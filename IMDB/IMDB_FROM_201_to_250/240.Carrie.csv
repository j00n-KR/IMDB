0,MartinHafer,"Not a particularly deep story, but executed very, very well",8,25 July 2009,"I cannot compare this movie to the Stephen King novel, since I haven't read it. So keep this in mind when you read my review.Carrie is a very socially awkward teenager who was made this way my an insanely religious and deeply disturbed mother. While students laughed at her, they didn't realize how hellish her existence was at home. Sadly, when Carrie does open up to those around her and finally tries to fit in, the kids at her school proved at the prom that they were truly evil and deserved to die...and then they did! The film is very well done and I think much of the credit is due to Sissy Spacek for her incredibly gutsy performance. Not only did she do some incredibly rough nude scenes, show a wide range of feeling but also put herself out incredibly far in order to get the best performance (read the trivia section carefully to see what I mean). The film succeeded more for her performance than the other supporting ones--as it's a lot easier to play a jerk than to play the full range of Carrie's emotions.As far as the direction by Brian De Palma goes, I must point out that I am NOT a fan of his style. De Palma NEVER leaves anything to the imagination and seems to usually believe that more is best (see SCARFACE). I would have preferred a few moments had been played more subtly and the film been less crude (for a 70s film, this movie had amazingly rough language). But, on the other hand, there was a lot of very creative camera-work and the ending (done in slow-motion much of the time) worked very well.Overall, it's an exceptional film but too bad there's so much nudity and foul language--as it was intended as a teen film. I do think that it's okay for most teens to see it, but parents should beware that the film does cross the line from time to time--making it a better choice for adults even though the message is one most kids should see.By the way, the statue in the closet is Saint Sebastian who was supposedly martyred with arrows. In a neat but not particularly subtle moment, this is recreated at the end of the film. Also, if you haven't noticed, Carrie and her mother are VERY similar to Waterboy and his mother...think about it.",Carrie
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A genuinely scary movie, but also one with heart",10,13 February 2011,"One of Brian DePalma's better movies, in fact scratch that it is probably the best film of DePalma's career, Carrie is a classic of its genre. I also think it is an example of the film being better than source material. The book, written by Stephen King, is good, the film is a classic.Carrie does have some genuine scary jolts and unsettling moments, such as the crucifixion which is thrilling and unforgettable and the ending which still shocks me. But it also has heart, as there are some poignant scenes, especially as Sissy Spacek's performance is so heart-breakingly good. Piper Laurie is also brilliant, and it was quite nice to see John Travolta too.DePalma's direction is taut, the script is tense and lyrical and the story despite being much copied never loses its impact or focus. Stylistically and visually, Carrie is a triumph too; I loved the cinematography and the scenery and the lighting just added to the atmosphere which was consistently amazing.So all in all, truly excellent movie. While it is scary and shocking, it also manages to have an edge of poignancy and humanity too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Carrie
2,Leofwine_draca,Superb direction in this Stephen King adaptation,10,23 December 2015,"Brian de Palma's breakthrough movie is still breathtaking after all these years, and the well-remembered ending still packs a punch even when you know what's coming. De Palma's typical trend for excessiveness works well in this movie which boasts one of the greatest, most explosive finales ever filmed; it is this finale which propels the movie into classic status. Sure, the rest of the film, the first hour, is good enough in its depiction of high school horrors, yet de Palma really lets loose at the end with some of the most audacious images ever put on screen.Every trick in the book is tried in this film; split-screen techniques, slow-motion, fast-motion, distorted camera angles, you name it, de Palma does it. Sometimes this makes the film look dated, but most of the time it works extremely well. Beginning with an unforgettably cruel taunt from a pack of girls in a changing room, Carrie introduces us to Sissy Spacek, who plays what may well be one of the saddest, most pathetic, and sympathetic victims in movie history, bullied at school by her classmates and at home by her bible-thumping mother. You're always 100% behind Carrie in these instances and the final comeuppance of the villains is so well deserved that I was positively cheering her on.The acting is of a high order, as to be expected. Sure, some of the villains may be exaggerated, but this makes their actions all the more terrible. Spacek is wonderful in the lead role, and even though she's not an obviously likable character you still end up caring deeply and feeling sorry for poor Carrie. Piper Laurie is truly obnoxious as her religious maniac mother and the cause of all the trouble. Whenever I see her in a film, I always remember this and end up despising her, so the performance is definitely a memorable one. Amy Irving (who went on to take a leading role in de Palma's next film, THE FURY) is fine as a schoolgirl with a heart, while William Katt (HOUSE) is chiefly of interest for his terribly dated hairstyle. The fresh faces of Nancy Allen and John Travolta help to create a pair of the nastiest teenage lovers you'll see.Anyhow, the first hour passes by with some shocking scenes of cruelty and plenty of suspense in the build-up to the finale. We get to see some minor examples of Carrie's handiwork - she makes an ashtray flip over, a bike skid - in order to prepare us for the big event. When it comes, and that bucket of pig's blood tips down, the impact is so powerful (de Palma uses slow-motion for a considerable period of a time here at the crucial moment, and it pays off) that I had tears in my eyes while watching. Then all hell breaks loose, with some well-choreographed carnage to enjoy, culminating in a fiery car crash which is one of the film's pyrotechnic highlights.Just when you think it's all over for our heroine, de Palma throws in THAT shock ending! CARRIE is a well made film and one of the very best Stephen King adaptations out there. A must see for horror fans as one of the best-directed of contemporary horrors.",Carrie
3,SnoopyStyle,Sissy Spacek perfect,8,2 November 2014,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an introverted isolated girl. She gets picked on by all the other girls. Her mother (Piper Laurie) is a crazy religious type who locks Carrie in the closet. Lead girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) tries to make amends by getting her hunky boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom. Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) refuses to take the punishment and is banned from the prom. Chris plans revenge on Carrie with the help of her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta). The plan triggers Carrie's supernatural powers.Director Brian De Palma makes this Stephen King story into a prom epic. The scene is iconic. However this movie is more than just one scene. This is about the great Sissy Spacek. She is absolutely perfect as the shy insecure Carrie. This is about her character. This is about the awkward years. This is a horror, a thriller and so much more.",Carrie
4,Hitchcoc,"It Has Its Moments, But...",7,22 October 2009,"I'm on the fence about this movie. I think the premise is excellent. Watching Sissy Spacek grow into her role is great. She is no one dimensional character. As she is persecuted by her classmates, we grow to like her, not because she is a victim, but we get to see that she is more than a caricature. She tries so hard to deal with all the pain that she has in her life When she is taken to the prom by Tommy, he has genuine motives toward her. Of course, it's a setup, but that's OK. He is still a trouper and doing everything he can to make this night a nice one. He's never in on the joke. I tend to go along with the general criticism That is, if one is going to have vengeance as a motive, we need to know precisely who is dispatched and why. The gym ends up looking like a bomb went off. The killing is random and non-directed. The good guys, the bad guys, the innocent bystanders. When one could at least get a sense of some revenge when the two nasties get theirs, it is diminished by the briefness and coldness of the act. I first saw this film 33 years ago and I have to say that it has one of the best scare scenes of all time. I was totally taken in by it. It's not a bad movie; however, with a little bit of characterization it could have been really good. I have a feeling they just wanted to get it down and go for the cheap thrills.",Carrie
5,mark.waltz,The most sympathetic monster since Frankenstein's monster.,8,5 May 2021,"With a few feature appearances and TV movies behind her, Sissy Spacek became a genuine superstar in this, perhaps the only actress outside of Fay Wray to do so in a horror movie. But no giant gorilla for Carrie White. She's not the one screaming here. She's the one causing the screaming. And those who are screaming because of her you may just applaud getting what they deserve.Steven King's novel of revenge for ill treatments in a high school has been remade and copied and even musicalized, but there's nothing like the original in this case. When you first see Carrie, she seems like a normal healthy American Girl, but the discovery of blood while in the shower after gym class revealed to the monsters are. They are the classmates who bully her, and even with the support of gym teacher Betty Buckley, Carrie isn't able to handle school or her home life.At home, she has her religious obsessed mother Piper Laurie whose psychological abuse has obviously sent Carrie over the edge. The product of a one-night stand, Carrie discovers that she has a gift, the gift of telekinesis which of course brings on glorious revenge.Prodded by girlfriend Amy Irving, class jock William Katt asks her to go to the prom with him, but other classmates have something sinister in store for her. They decide that they are going to publicly humiliate her and arrange for her to be named homecoming queen. But that comes with a price, and the real pigs must pay it.With Nancy Allen and John Travolta leading the way, their actions turn the prom into an absolute nightmare, and for many of these students and teachers and other surprise victims, it is a night of hell that the survivors won't forget. Just when it seems that it's over, there's more to come, and for the one surviving student, it's obvious that they'll take this nightmare to the with them.Stunning and horrific in every way (except as far as being a bad movie), this film under the direction of Brian De Palma stands the test of time and is now not just a cold classic but a horror classic and an all-time great film. Teenagers who bully should be forced to sit through this, then write an essay on why bullying is bad.Terrific performances, particularly by Spacek and Laurie (both nominated for Oscars) turn what would have been an ordinary '70s occult horror movie into something special. They would be reunited 20 years later playing sisters in an adoption of Capote's ""The Grass Harp"", but they end up being perhaps the most memorable mother and daughter on film in this one. Yes, there are moments that create ironic laughs, but for the most part, it is a sociological lesson on the evils of harassment and a power to conquer it that lurks in all of us.",Carrie
6,kosmasp,Film novel,8,13 June 2014,"I haven't read all of Stephen Kings books and Carrie is one of those I have missed. But this movie even without being able to compare it to the book, does a very fine job. It does give you a sense of isolation and it does give you a powerhouse performance by it's lead actress. A horror movie that is scary.Even though it's from the 70s and there has been a really solid remake, this is really worth watching. I myself always try to watch the original first, before going ahead to watch any remake, but I would understand if some don't have the time or patience to do that. There are differences though and you get an ending here, that you won't be able to forget soon ... unless someone told you about it ...",Carrie
7,classicsoncall,"""Hey, you're beautiful.""",7,6 August 2018,"In the annals of dirty deeds, what Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) did to Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) was one of the most vile, despicable acts anyone could possibly imagine. You have to wonder where that kind of hate and evil come from. That bucket of blood certainly wasn't commensurate to getting detention time for mocking Carrie in the girl's gym locker. Out of everything in the movie, that's the single thing that made the biggest impression on me, simply because it was such a monstrous act that it seemed impossible to come up with.Young Sissy Spacek did a commendable job as the severely chastised Carrie White. As her mother, Piper Laurie is virtually over the top in the way she demonstrates her religious fervor, to the point of creating a dysfunctional human being in the person of her daughter. The telekinesis angle used by Stephen King in his novel was an intriguing way through which Carrie exacted her revenge against a handful of scheming classmates. Margaret White (Laurie) called it Satan's Power, but we know it better as the power of Stephen King's written word.Of King's horror novel adaptations, this one stacks up as one of the better ones, owing to Brian De Palma's attentive direction and the effective screenplay by Lawrence Cohen. For it's hour and a half plus run time, it seemed much shorter to me, suggesting that the film had me pretty much focused on the story. The mid-Seventies time frame during which the picture takes place gives it a bit of a dated quality, what with the clothing and hair styles, but King's horror never seems to go out of fashion.",Carrie
8,gavin6942,The First (And Possibly Best) King Movie,8,27 October 2014,"A young, abused and timid 17-year-old girl (Sissy Spacek) discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the limit on the night of her school's prom by a humiliating prank.There seems to be little reason to review this film. Everyone knows it is a horror classic, and even has an entire book devoted to its analysis. Brian DePalma is one of the all-time great directors and he shows that here (using some of his trademark skills, like the split screen shots). Some may say he is nothing more than a cheap imitator of Hitchcock and others, but that is unfair. (Yes, there are a handful of ""Psycho"" references here, but that is to be expected given the material).Spacek is successfully awkward, William Katt's hair is amazing, and it is great to see P. J. Soles pre-Halloween. Amy Irving is great, and met her husband (Steven Spielberg) on the set, which is a story in itself. Nancy Allen always shines, and it is great to see her alongside John Travolta years before they reunited with DePalma's ""Blow Out"" (1981).",Carrie
9,lee_eisenberg,You're not gonna laugh at this...you're not gonna laugh at this (but it probably will scare you),10,10 October 2005,"""Carrie"" - probably more than any other movie - shows that even in the worst situations, we've all got the power in us; granted, most people probably don't have telepathy.Anyway, this first adaptation from a Stephen King novel was done perfectly, with Sissy Spacek as the mousy but deadly Carrie White. Everyone in the movie does a top-notch performance: Piper Laurie as Carrie's disturbed, fundamentalist Christian mother Margaret; Betty Buckley as gym teacher Ms. Collins, who befriends Carrie; William Katt as the clement Tommy Ross, taking Carrie to the prom; Nancy Allen as the despicable Chris Hargenson, wanting nothing except to brutalize Carrie; Amy Irving as the circumspect Sue Snell; and even a young John Travolta as Chris' crony Billy Nolan.The most famous scene is of course the prom scene, where Chris and Billy go a little too far in their vile plans, leading Carrie to do something that no one will ever forget. And believe you me, you won't forget it either. You shouldn't forget it, because ""Carrie"" is one movie that everyone should see. 10/10.",Carrie
10,jboothmillard,Carrie,10,31 December 2005,"Director Brian De Palma (The Untouchables, Scarface) adapts the first Stephen King book to the screen very well indeed. It is a very convincing creepy story of a very troubled girl. Basically this is the story of Carrie White (Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek), the non-threatening (until threatened) girl that is horribly treated by other people. Carrie doesn't know it until she researches, but when she gets angry she can create incidents, i.e. telekinesis. Her psychotic religious mother Margaret (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Piper Laurie) punishes her for some of the smallest things, that could be part of why she has developed this power too. Anyway, she goes to the prom, and she doesn't know it, but the girl who hates her most has planted a bucket of pig's blood above the stage, and she gets it poured over her head, during her winning moments as the prom's Queen, that is when Carrie goes insane. She makes doors close, people get electrocuted, ceilings collapse and kill people, and a car crash and blow up. When she gets home, her mother does too go insane, and ends up with her daughter having to kill her, and the house finally coming down on them. But it doesn't end there, there is a final moment where Carrie's mourner places flowers, and Carrie's bloody arm lunges out of the rubble, a nightmare, that probably haunts her for ages. Also starring Amy Irving as Sue Snell, William Katt as Tommy Ross, Betty Buckley as Miss Collins, young John Travolta as Billy Nolan, Halloween's P.J. Soles as Norma Watson and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Sydney Lassick as Charlie Cheswick (same surname as Cuckoo's Nest). A very disturbing but brilliantly creepy film. It was number 46 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!",Carrie
11,rmax304823,Psychokinesis in extremis.,6,31 October 2009,"Now, it's been said that many of Brian De Palma's movies are sloppy and half-witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's. It's a bloody lie. De Palma's movies are very precise and fully witted imitations of Alfred Hitchcock's.Whatever Hitchcock did, Brian De Palma does more of it and does it more expansively.Carrie (Spacek) is a high school senior who is an ugly duckling, kept ignorant by her mother (Laurie) who is a religious fanatic, and ridiculed by her classmates, especially the vicious and vengeful Chris Hargenson (Allen), a juicy and sluttish blond. Kids can be so cruel, you know? Spacek is too freaky to have friends in school but Amy Irving comes closest, and the gym teacher, Miss Collins (Buckley) isn't far behind. Amy Irving goes so far as to persuade her hunky jock/poet inamorato William Katt to take Spacek the Doomed to the all-important senior prom. It's meant as a kindly gesture.There, a terrible trick has been planned for Spacek by Allen and her boyfriend (Travolta). They've take a bucket full of pig's blood, perched it on a beam above the stage mark for the prom queen, arrange it so that Spacek wins, then dump the blood all over her in front of a gym full of classmates and teachers. Katt is knocked out by the falling pail. Everyone begins laughing at Carrie, who is standing wide-eyed with humiliation and fear on the stage, splattered all over with blood.That laughter is a big mistake. Spacek has hidden psychic powers. She distracts everyone from her discredited state by having fire hoses squirt water all over everybody, then electrocuting them and having falling structural beams crush them like cockroaches, and then burning the whole joint down.It's a very carefully done movie, paying at least as much attention to detail as Hitchcock would have, and usually more. Pino Donaggio has contributed a fulsomely orchestrated operatic score. He lifts the screaming violins bodily from ""Psycho."" The cinematography is by Mario Tosi and is equally well done. The performances are fully blown, as is appropriate to an Italian opera. Eyeballs bulge, voices shriek, knives fly through the air, gestures are florid enough to be seen from the balcony.Well, actually, it's not entirely true that this is a precise imitation of Hitchcock. Hitchcock would never have used so many looming close ups. And, like Beethoven, Hitchcock might have adumbrated a big theme into which he was about to launch with a couple of teasers, but he would never have drawn out the tension before a climactic act the way De Palma does.The bucket-of-pig-blood gag seems to go on forever -- and mostly in slow motion, which Hitchcock never used. Have you ever seen a movie in which people clap their hands in slow motion? It's a little like watching a machine gun being fired in slow motion, the twirling cartridges being ejected, the bolt languidly sliding back and forth. It's all very informative but dramatically the impact is more silly than tense.It's different from Hitchcock in other ways too. Hitchcock always made movies about the world he was familiar with. His early movies were about the British working class from which he was sprung. Later we got to see much more of fancy restaurants and Cary Grant in tailored suits. When Hitchcock moved too far from those chummy settings, he tended to stumble, as in ""Under Capricorn"" (Australia in an early period). In the end, his social world had narrowed to such an extent that he lost touch with taxi cabs. In his last movie, Bruce Dern is a taxi driver who wears a military-style yellow-cab cap with a bill.I don't mean to go on about Hitchcock this much but any reasonable assessment of ""Carrie"" compels me. Hitchcock wouldn't have DREAMED of making a movie about teen-age jealousies and the senior prom. He wouldn't have had sex and nudity in anything he did. He might have allowed the kind of discontinuity in character so blatantly on display here, though.Take Miss Collins, the gym teacher. She's been protective -- even nurturing -- towards the marginalized Carrie. She's punished those who've played tricks on Carrie. She's encouraged her to accept the invitation to the prom, prompted her on her wardrobe and grooming. Miss Collins' eyes glisten with tears when Carrie steps onto the stage to accept the award as prom queen. But a few minutes later, when Carrie is bug-eyed with humiliation, Miss Collins bursts out laughing along with the rest. Why? I guess so she can be selected for the special kind of destruction she gets. It violates the logic of the plot but it makes for startling imagery. And, really, who can believe that Amy Irving would be willing to talk her handsome boy friend into taking another girl to the prom, while Irving stayed home with Mom and Dad? I'd better quit this before I run out of space. I'll have to start editing this nonsense and slashing away at it, ""killing all my darlings,"" as Proust would have put it. I wish Brian De Palma could be as ruthless with his work.",Carrie
12,Tweekums,High school horror,8,15 July 2018,"Carrie White, daughter of a religious fanatic mother, is a shy and awkward teenager. When her first period takes place as she showers after gym class she is terrified as her mother had never taught her about such things; the other girls in her class torment her. As her teacher tries to comfort her a lightbulb bursts... Carrie's latent power of telekinesis has been awakened. The girls in her class are punished for their actions; after which one of then determines, with the help of her boyfriend, to humiliate Carrie further to get revenge. Another suggests to her boyfriend that he should invite Carrie to the prom to make up for what they did. Back at home Carrie's mother is unsympathetic and tells her that her period is a sign that she was having sinful thoughts. As she grows to understand her new powers she gains the confidence to stand up to her mother and accepts the invitation to the prom... needless to say the night does not end well.This is rather unusual amongst horror films in that the person who has supernatural powers and ultimately uses them to kill people isn't the villain of the story but its victim. The villains are Carrie's classmates and her mother; the first group are just very unpleasant, for the most part, but her mother is truly disturbing with her absolute faith. The film doesn't rush to get to the horror; instead it gradually raises the tension; clearly signposting the fact that something will happen at the prom. Not all of the characters are black and white; until it becomes obvious I wasn't sure if the boy who invited Carrie to the prom was being genuinely nice or part of the scheme to humiliate her. When the violence starts it is perhaps a little too comic but that could be due to effects that while not bad don't feel quite real. The cast does a solid job; especially Sissy Spacek in the title role and Piper Laurie as her mother. Overall I'd say that this is a classic of the genre so a must see for horror fans.",Carrie
13,BA_Harrison,An unmissable 70s horror classic.,10,16 April 2009,"Over the past few decades, almost everything ever written by Stephen King has been filmed for either TV or the silver screen; however, very few of these adaptations have come close to matching the extremely high standard set by Carrie, the first King novel to receive the movie treatment.Directed by Brian De Palma, this superb supernatural horror stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White, a shy and awkward teenage girl who is mercilessly bullied at high-school and further tormented at home by her overbearing, religious zealot mother (Piper Laurie). To make matters worse, at the same time as Carrie experiences her first period (during the film's unforgettable opening shower sequence), she also discovers that she has developed telekinetic abilities that get more powerful but less controllable as she becomes increasingly distressed.When a group of spiteful classmates (led by the gorgeous Nancy Allen and a young John Travolta) implement a nasty plan to humiliate Carrie during prom night, the poor girl finally snaps and unleashes her full psychic wrath on the unsuspecting revellers.Determined to impress with his first major Hollywood movie, director De Palma pulls out all the stops to bring Lawrence D. Cohen's excellent screenplay to life, displaying a confident and flamboyant style full of the fluid, gliding camera movements and impressive visual trickery that would eventually become synonymous with his work; these stunning visuals, combined with a lush orchestral score by Pino Donaggio and faultless performances from an amazing cast go to make Carrie an unmissable experience.Spacek's central performance is astonishing: her touching portrayal of the vulnerable and withdrawn Carrie—always wary, yet aching for acceptance—is heartbreaking and anyone who has suffered the indignity of bullying will no doubt find the fiery prom night massacre a strangely cathartic experience. Also worthy of praise are Piper Laurie as Margaret White, who mistakenly believes that she is protecting her daughter, but is actually doing much more harm than good (although her motherly advice about skipping the prom was, for once, right on the money), William Katt as Carrie's well-meaning prom date Tommy Ross, and Amy Irving as repentant bully Sue Snell, who is unable to thwart her school-pals' cruel trick.Stylish, beautiful, tragic, shocking, and even occasionally humorous, Carrie is an absolute classic that deserves a place in every horror fan's DVD collection. 10/10.",Carrie
14,moonspinner55,"Though cluttered up with crass humor, De Palma's trashy flair and killer instincts make this a classic screamer...",7,28 April 2006,"When picked-on high schooler Carrie White discovers to her horror that she's been made the butt of a nasty prank, she unleashes her secret powers at the school prom and all hell literally comes loose. This sequence, filmed in split-screen, is a canny marvel of technical wizardry, twisted imagination and production design (check out that gorgeous blaze that erupts behind Sissy Spacek). The cinematographer lights everything up like fluorescent goodies in a candy-box (the continuity problems with Carrie's appearance here can be overlooked). But Carrie's anger is all encompassing--it's a high school holocaust--and some of her victims are innocents, like the gym teacher (played very sensitively by Betty Buckley). Carrie has become as bad as her enemies, and director Brian De Palma doesn't seem to understand the irony (he's also too interested in girl-peeping, although to his credit nobody comes off looking foolish). The picture is fun on the surface, but has a depressing undermining that is never quite resolved. Spacek's performance in the lead is flawless; Piper Laurie exceptional as her deranged mother (it was her comeback role, Oscar-nominated, yet it nearly typed her as a horror-movie actress); Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, and William Katt are excellent as Carrie's classmates; Amy Irving is intriguing as schoolmate Sue who just wants to do the right thing (Pauline Kael of The New Yorker complained that Sue's role in the disaster wasn't made clear, but I disagree. I think she's conflicted and guilty and wants to help, wants to see Carrie bask in some of the glory which she helped create). Although an improvement over the Stephen King source novel, ""Carrie"" isn't perfect and is weighed down somewhat with dirty jokes and cheap laughs. Certainly it is a stylish picture, with beautiful (if repetitive) music by Pino Donaggio, and the final sequence is still being copied today. *** from ****",Carrie
15,Quinoa1984,"one of the more entertaining, chilling, and tragic stories ever about High school",9,30 July 2006,"Carrie is from a novel by Stephen King, and directed by Brian De Palma, and it can more than likely be found in any horror section of the video store. But to me the film may lend itself more to being a kind of weird, darkly satiric take on High school life that only really gets into the outright horror in the last twenty minutes. For the most part Carrie could just as well be a fable about the ugly duckling or some other kind of outcast. Nothing in the film or story is necessarily subtle, but it's hard for me to carp- all of the one to two dimensional characters are brilliantly played, and through such fantastical material there is a truth reached that might not be struck with a different cast or director. It's a unique blend of theatricality, style, and some very realistic, harsh notes about societal repression. That it's fun, and funny, at different times also puts it a notch above other genre material (certainly above other King adaptations about the mawkish loner with special powers).Sissy Spacek is in a career-making performance as Carrie, the awkward girl that everybody in school (at least all of the juvenile teen girls in gym class) teases to no end, who's own paralyzed way of being among people works against her. The first big chunk of the film is really dramatically satisfying and heart-wrenching with, aside from the obvious 'trait' Carrie possesses, could happen to any loner teen. After an accident in the girl's shower, to which taunting reaches a high peak, all of the girls (including the likes of PJ Soles, Amy Irving, and the very sexy b*tch Chris played by Nancy Allen) get detention under the only one who really cares for Carrie (Betty Buckley), and so the girls plot revenge involving the senior prom and a bucket of pig's blood. Meanwhile, Carrie still gets her ultimate repression by her bible-thumping, very nuts mother (Piper Laurie in the most successfully over-the-top performance of the film). As the prom nears, a near iconic line 'they're all gonna laugh at you' pops up, and becomes the crux of the last grueling act of the film.De Palma has only a handful of films that come close to this one for his sheer love for over-stylized, prolonged scenes that almost start to comment on themselves. And there's a really wonderful element to some of it, it's almost akin to Sergio Leone's the Good the Bad and the Ugly in just trying to see how far he can take his style before it might implode or get to just the right height of suspense. Obvious enough are the Hitchcock lifts in parts of the style, most notably in the climax with the split-screens and very similar music cues (all he's missing is Bernard Hermann). But his style works to making scenes already with a satirical tinge funnier as opposed for just shocking edginess. My favorite was the scene showing the gym teacher working the girls hard out on the field, this reaching almost a cartoonish side to it. And, of course, what would a 70s horror movie be without an amazingly explicit, slow-motion jump-cuts in the girl's locker room? This style works best with King's material, adding an extra emphasis on the emotional manipulations and cruelty, and rigid, constricting structure, that school imposes.Sometimes, too, part of the enjoyment in seeing a film like this is not just the take on a telekinetic getting her vengeance on her teasers and pranksters, but how it all fits well into a psychology and general outlook on High school. Certain scenes with the supporting characters are good at this, like with a very amusing John Travolta and Allen in the car. This is the kind of take on high school life that likely inspired other films like Heathers and Donnie Darko, but Carrie has a kind of timeless quality to it too. On the other hand, if you are looking through the store and want Carrie to be a genuine horror film- once it truly transitions into that section, it's (appropriately) gory, lavish, and unexpected; I had already seen this climactic scene somewhere before seeing the whole film, but it still kept me on my toes, particularly the final confrontation between mother and daughter. One of the best King adaptations and a very good turn from director and cast.",Carrie
16,BandSAboutMovies,Not just a perfect horror movie. A perfect movie.,10,24 May 2018,"This is King's first novel to be published and first one to be adapted to the silver screen. And if you ask me, it's probably my favorite. Credit where it's due - Brian De Palma presented a master class in how to build intensity and intensity in this film. It's so perfect that it brings me to tears.The difference between this film and any other teenager being abused who learns they have powers and gets revenge film is that we actually care about the teenagers. They're real. Other than one of them being able to move things with her mind, their issues feel genuine. Some characters have shades of gray. And no one emerges unscathed in the end.The film starts with shy Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) having her first period in the shower, surrounded by other girls. This typical nightmare scenario, one we expect to wake up from, like dreaming we're stuck in school naked, is happening to her as the other girls pelt her with sanitary napkins. Christine Hargensen (Nancy Allen, Dressed to Kill) leads the others as they yell ""Plug it up!"" Carrie's terror goes off as light bulbs explode and her teacher, Miss Collins (Betty Buckley, who is so perfect in this), has to console her.At home, Carrie is abused further by her mother (Piper Laurie, Twin Peaks) who screams at her for her sinful thoughts. Dragged into a prayer closet, she must beg God to forgive her.One of Carrie's classmates, Sue Snell (Amy Irving, the only actress to show up in the sequel - more about that travesty tomorrow) feels guilty, so she asks her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt, House) to take Carrie to the prom. Miss Collins makes the girls pay for the way they treat by sending them to detention, where Chris' behavior leads the teacher to slap her and suspend her from the prom.That's when Chris comes up with a horrible plot: they will name Carrie as prom queen and dump blood upon her, a scheme that she gets her boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to make happen.Carrie's mom learns that she is going to the prom and accuses her of witchcraft. She uses her powers to throw her mother down. While at the prom, Carrie finds a happiness that she has never known until now. She feels accepted. She feels love. And she has her first kiss with Tommy.What follows is what makes this movie a classic.
Chris' friend Norma (Totally P.J. Soles!) rigs the election and Tommy and Carrie walk to the stage to be crowned. At the last second, Sue tries to stop things and fails. And that's when De Palma uses nearly every trick in his book to amp this scene up. Split screen, multiple angles, time distortions...it's pure cinema.This scene took two weeks and 35 takes to shoot, including an intense dizzying scene that was created by placing Spacek and Katt on a platform that spun in the opposite direction of a camera that was dollied away from the actors.After all that build and suspense, the bucket of pig's blood covers Carrie and knocks out Billy. Our heroine has a hallucination that her mother's warning of everyone laughing at her has come true and she unleashes the full fury of her powers. Right and wrong, good and evil, everyone pays.You'd never guess that Sissy Spacek was her high school's homecoming queen.Carrie walks away as Chris and Billy try to kill her with his car, but she easily makes it flip over and explode. Soon, she is back home, crying in her mother's arms. Margaret confesses that Carrie is a child of rape, then stabs her in the back. She fights back by crucifying her mother and burying herself within the house.As Sue comes to the grave, months after this all happens, she is startled by a bloody hand that emerges from the tomb to attack her. Yet it's all a dream in a shock ending that has been - and will be - copied over and over.This is a movie that has lost none of its power. If it's not in your collection, you don't have one to speak of.",Carrie
17,Coventry,Our little girl is becoming a woman...and ONE of a kind !,8,17 October 2003,"Spoilers AHOY !!!Carrie - the movie - belongs to the finest adaptations of a Stephen King novel. I never read the book ( I don't read at all, actually ) but I can't imagine King would have wanted his story to be shown otherwise. Brian DePalma creates a terrific atmosphere here and the tension is always present. This movie is unique in many points of view. It's a perfect combination of horror and drama elements and that's not an easy thing to do. If you add a very frightening musical score to that and acting performances that are pretty close to perfection, you get the kind of film that we like to call MASTERPIECES !!!The plot is pretty much the most original thing that ever came out of the pen of Stephen King. The life of a girl in her late teens, Carrie. She doesn't have any friends, she kept very close by her religious mother and most of all, she doesn't know anything about nature and growing up. When she gets her period for the first time, she's being laughed at in a very traumatic way. With the help of an understanding teacher and a few students with a good heart, Carrie is accepted at last and even invited for the senior prom ...But, just when she thinks her luck is turning, she faces the ultimate nighmare...Carrie is a whole of fascinating, memorable and even touching scenes. The whole opening scene takes your breath away and then I don't even mention the entire prom scene. Horror and suspense cinema as pure as it gets. The movie is totally carried - sorry for the inappropriate use of words - by the acting performances of Sissy Spacek ( Carrie ) and Piper Laurie ( Mrs. White - Carrie's mother ). They both were nominated for an Oscar. I don't know who won that year ( probably someone from the cast of Network ) but they didn't deserve it !! The Academy Award belonged to these ladies here, no doubt about that. Smaller roles by John Travolta and Nance Allen are great as well. Even William Katt did a great job here but his character looks too much like a sheep. Nice haircut dude, keep up the 70's spirit. Brian DePalma did some of his best work in the 70's and Carrie belongs to his highlights. He often gets accused of being a Hitchock imitator, but in this film he certainly proves that he can create a unique atmosphere all by himself.
It has to be said...Carrie has one negative aspect in my opinion. Although this is nobody's fault, I would have wished the movie to be a bit longer ( that's a comment I don't give very often ). Personally I would have loved to see a bit more background on Carrie's family situation and a better explanation of the telekinetic forces she has. Her whole mysterious powers come all of a sudden and maybe that is a bit of a shame. The supernatural elements in Carrie aren't stressed enough but that's just my opinion, of course.",Carrie
18,michaelRokeefe,"Pure horror, thanks to Stephen King and Brian De Palma.",9,14 April 2014,"Solid, heavy handed horror directed by Brian De Palma and based on Stephen King's descriptive novel. Carrie White(Sissy Spacek)is a shy high school teen easily made fun of my her classmates. Carrie's life is about to become her own private hell, when she experiences her first period. Due to her innocence and ignorance of such matters concerning her maturing body; Carrie is an overwhelmed victim of the wrath of her religiously fanatic mother, Margaret(Piper Laurie). The young girl's reaction only causes more teasing and taunting from her classmates. Her gym teacher(Betty Buckley)tries consoling the frantic teen, but with her own private motives in mind. One of Carrie's classmates wants to show some compassion by having her own boyfriend Tommy Ross(William Katt)to invite her to the upcoming prom. A mean spirited Chris Hargensen(Nancy Allen)plans to carry out a prank intending to embarrass Carrie in front of everyone at the prom. Absolutely no one knows that mild mannered Miss White has minor telekinetic powers that she will unleash with fury in retaliation. Anyone in blood slinging distance will learn what real fear is.This is a true horror film that famously turned into a cult classic. It is so good that you can't help but want to see it again, and maybe again. For very obvious reasons this flick is rated R. An outstanding supporting cast includes: John Travolta, Amy Irving, Doug Cox and Priscilla Pointer.",Carrie
19,hitchcockthelegend,"Show her that if she had remained sinless, this curse of blood would never have come on her!",9,23 October 2010,"Carrie is directed by Brian De Palma and adapted by Lawrence D. Cohen from the debut novel of the name written by Stephen King. It stars Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen & John Travolta. Pino Donaggio scores the music and Mario Tosi is the cinematographer.Carrie White (Spacek) is the outsider at school, dominated at home by her fanatically religious mother (Laurie), Carrie is unmercifully teased by her class mates when she reacts with terror to her first menstrual period. When Miss Collins (Buckley) the teacher decides to punish the girls for their actions, it sets the wheels in motion for Carrie to unearth telekinetic powers that could spell devastation for anyone close to her.As pretty much everyone on the DVD documentaries says, nobody involved with making Carrie had any idea it would become the much loved classic that it is. Made for $1.8 million, it made almost $34 million domestically alone. Garnering award nominations, something of a rarity for horror movies, it also stands proud as one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. Be it the wave after wave of High School based horrors that would follow, or the now standard use of the unexpected jolt, Carrie has earned its place on any best of horror list. Not bad considering both De Palma and King don't feel it's necessarily a horror film! But that's for discussion elsewhere me thinks.De Palma astutely grabs us from the off, after we are quickly introduced to Carrie White on the volleyball court, where she subsequently loses the game for her side, we shift to the locker room and Carrie takes a shower. Cut to slow motion as the girls lark and pamper themselves in various forms of undress. Shot in steam based soft focus by Tosi as Donaggio's score swirls with playful emotion. Then BAM! Having lulled us in to a false sense of security De Palma brings the blood, menstrual blood. It's an attention grabber alright and it's a testament to how great Carrie is that the attention is held right to that jolting finale. Blood, as those who have seen it know, is pivotal to Carrie's structure, from the shower room to prom night, and on to a bit of a family tete a tete. Not a horror film my eye Brian & Stephen.For those who wish to delve into sub-texts, meanings and motives etc, Carrie's a good film for those of that mind. But again, that's for discussion elsewhere. I just love to view Carrie as a sharp story told exceptionally well, a movie that manages to pull my emotions in a number of directions. Anger, love, sympathy, revulsion and even a wave of guilty triumphalism, it's all there as De Palma crafts what is arguably his masterpiece. Spacek represents one of the best casting decisions of the 70s, the ugly beauty thing is down pat and the vulnerability extraordinary. Laurie brings the real monster of the piece, religion gone berserker; so brilliantly essayed. The young cast shine bright, notably Nancy Allen, while Donaggio's score is to die for: resplendent with Herrmannesque string stabs.Carrie may look dated now, but its ability to shock and trouble the cranium still exists on revisits. A masterful piece of film making, where even the use of split screens avoids charges of gimmickry. If only more King adaptations to the screen could be like this. 9/10",Carrie
20,Theo Robertson,"Depressing Shocker , Maybe Too Depressing",8,8 March 2008,"CARRIE is based on the eponymous book by Stephen King and is brought to the big screen from Brian De Palma . It is arguably the highlight of both mens' careers which is a shame because it was King's debut novel and an early contribution to cinema from De Palma . Many people have gone in to the plot in great detail so I won't bother , but does anyone agree that the supernatural elements of the plot are the weakest parts ? Put it like this Carrie White is becoming a woman , is bullied and humiliated by her class mates and lives at home with an unbalanced religious theocratic mother . If you've not got a hell of a lot of sympathy for her you're probably a corpse . If you've ever vaguely had the problems Carrie is suffering from then you will find this movie very depressingThat's not to say CARRIE is a bad film , it's not but it's a very uncomfortable watch and much of this is to do with the cast . Spacek , Laurie , Allen , Katt and Travolta all play their parts with absolute conviction , a fact that is reflected in two of the cast being Oscar nominated and how often do people receive Oscar nominations for being in a horror movie ? Still it's best to bare in mind that this is a horror film because if it was a straight laced drama involving teenage angst on the battlefield of adolescence I would have probably have switched it off before the end credits due to the distressing narrative . But CARRIE is a horror film and a bloody good one which gets eight out of ten from me",Carrie
21,Hey_Sweden,Features the prom to beat all proms.,8,10 August 2012,"This striking, memorable adaptation of the Stephen King novel announced the arrival of the author in a major way, and also made stars of director Brian De Palma and his cast. It still stands tall as one of cinema's ultimate ""loser strikes back"" fables and while it may be fiction its themes are still quite relevant. Sissy Spacek excels as the title character, an awkward teenager treated terribly by her fellow students and having to deal with the overbearing presence of her sanctimonious mother (Piper Laurie), a deeply religious individual. Things seem to be improving for Carrie when a popular jock (William Katt) asks her to the prom, only we know the poor girl's nemesis (Nancy Allen) is orchestrating much of the events for the sake of revenge. What very few people know - and unfortunately have to find out - is that Carrie possesses telekinetic abilities, which she unleashes in fury after being mocked and humiliated for the last time. Carrie is one of those characters one can't help but feel sorry for, and any person who's ever been in a similar situation in high school will know her pain. Spacek and Laurie are both incredible in their Oscar nominated performances; the former completely wins you over with her combination of shyness, naivety, and vulnerability. The latter, making a flamboyant return to acting after 15 years away from the business, is purely theatrical, and gets perhaps the most significant refrain in the entire film in the form of ""They're all gonna laugh at you!"" Also among the supporting cast are John Travolta, displaying that easy going charisma, Amy Irving (acting opposite her real life mom, Priscilla Pointer), P.J. Soles, Betty Buckley, Sydney Lassick, Stefan Gierasch, Michael Talbott, and Edie McClurg. They're all fun to watch, and De Palma directs with a typical flourish, employing split screen during one critical scene of chaos at the prom. The budget of the film only allowed for a minimum of destruction, yet what makes it onto screen still packs a pretty effective punch; the violence is strong without ever getting too blatantly gory. Some comedy relief is added rather incongruously - the music for the gym detention scenes, the sped up dialogue for the tuxedo shopping sequence - but it doesn't hurt the film at all, and our emotions are manipulated with ease and skill, especially when the haunting music score by the consistently reliable Pino Donaggio is taken into account. The imagery is stunning throughout, including one hell of a creepy little statue, and that now iconic image of Spacek doused in blood. To this date this remains one of the best ever adaptations of a Stephen King work, in this viewer's humble opinion. Followed by a 23 years belated sequel, a made for TV remake, and a pending theatrical remake. Eight out of 10.",Carrie
22,Doylenf,Chilling horror story of an unusual night at the prom...,7,20 November 2006,"CARRIE probably represents the sort of outsider feelings author Stephen King had as a nerdy teen-ager in high school. He was able to reach into those cruel childhood memories to create a girl with telekinetic powers that gives her the ability to wreak revenge on her tormentors in a big, over-the-top sort of way.And he found the perfect director for such a project in Brian De Palma. His vision of Carrie's everyday torments makes for a very gripping film and one that deservedly won Oscar nominations for both SISSY SPACEK and PIPER LAURIE. Standouts in the cast include AMY IRVING, JOHN TRAVOLTA and NANCY ALLEN (who became De Palma's wife).The disturbing scenes between Carrie and her mother have tremendous power but the highlight of the film, of course, is the famous prom scene where all hell breaks loose when the pranks get out of hand. It's a testament to the skillful playing of Spacek and Laurie that they got Oscar nominations in what is essentially a quality horror film.Summing up: If you like Stephen King stories, CARRIE ranks with the best.",Carrie
23,preppy-3,One of DePalma's best,10,26 September 2001,"High school misfit Carrie (Sissy Spacek) unleashes her telekinetic fury  on her tormentors. This was a huge hit in 1976 and scared me silly. It  doesn't scare me now (except for the closing sequence), but I still  think it's a good solid horror film beautifully handled by Brian De  Palma. It moves quickly, has some beautiful imagery (everything is shot  soft focus with muted color) and has almost uniformally good  performances. The only bad one is by John Travolta way out of his depth  playing a hood.  Amy Irving (as a student who befriends Carrie), William Katt (with a  very 70s afro), Nancy Allen (playing a real bitch), Betty Buckley (so  young and full of energy) and P.J. Soles (silly but bearable) are all  perfect. But Spacek is superb matched by Piper Laurie who is very scary  and marvelous as her deranged, religious mother.   Also the film is (by today's standards) very restrained in terms of  blood and gore. And the final sequence will make you jump (also notice  the cars in the background during that--they're moving backwards!)  Only complaints--De Palma REALLY hates some of the high school  kids--you feel like like he's working out some personal issues here.  And did we really need the slow-mo shower sequence at the beginning?  That aside--this is a great film. See it letter boxed.",Carrie

25,poolandrews,One of the best Stephen King adaptations around.,8,25 December 2005,"Carrie starts in a girls locker room (which, in my opinion as a bloke, is a good place to start) where the girls are getting changed & Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is having a shower. As she soaps herself down she begins to bleed, she is having her first menstrual period but thinks she is bleeding to death as she knows nothing about what is happening to her because her strict fanatical religious mother Margaret (Piper Laurie) hasn't told her about the facts of life. The rest of the girls taunt & tease her, throwing tampons at her & laughing, the gym teacher Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) comes to Carrie's rescue. The Bates High School prom is fast approaching & the nasty mean Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) is barred from going, she blames Carrie & together with her boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta) plans to gain a cruel revenge. Meanwhile Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels sorry for Carrie & tells her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to ask Carrie to the prom, he agrees & Carrie accepts despite strong protests from her loony mum. At the prom things go well to start with but Carrie is humiliated in front of the entire school by Chris, in a rage of anger Carrie uses her powers of telekinesis, the ability to move or change objects through the power of the mind, to gain some sweet revenge of her own...Directed by Brian De Palma Carrie is a good horror film. The script by Lawrence D. Cohen is based on the 1974 novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I cannot compare them, in fact Carrie was King's very first novel & in turn became the first to be adapted into a film. Carrie is all about character's, feelings & it tries to say something meaningful, it's not an easy film to pigeonhole as it could be described as a horror, thriller, drama or fantasy with strong elements from all. Every emotion in the book is here, sadness, sorrow, pity, anger, hate, happiness, jealousy, fear & it even touches upon the taboo subject of child abuse. The film does a brilliant job at portraying these emotions so that you really care & feel for these people which makes what happens so much more meaningful. There is an 'Ugly Ducking' vibe to it as Carrie starts off shy, unhappy & suffers plenty of growing pains before she transforms into something different at the prom. Carrie is pretty slow going for the majority of it's 100 odd minute duration but this is essential as things build up superbly towards the climax where the horror really kicks in. I don't usually like slow character driven films but Carrie worked for me & I enjoyed it but don't expect a happy ending as Carrie is most definitely not a feel good film.Director De Palma does a first class job here, the character's are brilliantly drawn & developed. He gives the film some style with a few really cool memorable shots like the dizzying spinning camera scene when it revolves around Carrie & Tommy for what seems like ages, the split screen effect at the climax where we see Carrie's anger as she dishes out some revenge &, of course, that opening shower scene... Forget about any violence or gore as that's not what Carrie is all about, just a few stabbings.With a supposed budget of about $1,800,000 Carrie is well made throughout, good special effects, some nice stunts, good music & solid production values throughout. The acting is simply superb from everyone involved, Spacek is absolutely brilliant here & was rightly nominated for a best actress Oscar in '77 & Laurie was nominated for best supporting actress although neither won (I have no idea who did that year but they must have been good). A young John Travolta does well.Carrie is a classic piece of horror that has impact & is quite a powerful watch, it's well made & stands up well even today although the slightly slow pace & lack of gory action may put some off. I'm sure you can get this cheap on DVD these days & it probably turns up on TV all the time too so there's no excuse not have seen, or see sometime in the near future, Carrie. Definitely worth watching.",Carrie
26,CinemaSerf,A cracking horror-thriller,7,19 October 2020,"Sissy Spacek is really good in this as the socially inept, psychologically tortured, girl living in the shadow of her overbearingly Christian mother, with few friends and some remarkable telekinetic powers. What ensues is a complex, at times convoluted, angst-ridden horror film that sees the best and worst of human nature - of all ages - depicted, as thoughtless pranks and humiliation become the order of the day with some chilling consequences. Piper Laurie is superb as the zealot mother, as is John Travolta as the odious ""Billy"" and the combination of Brian de Palma and Stephen King make for a compelling, multi-layered critique on many different aspects of intimidation, bullying as well as adding some genuinely scary moments too!",Carrie
27,utgard14,"""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.""",8,8 February 2014,"Brian De Palma's adaptation of Stephen King's first novel is one of the director's best films, if not THE best. The story, which everyone reading this probably already knows, is about a teenage girl named Carrie White who is tormented at school by bullies and at home by her religious nut mother. Carrie has telekinetic powers which are unleashed after a horrible prom night prank. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly received Oscar nominations. Neither won but that was the year of Network so that's not surprising. They both give memorable performances that are highlights of their respective careers. Nancy Allen and John Travolta are both excellent villains. Pino Donaggio's score deserves praise. Enough good things can't be said about De Palma's stylish direction. De Palma digs into his bag of tricks -- long tracking shots, split-screen, slow motion, etc. Most of the techniques that are associated with the director from his more popular films. I'm not a big fan of the man but as a director he entertains me, more often than not. Definitely a great film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. But please watch it before you watch any of the remakes, sequels, or variations that have been made over the years. There's nothing worse than when a great film is diminished to a newer audience because they saw the pale imitators that came after before they saw the original.",Carrie
28,lastliberal,I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.,7,1 March 2008,"I am sure that I've seen this film before, but I watched it again to see how Stephen King managed to write a story that captured teen-aged angst amidst bullying and popularity contests.Sis Spacek was simply incredible and it is no surprised that she got the first Academy Award nomination for a horror film. Piper Laurie was also superb as her mother and got a well-deserved nomination herself.The effects and cinematography were superb, as was Brian De Palma's direction.I also liked seeing some people in their first or early roles like Amy Irving (Yentl) in her first role on the big screen; RoboCop's Nancy Allen; John Travolta in his second screen appearance; and P. J. Soles (The Devil's Rejects) in one of her first roles.A great horror movie about teen life.",Carrie
29,zardoz-13,"Disturbing, Demented, But Spectacular!!!",10,3 November 2013,"""Scarface"" director Brian De Palma had made about ten feature-length films and several shorts when he made his first classic horror chiller ""Carrie"" with Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, William Katt, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles. If you look closely, you'll spot ""Miami Vice"" regular Michael Talbot, who played Detective Stan Switek, cast as Travolta's accomplice. This was author Stephen King's first novel that Hollywood adapted, and he approved of De Palma and ""Ghost Story"" scenarist Lawrence D. Cohen's adaptation. Performances are uniformly top-notch, with Spacek garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Actress while Laurie received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. These two make a convincing daughter and mother combination. Spacek is a revelation when she goes full-tilt telekinetic in the final quarter hour, devastating friends and foe alike. She walked off with the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. Amy Irving and Betty Buckley are sympathetic as Carrie's friend and mentor. Nancy Allen and John Travolta play a villainous who orchestrated an evening of mayhem with pig's blood galore. ""Carrie"" is all about the terrible effects of bullying.Our poor, disadvantaged heroine grows up with a tyrannical mother whose husband abandoned her and turns into a radical Christian who sees sin in her innocent daughter. Furthermore, Carrie is an outsider at Bates High School, and her only friend is her gym teacher, Miss Collins (Betty Buckley of ""Wyatt Earp""), who struggles to help. Things get off to quick start after gym class one day when Carrie has her first period in the locker room shower. Virtually everybody ridicules Carrie's ignorance and they sling a storm of tampons and feminine napkins at her. Honestly, Carrie has no idea what is happening because her prudish, repressed mother has told her anything about growing up and the changes that occur with puberty. Miss Collins reprimands the girls and threatens to revoke their prom privileges if they don't spend time after classes with her performing calisthenics. Sue Snell (Amy Irving) regrets her behavior and arranges a prom date between her handsome football hero boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt of ""Butch & Sundance: The Early Years""), who reluctantly goes along with her best intentions scheme. Meanwhile, Sue's class mate Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen of ""RoboCop"") smolders with rage from the treatment that Miss Collins accords her. Only in the 1970s could a high school teacher assault a student by slapping her face in front of her peers and getting away with no repressions. Secretly, Chris plots revenge with her class mate Norma (P.J. Soles of ""Halloween"") and boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta of ""The Devil's Rain"") and Billy's buddy Freddy (Michael Talbot) to fix the prom vote so Carrie and Tommy will win. At the moment that Carrie receives her flower, Chris plans to tip a bucket of swine blood so that Carrie is drenched from head to toe in the gore.What nobody knocks is that with the onset of her period, Carrie has developed telekinetic powers. We see some foreshadowing of this awesome power early in the shower scene and later in the principal's office when Mr. Morton (Stefan Gierasch of ""High Plains Drifter"") mispronounces Carrie's name as Cassie and the cigarette ashtray fragments. Later, at home with her warped mother, Carrie shatters a mirror with an etching of Jesus in the background. Tommy has to harass Carrie before she accepts his invitation to go to the prom with him. Predictably, Carrie's mother is dead set against her daughter donning a dress that will prominently display her 'dirty pillows' and plans some retribution of her own. Meanwhile, Miss Collins suspects initially that Sue and Tommy are up no good with Sue's decision to skip prom and her insistence that Tommy take Carrie. The night before all Hell breaks loose, Chris, Billy, and Freddy place the bucket of pig's blood directly over the stage. Freddy and Norma decide to fix the prom couple vote without anybody knowing any better.Naturally, things go smoothly for the evil villains, but they are in no way prepared for the electrifying outcome. After she is covered in the hog's blood, Carrie unleashes all her telekinetic powers and all but burns down the auditorium where the prom occurred. She walks out of these fireworks. When Chris and Billy try to run her down with his car, she turns her powers on them, their car rolls several times, ignites in a fireball explosion and incinerates them. Talk about a spectacular way to die! At home, Carrie washes off all the swine blood and seeks her mother's loving arms for comfortable only to scream when mom buries a knife in her back. Carrie has another telekinetic bout and skewers her mom with seven kitchen utensils. Suddenly, Carrie's small white house collapses around him, and the sole survivor of this nightmare is Sue. Sue goes to the flat, level site of Carrie's house to put flowers on the for sale sign and an arm from Hell soars up from the rocks to seize her, and she awakens to find her own mother consoling her after experiencing a nightmare. The ending will startle you because this is the last thing that you expect. Four years later, Sean S. Cunningham appropriated the shocker of a finale in his gruesome but seminal slasher ""Friday the 13th"" with a small boy exploding from the calm surface of a lake to stab at a girl after the heroine had taken refuge in a boat to escape the villainess at Camp Crystal Lake. Director Brian De Palma never wears out his welcome with this 98-minute melodrama about a young girl and her supernatural powers and went on to exploit it in his next film ""The Fury."" ""The Fury,"" however, was not the memorable experience that ""Carrie.""",Carrie

Director Brian De Palma builds the intensity and menace well. Great climax too.However, once we have the climax of the prom night scene, the movie seems to fizzle out after that. It's as if De Palma, or writer Stephen King, didn't know what to do after that. The conclusion is very weak.This movie launched scores of careers. This was Stephen King's first movie (or TV) credit.

An unique one in its genre.,10,9 November 2007,"The movie is often classified as an horror movie and it also is on basically every horror top-list published, but truth is that this movie isn't really an horror movie in terms of having all of the standard required horror elements. I just say this as a little warning, since I have the impression that lots of people are watching this just because of the reason that it always tops all kinds of different horror-lists. It still is a movie with unpleasant and oppressed undertones and yes, it's of course based on a Stephen King novel, so it's totally understandable that this movie is classified as an horror movie, but it's not the kind of horror you would expect. The movie is far from standard, which is perhaps the biggest reason why this movie works out as such an horror like one, but in totally original way of its own. The characters and situations are all unpredictable. You never know what to expect, which adds to the atmosphere of the movie.But the movie is also really powerful and effective as a drama. I remember when I first watched this movie I was still too young to be able to read the subtitles, so there was no way I could understand what the movie was about, but I could still totally feel for the main character and feel her fear for her mother and at school. It's of course also absolutely thanks to Sissy Spacek's great performance that this comes across so effectively. It makes you feel and sympathize for the main character, even though she is a really unusual person and extremely shy, insecure person. I think that everyone had a sort of Carrie like person in their class at high school (althouh I hope not as extreme as this one!), which also makes it easy to relate to the events and characters within the movie.I was also surprised at some of the light and fun elements within the movie. Apparently also some of the actors thought they were making a comedy during the production of this movie. Some parts of the movie really reminded me of some good old fashioned high-school comedies. But of course the comedy goes never at the expense of the movie its tension or dramatic elements. The comedy just makes sure that this movie isn't a complete dark one. The comedy is used to draw the people more into the movie and makes us feel more at ease, rather than pushing them away with only heavy distant drama and an uneasy atmosphere. I think Brian De Palma did a really good job at this! The best horror and tension also works out best when a movie makes you feel at ease first, rather than constantly trying to scare you, also with its atmosphere.Yes, the movie is also still a real Brian De Palma movie, so expect lots of unusual, artistic and often long shots. The movie has some typical De Palma moments in it, especially toward the ending during the prom. He also knows to build up the tension and a sequence in a way only he can. It's part of the reason why the ending is such a legendary one.The whole end-prom sequence is really an extremely memorable and brilliantly shot and constructed one, also once again thanks to its wonderful build-up of the inevitable events to come. It's one of the most extreme and totally straight-forward sequences, which makes sure that it will stay with you forever.For most part the movie also works out so great due to its acting. All of the student characters are very authentic and it helps that they are being played by not the greatest actors around. Let's face it, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen and William Katt never really became the famous respected actors everybody expected them to become in those days. Sissy Spacek really plays the role out of her career as Carrie White. You totally feel and sympathize for this girl. And Piper Laurie also plays a totally great and effective character, that perhaps is the most evil and scary one out of the entire movie, as the religious-freak and mother of Carrie. Also of course the early- and quite big movie role for John Travolta in this movie is already sort of a legendary one.It's truly an unique movie to watch. There never had been a movie like ""Carrie"" before and there almost most certainly won't be another one like it. Brian De Palma himself tried it a couple of years later with his movie ""The Fury"" but I think that experience made him realize how totally unique in its sort ""Carrie"" actually was and still is.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Carrie
32,Calicodreamin,Always be nice to the weird kid,8,30 September 2021,"A true classic 70s horror movie, Carrie delivers on teen stereotypes, killer action, and one of the best ever builds up to a climactic finale.

33,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Good horror-drama by De Palma,7,11 August 2004,"Once again, I have not read the original Stephen King novel on which this film is based on, so I can't draw comparisons there. I have heard, though, that it's a fairly faithful adaption. I don't have too much faith in neither De Palma or the idea of novel adaption, but this one looked somewhat interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did; it's definitely one of De Palma's better, and one of the better horror movies of that period. The climax is great, some of the best use of split-screen and instant zooming I've ever seen. The use of slow-motion also adds a lot. The plot is good; it deals with Carrie, a teenage girl who's constantly bullied by her classmates and just about everyone else, for that matter. Her mother is a dominating and very extreme Christian believer, so Carrie also suffers under that. The film has a pretty good pace; there wasn't really more than five minutes in total out of the 90 minutes the movie takes where I was bored. The film has a few light-hearted and humorous scenes, which are probably there to keep the viewer interested, and intensify the climax, which comes as a huge shock, like a crack of thunder. Some would say that it has too many humorous scenes, considering the theme, but I think it was a good idea; though I guess the film is a little hurt by the unintentional comedy, mostly brought on by the slightly overacting performances of Nancy Allen, John Travolta and Piper Laurie. This is evidenced by the trivia section indicating that they did, in fact, think they were there for comic relief, which did ruin some scenes(mainly those involving Laurie, as she was the psychotic mother, who provided a little too much comic relief, rather than instill fear in some instances), though it's easily ignored, and doesn't ruin the movie as a whole, nor does it lessen the value of the point. The acting is mostly good. Sissy Spacek was great as the mousy Carrie. The characters were well-written, though I guess many of them, especially the teens, were cliches and stereotypes. The score was good. The music almost always fitted with the scene. The special effects are great, and the atmosphere and shocks were chilling. All in all, a very good horror-drama, that could possibly have been better, but De Palma makes good use of various cinematic tricks and editing finesses, which takes the film to a fairly high level. I recommend it to fans of horror and teenage dramas, possibly fans of King, and fans of Brian De Palma. 7/10",Carrie
34,view_and_review,King Starts His Filmatic Career Right,8,13 June 2014,Carrie was a trip. Even the way the movie started was bizarre but it set the tone for the rest of the movie. This was Stephen King's first novel made into a film and it was superb.Imagine Revenge of the Nerds as a single female nerd with telekinetic powers and no annoying laugh and you'd have Carrie. The entire movie was a slow promenade building up to a grand finale. How few are the movies that successfully end with a bang. Carrie ended with a big bang.This movie was so good it would go on to be referenced for the next 30+ years. There was even a remake of it done in 2002 and again in 2013. This movie was an undeniable classic.,Carrie
35,neil-476,Monsters,8,14 April 2011,"Stephen King is noted as an author of horror stories - stories involving monsters, if you will. Carrie tells the story of a teenage girl with telekinetic powers which kick in with the onset of puberty, who kills her entire high school year at the Prom - at first glance, an obvious monster. Yet the beauty of this story (and it is an ugly beauty, if such a thing is possible) is that Carrie is not the monster -she is a victim. The monsters are her mother and a large part of her class at high school.The only major discrepancy between King's novel and DePalma's adaptation is that Sissy Spacek is a good deal cuter than King's Carrie White. But she is just as vulnerable, damaged, frightened and victimised and, ultimately, the difference in appearance does not matter in the slightest for dramatic purposes.This film is excellent all round. The performances are all very good, and the direction is stunningly effective - it suits the material perfectly.And the movie is also notable for the names it put on the map - DePalma, King, Spacek, Allen, Travolta. King hasn't always been fortunate with film adaptations, but he had nothing to complain about here.",Carrie
36,evanston_dad,Stephen King's First Novel Makes It to the Big Screen,6,28 August 2007,"Brian De Palma's assured adaptation of Stephen King's first novel does the book justice, but it falls short of a horror classic for me.Actually, this is one of those movies that maybe really wouldn't even be remembered today if it had not had the luck of casting an actress as good as Sissy Spacek in the title role, who finds things to do with the character that a lesser actress wouldn't have. It's also notable for showcasing John Travolta on the cusp of stardom. And Piper Laurie, who hadn't been seen by movie audiences since her appearance in ""The Hustler"" fifteen years earlier, pops up as a whacked out religious nutjob who would give Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford a run for her money as worst movie mom ever.De Palma uses funky split screens to stage the film's big set piece, the prom in which Carrie lets her telekinetic powers loose on her tormentors. The device looks hopelessly dated today, but yet somehow works well in context and makes the scene more disturbing than it otherwise might have been.Grade: B",Carrie
37,gridoon2021,Unsurprising but sensational thriller,7,17 April 2016,"Even if you have never read Stephen King's book or seen any of the sequels / remakes, ""Carrie"" holds few surprises. Basically, if you've seen the 3-minute trailer, you've seen most of the film. Even if you don't see the trailer, the movie itself telegraphs early on approximately what is going to happen. But the movie is still worth seeing, primarily for three reasons: Brian De Palma's direction (he is a genius with the camera), and the performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie (Amy Irving is also terrific in one of her earliest roles): Spacek should have won the Oscar for her extraordinary, sensitive, chameleonic, scary interpretation, and Laurie makes one of the most terrifying villains in movie history - maybe because she is so single-minded and devoted to her ""cause"". There are some inexplicably poor scenes (those with John Travolta and Nancy Allen - a far cry from their work in De Palma's later ""Blow Out""), but the prom climax is worth the wait, the confrontation between Carrie and her mother is unnerving, and the shock ending is effective. *** out of 4.",Carrie
38,anaconda-40658,A Message to Bullies.,9,30 December 2015,"Carrie (1976): Dir: Brian De Palma / Cast: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen: Compelling high school horror film that is about as sophisticated as these films get. Sissy Spacek delivers a brilliant performance as Carrie White with hair in her face to hide insecurities, and her plain wardrobe. She is a tormented student under the ruthless religious rants of her mother. She also has telekinesis and this is discovered when she is pelted with tampons in the locker room by her peers. Piper Laurie plays Margaret White who drags her screaming daughter into a closet to cleanse herself in prayer in front of a Christ figure. Amy Irving as Sue Snell is the one student having remorse for her morbid behavior. William Katt plays Sue's boyfriend Tommy Ross whom she convinces to ask Carrie to the prom, as fallible as that is. Nancy Allen plays the nasty female antagonist who plots to have pig's blood dumped over Carrie's head at the prom. This results in an electrifying climax where Carrie cuts lose and consequences go up in flames. Brian De Palma previously made Sisters and The Phantom of the Paradise and here he propels to a higher level with an interesting social commentary on high school peer trauma and a central character time bomb awaiting to go off. The result is a captivating character study and a retaliation that goes so far that her own world caves into the ground. Score: 9 / 10",Carrie
39,bombersflyup,Margaret White: They're all gonna laugh at you!,3,7 May 2018,"Carrie isn't much of a film. It's paper thin with an uninteresting conclusion.Sissy Spacek's the part and it's well acted by all parties, but there just isn't anything here. I honestly can't remember where the time went, slow moving scenes, gym class, going to the prom, sitting, dancing. Yet not enough time's invested in learning about Carrie, her mother or Sue. There's just too much nothingness to give any of it importance and the Tommy character's just unwritten. His personality says he wants to be in on it, yet he still takes Carrie and why's Sue with him? Awful writing, grrr.",Carrie
40,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the better King adaptations,8,29 October 2015,"Relentlessly tormented and humiliated by her peers, a teenager fins that her growing telekinetic powers are the manifestation of her ascent into puberty which reaches a boiling point during her high-school prom that no one at the school wishes would've been discovered.While it's a little overrated, that doesn't take anything away from it at times since there's still some good stuff to it. One of the best points is the fact that there's an exceptional build-up initially based upon the religious angle, which is from the rather well-done religious angle on display. From the ranting and raving, which are perfectly done so as to really amp up the tension, along with her house which is like a containment camp for the religiously devout with crucifixes in every possible location, 'Last Supper' paintings placed in ominous places, and her special confessional, a small hole in the wall with figures, ornaments and strange candles, is just weird. All of these are building up tension, and it actually succeeds from others that haven't before in making this seem genuinely unnerving. It's also great at building tension earlier on with what happens at school from the very beginning, which has the distinction of showing some of the scariest images of a high school ever during the shower scene, which is one of the absolutely best parts due to it instigating all the great parts that followed, and the traumatic events that followed are what make it work so well. The initial bits used to show her gift are also some creepy images, and the events are pretty creepy. There's also some really great action scenes towards the end with the prom as one of the highlights of the genre which is quite fun when it gets going, with the fire raining down on everyone and the different methods of telekinesis-inspired tortures that are simply fun to see as there's lots of impaling, a couple of people set on fire and some electrified while standing in water or touching a microphone, and the rampage through town with a fantastic car crash and some more damage to be had making for a fantastic finish here. These here are the film's good points while there were a couple flaws with this one. The main problem here is that it takes a long time to get going as a long portion of the film, at least fifty minutes, takes place before we get anything remotely interesting. Making the beginning focus on the mother-daughter relationship over anything else tends to drop the film down a lot since it doesn't tend to place any kind of importance on the supernatural aspects of the story which are far more important to the story. There are so few jumps due to how the film is going, especially with the drama-like focus for much of the time, that after repeated viewings it loses some of its initial impact with how it goes about. Also, some of the religious discussions can be a bit much for those that aren't that versed in religion or don't believe in it. The religious aspect of the film is a large part of the film, and if you don't believe in what is presented, it can lead to some unpleasant experiences. These here are the film's flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, and discussions and events portraying feminine issues and religion.",Carrie
41,AaronCapenBanner,I Felt Bad For Poor Carrie!,7,19 September 2013,"Based on Stephen King's first novel, this film tells the story of a shy teenage girl named Carrie White(Sissy Spacek in an unforgettable performance) who is mocked and humiliated by her cruel schoolmates, though one of them takes pity on her, and has her popular boyfriend(William Katt) ask Carrie to the prom, which she accepts, but tragically Carrie's mother(Piper Laurie, quite good) is a psychopathic religious zealot who keeps Carrie locked in the closet as punishment for her ""sins"", but Carrie defies her, though two evil expelled classmates(played by Nancy Allen & John Travolta) plot a cruel prank on her at the prom, which pushes Carrie over the edge, and makes her use her latent telekinetic powers in merciless revenge...Fine performances and script compensate for some exploitive and obvious scare tactics in this memorable film, which elicits such sympathy for this unjustly put-upon girl that her rage at the end is understandable, though of course the poor girl is doomed...",Carrie

But another girl who has been banned from the prom for her continued aggressive behaviour, is not as forgiving, and plans a trick to embarrass Carrie in front of the whole school. What she doesn't realise is that Carrie is gifted, and further embarrassment may cause a rage.......Along with The Shining and Misery, this is the best King adaptation ever committed to film. Its taut, filled with sinister tension, and Spacek gives a career best performance.De Palma has crafted an intricate horror film, and many of his traits seen in later movies are evident here, and add a little more to the movie. If it wasn't for the auteur, we wouldn't have had the split screen during the finale, and it wouldn't be as tense as it is.But Piper Laurie steals the show as Mother, and whenever the film is set in the White household, the film turns into something different, the angles and the lighting change, and the film becomes more eerie.The prom scene is crafted beautifully, and even though you know the bucket will drop, it's still the longest drawn scene in a movie and the aftermath fits the crime, so to say.All in all, its a wonderful horror movie, filled with beautiful cinematography, and wonderfully filmed backwards finale.See this before the remake.",Carrie

Carrie accomplishes both these tasks with aplomb. It still resonates as hard today as it did nearly 40 years ago (has it truly been that long?

46,zetes,"Conflicted, but it works",10,22 July 2003,"I am usually one who has little problem deciding how I feel about a movie. Carrie is a rare movie that completely conflicts me. A good half of the movie I found excellent. The other half I found execrable. I was highly suspicious right from the second scene, where the camera pans through a high school girls' locker room in slow motion, and no detail is spared. Okay, so none of the girls in the film were under 25, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they're supposed to be 18 and under and we can see their naked breasts and even pubic hair. This is very bothersome. And then we find the source of the title character's problems: her religious zealot of a mother, played by Piper Laurie. This role is so poorly written, and so poorly performed that it veers very close to being hugely offensive. Even if not offensive, it's annoyingly one-dimensional and adds absolutely no depth to the picture. And then there's the climactic sequence. If you haven't seen the film, egregious SPOILERS follow. I've always known how this film turns out, for the most part (I had never heard about the ultra-religious mother, which is probably wisely kept a secret by the film's fans). I expected the whole film to be little more than a revenge fantasy, and I was mostly correct. I especially didn't like the scene where Travolta and Nancy Allen got killed, despite the fact that I've always secretly wanted to see John Travolta die in an exploding car. But it would have been better to let them survive, to allow some of the guilt exist on with them (they had already escaped the prom, so it almost seems like they were supposed to live). Yet the actual climactic scene in the high school gym is not merely a revenge fantasy. If it were, the audience would be allowed to enjoy the violence and take part in the joy of it, which is the way revenge fantasies generally work. But, no, our emotions are purposely conflicted when Carrie ends up killing several people who neither meant harm to her nor did harm to her. She even kills her gym teacher (Betty Buckley), who is more benign to her than any other character in the film, brutally and intentionally. These deaths were not playing into the audience's desire, but rather worked against it, raising uncomfortable questions.Unfortunately, we then have to follow Carrie home. On the way, she kills those who did her, and, consequently, everyone else, the most harm, and that is a death scene we're meant to revel in. Then she gets to have revenge on the cartoon character of her mother (who speaks with a fake Southern accent because anyone who would be that into Jesus would have to be a Southerner, I guess), where she dies in the same position as Carrie's demonic-looking Christ figurine, a ham-fisted attempt at satire. Along the way De Palma foolishly throws in his entire bag of tricks, which don't really encompass anything that Hitchcock hadn't perfected years earlier, and perhaps even fall far short of what Hitchcock could achieve, and he has composer Pino Donaggio write what has to be one of the worst musical scores of all time. It frequently steals the sharp violin notes that punctuate Janet Leigh's death in Psycho, and uses them in an incredibly inept manner, at that.And then, and then the film has such a remarkably knowing center, the cruelty and pain of a young girl's existence in high school. Throughout the movie, so many perfect notes are hit, from the embarrassment Carrie feels when her gym teacher, either thinking the girl can't hear her or forgetting the fact that she can, is telling the principal about Carrie's period (hey, maybe that's why she gets crushed at the end!), to the way Carrie refuses Tommy when he first asks her to the prom, to the beautiful spinning dance  not so much the actual dance, which is another of De Palma's moments of unneeded inventiveness, but the sweet, natural dialogue between Tommy and Carrie. At that point we don't know yet that Tommy and his girlfriend, Sue, aren't in on the prank, but Tommy's dialogue sounds so unforced that I was unsure of whether he was just an exceptional actor (William Katt does an excellent job in the role) or whether he might actually like Carrie. I found myself actively hoping for the latter and, though we never do find out the exact truth of the matter, I was at least relieved that it wasn't the former, or at least that the act he was putting on wasn't an act of unadulterated cruelty (perhaps, at the most, unintentional cruelty). In the middle of this mess of a film is the beautiful, brilliant, powerful performance by Sissy Spacek. She was a decade or more older than the character she was playing, but she captures that look of a tortured teenage soul with those cavernous, blue eyes and the hangdog lips. And she gives such perfect readings of her lines. Spacek breaks my heart with every word she says in the movie, even during the bad scenes with Piper Laurie. And knowing what awaits Carrie at the prom makes some of the film almost unbearable emotionally. As many problems as I had with the film, I had tears in my eyes through most of it. Indeed, I was very involved with the film emotionally through its entire run. When, in Sue's dream sequence in the end of the film, an event occurs that would have been entirely predictable  even if this was the first time it had ever happened (which I doubt anyway), I was startled, badly. I, who claim to recognize nearly every cinematic trick and cliché in the book. And I sat there and chastised myself in my mind for being that gullible. But the simple fact was that it made me jump. That's higher praise than I can give a good number of the best films.",Carrie

48,christopher-underwood,Has to be seen but not too often.,8,26 January 2020,"Extremely well made and probably DePalma's most popular film and based upon Stephen King's first published book. Its just that for the first hour this is just so nasty, what with all the girl on girl bullying and getting the guys to do their bidding, that this is a difficult watch. Indeed, I'm sure I haven't seen this for many a year, although I still remember the sensation it created upon its original release. Apart from DePalma's undoubted directorial skills, a largely rookie cast pull together in a most extraordinary way to lift what was to have been a 'B' feature into an Oscar nominated feature. Central to all this is the amazing performance of Sissy Spacek. I had been stunned by her performance in the earlier Badlands, but here she even outdoes that and probably helping bring out a similarly amazing showing from Piper Laurie as her deranged mother.

49,ShadeGrenade,Death by Telekinesis,10,28 February 2011,"I was too young to see 'Carrie' in 1976, so had to make do with the New English Library paperback of Stephen King's novel ( his first major bestseller ). The cover had a picture of a startled young woman with a bloody face. I saw the film some years later and found it to be remarkably faithful to its source. Sissy Spacek is 'Carrie White', a shy, sexually repressed student who is the butt of her classmates' childish jokes, in particular 'Chris Hargenson' ( Nancy Allen ), a bitch of the first magnitude. Following a volleyball game, Carrie is in the shower room when her menstrual cycle begins. As her religious fanatic mother ( Piper Laurie ) never bothered to inform her daughter about such things, she panics, only to be laughed at by her class. Along with the arrival of womanhood Carrie begins to develop telekinesis - the ability to move objects just by thinking.Sue Snell ( Amy Irving ) persuades her boyfriend Tommy ( William Katt ) to ask Carrie to be his Prom Night date. Against her mother's advice, she accepts. Carrie and Tommy win a rigged vote to become 'King' and 'Queen', but her moment of glory is to be cruelly shattered. Chris and boyfriend Billy ( John Travolta ) have placed a bucket of pig's blood in the rafters. As soon as Carrie is standing under it, they cause the bucket to fall. At first, the assemblage is shocked, but then laughter rings out. Angered, she unleashes the full force of her power against those mocking her...This was Brian De Palma's first major hit following the cult smashes 'Sisters' ( 1973 ) and 'Phantom Of The Paradise' ( 1974 ). He was touted as 'the heir to Hitchcock' and from this you can see why. Listen out for the 'Psycho'-like stings whenever Carrie uses her powers. He employs slow motion and split-screen to good effect. Of course it helps that the book and script ( by Lawrence D.Cohen ) are first-rate too. Dominating the movie though is a superb central performance from freckle-faced Spacek. You want to weep for her. When I read the book, I imagined her mother to be some toothless crone, but the movie 'Margaret' is surprisingly attractive, strangely emphasising her insanity. This was Laurie's first film in 15 years, and she was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Margaret's madness began when she was raped by her husband years before ( ""I could smell the whisky on his breath!"" ). The scene in which she stalks Carrie, knife in hand and a demented smile on her face, has got to be one of the most chilling cinematic moments ever.The rest of the cast also impresses, particularly Nancy Allen and Amy Irving. De Palma retained the latter for his next picture, the underrated 'The Fury' ( 1977 ). It is interesting now to see Travolta in his pre-'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Grease' days.'Carrie' might not have as much gore as say 'The Exorcist' but it definitely ranks as one of the '70's best horror pictures, certainly the best ever King adaptation.There was a stage musical ( believe it or not! ) and a T.V. sequel ( 'Carrie 2: The Rage' ) but they are best forgotten. Watch the original and be prepared to fly out of your chair during the final scene. 'Carrie' boasts one of the first examples of the 'trick ending' ( later copied by, amongst others, 1985's 'Nightmare On Elm Street' ).",Carrie

The Oscars for acting were very well deserved and I wouldn't doubt that this is one of the best films from '76.Carrie is a shy girl in high school who gets picked on... a lot. At home, it's not any better, she has a psychotic mother who is abusive and highly religious. Everyone underestimates her and doesn't realize the little power she has inside her, telekinesis ""Thought to be the ability to move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind"". When she has a very bad incident at school, a girl, Sue feels horrible and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom in hopes to make Carrie a little more popular. One of the girls, Chris, isn't feeling so guilty, more of in a revenge mood and wants to get Carrie back for her punishment by being banned from the prom for her prank on Carrie. Her and her hillbilly boyfriend, Billy played by guess who? John Travolta! They together devise the perfect revenge by dumping pig's blood all over Carrie at her perfect moment of being prom queen. It's not done yet, let's just say she can throw one HELL of a prom.This is a terrific movie, not just for horror fans, but for any movie fan. I would always recommend this movie for it's memorable characters, moments, lines, and scenes. The ending is always a heart stopper though, you might want a blanket to cover your head.10/10",Carrie
52,blanbrn,Well done horror film that showcases the different and highlights revenge.,9,28 June 2016,"Brian DePalma's 1976 horror thriller based on Stephen King's novel is a well done film that has theme of feeling different and it proves that an outcast can have the most fun and revenge in the end. This film entertains to the end it's an ultimate revenge story.The story has Carrie White(in a top performance from Sissy Spacek)who's a bullied and picked on and mocked tormented girl as she gets it in droves from her classmates as the leader of the pack is Chris(the sexy Nancy Allen)a rude cheerleader type who's so cruel. Also out of this supporting cast of mean teenagers look for Amy Irving, P.J. Soles, William Katt, and John Travolta all in early roles for themselves. Also on the other side Carrie is tormented and treated bad by her crazy and religious freak mother Margaret(Piper Laurie). Carrie has no friends no hope she's an outcast well the one little thing she has going for her is the secret powers of being telekinetic as she can move objects, move people and even start fires.Finally when all around Carrie go to far with the mocked encounters and humiliation Carrie then takes her powers of vengeance to new levels and new highs a powerhouse moment as this special gift cause hell and a firestorm of a good time at her high school prom! Overall this is a wonderful film of blood, fire, revenge, and getting even as the film is straight to the point and cast chemistry is in top form, as ""Carrie"" is clearly a horror classic.",Carrie
53,lasttimeisaw,Carrie,8,29 May 2012,"Now this Stephen King's horror classic has been confirmed for a remake which stars Chloë Grace Moretz and my diva Julianne Moore (highly likely to take on the role of the religion- maniac mother), both reinterpret two Oscar-nominated performances from Spacek and Laurie, with the juicy fodder, a belated Oscar finally seems to be approaching for my goddess (finger crossed). So it seems to be a properly perfect time for me to watch the original version for the very first time. Brian De Palma, has been considered Hitchcock at his time by his devotees, the similarity is both haven't received much awards-crammed recognition, but arguably De Palma is a lesser player as his oeuvre encompasses more run-of-the-mills, but CARRIE is by any standards not among them, and it could be his PSYCHO (1960) because De Palma shows off his artistry in a full-fledged sweep. For instance, there are many eye-dropping stunts: the opening credit, slow-motion of volleyball girl's changing room until Carrie's first bloody period running through her fingers; the multi-prisms perspective images after the blood splattering all over Carrie after a long-stewed happiness-hanging-by-a-thread preparation; the havoc of massacre at the prom is more supernaturally gratifying than scary. The mother-daughter face-off and subsequent house caving into debris scenes may be attributed to produce a more crowd-please impression (despite of its low-budget SFX and the well-expected surprise at the coda), the film could hardly be pigeonholed as a horrorfest, as Carrie is ubiquitous in every school, every class, a bully-defying story has much more drama empathy even after 35 years after its debut, which could nicely explain the ground for a remake now. Sissy Spacek is against the grain to portray a teenage girl due to her actual 27 years old age, the immense age difference is rarely perceivable if one doesn't know it before and Ms. Spacek is on fire in it, renders an extraordinary transformation from vulnerability to malice. Piper Laurie as well doesn't betray her Oscar nomination to give birth to a conflicting mother role which is hauntingly unforgettable. All in all, thanks to Stephen King's story to surmount many genre clichés and continue to stagger us with the rosy remake in 2013.",Carrie
54,Rainey-Dawn,Still Good All These Years Later,8,8 September 2017,"A timeless horror classic - it's very much a must watch for fans of the genre. This classic with Sissy Spacek is THE version to watch, I'm not into the remake at all.For those who have not seen this one yet and love horror - you'll just have to watch it because I won't give it all away. I will say that Carrie is a girl with a mother that is overly zealous in her religion and has raised Carrie in it - making Carrie weird to others and they make fun of her for that. Carrie also has Telekinesis - a mental power that she uses only when she feels forced to use for her own protection.A really fun watch. It's just to bad those who are picked on don't develop Carrie's powers for their own personal revenge in real life.8.5/10",Carrie
55,disdressed12,nearly perfect movie...just one major flaw,7,22 October 2006,"i finally got around to watching ""Carrie"".while it was worth the wait, i was a little disappointed.the first two thirds of the movie are very well done.it is very easy to sympathize with ""Carrie"",given the evil witch(Piper Laurie in a brilliant performance)she has for a mother.Carrie(Sissy Spacek in an equally greet performance)is an awkward outsider who has been sheltered from life and does not fit in.she is frequently the target of mercilessly cruel verbal abuse and torment from her classmates.but Carrie has a secret.she has the ability to move objects with her mind.this ability could have been explored and developed more in the story.however,now we come to the last act of the film.after a particularly cruel prank(having a bucket of Pig's blood dumped all over her at the prom),Carrie exacts her revenge-sort of.and herein lies the one major problem with film.given her obvious humiliation and anger,you expect the cruel mongers would get their just rewards for what they have done.yet the revenge that Carrie exacts is much less than what these wretches deserve and is anti climatic.her so called mother also deserves a much worse fate than she receives,as well.although the destruction of the house and its being swallowed up by the earth does imply that she gets her just reward in hell.the only problem is that Carrie is with her and hardly deserves the same fate.there is however much more that is positive about this film than negative.the brilliant performances from the two leads,as mentioned,and the very well executed direction,which provides many moments of tension and suspense.the most important aspect of this film,however is the brilliant score by Pino Donagio,which elevates this movie to a whole new level.so,how to rate this film.only one flaw,although a major one. 6.5* stars seems fair for this movie",Carrie
56,Red-Barracuda,A heartbreaking horror movie,10,2 October 2009,"This is a highly successful Brian De Palma adaption of Stephen King's novel. And while I have never read the book itself, I can still say that this is one of the best films associated with both King and De Palma.Carrie is the story of a shy girl who is bullied in high school. She has telekinetic powers that seem to be connected in some way with her progression into womanhood. Her religiously fanatical mother dangerously over-protects her from the wider world. Things then take an unexpected turn when Carrie is invited to the prom by one of the popular boys from the school.Firstly, let me say that I find this film absolutely heartbreaking. It rips me apart emotionally every time I watch it. To say the least, this is not what you expect to happen when watching a horror movie. Much of the reason for this is down to the performance of Sissy Spacek. A more delicate and nuanced presentation of a troubled and bullied young girl you will have difficulty finding. She is perfectly cast. You would have to have a heart of stone not to want happiness for this girl. Another significant performer is William Katt. He too is excellent and is a highly likable presence; the romantic developments between these two characters are extremely touching and genuine. Forgetting the horror element for a moment, Carrie works brilliantly as a heart-warming coming-of-age drama. So much so, that every time I see it, I dread the horrific finale in the school. I just want this girl to be happy. By the end of this movie I feel emotionally drained. Although many horror films end in a pessimistic way, the manner in which events in Carrie are built up and then ripped apart is incredibly cruel and carry an unusually high emotional impact.Stylistically, as is typical for De Palma, this is a great looking film. The widescreen format is used beautifully throughout but the cinematic style is truly taken to the fore in the final showdown in the school. De Palma's combination of split-screen photography and jump cuts really accentuates that scene. It's a mesmerizing sequence that does not disappoint. If I had to voice a minor quibble about the movie it would be regarding the soundtrack. In a couple of the lighter scenes it's cheesy in a horrible way and later it unfortunately resorts to shrill Psycho-esquire strings when Carrie uses her telekinetic powers. This latter factor, along with the use of the 'Bates School' name, are the type of Hitchcockian references that De Palma has become notorious for. However, aside from this, Carrie is not an obvious ode to the master of suspense and should not be thought of as such.Overall, this is a great film. Aside from Spacek and Katt, Piper Laurie is also excellent here, in what is a film full of strong performances. The exemplary acting contributes to the strong dramatic impact of Carrie, and this allied with De Palma's mastery of cinematic style, means that this is a film of a very high calibre. Effective horror films to tend to work on the emotions, as they play on our inner fears. Carrie is no different in this. But what sets this film apart from so many of its contemporaries is that it is not only about that, it's also about adolescence, loneliness and bullying. It might even make you cry. And how many horror movies can you say that about?",Carrie
57,OllieSuave-007,Creepy Carrie!,7,2 March 2014,"Based on Stephen King's novel, Sissy Spacek stars as Carrie, a timid 17-year-old girl who falls for constant hazing at her high school and is abused by her religiously-fanatic mother Margaret White (Piper Laurie). Carrie later discovers she has telekinesis, and gets pushed to the limit on the night of her school's prom by a humiliating prank, giving the perpetrators a lesson they'll never forget.Filmed with much suspense and horror, Sissy really shined as the tormented and cast-out girl, generating the audience's sympathy. Nancy Allen and P.J. Soles play mean girls Chris Hargensen and Norma, very convincing, bratty and downright cruel in their performances. John Travolta makes his film debut as Billy Nolan, playing a very bad-boy and gangster-style boyfriend to Chris, eager to join in the fun to prank Carrie. And, Piper Laurie gave an astonishing performance as Margaret White - disturbed, fanatic, wired and downright crazy.It is an exciting movie, but I just wished the prom scene was filmed with a little more carnage, horror, and vengeful acts that directed more on Carrie's tormentors, rather than some of the more innocent characters like Miss Collins. But, overall, not a bad horror film.Grade B-",Carrie
58,ElMaruecan82,A Landmark of the Horror Genre...,9,17 January 2017,"The mark of great horror movies is to depict horror visually and tacitly, when the anticipation and the non-action make your heart pound more than any slashing. For all its abundance of hemoglobin, ""Brian de Palma's ""Carrie"" is never as haunting and effective as when it deals with the brutality endured by its titular characters. For ""Carrie"" is a deep and emotionally involving portrait of a tormented creature, whose power is finally, fully expressed when she's the victim of the ""one prank too many"" at the moment that could have been the time of her life. Everyone knows the iconic picture of blood-soaked Sissy Spacek, but also her dazzling smile while holding flowers during her prom coronation, that's the duality of Carrie and the secret of her appeal.Through his breakthrough best-selling novel, Stephen King painted, in bold red letters, a much fascinating portrait of a shy, insecure girl like we all knew in high-school, an easy target for more confident, popular and (although not a rule) prettier girls. This is clearly established in the first shot where, after having missed a ball during volleyball game, she gets insulted and hit by her schoolmates. Looking at Sissy Spacek's innocent look, I felt an instant empathy toward that poor creature. I was bullied in school, athletics weren't my strongest suit, and while I wasn't as shy as Carrie, I was certainly below the line of popularity, so I knew all too well what she was going through.But Carrie is an even more excessive case, she doesn't even realize that she's having her first period during the following shower. That a girl so advanced in age didn't even anticipate her physiological changes is suspicious and worries Mrs. Collins, her comprehensive gym teacher who finds the right words and gesture to appease her panic attack. We start having a few glimpses of Carrie, when the principal misquotes her name; an ashtray starts shaking and then literally jumps when he shouts. A similar incident occurs when a kid teasing her falls from his bike, there's a sort of catch underneath Carrie's seemingly submissive personality. She's not your typical target. The film doesn't try to be a character study but works all the same.At home, Carrie's mother confronts her, she's a bigoted Christian played by a convincingly scary Piper Laurie. At the very knowledge that her daughter has the curse, Margaret throws a tantrum on her and asks her to pray God for forgiveness. She's a scary woman but she reveals a lot about Carrie especially that behind every weak personality, there's a controlling and dominant parent believing in his/her good intentions. Carrie's soul is the soul of her mother's obsessions, but it had such a traumatic effect on Carrie that it shaped the two defining aspects of her personality: shyness and a 'power' revealing itself to be 'telekinesis. In King's oeuvre, power is always at the hands of vulnerable people and that's why King's books and adaptations are so successful.But ""Carrie"" also benefits from Brian De Palma's directing, flashy when it's called for to emphasize the suddenness of the scary outbursts with the use of Bernard Herrman's violin score from ""Psycho"", but there is a fine balance between stylish moments and quieter ones. And on the basis of these moments where the teacher confronts the girls, when she helps Carrie to feel better and to take care of her face, for these touching interactions with Tommy, the prettiest guy in school, I liked ""Carrie"". This is not your typical 'all flash and no substance' horror movie, as no flashiness, no nudity, no extreme violence or sexuality ever feels gratuitous. Spacek makes Carrie so real the realism exceeds her fragile aura and affects the film, positively.And while De Palma paid a remarkable tribute to his master Hitchcock, there's a dimension of sweetness and romance that weren't known as Hitchcock's trademarks. So in its own right, this is great romance culminating at the prom. The dance sequence is nothing short but a masterpiece of filmmaking, a moment where Carrie still doesn't realize that this is happening, but Tommy finds the perfect words to reassure her. The camera turns around them and the pace accelerates until it gets vertiginous as if De Palma deliberately accentuated the dizziness of Carrie, as if she was intoxicated by her euphoria. It is just too good to be true, but as viewers, we want to believe it, and as long as it takes for Carrie to get on the stage, to smile, to see people smiling back, to receive the flowers, we savor every moment of that before it all gets downhill.This is one of these instances where you almost wish there would be no movie, for Carrie's sake. This is how powerfully and patiently our empathy was built and how the climax, as brutal and blindly violent as it was (many victims weren't even laughing at Carrie) shows that sometimes, violence is out of control, it starts when an innocent life is brutalized but as a consequence, many other innocent lives can be swept out. In the case of Carrie, vengeance was a dish served immediately, all in a flashy red, one of the film's leitmotifs, and the climax is still now, a staple of modern horror movies and an indicator that the 70's were a terrific decade in every level.And it also works on a slightly pervert level, as we all feel somewhat satisfied when some of the bullies get their comeuppance, no matter how extreme they are, then the fact that innocents die too reminds us that one should not cheer for violence and accept that bullies can be victims and victim can be bullies, although in the case of Carrie, a very extreme type. It seems reliant on voyeuristic and manipulative tricks but when you look closer, it's far beyond these clichés and respects the viewers' intelligence more than your usual horror flicks.",Carrie
59,paul2001sw-1,Deserves its classic status,7,3 September 2021,"Watching Brian de Palma's celebrated horror 'Carrie' one can't but help noting that it's dated, by its special effects (actually, not a problem), by it's film making techniques more generally, and also by the director's judgement of what passed for mainsteam-acceptable titilation in the 1970s. But there's also a lot going on in the (Stephen King-penned) plot: its poor eponymous heroine is caught between puberty, bullying classmates, a tyranical, evangelical mother and her own growing powers of telekenesis, which, it's ultimately suggested, are the results of demonic posession (or maybe even possession by Jesus!). In fact, the plot and pacing of the film are excellently managed, preparing the audience for the moment when all hell (quite literally) breaks loose. Carrie's own helplessness in the face of both her own power, and the cruelty of others, is well-conveyed. By the standards of modern excess, this movie is not exactly shocking; but the air of menace is pervasive throughout. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre in general; but it's not hard to understand this film's classic status.",Carrie
60,ThomasDrufke,Vicious and Relentless,7,22 October 2016,"With the utmost respect, Carrie seems very much like an exploitation film of the slasher/revenge genre. In another one of the many films that was undoubtedly inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, a teenager decides to unload her unusual powers on a bunch of unfortunately sour members of her school.One of my problems with many horror films is the loss of grounded characters who are easy to root for. I feel like many films in this genre focus too heavily on the antagonistic presences in the films that they forget to build out likable and realistic main characters. Carrie doesn't necessarily suffer from that particular problem, but it chooses to surround Carrie, a bullied and reserved girl, with stereotypical one-note characters. Sometimes it works, but I will always desire characters with understandable motivations.So even though there is basically no one likable in the story, Carrie succeeds in that it's an important tale of the damage that bullying can do and the lengths that the victim could go to get revenge. With a limited budget, due to it being the first adaptation of Stephen King's work, Brian De Palma does more with less. And even though you pretty much know what's going to happen, the execution is nonetheless very effective. Sissy Spacek kills it, as she did a whole lot in the 70's and 80's. She's complemented by an equally creepily eerie turn by Piper Laurie, who plays her mother. Yikes. Yes, It's definitely dated, but Carrie is a fun product of its time, and a story/message that should be remembered.+Bloody/fiery fun+Exploitive in the best ways-A few too many unlikable characters7.1/10",Carrie
61,ericstevenson,Another great Stephen King movie,9,7 January 2018,"I thought that I knew exactly how this movie ended, but it turns out I was wrong. I'm actually glad of it so the ending wasn't quite spoiled for me. Everyone remembers the ending of the film or rather one of the last scenes in the movie. This is a great movie throughout the entire running time. Even in the first scenes, we see Carrie struggle with puberty. We're not sure how many people die in the end. The last scene is truly haunting.The best performance might be Carrie's mother. From a certain point of view, her reaction to her daughter's telekinesis could be considered realistic given her personality. I heard that the actress who played her mother thought that she was in a comedy. She even holds that view up to this day. You feel sorry for Carrie and the few people who sincerely care about her. This is a great horror film. ***1/2",Carrie

God I honestly couldn't believe she stabbed Carrie, she must had a really bad mental illness like a killer! I think Carries bullying, loneliness and the fact that her mother made her mood plus powers become more triggered by it all!I really think this is the best horror movie of all regardless how old or how sad it was, it was really good!Well done Stephen King but really why can't they leave this movie and not add other adaptations that aren't as good as this honestly!",Carrie
63,Bored_Dragon,"Sissy, sweet nightmare",7,1 November 2016,"In the '70s, ""Carrie"" was a show worth your money. By today's standards, it is not a horror movie at all. But horror isn't the point of this movie anyway. King goes much further than the simple scaring of the audience. ""Carrie"" is a primarily sad and heavy drama about an unhappy childhood, while supernatural aspects of the story and horror ending just serve the purpose of amplifying the drama. Mother, religious fanatic, was much more convincing to me in the 2013 remake, but Sissy Spacek really nailed her part. Although the movie does not give us enough time and background to get to know her well enough, Sissy's performance is so real and convincing that she transfers her emotions to the audience from the very beginning of the movie. We feel her sadness, her loneliness, her fears, her anger. When other kids mistreat her we want to kill them all. And at the end of the movie, that sweet shy little creature transforms into a frightening monster. Makeup cannot do that transformation on its own. Sissy nailed it. She is so creepy and scary at the end that she established herself as one of the most terrifying nightmares in horror movies history. Still, I prefer the remake.7/10 [10/10 for Sissy]",Carrie
64,kenjha,Campy Comedy,6,28 September 2010,"A shy high school student who has led a very sheltered life becomes the target of bullies before she unleashes her wrath upon them. Spacek manages to make her character sympathetic, but she, like all the actors here, was in her late 20's, too old to be believable as a high school student. Laurie is hilariously over the top as Carrie's mother, a God-fearing woman. The special effects are cheesy. It's somewhat enjoyable if one treats it like a campy comedy, which it is unintentionally. The last 15 minutes unfolds in slow motion and drag on for about half an hour; perhaps De Palma did not shoot enough footage to meet the requisite running time.",Carrie

It is one of the scariest movie from the 70's. If it does not scary you. Then there are not to many movies that will. This is a great film. It is a must see.

66,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,5 June 2005,"An absorbing allegory about the effects of high school bullying, it is disguised as a horror film to allude to the horror of such mental anguish. The film manages to depict true emotional concerns involved with school life and ontological pressures even while juggling an overcoat of horror. Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek are the perfect choices for their roles, and the overall film is impressive on a cinematic level. The only quirk in the film is the typically horror genre ending, but that hardly can affect the effectiveness of this emotional drama. 'The Rage: Carrie 2' followed some 23 years later, however it is hardly worth a look.",Carrie

68,Rodrigo_Amaro,One of the most relevant horror films ever made,10,17 December 2010,"Based on Stephen King's novel, ""Carrie"" is a classic horror film directed by Brian DePalma and one of the greatest movies from the 1970's that still echoes in our minds and in the popular culture. If in many high school themed movies there's always a shy and lonely character who gets abused by everyone in the school and sometimes in the family we owe this characteristic to Carrie White, the main character played by Sissy Spacek. And if we sometimes identify with the tragedy of the character, with a possible chance for revenge the ones who are bad to us, you gotta recognize: you have a part of Carrie inside of you. I don't know how Stephen King idealized this story or his motivations but all I can say is that it works, it scares yet it makes you look at life with a different perspective. Carrie had a hard religious education at home with her mother (Piper Laurie, excellent) that looks more the devil himself than a woman who preaches the Gospel. And the teenage girl doesn't know how to behave herself during classes at school, or even taking a shower when she finally had her first period (a scene meant to be more dramatically sad than scary, except for the music) and she gets mocked by her colleagues all the time. The film evolves into a dramatic story but there's a catch. In the middle of the drama we find out that Carrie has special powers, she can move or break objects with the power of her mind, and that's something she can't control quite right and no one knows she has this ability. I'll won't spoil more things, I'm gonna let you see for yourself, but by this time you can possibly know what's the horror in this story.I must admit I had a total dislike over this film when I watched a few years ago; now I understand why it's an effective and powerful film, and why it was relevant in 1976 and still is today. DePalma released ""Carrie"" on the same year of many great classics whose major themes were ""We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!"". Carrie White is no different than Howard Beale (""Network""), Travis Bickle (""Taxi Driver""), Rocky Balboa (""Rocky"") and the Woodstein team (""All the President's Men""). Strange mixing of films some might think but if you look back to all these characters and their struggle to challenge everything and everyone, is quite similar from one to another. In the scene where Carrie stood up and says to her mother that she'll go the prom with a boy for the first time in her life you can see the exactly same thing when Howard Beale shouted the most famous movie quote of that year. Gladly all these films were great, and were recognized with nominations and awards, and survived to tell how the American society felt at that time, and ""Carrie"" even while being a horror movie knew how to be a important piece of filmmaking.As I mentioned in the beginning most films today has some qualities and characteristics that appeared here for the first time and the way DePalma presented the story was excellent, including homages to his idol Hitchcock (the music by Pino Donaggio reminds some parts of Bernard Herrmann's theme in ""Psycho"", and by the way Herrmann was the original composer of the music of the film but died a few months before the filming begin). Not only the music, but the editing is also great, and one of the most awaited moments is the prom night, there are thousand of things in that scene that keeps you thrilled all the time, no matter how many times you watch. And at last the great casting composed by Spacek, Laurie, John Travolta, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley, all wonderful. It's a very interesting horror film but more than that it is a historical study (in terms of film) over a period. 10/10",Carrie
69,zkonedog,Captures The Essence Of Why The Material Works,9,8 March 2017,"The ""Carrie"" story--originally penned by Stephen King--contained some of the most interesting and truly uncomfortable themes ever put to paper. For the most part, this film adaptation effectively captures those main points, especially when it comes to the titular character.For a very basic overview, ""Carrie"" sees high school student Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) undergo her first menstrual period in the gym class showers and be relentlessly mocked by the other girls for it. Having not been educated about ""those things"" due to her crazed, religious fundamentalist mother Margaret (Piper Laurie), Carrie struggles to understand what is happening to her. Not helping matters is how Carrie also begins to develop telekinesis, allowing her to move objects with her mind when her emotions get out of control. When fellow student Sue Snell (Amy Irving) gets boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom, a series of events transpire that are as tragic as they are horrific.First and foremost, ""Carrie"" works because it does the most important thing completely and utterly correct: it makes the viewer sympathize with young Carrie White. In order for the material here to work, one has to feel mortified for her in an almost visceral fashion. Spacek's performance is brilliant in that regard, rendering Carrie a sad figure, but not so sad as to be dismissed. Instead, she is someone you will desperately want to see succeed or gain some semblance of a life, making her continued tragedies all the more compelling.There are also so many interesting concepts floating around in the screenplay here, such as: religious mania, adolescent coming-of-age, parent/child struggles, and high school friendship. In other words, there is usually always ""something to think about"" in each scene. In that sense, I would never classify ""Carrie"" as a horror flick. It is far more drama/thriller by genre.About the only reason I can't give this film a full 10-star treatment is because director Brian de Palma whiffs on a key point of the overall narrative. This is most clearly seen towards the end of the film, when the major trauma inflicted upon Carrie is met--at least at first--with laughter. This seems a bit odd or out-of-place and is never really explained, whereas the source material does a much better job of conveying how Carrie is such a pitiable figure that only bursts of emotion such as anger/laughter can truly classify her persona.Overall, though, ""Carrie"" is a classic thriller filled with uncomfortable themes and acting performances that will move you. It is very much worthy of King's original work and will likely stand the test of time along side it.",Carrie
70,poe426,Seeing red...,7,21 July 2014,"CARRIE was perfect drive-in fare (which is where I saw it), and just happens to be Brian De Palma's best film to date (in my own, ever-humble opinion). Piper Laurie as Carrie's demented mother deserves mention, but it's Sissy Spacek as the title character who really steals the show: she's as convincing as an actress could be as the tormented teen and when she finally unleashes all of her pent-up frustrations, the screen quite literally runs red with blood. Another noteworthy scene is the one where she turns her mother into a pin-cushion: this was done way back before fx became the province of computer operators, and it was done very effectively.

71,eddie_baggins,A classic that stands the test of time,8,20 November 2013,"Upon watching Carrie for the very first time in today's modern age one wishes that it were possible to go back and witness the film in a packed cinema screening upon release for it would have been a grand and previously unseen experience, for Carrie is a film that feels ahead of it's time and stands the test of age to still be shocking and frightfully spot on in it's depiction of teenage isolation and discovery of oneself.Carrie needs no real introduction as many know the story of bullied social outcast Carrie White, played so well by the then 26 year old Sissy Spacek. Spacek will forever be known for her role in this picture and what a great feat to lay hold on as her performance in the film is so eerily spot on you almost forget that she in fact isn't Carrie. Other performers in the film also resonate with special mention to Piper Laurie as Carrie's god fearing and overbearing mother Margaret and Betty Buckley as Carrie's gym teacher Miss Collins. The film also features early performances from John Travolta as idiotic teen Billy Nolan and Nancy Allen as evil school girl Chris.Much of Carrie's success must be related back to director Brian De Palma who directs the film with that voyeuristic style that made him famous in films such as Dressed to Kill and Body Double. If a film were to open the way it does as with this original Carrie today it would lose none of it's downright creepy vibe and would remain just as controversial. De Palma sticks to his guns throughout the entire runtime and is aided by a now equally classic film score from Pino Donaggio giving the film a unique moody atmospheric feel.I have no idea why it took so long into my life to catch this original horror classic but I am glad I have before I partake eventually in the newly updated version with Chloe Grace Moretz. I can see already that the film will have a tough time justifying it's existence as Carrie is the quintessential version of the Stephen King story and a movie that still shocks as it did upon release.4 buckets of pig blood out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out: www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Carrie
72,johnnyboyz,Relentless and often tough film hybridising these ingredients of coming of age; family relations and high-school drama to really good effect..,7,2 February 2012,"It would be fair to say that the titular character in Brian De Palma's Carrie is in no way leading a ""normal"" life at the precious, delicate stage she is. True to theory, De Palma inter-cuts between two scenes encapsulating the varied natures of what might constitute as ordinary teen-aged behaviour with what it is that our lead must go through at precisely the same time. The two scenes see school bully Sue (Irving), and what appears to be a standard night OUT for her, placed up against a typical night IN for our Carrie, played with vulnerable relish by that of Sissy Spacek. Sue is of the young; athletic and confrontative sort. She sits beside boyfriend Billy upfront in the passenger seat as they cruise around in his car. They're in the middle of a sort of argument, but it's one of those squabbles which you know no matter how long it goes on, as long as it doesn't venture beyond a certain threshold of aggression, everything will remain sound by this time tomorrow. She's challenging him as they chug along when he raised the point that he'd quite like her to stop playfully insulting him, but she plugs away anyway.It's a scene demonstrating an exchange in power and an established dynamic between two characters being pulled and pushed back either way; a scene told alongside another that involves Carrie who's at home with her mother. Here is another instance involving a young girl bordering on the leaving of high school in which that person must engage in an established dynamic built on further exchanges of power, only this time with an icy and thoroughly religious woman whose idea of 'saving' Carrie is to stilt her growing out of childhood. Neither instance is necessarily that constructive in their overall breakdown, but I would take a guess that the one involving Sue and Billy best represents how 'typical' young women might be spending their evenings. Oh, to be able to engage in a natural back-and-forth whilst out and about in the side seat of a friend's car wherein you challenge the dominant force of a partner rather than remain shut away inside with that of an equal force engaging in strict mealtime processions and being forced into reading the bible whilst locked in a closet.Carrie's lives in America and attends a high-school with many other girls of her age, most of whom bully; berate and wind her up. The volleyball match opening the film suggests good, healthy competition amidst the girls - competitors go for shots and clearly enjoy the physical activity to De Palma's applied slow motion. The reality is quite the opposite when we reach the girl at the back in the corner doing her best to stay away from the action; it is Carrie and alas, one of the members on the other team no doubt spots the weak spot in Carrie's team's makeup in so much she provides her with something to do: specifically, make the crucial shot on match point. She blows it and the ugly scenes as Carrie is 'comiserated' by her teammates alludes to the bigger picture.Not so far away is Carrie's mother Margaret (Laurie), a preacher who goes from door to door attempting to spread her religious musings in a way which is at once all of enthusiastic and quite maddening. One occasion sees her turned away by those whom own the house she has just called upon, and we note how pleased they are to be rid of her. The film does not linger with this family and their, in comparison rather perfect, set up nor further detail them much. Instead, we track home with the fanatic and to her domestic situation; Carrie's school day in mind, one could feasibly say that it is the more pleasant-a half of her daily existence as when she gets home to her lone mother, things are cranked up a notch. De Palma utilises the incoming end of school prom night dance as a looming deadline, in turn transforming everything into a shrill, and at times agonised, low level drama which happens to mutate into domains of the uncanny when great levels of frustration and anger boil up.The film is essentially one big build up to the prank-of-all-pranks that the bullies, lead by the aforementioned Sue and her partner Billy, who himself isn't shy of getting stuck into a hair-raising situation when we observe him out drinking and driving at once with the verbal confirmation that police cars are buzzing around, aim to play on Carrie at the end of school dance. Prior to all of this, the film shoots Carrie purchasing a dress for the special evening to the same music that accompanied the rest of the girls engaging in gym class; a series of exercises making light of their sexuality to highly suggestive musical overtures. Carrie is unsure of the prom and unsure that she has the ability to share such a realm with that of the 'other' girls, but the use of the musical track as she attempts to burrow her way onto a level playing surface following one boy's asking of her to the dance suggests she is approaching achieving otherwise. In spite of its reputation and what it is people either predominantly know or remember it for, the film is a low-level American town character drama more than anything else and works really well to that degree and is something most certainly worth checking out.",Carrie
73,filipemanuelneto,"A classic, in its own right.",9,31 October 2020,"A few years ago, I saw the modern remake of this same film. Now it's finally time for this one, which I just saw a few minutes ago. Made in 1976, the film became a classic and has survived the test of time. In fact, I would say that it is one of those old horror films that any fan of the genre must see.I will not go on too long to describe the story, I think it is well known. It was inspired by an original Stephen King novel (according to the information available here, the writer really liked this film, and even considered the ending to be better than the one he had originally written), tells the story of Carrie White, a young teenager who is extremely naive and who has lived all her life under the supervision of her mother, overprotective and religious fanatic, obsessed with the sin of the flesh and the weakness of the female sex. She is the target of mockery from schoolmates and it gets worse after she panics with her first menstruation, in the gym locker room. She simply knew nothing about her own body and sexuality because the mother was sure that a sinless woman (as her daughter had to be) would never be ""tainted"" by the blood that, for her, was the mark of Eva's original sin. Well, things get worse from there, with Carrie discovering that she has telekinetic powers amplified by fear or anger, and an anthological ending in a prom that goes terribly wrong.The secret to the success of this film is largely due to the main character. For us, it is clear that Carrie is a victim: victim of a wicked and crazy mother who mistreats her and carries on a permanent psychological terror; victim of cynical and selfish schoolmates who never think of the reasons why she behaves that way and never give her a chance to integrate; and finally victim of an extremely rare mental power that she doesn't know well or know how to control. Carrie is never truly a bad person or a wicked being. She has no pleasure in the pain of others, she is the one who is suffering. It moves us, it causes a strong empathy with the character, which we would like to help. The way it all ends seems filled with a poetic justice that also satisfies us, despite feeling for Carrie, and seeing that she will never be understood by anyone.Sissy Spacek was extraordinary in her work and obtained, in this film, her great work as an actress. Despite continuing and making other films, it is Carrie who immortalizes Spacek and makes her memorable. She gave the character a lot of psychological depth and drama, as well as having the strength for some nude scenes so brutal, due to their harshness, that other actresses with more experience would surely refuse them without thinking twice. The film also features the participation of Piper Laurie (in the role of Carrie's mother), Amy Irving and John Travolta.Directed by Brian De Palma, a director recognized for his meticulous spirit and attention to detail, its a film with good production values and an excellent pace, with time for everything, without haste or speed. Cinematography deserves a close look with a series of truly successful moments, from the use of colors (white and red, as at the prom) to the work of the camera (the scenes at the prom, the kaleidoscope, the punctual resource to division of the screen), everything was extremely thought out and done with great care. For more than one occasion, the film ""blinks the eye"" to Hitchcock, the most evident feature being the famous sound effect of the film ""Psycho"", used here by De Palma. The sound, visual and special effects worked perfectly, even though the fire in the house, at the end of the film, makes it quite evident that the house is a miniature and not a real building, all it takes is a certain sense of scale. The costumes also deserve applause, they fit perfectly into the big picture. The soundtrack, by Pino Donaggio, is one of the most beautiful in classic horror cinema. Truly a magnificent melody that is in the ear.",Carrie
74,TheMovieDiorama,Carrie hosts possibly the most memorable prom scene in Hollywood's history.,8,11 June 2018,"If you haven't seen it, then you've atleast heard of it. The moment a timid innocent girl is titled prom queen before she causes catastrophic chaos nearly wiping out her entire year group. Best. Prom. Ever. Glitzy sequin dresses aside, there are subtle subtextual layers that really elevates this supernatural horror into classic status. A shy bullied girl named Carrie White is invited to prom, however she soon discovers that she has the power of telekinesis. The coming-of-age tropes outweigh the horror elements, granted there are scenes of gore and supernatural violence but these are incredibly dated now. It's how Carrie evolves as a young girl that truly captivates. Her first period, dealing with her fanatical religious mother and overcoming bullying, for its 98 minute runtime you see Carrie rapidly evolve as a character. The religious allegories that are presented, Carrie and her mother depicting Satan and Jesus respectively, works well the themes of maturity and motherhood. It's a spellbinding human portrait, expertly directed by De Palma. That prom scene was nothing short of genius. The five minute rotational dance sequence, the over excessive slow motion, cross cuts and excellent use of props. The whole narrative built up to that final act, and it did so with bravura. Spacek gave an expressive performance, intelligently using her eyes to capture the fury and anger within Carrie. But it's Laurie who steals the show, professing her adoration for God and repenting her sins by abusing Carrie. Their final scene together was poetic. Cohen's screenplay surprisingly embeds tongue-in-cheek humour, particularly with the character of Miss Collins, making the first act feel more like a teen high school film. The sudden shift in tone later on felt seamless. De Palma did use some detractors, his utilisation of slow motion stretched out the prom scene substantially yet adding nothing. Also further exploration into the motherly bond with Carrie would've made for a more sinister turn at the end. However this still remains a supernatural classic.",Carrie
75,Tweetienator,Blood Speaks,8,7 December 2018,"Carrie is like Shining another masterpiece of the horror genre and both those movies have something in common: they are based on a work by Stephen King, and last but not least, they belong to the rather thin line of outstanding to well-made movie-adaptions of Mr. King's work.What else!? The director is Brian De Palma (well done!) and Sissy Spacek plays Carrie outstanding and most memorable. The iconic scene where she is covered in blood and pure terror/madness shows on her face I will never forget.Belongs on the must-watch list of every guy and gal and whatever who wants to be taken seriously as a lover of the arts of horror.p.s. the remake (2013) with Chloë Grace Moretz in lead is not a bad one (my rate a 6), but can't beat the original.

78,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The imagery of ""Carrie"" will stay with you despite its imperfections",7,3 October 2012,"Everything that makes high school an evil, evil place comes to the forefront in ""Carrie,"" or at least all the worst possible combinations of things that could literally make high school hell. Brian De Palma brings Stephen King's first novel to life as part coming-of-age drama, part obnoxious high school movie and part horror film in a way that's at times messy, but visually lasting and highly memorable.Unexpectedly, the film's title sequence takes place in a girls locker room where we get a barrage of full-frontal nudity followed by star Sissy Spacek erotically soaping herself in the shower and discovering that she's bleeding for the first time. The sudden change in tone sets the expectation for the shock factor that pervades the rest of the film, and De Palma portrays Carrie's consequent freak out and the subsequent bullying she endures from her peers with a certain surreal turbulence that will also make repeat appearance.Carrie has it rough. In addition to being bullied at school, her mother (Piper Laurie) is a religious nut who abuses her regularly, forcing her into a ""prayer closet"" for sins she hasn't committed. To complicate matters, she's started to develop telekinetic abilities. All this starts to set the perfect storm in motion for Carrie to completely lose it.Amazing, then, that despite all the foreboding, De Palma convinces us at times that things are looking up for Carrie. When one of the girls who bullied Carrie in the shower, Sue (Amy Irving), has a change of heart and convinces her prom date, Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom instead, it seems like misguided and disingenuous help, but over time we come to believe Tommy sees Carrie in a new light. Suddenly things are looking up, even though we know that Chris (Nancy Allen), the girl still bitter about being punished for tormenting Carrie, has a nasty surprise in store for her that will quickly change things.In the script, we lose Carrie at times for these lesser supporting roles, including Chris' boy toy played by John Travolta right before ""Saturday Night Fever"" launched him to fame. Carrie is prime for a cinematic character study, but the film doesn't go in that direction nearly enough. As such, Carrie becomes the object of pity instead of empathy. And her mother simply acts like a zealot, so by the time we finally start to understand her, it's too late.It's a stretch to call ""Carrie"" a horror film; most of it is an exercise in effective foreshadow because we know all these circumstances will lead to something bad, but not until the end does it get a bit gruesome (though not nearly gruesome enough). Even so, the images are more creepy than terrifying. De Palma doesn't scare us so much as shock us with images we won't soon forget. There's a reason that to this day, everyone talks about the prom scene in ""Carrie.""Spacek also has an important role to play in the memorability of the film. Her performance certainly works as a sheltered girl dominated by her mother and shunned by her peers, but her looks contribute immensely to the story. With bug eyes and prominent cheekbones, she looks a little strange and plenty weird, but as she transforms herself for prom, she pulls a 180 that makes the final act's flip of the switch eerily effective.The whirlwind ending to the film will leave a sour taste for some viewers looking for more answers or definitive resolution. There's a religious connection implied in these final scenes that distracts a bit from what King did well with ""Carrie,"" and that's serve as a cautionary tale. At the least, you might think twice before picking on the loner, or at least regret whenever you did.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",Carrie

81,jzappa,Even the Sharpest and Most Vicious Revenge Films Can Still Not Feel Like Enough,8,26 September 2006,"Carrie is one of Brian De Palma's greatest achievements, because his sequences of suspense are some of the most tense and gripping and teeth-gritting that I've ever seen. I think he spends a little too much time on prolonged, embellished sequences of lush shots of Sissy Spacek's body as well as a few others, but his suspense evens it out.I just wish Carrie's final breaking point where she uses her telekinesis to slaughter all of those who hazed, humiliated, and devastated her was as prolonged as his almost aggravatingly wanton opening shower scene or the walk through her house near the end, or other scenes of that nature. Why, in a film about vicious unleashing of cold, hellish vengeance and wrath on the meanest possible people who play the meanest prank or con or sham I've ever seen on film does the rising action have to be so overlong and without an at least minimally violent forewarning and why does the pay-off have to be so short and to- the-point?Really! What's wrong with that scene of almost orgasmic wrath upon the people at the prom being fifteen minutes long, focusing in on each and every person who has in the film specifically picked on her and their brutal deaths? Nancy Allen's gabby friend cracking up at the dousing of the pig's blood simply being hosed down? Why was she not hosed so hard that she was elevated with such force from the house against the wall that she started vomiting blood or dying of suffocation? The snobby, immature teacher who made cruel fun of Carrie's comment in class being electrocuted for, what, six or seven seconds? How about being fried to the point of his skin turning to a crisp? And especially Nancy Allen and John Travolta! The cruelest and most unbelievable vicious characters in the movie just get blown up in their car?! They seriously should have been turned over in their car by Carrie's telekinetic powers, yes, but the car should of just caught aflame, which should've slowly engulfed the car as Carrie uses her mind to crush the car into a smaller, tighter place where there is no escape, so that the two evil people are forced to watch Carrie's saucer-sized eyes of retribution as they slowly burn to death in a cramped space with broken bones? And Carrie's mother should've been crucified with even more knives. Even more, yes. Even one in her eye.Carrie deserves the cruelest, most inhuman revenge ever heard of up till 1976. Why not?! The whole movie up until her breaking point is about her horrible suffering and being sheltered in a terrible psychologically debilitating way by her mother. The audience deserves more than what they get in the climax. The movie is great, and the revenge is sweet, but if only it could've been a little more.Whether you like the film itself or not, you should at least admire Pino Donaggio's wonderful score. It's fantastic and works beautifully.",Carrie

Made in 1976, Sissy Spacek the beautiful redhead from Texas, plays the title character hands down! The girls' locker room scene was just the beginning of teenage boys' ""wet dreams"". The showers, the dressing, and the late period Carrie gets that gets her all freaked out. I know she looks like your common outcast. However, hanging with people who ostracize her is a mistake anyone would make. She took care of that little bike brat who shouts ""Crazy Carrie, crazy Carrie!"" She should have popped his bike tires with her mind. Then there's the memorable prom scene. ""Dirty pillows"" are breasts and the mother was all high and mighty, and full of you know what!

Her mother's failings placed directly on the child's head; everything the mother went through; every failure, every weakness, blamed on the child. ""Satan will take you away just like he took your father!"" ""Oh, Mama! Everybody KNOWS he left with another woman!""The scene where Carrie is dragged into the closet and locked inside by her mother is quite dramatic. It actually looks as though Carrie is being PULLED by her hair! It is also typical of a household in that precarious situation; living on donations made by those who'd rather pay money than listen to the zealot drone on.The effects were quite nice, but the religious connotations of the movie really just bash you in the head until you're in danger of a coma.Other than Sissy (Carrie)'s performance, the acting was stiff, the teenagers were portrayed by people closer to 30 and the movie really wasn't all that.For a compelling and faithful version of this movie, see the Made4TV remake with Angela Bettis.

As long as Mr. King continues to right, someone will always try to adapt his novels or stories for either the silver or small screen. This film not only made King's career but it launched a plethora of knock-offs.

86,freemantle_uk,A loose adaptation,7,8 September 2013,"Carrie was Stephen King's first novel and easily considered one of his best. When it became a hit a film adaptation was practically inevitable. Carrie is considered one of the most important horror films of the 70s.Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is an isolated high school student with no friends and a fundamentalist Christian mum, Margaret (Piper Laurie). After being humiliated when she gets her first period in the school shower her telekinetic powers start to develop and heighten when under stress. Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty due to the incident in the shower where she joined in with mob and wants to make it up to Carrie by getting her boyfriend, Tommy (William Katt) to take Carrie to the prom. But the lead bully, Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) wants revenge against Carrie, blaming her for not letting her go to the prom and with her delinquent boyfriend, Billy (John Travolta) plan to humiliate Carrie in the most public and sadistic way possible.Carrie is an excellent novel, a short, taut little affair that is a breeze of a read. Some of the elements from the novel would have been hard to translate into because of the structure of the novel: mainly the extracts from the White Commission, The Shadow Exploded and Sue Snell's diary. Other scenes were cut because of expense, i.e. the explosion of the petrol station. But this is an adaptation that does make some big changes and cuts from the novel. Some include not getting to see Chris' father threatening to sue and ends up seeing what his daughter really is, cutting out Sue's pregnancy to small things like Carrie saying her father left her mother instead of dying in an industrial accident. Plus the sociological elements were cut out, looking at the impact of the aftermath of the Carrie incident which I thought was some of the most interesting stuff in the novel.The big positive with the film is the casting of Spacek: she was a terrific as Carrie, having the right look for seemingly being a little weird but have a unique beauty when she is at the prom. She was able to convey the shy, awkwardness of a character who is beaten emotionally at home and at school and shows a psychopathic rage with the look with her eyes when the pigs blood fell on her. The rest of the cast were solid, like Allen playing the bitchy, self-centred bully, Travolta as the abusive boyfriend, Katt and Irving as the high school students who want to do the right thing. Betty Buckley was excellent as the friendly teacher who wants to support and protect Carrie and Laurie did a good job as Carrie's fundamentalist mother. But Sydney Lassick was really hammy and out of place as an English teacher who wasn't even in the book.The big highlight of the film was the prom scene when the pig's blood felt on Carrie goes into a psychopathic rage, locking the doors with her mind and sets out killing everyone. Director Brian De Palma was able highlight the build-up and the tension and then the terror of Carrie's killing. De Palma was able to make the sequence with a unique style using split screens to show different actions happening at the same time and De Palma used silences, making us lip-read what people are saying (though it is very obvious). It is excellent sequence.During the film they are plenty of musical cues when Carrie using her powers, partly due to the limits of special effects, but sometimes the violin streaks from Psycho which was a distraction.Carrie is a very well-acted film that had some stand out sequences and excellent acting, but it is too loose of an adaptation for me.",Carrie

That is quite a powerful way to start. For most of its running time Carrie does play as a teenage, school drama - Carrie is relentlessly bullied by both her school peers and by her religiously fanatical mother. It is a very sad tale. Carrie possesses powerful telekinetic powers and in the infamous Prom scene, where she is cruelly humiliated in front of the school, she unleashes these to devastating effect. Awesome! But her revenge doesn't end there!
I remember watching Carrie for the first time in the 1980' on TV, I nearly crapped my pants!! Having just watched it again it no longer has that effect, I assume that's because I'm older and know what to expect. Carrie is a brilliant film, one of the standout horror movies of the second half of the 1970's. Naturally it does look dated. The disco music is still pretty groovy, but the split screens look a tad naff now. It's quite behind with the times, John Travolta slapping his girlfriend around her face is seriously NOT cool! I liked the cinematography and de Palma is a great director, but there was no need for him to rip the famous Psycho shower scene music.

Hence, ""Carrie"" looks and feels less a horror movie and more a teen-drama. Style filmmaker Brian De Palma directs ""Carrie,"" an adaptation of the Stephen King novel (King's first work to be adapted into a movie), and thus one of the scariest movies of the genre.As Carrie White, Spacek seems a natural. Our feelings for her are genuine, especially since as the film opens, she has her first period while in the girl's locker room and panics at the sight of her own blood. Because her mother (Piper Laurie) has burdened her down with a whole bunch of religious nonsense, Carrie just has no idea about how to react to a natural bodily function.The incident also brings about something else in Carrie: she realizes that she has psychic powers, which she then uses against her tormentors, including her mother and classmates Chris (Nancy Allen) and Norma (P.J. Soles), and Chris's boyfriend Billy (John Travolta). It all boils down to a blood-drenched, special effects-laden climax at the school prom.There are others who care for Carrie: a fellow classmate named Sue (Amy Irving), her friend Tommy Ross (golden boy William Katt), and a sympathetic gym teacher (Betty Buckley). But the constant torment of her enemies leaves Carrie no choice but to do the unthinkable on a night where everybody is supposed to be happy.""Carrie"" was made before the slasher madness of ""Halloween"" (1978), its sequels, and the many knock-offs. So in this sense, ""Carrie"" seems to be a stand-alone picture. As stated earlier, the bloodbath at the end is so unexpected in a movie that was building up into a touching teen story. Such effects-laden sequences come as a surprise and are indeed frightening to watch.Spacek is wonderful, generating the emotional depth required for her character. Since she just celebrated her 57th birthday yesterday, why not give ""Carrie"" another chance in some other media format to mark its 30th anniversary? I've read that Stephen King doesn't particularly care for the movie adaptation of his first hit; I find it hard to believe he's truly upset with the finished product. But ""Carrie"" is a true classic of the genre, one of the first of the best.10/10",Carrie

91,kevin_robbins,This is a smart masterpiece that is a classic,10,23 October 2021,"Carrie (1976) is in my personal DVD collection and also available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a sheltered young lady with her over religious mother. The young lady has a unique power to move things with her mind that only further confuses her. When people start bullying her at school, and her mother pushes her to the brink, Carrie is about to burst. This movie is directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface) and stars Sissy Spacek (The Help), Piper Laurie (The Faulty), John Travolta (Grease), Nancy Allen (Robocop), William Katt (House) and Sydney Lassick (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). The dynamics of this film are so well told - but my favorite premise is how parents can really set up children to have no chance by over pressing their beliefs on them. We've all likely known people like that. The cruelty of children is really well depicted but this film goes way out of its way to really establish every character, top to bottom. The circumstances are brilliantly told and Carrie's naiveness are brilliantly depicted by Spacek. Laurie played the mother perfectly and I was literally scared of her from beginning to end and never could have imagined myself in Carries shoes. The setting and backdrops are very well depicted also, that Jesus statue was super creepy...and how could you not grade a movie 10/10 when the first scene is a shower scene? 😂 Overall this is a smart masterpiece that is a classic. As referenced, an easy 10/10.",Carrie
92,GiraffeDoor,There isn't a movie quite like it.,7,27 May 2019,"A rather campy and hysterical horror of a kind they wouldn't make now, probably for good reason.But the resulting uniqueness in its style makes it a strangely disquieting if unsubtle experience.It's hard not to fall in love with Jolie Laide, Carrie and the plot gives every clue we are going someplace terrible without getting macabre till toward the end.Not always dignified; Carries mother is a laugh and at one point they actually fast forward the footage.But it is enchanting and hypnotic. While James Wan shows us a monster and then has us trying to escape it as if it were a Spielberg Movie, this is post-tonal recount of an unfortunate situation that turned into a nightmare.",Carrie
93,iquine,Not a Very Enjoyable Prom Night,7,27 August 2019,"(Flash Review)Carrie, a heavily sheltered high school girl who is a social outcast and often bullied gets asked to the prom by the popular guy (a spitting image of Robert Plant) initially as a gag. Only problem is her mother is a religious extremist and refuses to let her have friends, let alone a prom date, part because she knows her daughter has a special power. So, how will prom go? Will the guy be a true gentleman? Will the bullying continue? Will people witness Carrie's special power? This is full ubiquitous 'Hitckockian' fright screeches and slowly builds to some memorable intensity. There was enough meat on the bone to carry the story but some parts could have been more strongly developed and the cinematography was lackluster.",Carrie
94,mattkratz,scary,8,18 February 2007,"This review might contain a spoiler.This was a really good adaptation of the Stephen King novel, and it has earned the term ""classic."" The final scenes were the scariest and the best, as Carrie unleashes her powers and gets her revenge. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were perfect for their roles, with Sissy as the tormented Carrie and Piper as her religious fanatic mother. Carrie was tormented both at school by the cruel other girls and at home by her religious fanatic mother, and when she is finally pushed over the edge, she really gets her revenge. I think this was a great film, and I highly recommend it. It was well cast, well written, and well acted. It will remind you of what you felt like doing when you were tormented in high school.*** out of ****",Carrie
95,jimbo-53-186511,"Some very strong scenes, but as a whole Carrie isn't entirely successful",6,16 August 2015,"Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a shy 17 year old girl who is bullied by her classmates for being a bit weird. This situation is exacerbated when she has her first period whilst showering at school. Out of the blue, Carrie discovers that she has telekinetic powers and is intent on using these powers to get revenge on those that are bullying her.For me, Stephen King adaptations have always been a bit hit and miss and interestingly Carrie falls somewhere in the middle. Like other King adaptations such as Christine and Cujo, Carrie essentially is one long build up to the eventual crux of the story which takes place at the prom. Unfortunately, if you're going to set the story up in this way then you need to make sure that there are two key ingredients; a really strong pay-off or an involving story between point A and point B and again Carrie only partly succeeds in both areas...What lets this film down slightly is that for the bulk of its running time it doesn't really explore Carrie's telekinesis particularly well. The majority of the run time seems to be spent on all the pretty people discussing the prom night. The side characters are rather bland and for me got a little too much focus. Thankfully some scenes are very effective throughout the middle of the film (most notably the scenes between Carrie and her mother - wonderfully portrayed by Piper Laurie). Whilst watching this film, it's very easy to feel for Carrie as a person as she not only has to deal with a gang of bullies at school, but she then goes home to her barmy mother who is some kind of religious nut. In some ways, I felt Carrie deliberately ostracised herself from everyone else for fear of bringing friends home. Reading between the lines, I suspect that there was definitely something of a 'daughter doesn't need any friends other than her mother' scenario with Carrie and her mother.The moment where Carrie starts to unleash hell at the prom is very good and this is mostly down to Spacek looking so damn creepy. The problem again is that the build up to this moment was far too drawn out. I'm all for suspenseful build ups, but if you leave it too long you're in danger of losing your audience. I kept thinking to myself 'Oh just bloody get on with it'. The film ends quite strongly, but again is it good enough to make up for its shortcomings? Yeah I'd say it just about does enough to make it worthwhile.As far as performances go then many may see Spacek as the star of the show and yes she was very good, but for me it was Piper Laurie that was the best thing about this film. She was a joy to watch here and her character did genuinely unnerve me slightly. Some of the other characters are rather bland particularly Travolta who shows his face a couple of times and collects his pay cheque.Carrie is a passable and watchable film, but it's very uneven and whilst it's effective at times, many scenes that don't focus on Carrie and/or her mother are quite tedious. It's certainly not bad, but a classic? I don't think so.",Carrie
96,Nazi_Fighter_David,"""Carrie"" marked Brian De Palma's breakthrough",8,3 August 2008,"It is a classic offbeat horror-melodrama merging harmoniously the family Gothic extravaganza, supernatural power, and a woman's movie of a peculiar kind It remains the cinema's best adaptation of a Stephen King novel The film initiated De Palma's inclination for surprise diverts between playful imagination and reality, as in the opening, which swifts from a soft-core porn fantasia of girls taking a shower in the locker room to the fact of Carrie's menstruation for the first timethe first sign of ""otherness"" that will reserve her as an horrifying monster from her small-minded colleagues All the oppression that Carrie undergoes both at home (with a bible beating maniacal mother played by scary Piper Laurie who develops twisted bizarre ideas) and at school to suppress tension which takes the shape of super telekinetic power, the ability to move objects with the strength of her mind We observe with ambivalence as Carrie's insatiable revenge jumps the line into uncontrolled mass murders ever filmed Sissy Spacek is amazing as the mocked, helpless girl pushed over the edge Her face and body twist like a living special effect to unleash her pent up rage, as well as her character's alarming progress from painfully shy high-school teenager to Angel of Vengeance",Carrie
97,smatysia,"A pretty good film, with a few caveats",7,27 June 2020,"A pretty good film, with a few caveats. Sissy Spacek was fantastic in her role. It seems that the filmmakers purposely made her look as unattractive as possible. Nancy Allen was good as the villain, as were Amy Irving and P. J. Soles. Most of the cast, however, looked too old to be in high school, a flaw found in many, many films set there.I was in high school at this time (1976) and a lot of the scenes don't really ring true. But my school was in a suburb of a large city, rather than a small town, and our proms weren't held at the school, but in hotel ballrooms miles away.Anyway, I had read the book long ago, but never seen the movie until now. Stephen King makes every scene seem perfectly rendered on the page. This adaptation was pretty good, but I did find de Palma's direction a bit annoying at times.",Carrie
98,Foreverisacastironmess123,Carrie and the prom.,10,31 October 2015,"To me this brilliant classic is one of the very-most defining viewing experiences of the entire horror genre. It's one that grabs you right from the beginning and doesn't let go, and it leaves an effect that is profoundly disturbing. Not due to any grotesque shock value, but by emotion. Maybe even more so than in any other horror movie that I've ever seen, it has such a tremendous depth of emotion. The tone is always dead on and perfect and it can really can make you feel whatever it's setting out to. Watching it recently, it made me think about what actually makes a horror movie just that. Most of it plays out like a tense drama with a strange darkness to it, one that really dives into grim horror as it nears its bitter end. It's a real mixture of tones, and thankfully a very effective one. The score itself works like a character and is a huge part of the film's enduring appeal. I mean what fan ever thinks of this picture and doesn't also automatically think of that iconic music? You don't even have to say to someone ""Think of the music of Carrie"", you can just say ""Think of Carrie"" and that achingly poignant theme will pop into someone's head, and that's one of the biggest compliments you could ever give a score. Can't believe they've attempted to remake this twice, give it up fools! Try to think up your own damn ideas, you will never surpass the original, your reboots deserved to flop. In my opinion it's the chemistry and combined performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie that truly drive this film and make it so very exceptional. Carrie is such an innocent pure and fragile waif of a girl who happens to possess a very dangerous special gift, and you really feel that she's been through hell. It may sound cold but all my sympathy lies with her for all that she goes through and how she ends up, becoming a figure of nightmare, a 'devil', it's almost as though her mother has won. And Piper Laurie, wow! She cuts such an imposing and commanding woman. Her face had such a kind, almost saintly glow to it. You'd never know what a monster she was. And I'd say she was, because she kept her own daughter's womanhood completely unknown to her and never told her what to expect, and when she does come home traumatised from the humiliating ordeal she declares it a sin and locks Carrie up in the closet with the terrifying idol of Christ. She uses her own twisted religion as an excuse to treat her daughter so poorly, no wonder that she winds up ironically getting crucified by her. The magnificent prom sequence is dazzlingly shot and choreographed. It plays out like delicate glass that shatters with the fateful splattering of the pig's blood... Absolutely phenomenal and flawless buildup and payoff. After all that it's so heartbreaking to watch, all of her hopes and dreams for a normal life are literally in ashes, and she has nowhere to go and no one to turn to except an insane mother who stabs her in the back. That final scene still gives me a chill to this day. The way the rock tumbles out of the way as the bloody arm lashes out and grabs onto the guilt-ridden Sue. Sheer brilliance, it's one legendary jump-scare of an ending that leaves a haunting memory... So moving, horrific, and tragic, and just plain overall a masterful horror film. I always did love it very much, thank you. ""I pray you find Jesus!""",Carrie
99,dwpollar,Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate...,9,10 December 2006,"1st watched 12/10/2006 - 9 out of 10(Dir- Brian DePalma): Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate that followed. Brian DePalma does an excellent job of building up the suspense leading up to the prom thru slow motion, split camera effects, music, brilliant close-up shots and excellent direction even when you know what the final outcome is going to be. This movie started a series of Stephen King efforts brought to the big screen but for me the real star was the director. No other modern director could have done what DePalma did with this material, in my opinion. The movie is about an oppressed young girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who is made fun of because of her inability to fit in with those around her. Most of the problem is because of her bible-toting overbearing mother who chooses to close her eyes to the real world and blame everything on sin and the devil. Carrie, as she is known in the movie, in the meantime is starting to discover her telekinetic powers and is physically becoming a woman as well(which is seen by all in the famous shower scene that opens the movie). A few folks at her school are on her side and try to bring something positive in her life by hooking her up on a date to the prom. The problem is that others are scheming to setup a disaster but are unaware of Carrie's abilities to take revenge upon them. The rest of the movie, I'm going to leave up to you to see. Again, DePalma masterfully hooks us thru excellent characterizations, story and build-up in what I consider one of the best movies of this kind ever made.",Carrie

One of the things about this movie that made me feel bad was that Carrie (Sissy Spacek) got picked on. You poor thing. I felt good when Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) told Chris (Nancy Allen), ""You're out of the prom, Hargensen!"" I really didn't like Chris. This was because she treated Carrie like dirt and acted snobby, especially every time she picked on Carrie. My favorite character, of course, was Carrie. The prom was one of my favorite parts of this movie. I thought that Carrie looked very beautiful in the prom dress she wore. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to all you Sissy Spacek fans who have not seen it.",Carrie
101,drownnnsoda,A Classic That's Not For All Tastes.,10,14 May 2006,"""Carrie"" is not your average horror story, so I'm warning those who haven't seen this and expect it to be some all-out horror film full of gore, because ""Carrie"" is quite different. It's more like a teenage drama-turned horror flick when the last thirty minutes come along.The film follows the basic story of the book, with a little bit of changes here and there, some things excluded. Carrie White is a nerdy teenage girl who is tormented by her high school peers. On top of that, she has a fanatical religious mother, who comes off more as crazy then holy. Carrie begins to realize she has a special power - if she concentrates enough, she can move objects with her mind. This is called ""telekenesis"". As prom nears, a girl named Sue Snell convinces her boyfriend to take Carrie to prom, to try and make up for a cruel incident that took place in the girl's locker room. But there are Chris Hargensen and her boyfriend, Tommy, have plans to turn Carrie's magical night into a night of horror - which turns out to be a night of horror for the entire student body.The acting here is great, Sissy Spacek is wonderful and Piper Laurie, who plays her mother, does a very good job at being genuinely scary. I saw this film at a young age and that image of Carrie's mother with the butcher knife still haunts me to this day. The whole sequence is scary, the creepy score accents Laurie's crazed performance. Sissy Spacek really garners some genuine pathos here, living the sheltered life with her religious fanatic mother, all of the girls at school treating her like an animal. I felt bad for her throughout the whole movie, even after she killed the whole prom. She suffers throughout the whole movie, so you really feel bad for her. ""Carrie"" is not a horror film for everyone. The majority of the film is more like a teenage drama, focusing on an outcast high school girl. But as tension builds in the film, in the last 30 minutes, all hell breaks loose. So if you aren't a fan of slow-building horror films, then you probably won't enjoy this. But for those who do, this is a classic. 10/10.",Carrie

105,gcd70,Hammy Horror,5,17 February 2008,"Stephen King's early novel about the telekinetic Carrie White would I'm sure have been a most eerie, spine-tingling tale about an outcast young girl who found she had the ability to move things purely by the power of her will. In the hands of Brian De Palma (ever the inconsistent director, with as many hits as flops to his credit) it comes out as rather an unscary, hammy horror that will struggle to frighten anybody over the age of fifteen (or even twelve).Some scenes, which would have been chillingly effective in King's novel, are certainly well handled by De Palma (such as the 'discovery of the plot' scene), while others are completely hopeless, including the ridiculous finale which totally ruins the whole film and any mood that De Palma had managed to set.As ugly duckling Carrie White, Sissy Spacek does a splendid job, in a role she seemed to be born for. Both Sissy and Piper Laurie garnered Oscar nominations, the latter for a most effective performance as Carrie's disturbed and obsessive mother. Amy Irving, as the girl with a conscience, and Nancy Allen, as the girl with no conscience, both give convincing turns, while Betty Buckley is strong as the vigilante gym teacher who attempts to help and befriend Carrie. John Travolta's meat-head boyfriend gets nothing to do, while William Katt just smiles and looks cute with his blonde curls and dimples (he had to wait for ""The Greatest American Hero"" to rescue him from roles such as this). In fact, all the plum roles and strong acting belong to the girls in this one.Thursday, July 13, 1995 - Video",Carrie
106,Witchfinder-General-666,Hell Hath No Fury Like an Innocent Teenage Girl!,9,7 November 2009,"The work of Stephen King has brought to cinema with various adaptations, including some very great ones. Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" of 1976 is the first adaptation ever made of a King novel, and it is doubtlessly also one of the greatest. The pairing of Stephen King and Brian De Palma truly has outstanding results as De Palma perfectly understands how to turn the creepiness of King's novel into a spine-chilling, thrilling and even very moving film. This disturbing, very creepy and in some parts genuinely terrifying film is a true classic of 70s cinema that is not only a must-see for my fellow Horror fans, but that no lover of film should consider missing.***SPOILERS!*** The eponymous Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a disturbed teenage girl, and outsider with certain telekinetic powers. She suffers both from her religious fanatic mother (brilliantly portrayed by Piper Laurie), who regards her powers as the work of the devil, and the malice of her schoolmates who constantly bully her. One day she is pushed too far... This film deserves great praise for many of its aspects, starting with the performances: Sissy Spacek is phenomenal in the eponymous lead. There are few other characters in Horror films that we will feel as much sympathy and compassion for as it is the case with Carrie. Carrie transforms from a disturbed, bullied victim to a stunning innocent beauty and, then, to the terrifying wrath unleashed upon her victimizers. Spacek is brilliant in all facets of the role, her performance simply cannot be praised enough. Great praise also goes to Piper Laurie who is truly diabolical as the devil-fearing, ultra-religious mother. Memorable supporting performances include the cute young P.J. Soles, who plays the girl who wants to help Carrie, Nancy Allen as a truly malignant bitch, and Betty Buckley as the PE teacher. John Travolta can be seen in an early role. In typical De Palma fashion, the cinematography is brilliantly done. De Palma's direction has to be applauded both for the film's visual greatness and the great manner in which suspense is built up in this film. Though the mood of the film changes on several occasions, Carrie is a consistently highly intense film, that constantly builds up increasing tension. The film is intense on many levels: it is disturbing, moving, extremely creepy and suspenseful, unsettling and the finale is truly terrifying. Brian De Palma has earned his reputation as a master of cinema with several great films including ""Scarface"" (1983), ""The Untouchables"" (1987) and ""Carlito's Way"" (1993); if I had to choose, however, I would personally still name ""Carrie"" my favorite De Palma film. Along with Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980) and maybe Cronenberg's ""The Dead Zone"" (1983), ""Carrie"" is one of the truly great Stephen King adaptations, and an unforgettable film that must be seen by every Horror fan. A masterpiece!",Carrie
107,MarieGabrielle,"Stephen King, at an earlier time...",7,24 November 2006,"Just after ""Salem's Lot"" and before ""The Shining"". King himself has commented that he wrote this while living in a trailer, living on an high school English teachers salary, and drinking (quite a bit) to forget about the state of his life at the time.Interjected in the story is the sardonic humor which all of us can remember certain people, places and ""catastrophes"" from high school. Carrie White (Spacek is perfect) embodies all the innocence and nerdy persona every freshman girl in high school hopes to not have. John Travolta and Nancy Allen, Amy Irving as the popular crowd. Also William Katt, who takes Carrie to the prom as part of the sadistic scheme.Comparing this to what happens in high schools today, this is now mild. Normally the theme of telekinesis would seem silly, but King paired with DePalma presents a viable story; the surreal insanity of high school, how everything is magnified to the point of hysteria. Betty Buckley in an early role as high school gym teacher.There is cutting edge humor here, which King often includes in his books. The principal, who is supposed to help Carrie, but is secretly repelled by her. Of course the standout performance is Piper Laurie, as Carrie's mother. Who wouldn't need some form of insanity to survive her psychological outlook on life?.While today a bit dated, this film still stands as one of King's earlier, and better films. His earlier stories, even the short stories, are well worth reading. ""Apt Pupil"" (1998) (with Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro) is also worth checking out if you are a King fan.",Carrie
108,aidanratesmovies,Carrie (1976),9,27 September 2020,"Timely, with some great performances, and a very eerie nature- Carrie is yet another great Stephen King adaptation, and one of the films responsible to why we have so many King films today. Carrie is certainly not a typical high school story, in any way, but it does have its fair share of stereotypes- with certain characters feeling nothing but the shallow cliches we have seen dozens of times in this film. Besides this flaw, the only other problem I had with the film was the ending, which seemed rather abrupt to me- although I have not read the book so I am not entirely sure of the reason behind it. Brian De Palma provides fantastic direction to this film, and is largely the reason why I feel the film works so well. So many moments in this film I feel may have fallen flat if it were not for De Palma, and I was glad to see his directorial talents shine so well on screen throughout. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, and Betty Buckley all provide terrific performances on screen- although it is truly Spacek that shines throughout- not only on screen the longest, but also providing an incredibly breathtaking work and transformation throughout the film, which she plays to the fullest. The film can be entertaining, and often quite enjoyable. It isn't afraid to try and relate to its characters, rather than simply format it to a film standard, and I enjoyed the extra effort on behalf of that and the writers involved (at least in that aspect). In the end, Carrie is not King's best adaptation but one of the most important. It has its weaker moments, but all in all, it feels like a terrifically strong effort, and one I wouldn't mind watching again.
My Rating: 9.25/10",Carrie
109,ShootingShark,The Original Stephen King Movie,7,8 May 2005,"Carrie White, a shy and repressed teenager with a fanatically religious mother, discovers she has the power to move and control objects with her mind. Some cruel classmates hatch a plot to humiliate her in front of everyone at the High School Prom, but Carrie's response is not quite what they bargained for ...Carrie is one of several great seminal seventies horror movies and has been extremely influential - the high-school-teenagers-in-peril setting has been a (sometimes regrettable) staple of the genre ever since, and the unsettling shock ending has been copied countless times. The movie is perhaps most important as the launchpad of the careers of DePalma and author Stephen King; the former had already made several films but none were very successful financially, and the latter had several unpublished manuscripts before Carrie proved to be very popular as both a book and a film. The plot is pretty straightforward but the idea of linking Carrie's adolescent development to an explosion in her telekinetic powers as a metaphor for raging teenage hormones is sensational. Equally fabulous is DePalma's cinematic treatment, brimming over with stunning effects - deep focus, low angles, overheads, filters, amazing use of split-screen and especially the most brilliantly stylised use of slow-motion. The bucket-of-blood prom sequence for me is not only an incredibly evocative and suspenseful scene, but also a masterclass in how to really use editing and photography effectively. Equally invaluable are the memorable performances of Spacek and Laurie (both of whom were nominated for - and should have won - Oscars), who capture the tormented qualities of their characters perfectly. The reality they bring to the melodrama, combined with the film's technical pedigree, is what makes it so much better than its many subsequent imitators. The rest of the young cast are good, notably bad boy Travolta and DePalma's future wife Allen as the thoroughly nasty Chris Hargenson. Carrie is a class act - it's not a very pleasant movie, but it's an extremely well made, well acted and scary one.",Carrie

For the average horror fan, I will state again that I didn't find the film itself to be incredibly terrifying (disquieting, certainly). But while the movie might not be horrifying, it is an incredibly well told story that really works well as a character study of an outcast. Really powerful stuff from DePalma and from King- if you're a fan of either of their work, this movie is a must see!For hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit True Myth Media!",Carrie

Everyone will.,7,16 October 2013,"I've seen this film before, but I watched it again to see how Stephen King managed to write a story that captured teen-aged angst amidst bullying and popularity contests.Sissy Spacek was simply incredible and I'm not surprised that she got the first Academy Award nomination for a horror film. Piper Laurie was also superb as her mother and got a well-deserved nomination herself. The effects and cinematography were superb, as was Brian De Palma's direction. I also liked seeing some people in their first or early roles like Amy Irving (Yentl) in her first role on the big screen; RoboCop's Nancy Allen; John Travolta in his second screen appearance; and P. J. Soles (The Devil's Rejects) in one of her first roles. A great horror movie about teen life.",Carrie
112,raulfaust,Weirdo Freakshow,5,16 December 2010,"I don't know what is so good about this movie. It's basically about a girl who suffers bullying and kill everyone that tried to kill her in the last 15 minutes. There is no art, story, plot, development, there is nothing. We also are obligated to hear Carrie's mother talking about sins and god every 10 seconds, even though nobody wants to hear about it. That's a shame some people on IMDb think it's a masterpiece of art, since it brought nothing new to me and I will forget about this movie in a few days. But maybe it's just a matter of year. I mean, we are in 2010 and maybe now this movie is absolutely out of quality, but maybe back in 70's it was a great innovation for the movie industry. Just maybe.",Carrie

114,PredragReviews,"""They're all gonna laugh at you!""",9,20 May 2016,"There's one thing I specifically like about certain horror films, and that is those that contain the horror elements, yet have a story that allows you to feel a great deal of emotion for a main or secondary character, depending on the focus of the plot. When Stephen King wrote his first novel, Carrie, it was shocking as well as emotionally heart-stopping. Brian De Palma's film, following soon after, is groundbreaking and intense, and captures the horror of the character's actions as well as the horror of her secluded and alienated school and home life. Sissy Spacek was brought to the project to play the title character, and does a top-notch job. She is the perfect ""ugly-duckling"" type for the role, and she is able to play out all of the emotion and terror that Carrie experiences throughout the novel. Amy Irving is does a credible job as Sue Snell, and her performance makes us believe that Sue really does feel sorry for what she has done to Carrie. The rest of the ensemble makes the movie believable, and never is there a moment where you will question the authenticity of a performance.The film is unflinching in its portrayal of female jealousy and sublimated sexual rage. The appearance of Carrie's powers coincides with her first period, i.e. the onset of sexual maturity. The following events are all about sexual attraction and jealousy, following Carrie's emergence as a woman, the dynamics of the other girls at school and their sexual/romantic intrigues, and the White family's bizarre sexual mores. The drama with the girls at school is all about dates and sex and going to the prom. Carrie's sympathetic gym teacher tries to get her to wear makeup and pay more attention to her hair. Meanwhile, Carrie's mother equates her menstruation with acceptance of sin, and later refers to her breasts as ""dirty pillows."" Once you start to look at it this way, you'll be surprised at the number of incidents and bits of dialogue that relate to this theme, and how carefully focused the entire screenplay is. The other amazing thing is DePalma's direction. The sequence beginning with the announcement of Carrie as Prom Queen is a masterpiece of building tension, notice the music and editing as the sequence gathers speed, culminating with the spilling of the blood. You will also notice that this entire sequence is dialogue-free. It is so tight, audacious and over-the-top that you have to admire it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Carrie
115,lewiskendell,A must see for horror fans.,9,29 September 2010,"""I wanna be normal, I wanna start to try me, a whole person, before it's too late for me to.""What happens when an odd, repressed, emotionally abused teenage girl with telekinetic abilities is pushed past her breaking point by an overwhelmingly humiliating prank pulled by her bullying classmates? A prom night that no one will ever forget. If they happen to survive it, that is. Carrie is an absolute horror classic. It runs the gamut from unsettling, to creepy, to horrifying, and every second of it is enjoyable. If it doesn't freak you out before the end, you're made of sterner stuff than I am. I don't think I'll ever forget the insane zealotry of Carrie's mother or the mesmerizing carnage of the end of the movie, among other scenes, and the best proof of a good horror movie is one that is memorable. This is by far the best Stephen King adaptation that I've seen, and the fact that it was based on his first published book makes it even more impressive. The pacing is perfect, with a perfect build up to the spectacular finale that will have you torn between feeling satisfaction of seeing some horrible people getting their comeuppance, and a genuine horror at the character of Carrie. If you're at all interested in a scary movie that's effective beyond constant jump scares or gore, then you should love this. I sure did. It's quality hasn't diminished in the least by the years that have gone by since it was made. Great camera-work, great score, great movie.",Carrie
116,philip_vanderveken,"Very good acting, a very nice story, some interesting camera work... reasons enough to give this movie a try",8,13 September 2005,"""Carrie"" is a classic horror movie that has always been one of my favorite movies in the genre. It may well be thirty years old, but the tension, the story, the images,... really haven't lost anything of their power. And I'm certainly not the only one who likes this movie. The fact that it has inspired several other movie makers to try to do the same by making a sequel or a remake, shows that they too were convinced of the potential of the movie. The only difference is: they have all failed where De Palma succeeded.Carrie White is a shy girl who doesn't have any friends and who is completely unaware of what the world has to offer. She has never learned to make social contacts, because she has been living in an isolated world, together with her psychotically religious mother. After an embarrassing incident in the showers, her fellow students start to tease her even more than what they have done before. Her teacher disciplines them severely and that's why they are determined to have revenge. They all hatch a plot against Carrie to embarrass her in front of the whole school during the prom. But one girl feels sorry for Carrie and asks her date not to take her with him to the prom, but to ask Carrie instead, which he does. The entire night seems to go perfectly and especially when she's chosen as the prom queen her life seems better than ever. But when she is asked to go on the stage everything starts to go terribly wrong...If you look at the story and the special effects and compare them with todays horror movies, than I'm sure that several (young) people will not like it all that much. However, when you keep in mind that this movie was made in 1976, than you'll have to agree with me that this is still stunning. OK, horror movies now try to use more scary moments (you know what's going to happen and still at that exact moment in the movie you get frightened) and that's something which you will not find in this movie, but it's the entire story and the idea behind it that make it all work. But even when the story and the special effects can't convince you all that much, you'll probably like the movie for the acting in it. Sissy Spacek was very convincing as Carrie, Piper Laurie was unbelievable as her mother and all other actors were more than OK as well, especially the young John Travolta could convince me in this movie. What I also liked a lot was the camera work. There aren't that many movies who have made use of split screens as much as has been done in this ""Carrie"", and those who did weren't always very successful in it, but in this movie it works and it sure adds an extra dimension to the entire experience.In the end this is a horror movie that hasn't had too much difficulty to stand the test of time if you ask me. If all of today's horror movies will still be good in thirty years time is only to be seen, but this one certainly proves that it deserves to be called a classic in the genre. That's why I give it at least a 7.5/10.",Carrie
117,screenman,A Strange movie,8,30 October 2010,"I have found this to be a strange work. Although usually described as a 'horror' movie I think that, if anything, it questions the nature of horror.Carrie is a pubescent schoolgirl. She is gauche, freckled, withdrawn, but she is the ugly-duckling that is destined to be a swan. Every school has its schmuck, and Carrie fits the role here. During school hours she begins menstruating and is hysterical about the seemingly inexplicable mess. Her mother has never explained. Naturally; all her classmates have had a sex-education and regard her behaviour as hilarious. Young kids are depicted as nasty, insensitive, bullying bigots, which a lot of kids are - though not all. A sympathetic teacher takes her aside. To be alone, the butt of everyone's ill-humours in a closed institution like a school is itself some kind of horror story. But there's more.Carrie lives with her mother. The woman is, frankly, unhinged. She is stricken by some gross interpretations of old-testament guilt and damnation and has inculcated with only limited success, her poor daughter into her bizarre belief. She lives an isolated life, as does Carrie socially. But the daughter must attend school and discovers there that although people can be terribly cruel, they are not necessarily tainted with evil. It's a horror-story upbringing. Yet it doesn't end there.Carrie possesses a unique gift of telekinesis. She is at first slow to discover this, but soon realises that she can accomplish great things. The high-school proms are due, and another girl, a favoured beauty, takes pity on Carrie and persuades her hunky handsome boyfriend to invite this gauche misfit as his partner instead. Her mother scorns such debauchery, but Carrie means to go and makes her own dress. On the appointed evening, Sissy Spacek looks absolutely perfect as the ravishing naivete and innocent beauty. Even the hunk realises that he could have done a lot worse. But another girl, embittered, plans a monstrous booby-trap to ruin her evening and triumph. And it works.Everyone at the high-school roars with laughter and behaves exactly as her mother foretold. Carrie responds with such a telekinetic tantrum that results in the slaughter of pupils, teachers and parents alike.She walks home afterwards, only to be murdered by her mother, who has finally slipped over the edge.To me, the real horror of this movie is not slaughter, but cruelty, and meanness, and the wretchedly brief and unfulfilling life that is Carrie's. She is doomed at every turn and I am grief-stricken on her behalf. I actually cheered her on as she systematically electrocuted her tormentors and burned their edifice to the ground. How different it all could have been.I also thought the ending was unsatisfactory. The mean language on the tombstone and the hand reaching out from the ground still seemed to smack of an indictment of Carrie and her strangeness, when the real indictment was one of human intolerance.This is a very well-crafted work in all technical aspects. The players give believable turns with Sissy Spacek quite enthralling as a young girl doomed by a terribly troubled upbringing and a unique gift. It's a riveting watch, but saddening for all that.",Carrie
118,mjw2305,Dated Horror Classic,7,29 December 2006,"Carrie was Stephen King's first transition to film, and the most successful horror novelist's story didn't disappoint. Sissy Spacek excellently portrays Carrie, a sheltered high school misfit who is ridiculed and tormented by her fellow students because of her innocence and naivety. Little do they realise, they are pushing her to the edge and helping her unleash the power she wields within.Sadly unlike the novel the movie has suffered the test of time, seeing it again now makes me realise how much of the horror is lost in this on screen translation; but i still salute it as a genuine horror classic; i remember how scared i was when i saw it the first time, and it is because of movies like this one that the horror genre has continued to evolve and entertain.7/10",Carrie
119,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,"Stick with this one, it beats the remake!",9,14 August 2014,"In 2013 a really lousy adaptation of Carrie was created. The 1976 original is the best, hands-down.Carrie is the shy, quiet and weird girl in high school who nobody likes; one day she has her period in gym and is bugged by other girls until she shows a display of weird powers. Her only friend is the teacher, who pities her more than anything else. Her mom is an abusive religious nutter who locks up her daughter to force her to pray. One day at school things go too far and Carrie uses her powers to turn the tables on everyone else.Sissy Spacek was the best actress for Carrie out of all the remakes. Piper Laurie was amazing at her role as the insanely religious Margaret White, the soundtrack was really spectacular and they managed to capture a creepy atmosphere and some gore without overdoing it, while also sharing a powerful message about bullying.Don't watch the remake, stick with this one, it's much better.",Carrie
120,sme_no_densetsu,A genuine horror classic,8,26 January 2009,"Brian de Palma's ""Carrie"" is based on Stephen King's debut novel of the same name. Today the film is recognized as a horror classic while Mr. King hasn't done too bad for himself either.The title character is a high-school outcast with a religious fanatic for a mother. She is routinely victimized by her peers but her developing telekinetic powers threaten to make her tormentors pay for the distress they've caused.The cast, composed mostly of unknowns, was well-assembled. Sissy Spacek is excellent in the title role and Piper Laurie showed no signs of having just returned from a 15-year hiatus. Both actresses received Oscar nominations for their efforts.Another strong point of the film is the visual aspect. It's clear that de Palma put a lot of thought into the film's look. While he sometimes goes overboard it cannot be denied that there are numerous striking images throughout the film. The musical aspect is also well-handled with Pino Donaggio's score sometimes recalling the work of Bernard Hermann while at other times imparting a dream-like quality.I would not hesitate to rank ""Carrie"" among the best horror films of all time, alongside the likes of ""The Shining"" & ""The Exorcist"". Even if you're not much of a horror fan I still recommend the film on the basis of the often memorable visuals.",Carrie
121,Howlin Wolf,Intelligent film that's more than just a horror flick...,10,9 March 2001,"...Due in part to the amazing subtlety of Spacek's performance.  The last 20 minutes is when the real scares start, so we'd better have something to hold our interest until then, and we do.  A convincing portrayal of high school (albeit pretty dated, hey, this is the '70s!) and a subtle showing of Carrie's telekinetic ability.  Sure, De Palma used up all the subtlety by the time he got to the finale but that's one of the reasons why the film is so interesting.   (SPOILERS)   Piper Laurie is great too as the religious fanatic of a mother.  She really gives me the creeps!  William Katt is also good as Tommy Ross, building up such a good rapport with Carrie by the end of the movie that we feel genuinely horrified as the denouement begins.  This is also another point in the film's favour.  We're unsure  whether to cheer as the horrendously bullied Carrie gets her revenge, or be horrified at the destruction she wreaks, since some quite sympathetic characters also fall foul of her wrath (the gym teacher for one).  A nice test of audience sympathies, that.   Deserves to be regarded as one of the classics of modern horror, and showcased De Palma's potential for those of us who weren't familiar with his earlier work.  Excellent.",Carrie
122,pyrocitor,Bloody good,9,23 July 2017,"Quick – picture the scariest, most blood-curdling thing in the world. Don't think – just picture it. An image; a moment; a feeling of such utter mortification, disgust, and soul-chilling repulsion, even tangentially picturing it makes your skin clammy and fills you with dread. Have it? Good. Now, let's compare notes. I'll hazard a guess: it's not vampires, zombies, or ghosts. It's not clowns, axe-murders, or murderous children. It's not falling, being trapped underwater, or in a tight space. It's high school. Yes, it's a profound enough realization to catapult Stephen King from up-and- coming novelist to genre titan, pioneering decades of audiences realizing the true horror was not elaborate fantasies on screen – it lay in the people surrounding them in day-to-day existence, and just how perverse, vindictive, and creatively cruel they could be. And it's a guiding principle that helps Brian De Palma's seminal adaptation of King's fledgling classic persist as more than a schlocky '70s thriller, landing in The Exorcist camp of one of the most deeply disturbing but perversely, sheepishly enjoyable cinematic frights of all time. And that's not even factoring in the blood-drenched mass-murder by telekinesis. De Palma, a director largely acclaimed for style at the expense of substance, here finds the ideal wedding of the two, recognizing that King's parable is all the more gruesomely effective when seen through the heightened, hormonal dizziness of high school. At first glance, we're given the sense he's somewhat sold himself short, as the cheerfully gratuitous credits, featuring a gaggle of spectacularly naked coeds bouncing around a change room, suggest a jocular resignation to the comic book camp of B-horror (B for beeeeewwwbbs, naturally). A subsequent shot of Carrie ambiguously pleasuring herself in the shower, pelted by a playfully ejaculating shower head, is straight out of a porn parody. But then: a spurt of blood, and the shower's gone ice cold, as we're plunged into one of the most chilling openings to a horror film imaginable, as Carrie's histrionics, blindsided by her first period, are trumped by the scarring spectacle of her being pelted with tampons by her hooting, jeering cohort. And then the shoe drops: De Palma, cunningly, has cottoned on to the true horror inherent in King's treatise being the see-sawing of expectations being requited and rebuffed. Initially, horror takes the backseat to satire, as De Palma gleefully lampoons the genre's objectification of female sexuality, and tacks on a deceptively savage incitement of the school system's inability to properly address bullying and mental health concerns (here, Betty Buckley expertly riddles her do-gooder teacher's kindly exchanges with Carrie with pedantic clumsiness and subtle resentment), while sprinkling in visits from Carrie's horrifically deranged mother (and the most distressingly leering Jesus on a crucifix in cinema history) so unhinged they can't help but ring grotesquely emotionally true. The social commentary is tempered somewhat by the slightly out-of-touch 'male writer hypothesizing what it's like to be a high school girl' (not helped by a cast nearly as visibly inappropriately old as Grease), but the cruelty rings hauntingly true. But De Palma changes gears to to full-blown suspense building in the second act. Hardly subtle about his amorous Hitchcock influences (check out the sampling of Psycho's shrieking strings in Pino Donaggio's elegantly bombastic musical score), De Palma treats prom like Hitch's proverbial bomb on the bus - the anticipation, watching every last piece fastidiously click into place, is what makes it horrifying. With sadistic cheerfulness and perfectly steely, squirm-inducing pacing, he cross- cuts between Carrie, audaciously daring to hope she could still integrate with her peers at prom, and her classmates taking a late night jaunt to the slaughterhouse. It's almost unbearably cringe-worthy - pop culture infamy ensures we know exactly what the coup de grace is, but can't quite look away as it painstakingly runs its course. The final blowout itself - a maelstrom of dizzyingly circling cameras, whip- pan zooms, fast-forwards, and split-screens - toes the line of being distractingly stylized, but it's too guiltily, sordidly cathartic a payoff not to drink up. What we don't expect is a climax part II - even more distressingly batsh*t, as Carrie's mother requites the looming Psycho allusions before Carrie - literally - brings the house down. Tack on a jump scare coda that suggests De Palma, smirking, trying to outdo the heart palpitations from his buddy Steve's shark movie, and there's no question we've got a chilling classic on our hands. Sissy Spacek is almost achingly perfect as the titular telekinetic, and there are few cinematic images that convey the writhing claustrophobia of adolescent isolation as her pitifully slumped, dishevelled form. Watching her painstakingly build nuggets of self-confidence, conceiving that her supernatural abilities could be miracles rather than satanic curses, to her beaming, tearful euphoria at being crowned prom queen, are almost too adorable to watch, making her descent into bug-eyed murderousness as heartbreaking as it is chilling. Piper Laurie unquestionably steals the show with a grotesquely fever-pitched tour-de-force as Carrie's fundamentalist mother, all the more titanically detestable upon realization that, idly humming while dragging and locking her daughter in a closet, she genuinely believes she's acting in Carrie's best interests. John Travolta and Nancy Allen are each deliciously awful as Carrie's malevolent bully and her dopey, sadistically eager boyfriend, their caustic banter as funny as the underlying abuse is unsettling, while Luke Skywalker-wannabe William Katt and Amy Irving are each understatedly earnest as the two sheepishly trying to redeem Carrie's year (the ambiguity of Katt's oscillating enthusiasm as Carrie's prom date remains one of the film's most enigmatic touches). Carrie may verge on being overcooked at times, but its blend of visceral imagery, incisive social critique, and bonkers climactic payoff sear its place into the annals of horror history. So go ahead: take Carrie to the prom. You just might not be sorry that you did. -9/10",Carrie
123,frankde-jong,Without Sissy Spacek this would not be more than a mediocre film,7,4 April 2021,"""Carrie"" has become a very influential horror movie. Brian de Palma is not known for his nuanced productions, but in ""Carrie"" the horror flows naturally from the characters in stead of shock effects appearing out of the blue. Only in the last twenty minutes de Palma unnecessarily accelarates and gives us one ""shoot out"" too many. The iconographic image of Carrie soaked with pig blood however is from this phase of the movie.The story of ""Carrie"" has much in common with the story of ""The match factory girl"" (1990, Aki Kaurismaki). An emotionally abused girl (both at home and outside) flourishes after she finally gets attention. The following disappointment is more then she can bear. She takes revenge in a gruesome way.It is interesting to see more or less the same storyline adapted in an American (""Carrie) and European (""The match factory girl"") way. The European way is more subdued, both in the way that is taken advantage of the girl as in the way that she takes revenge.In ""Carrie"" the action is situated in a high school, and therefore sex plays a more prominent role. The average girls are obsessed with boys and clothes and Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is an outsider just because her religious fanatic mother forbids her to wear pretty clothes (not to mention make up) and has told her nothing about the female period.De Palma uses this in one of the first scenes of the film. After a gym lesson Carrie is taking a shower and is caressing herself in a slightly erotic way. The spectator is expecting everything apart from a horror movie. All of a sudden the water turns red. Carrie has her first period and the mood of the film changes instantly. A brilliant scene. I wonder if de Palma for this scene was inspired by the famous shower scene from ""Psycho"" (1960, Alfred Hitchcock).In ""Carrie"" there are people who are willing to ridicule Carrie to score a cheap success by their fellow students. On the other hand there are also people who feel sorry for Carrie and try to break through her isolation. Both kinds of people are present under both teachers and students. Restricting myself to the students: Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) tries to mock Carrie and Sue Snell (Amy Irving) tries to consolate Carrie.What surprised me from a director like de Palma (who is not known for his female friendly characters) is how weak the boyfriends of these two girls are. Both girls manipulatie their boyfriend as if they are radio controlled. Chris manipulates her boyfriend Billy (played by John Travolta in an early role) by giving sex. Sue manipulates her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) bij refusing sex. By the way, the manipulating beauty queen Chris reminded me of Jacy (Cybill Sheperd) from ""The last picture show"" (1971, Peter Bogdanovich), and that is not a compliment.For a long time ""Carrie"" was for me synonymous with Sissy Spacek. I still am of the opinion that without her the film would be mediocre at best. There are however a few other names to mention. I always thought that the career of John Travolta started with ""Saturday night fever"" (1977, John Badham) and ""Grease"" (1978, Randal Kleiser), and was unaware of this earlier role. He plays not without merit. Higher praise for Piper Laurie who had not acted for 15 years (that means since ""The hustler"" (1961, Robert Rossen) I guess) and plays the religious fanatic mother in a scary way. Still ten years later she would again be the mother of the main character in ""Children of a lesser God"" (1986, Randa Haines).Honestly I didn't know the cinematographer Mario Tosi, but he contributed to the look and feel of the movie with striking camara-angles. To name just a few. Angle from above (birds eye view) in the opening scene when the girls are playing volley-ball. Angle from below in some scenes where the mother is harassing Carrie. Deep focus when Carrie says something in the class room en we see also the facial expressions of her fellow students. Circulating camera when Carrie is still having a good time at the Prom.",Carrie
124,Pumpkin_Man,Another Hardcore Classic!!!,10,16 August 2009,"This movie is very creepy. A teen aged girl named Carrie White is always being picked on and made fun by the sexy teen aged girls. (Her psycho God-crazed mom doesn't help.) The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also. The very end with Sue putting the flowers on Carrie's grave and a bloody hand pops up is awesome. Hell, the whole movie is awesome. I would love to take Carrie to the prom.

125,Spuzzlightyear,Teaming together helps towards achieving a bigger goal!,8,9 July 2006,"Carrie still is quite a lot of fun, despite the fact that much more violent and shocking movies have come our way ever since it was released way back in 1976. I remember seeing this on TV (probably in 1978) and being pretty amazed by it. I distinctly remember John Travolta slaughtering that pig, and wondering why someone as cool as Vinne Barbarino would do such a thing. Anyways, I'm sure all of you know by now that this is the tale of one Carrie White, a homely high school girl with some tricky telekinetic powers. Her Mom (HILARIOUSLY played up by Piper Laurie) well, is a nit off the deep end, so Carrie can't really go to her when she's developing some, well, developmental issues at school, and therefore picked on mercilessly by the other students. Fortunately, the phys-ed teacher protects Carrie and punishes the girls for picking on Carrie. The girls strike back though, of course on Carrie and not on the Phys-Ed teacher, by developing an ingenious plan which involves pig's blood, rigging the prom balloting, rigging the set of the prom and getting the school jock to invite Carrie to the prom. So while yes, this movie is about Carrie's problems, I just love the film's underlying theme of banding together to achieve a bigger goal! It's like a twisted educational film! ""Chris realized she would need some help in the mean prank against Carrie. So she recruited some friends to help her! Billy got the pig's blood, Freddy got on the polling committee etc etc"" Goofy fun! The only problem I had with this, is the question of WHY Tommy asked Carrie to the prom, it's never explained, and I found it surprising that he nor his girlfriend (played by Amy Irving) wasn't in on what was going to happen. That just made everything confusing.",Carrie
126,juliankennedy23,I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.,9,25 October 2018,"Carrie: 9 out of 10: Shy teenage girl with telekinetic powers and a religious mother faces down: bullies in her last year of high school.The Good: This movie has aged like a fine wine. It features a star-studded cast including Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, PJ Soles, William Katt, Nancy Allen, and Amy Irving. Director Brian DePalma keeps a great pace, makes smart changes to the source material, and is not afraid of an artistic touch or two.The underlying theme of a girl coming into womanhood and all the power that entails is handled extremely well for a film that manages to be both an exploitation film (Hey it's the girl's shower) as well as well-received critical darling (Oscar nomination for Sissy Spacek and an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for Piper Laurie.)The ending works as well as you remember it but it is the little touches on the journey that elevate the material from its honestly pulp roots. Piper Laurie in particular really sells her over the top character with one memorable set piece after another.The Bad. Bernard Herrmann was supposed to do the music for this movie, unfortunately, Bernard Herrmann died before the production started up. Perhaps as an homage, like renaming the high school Bates High, or as part of his Hitchcock obsession Director Brian DePalma decided to use Herrmann's Psycho score over and over again. This movie started a trend of cannibalizing that eek eek eek Psycho Scare Chord that lives to this day.The Ugly. Good lord these are some old High schoolers. These are Grease old even Porky's Revenge old. I am not just talking about the leads either there are some suspicious hairlines and crows feet among the student extras in the prom scene not to mention Mrs. Herb Tarlek herself Edie McClurg as a high school student.Clothed Sissy Spacek almosts pulls of the wallflower in high school look. (Naked she more like Denise Richards in Wild Things than a high school girl having her first period) The other ladies suffer from a similar fate with only PJ Soles looking anything close to high school age.In Conclusion: From the last scene that has inspired horror films to this day (particularly the first Friday the 13th) to the theme of womanhood equaling horror a lot of what made Carrie unique is old hat in this day and age. What has held up through is the great performances and still hilarious dialogue (I am sorry I agree with Piper Laurie dirty pillows belongs in a comedy).

But whether you love it, hate it or are indifferent about it, no one can deny the impact that CARRIE has made on everyone who grew up in the Seventies...or that it continues to resonate with new audiences even today.Based on the very first runaway bestseller by Stephen King, this was a tale that acknowledged the peril-laden sharks-and-piranha-filled environment that was high school. Teasing, bullying, ostracism and how shockingly (at least back in the day) the girls were more adept at practicing casual cruelty than boys would ever be. Into this circle of Hell as yet undocumented by Dante, comes poor Carrie White. No friends, a bleak future at best, and her only family being her Christian funda-MENTAL-ist wack-job of a mother, the last thing she needs is to become the favorite scapegoat of two of the meanest of the ""Mean Girls"" at Bates High School...Blond, frosty bitch-goddess Chris Hargensen and her irritating sidekick, Norma Watson. But that Carrie does, and the taunts, teasing and relentless bullying reaches its breaking point, when a terrified and clueless Carrie experiences her period for the very first time in the girls' locker room, and the resulting chaos resembles an all-female version of LORD OF THE FLIES (if you add flying tampons). But that very day, Carrie discovers something else she possesses....Latent telekinetic powers that have been unearthed along with her traumatic introduction into womanhood. Nobody knows - not the teachers, her tormentors or even her mother - and as Carrie begins to discover that maybe she does have a chance to assert herself and find some kind of happiness after all, the stage is set for a teenage tragedy of epic proportions.A lot of things were at stake with this film. It was Brian de Palma's last chance to prove himself as both an auteur worthy of carrying the torch for his hero, Alfred Hitchcock, and as a director capable of producing a box-office smash. It was THE long-shot at the big time for a cast of virtual unknowns: Sissy Spacek as the tortured title character; Piper Laurie, leaving semi-retirement to play religious fanatic Margaret White, Carrie's mother; Nancy Allen (a future Mrs. de Palma) and P.J. Soles as Chris and Norma respectively; Broadway and film star Betty Buckley playing the sympathetic gym teacher Miss Collins; Amy Irving (one of the future Mrs. Steven Spielbergs) as Sue Snell, the only girl on Carrie's side; William Katt (THE GREATEST American HERO) as Tommy Ross, Sue's BMOC boyfriend and the key to Carrie's downfall; and in a cameo that would send his career skyrocketing, John Travolta as Chris Hargensen's lunk-headed boyfriend, Billy Nolen. Some films are so bad that for those who participate in them in front of and behind the camera, no one's career is left unscathed. Happily, in the case of CARRIE, the exact opposite was true. Where de Palma's penchant for raiding Hitchcock's bag of tricks usually got him into serious trouble, he was firing on all cylinders with CARRIE, because it all worked perfectly. Everything - from the dynamic performances (both Spacek and Laurie were Oscar nominees), to Mario Tosi's photography and Pino Donaggio's unforgettable score - meshed together to go above and beyond King's effectively horrifying prose, and what resulted was a tale told about the hopefulness - and horror - of humanity, that has served as a genre touchstone for nearly four decades. All this time has passed, and even having seen it about two dozen times or more, the movie never fails to affect me. I almost envy those who have never seen it, because there is nothing like the first time. The experience will never leave you....EVER...",Carrie
128,itamarscomix,Wasted potential,5,23 September 2011,"When one of the most overrated directors in Hollywood adapts the most overrated author in America, the predictable result is an incredibly overrated movie, which is indeed what Carrie is. It's not a bad movie exactly - it has a lot of style and a few interesting ideas - but those get lost in a very messy haze. De Palma boldly tries to mix high-school drama with horror and mystery, but in the end all aspects fall flat, and as is often the case with Stephen King stories, the supernatural element is the dullest one in the whole movie. Sissy Spacek's performance is memorable enough to make a very flat and undeveloped character work, somehow; the best performance in the movie, though, is that of Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother, and it's completely wasted, as is anything good that De Palma has here.",Carrie

130,EijnarAmadeus,Brian De Palma's finest hour.,10,24 July 2009,"Sissy Spacek's star-turning performance in 'Carrie' is one of the finest portrayals by an actress ever in a horror film. The film, adapted from a novel by Stephen King, revolves mainly around adolescence and religion, adolescence in the sense of a outsider girl on a high school with telepathic abilities who ""just wants to be normal"", and religion in the sense of her Christian über-fundamentalist mother who's been teaching her inside-out about life and all its possibilities. The film does not (like surprisingly many Stephen King adaptations) go for the full-on shock effect of murder, blood and nerve-wrecking excitement, still, with all these ingredients very much intact, director Brian De Palma (who's on a victory-run of invention) presents the film with a high-school backdrop full of bubbly life, and the themes of lost family and love, and the alienation of teenager-life, is always at the main focus. 'Carrie''s disturbing undertones and shocking scenes are still full of terrifying life, and as any great horror, it brings that tingling feeling of nastiness, wrong and suspense.",Carrie
131,perfectbond,Very good entertainment,8,28 January 2003,"I saw this movie on DVD the other day and have to say that I was more than moderately entertained. There are some interesting messages in this film about fanatical religious devotion and peer acceptance. Standout performances from Spacek and the actress who plays her mom also highlight this film. A young John Travolta isn't given much to do but he does his job well. I think Nancy Allen, who plays Travolta's girlfriend Chris, is the same actress who plays Murphy's girlfriend in the Robocop movies. There are many great images in this film, especially Carrie's reaction after 'the prank' and the reaction and aftermath of the girl at the grave. All in all, a very good horror flick. A minor complaint about the otherwise insightful DVD documentary: couldn't Travolta be coaxed into giving an opinion or two?",Carrie
132,FloatingOpera7,It's Hell Being A Teen: Carrie As Psychological Horror,10,5 March 2005,"This is one of the better horror films in the mainstream repertoire. It's a classic. Though there have been remakes (on television and also on screen, such as The Rage in the late 90's, the original 70's Carrie unleashes deep, psychological horror and frustrations of being a teenager. Sissy Spacek portrays the frail and powerful Carrie, with sympathetic and touching pathos and tragedy. John Travolta makes an appearance as a one of the high school boys who ""wrong"" her.In the 70's, it was probably harder to ""survive"" high school. I grew up in the 90s when individual pride and diversity was accepted. For a girl like Carrie, who is almost reared as an Amish girl, by an unbelievably religious fanatic mother, who dresses differently than the rest of the girls in school, who is shy, awkward, insecure and most significantly- going through puberty (menstruating)..life can be very hard. The way she is treated by others, particularly the character Jon Travolta is playing and his girlfriend, is enough to drive her to madness. It's so understandable why after all she's put up with, she finally snaps. The moment she felt was her best, when she finally believed she was accepted even triumphant, also becomes her worst moment. Lashing out, she finally makes use of the telekinetic powers she has been practicing. Her mother, too, meets a death by her hands. The final scene seems to be the end-all to the tragic mother-daughter relationship. This movie is well-made, well-written and haunting. Stephen King became the king of horror movies with this, his first.",Carrie

Spacek is a revelation in the role that officially made her a superstar and Laurie is equally as riveting as her mother. Both actresses received Oscar nominations for their performances.

134,Movie-12,"Not a scary movie, just a major let down. ** (out of four)",5,1 June 2001,"CARRIE / (1976) ** (out of four)
In ""Carrie,"" the acclaimed vision of Stephen King's novel, we meet a character who doesn't have good days, joyful moments, or times that she can laugh with friends. The title character is played by Sissy Spacek, who, under the circumstances, does very good things with her character. Carrie's mother has raised her under a constricting environment of fanatical religion and strict discipline. As both the novel and the movie open, we meet Carrie White, a high school senior who has a very complex body; she is telepathic-contains the ability to move objects with her mind-and she has never had a period. Now, I know I am becoming graphic in my explanation, but this is an important aspect of the story. The audience assumes from the implications and plot points that Carrie has had a rather cloudy history as a person and student. Her neighbors look away as she passes, her fellow students pitch tampons at her when she experiences her first vaginal bleeding in the school showers. These are the only things that develop Carrie White as a character-the rest is up to you to assume. In a movie where the main character kills countless presumably innocent individuals due to unkempt rage and years of building aggression, we better be able to understand her, but  the movie does not provide us with the right material.
The problem with ""Carrie"" is not so much a problem with the movie itself, but a problem with the novel by Stephen King, and the adapted script by Lawrence D. Cohen. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I obtained a videocassette copy for critical screening to compare the two arts. I hated the book. Stephen King confused his simple, one-line story with frequent scientific rationalizations of the occurrences within the actual novel. It is like he didn't trust the reader with his idea, and felt the need to provide us with factual evidence that the story could actually happen. This distorts the narrative, and provides the reader with nothing but more questions. I like the movie better than the book because it is more visual. Although King wrote some vivid, picturesque scenes in his vastly popular work, ""Carrie"" makes for a much clearer screen presence because it is not so jumbled with awkward ideas and interceptive explanations. However, I still dislike the movie. Screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen does not alter King's depiction of the characters-one of the biggest problems with both the movie and the book. The character's in ""Carrie"" both in the movie and in the book, are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The mother is a religious fanatic obsessed with finding forgiveness in everything her daughter does; the kind hearted counselor befriends Carrie, boosting her confidence to where she actually has the courage to accept a young man's invitation to the upcoming prom; the spiteful schoolgirls, obsessed with self-image and popularity, vow for revenge against Carrie, when Carrie herself was simply a victim of cruelty; need I go on? The character's are all seen in one light, and one light alone. The kind counselor never does anything mean. Carrie's mother sees everything as a sin against the Lord. Even Carrie herself is over the top in shame, hopelessness, and confusion. I never cared about any of the characters, therefore, instead of being terrified and involved when the film's disappointing but violent climax transpires, I was left analyzing my thoughts of why I didn't care in the least about what happens.""Carrie"" isn't a terrible movie. I liked the scenes at the prom and beyond; it has a good sense of style and momentum. It proves that Lawrence D. Cohen has a mind of his own, instead of using identical material to the novel. But it is overrated, tiresome, and often boring. This is not a scary movie-just a violent, abhorrent one. It contains all the necessary ingredients to make for a tantalizing, suspenseful motion-picture-but it never delivers. There are avid horror principles here, but ""Carrie"" doesn't seem to understand what to do with them.",Carrie
135,virek213,Classic Mix Of Horror And Drama,10,6 July 2001,"From Stephen King's very first novel came this classic 1976 horror film from director Brian De Palma. Alongside Steven Spielberg's JAWS and John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, CARRIE was a 1970s horror masterpiece.Granted, by today's standards of blood, gore, and guts, CARRIE may not seem like much. But almost none of today's horror films manages to be effective as both Horror and Drama as CARRIE is. Yes, there are the classic horror moments (the pig's blood; the firestorm; and the hand-from-the-grave shock at the end, inspired by the equally brilliant DELIVERANCE), and De Palma's direction effectively echoes Hitchcock without ever blatantly imitating the Master. But what makes CARRIE so effective in its story of a repressed high school student who takes telekinetic revenge on those who have humiliated and tormented her once too often is the devastating, Oscar-nominated performance by Sissy Spacek in the title role. There probably isn't anybody else who could have played the part with such devastating effectiveness. Spacek, in fact, may well have given the single greatest performance by an actress in a horror film right here.Pino Donnagio's effective score, which echoes not only Bernard Herrmann but even Stravinsky, tops off one of the most effective, indeed one of the most downright disturbing, horror films of all times. CARRIE is a film that will certainly be remembered long after SCREAM, URBAN LEGEND, and all their myriad clones have been forgotten. It is by any standard one of the most important and disturbing horror films of all times.",Carrie
136,Bogmeister,Taking the Wrong Girl to the Prom,7,13 November 2005,"This is what it boiled down to, isn't it? Taking the wrong girl at the wrong time to the wrong place. By today's standards, this is a classy approach to depicting horror on screen. It builds on the theme of alienation, taken to the Nth degree by circumstances surrounding the sad short life of Carrie White (Spacek). I think it actually improves on some of the points raised in Stephen King's novel. The scorn Carrie endures from her classmates is apparent from the first minute of the film (and who can forget the traumatic shower scene?), but the adults are all presented as clueless dullards, as well. It's a highly disturbing scene when Carrie is attacked by the other girls for her sexual ignorance, but the subtext of sexual repression extends to the scene after the shower, where the school principal gets distracted by the close proximity of the attractive female coach (Buckley), causing him to repeatedly get Carrie's name wrong. Carrie's anguished reaction triggers the early use of her potentially deadly telekinetic powers (powers surfacing after her first period).Everyone's actions, including those of the sympathetic coach, are really geared around being self-serving. The coach is intent on punishing Carrie's classmates with a form of torture, possibly out of guilt for behaving the same way when she was in high school. She makes herself feel better by enforcing this punishment on younger versions of herself. The one good girl (Irving) also decides to help Carrie out of guilt, to make herself feel better. No one really thinks about Carrie herself and this proves to be to everyone's downfall. They happened to pick the wrong girl to mess with - very bad luck all around. The first two acts, a build up to the climactic prom sequence, are just a preparation. We wait for things to go to hell at the prom and they do. The sequence is not very frightening by today's standards. Mostly, you see a water hose go out of control, and director dePalma employs split screens to diffuse the action. Then the two main culprits (Allen & Travolta) are attended to and this revenge (or justice) is also lacklustre.But then we're back at Carrie's house and with her truly creepy mom (Laurie). Ms.White is what actually made the film a shudder to watch, a very unsettling depiction of religious madness. The true climax is Carrie's final confrontation with her mother and it'll stay with the viewer for awhile, whether they like it or not. Then the real shock, the epilogue dream with Irving. If I had to pick the one scariest jolt in all filmdom, it's this. Even watching it repeatedly, knowing what's coming, still makes the hairs on my neck stand up uncontrollably.",Carrie

139,movieguy1021,Carrie: 8/10,8,13 October 2002,"Carrie boomed Sissy Spacek's and John Travolta's career. I understand why.Carrie starts off at a gym locker room, where we find out how much the other kids hate Carrie. But, we find out that Carrie has some powers. Like in other Stephen King book-movies, the supernatural aspect is only minor compared to the rest of the story, but it comes into play at the end. Carrie's mom (Piper Laurie) is an over-protective religious zealot who makes The Royal Tenenbaums seem normal. So Carrie tries to cope with her horrible life, but it's getting tougher and tougher.Spacek is exceptional as Carrie, and I now know why she was nominated for Best Actress. Her emotions are real, not some fake tear drops that make us think she's sad. Either she has great motivation, or she's one of the best actresses of the century (or both!). Laurie was equally good as her mother who locks Carrie up in a closet everytime she thinks that Carrie has sinned. This movie wouldn't be half of what it was if the acting wasn't so great. When Carrie was sad, you were sad. When the other kids ridiculed her, you felt like you wanted to kill the kids. When she smiled, you smiled. Emotions that raw couldn't come from just any movie.If you know me, I'm a stickler for character developement. Carrie didn't take much time, but from the opening scene you knew about Carrie and her weakness. So are the secondary characters; they're nicely developed even if their role isn't that major. Travolta had a miniscule role, but he was fine in it; it led to Grease and Saturday Night Fever.The prom scene has got to be one of the most memorable scenes from a horror movie. That red tint is awesome; it's like a premonition. In fact, the movie is full of premonition: the red tint, the freaky looking voodoo doll, ""They're all going to laugh at you."" I'm assuming that director Brian De Palma meant to put that in, so it just isn't about some supernatural powers, it's also about foreshadowing. Also, I dig that camera movement during the dancing.The blood and gore wasn't held back, but they just put in what was necessary. De Palma obviously stole from Hitchcock's Psycho, mainly the music cue whenever Carrie is using her telepathy. Also, her school, Bates High, is another Psycho refrence.Carrie was also very creepy. It wasn't a thrill-a-minute, but at the ending, that was Scary with a capital S. The last ten or twenty minutes were scare-inducing for sure. That last jump scene in the dream...wow! It's still jumping at me. If there was one complaint I had to do about the movie, it's that it took too much time to get to main scene and the prom went on a little too long, but other than that it's a first class horrror/thriller that any horror buff needs to see.My rating: 8/10Rated R for nudity, some language, and blood.",Carrie

Based on the novel ""Carrie"" by Stephen King the movie stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White a high school senior who is also not a very social person and who gets bullied by other girls in her class and is also has a religious nut for a mother named Margaret (Piper Laurie),also in the movie the only friend she seems to have is her gym teacher Ms. Collins (Betty Buckley), then afterwords a girl in her grade named Sue (Amy Irving) has a conversation with her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom but at first Carrie doesn't know anything about it until Tommy drives over to her house but at first she is very reluctant to accept his offer to take her offer (because she told her mother and was forced to say no) but it would eventually take a few more tries before she accepts his offer. Then the night before the prom starts two teenagers named Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) go to a farm and slaughter a pig and pour it's blood into a bucket in order to ruin Carrie's most exciting moment of her life which I won't give anything else away here. Brian De Palma and his screenwriter Lawrence Cohen do a very good job here at including the jump scares at the right moments. The movie is also ranked with ""Poltergeist"" (1982), ""Psycho"" (1960), and ""The Shining"" (1980) as one of the best horror films ever made. Also Carrie has telekinetic powers which she learned how to use with the sole purpose of defending herself from her own mother and her enemies. The movie behaves like a Hitchcockian thriller that was filmed by a rookie director. Both Spacek and Laurie should have won Oscars for their performances in this movie and both of them gave the best performances of their careers.

143,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"A well carried hit, helped deeply by Travolta and Allen's performances",8,15 March 2013,"Carrie is not a horror movie, I'm fond of. But given that said, it's still a good quality horror movie, from a novel, penned by a horror writer icon. Carrie (Sissy Spacek-perfect) is a student outcast, who at the start, endures a horrible, if intolerable cruelty, that's nothing compared to that trademark scene later, involving pig's blood. Travolta and Allen as high school students, (scene stealers) play such nasty characters, I wouldn't want to imagine characters being real. You so much want them to die, and when they do, it's almost euphoric. That goes too, for Allen's bitchy friend (P.J Soles). Carrie, though has an advantage, a telekinetic ability to make things move, like one instance involving a young boy (Director De Palma's actual son) hitting Carrie with insults, before he's literally tripped up on his bike, with having no understanding of how he ended on the ground as he fondles his sore knee. One high school student, (Amy Irving) and her jock boyfriend (Willian Katt) lagging behind in the acting department, try to help her out. As a favor to Irving she pesters Katt to take Carrie to the prom. He finally succumbs, so you obviously knows what's to ensue, when Carrie who can no longer suppress all her rage and torment, goes full throttle with her special gift, after that sick pig blood stunt (I still recall Soles's sick excited smile) which has tragic consequences for many a party. Allen is such a bi..h in this movie, she really shows us as proved in other films, just what an underrated actress she is. I loved her in Robocop. Her and Travolta make one hell of a couple, and watching P.E. teacher (Betty Buckley) go head to head with Allen was grand. Carrie is a well formulated horror film, every scene fitting the movie perfectly the way pieces fit in a jigsaw.

It was both tragic and thrilling and a real page-turner. The movie is just as good. Usually, book to movie adaptations fail (which has happened a lot to SK's books) or never live up to hype, but this is easily one of the best. With a perfect cast and a competent director, Carrie is easily one of the best horror movies ever made.Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is an unlucky girl. She isn't good at sports and she isn't gorgeous. She is constantly picked on. After a P.E. class, she has her first period. All the girls there throw tampons at her and taunt her. When she goes home her over-religious mother (Piper Laurie) locks her up in a closet. Throughout the movie we follow Carrie and her lead up to the Prom. She manages to get a date with a little help, first she is reluctant to go, but she soon picks up the courage and heads off. The night starts off so well, but will later end up in tragedy.....Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are excellent in this. No wonder they got nominated for Oscars.

I've really grown to like Brian De Palma as a director, ""Mission: Impossible"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and despite pretty bad reviews, I liked ""Mission To Mars"" a lot.  I also saw ""Scarface"" and ""Snake Eyes"", and they were pretty good as well.  Anyhow, back to ""Carrie"".  As I watched the movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a horror movie.  Even after seeing it, I have a hard time calling it a horror movie.  I'm not really sure what I'd call it, but it doesn't seem to be much of a horror movie (although, I can't argue that it DOES have elements of horror in it).I thought the film was very well acted (minus a few scenes that I think could have been done better), and the story was actually pretty good.  The movie really seemed to flow quite well, I wasn't bored at all during the movie, and was interested in all the characters.  All-in-all, I thought it was a very good movie, and I hope that you agree.

I also Loved how she went home. Cleaned up all the Blood off of her body. Her Mother tryed to kill Her. So Carrie Killed Mommy and Burned down the House and Killed the Both of them.
I just loved this Film because they just made one Film called ""CARRIE"" It just made it so much better. Example how many FILM'S are made to many of like. Nightmare on Elm Street 1,2,3,4,5,6 just to many.",Carrie
148,garethcrook,"Good, but...",7,21 November 2020,"This might be controversial, but I'm really not sure this stands up all that well. Sure it's a horror classic and it does leave an impression, it certainly did when I watched it in my teens. Now though it felt a little flat. Granted it starts with a punch. I'd forgotten how intense that first scene in the shower is, with its rip off Psycho audio stabs and the first look at Spacek's piercing stare. From there though it fells like a slow plod waiting game for that bucket of blood. Sissy Spacek is great as the outsider Carrie. Terrorised by her religious nut mother and vile classmates. It's pretty base stuff though. Bullied for being a bit different, pushed to the limits and to the beyond. If it weren't for the telekinesis we'd have no fun a all... how many times I've said that! Sure there's some fun to be had in watching nearly 50 years on, chuckling at the hair, the flares, the tuxes at the prom, but it's all a bit cheesy and schlocky. Like a daytime TV show cut with some B-Movie horror. I'm being harsh I know. I do like it. It is fun. It's classic revenge stuff as Carries goes postal on the entire cast, bad guys and good and 'that' scene is gripping, with its slow repeating shots delaying the inevitable and building to its dress ruining crescendo. Maybe it's one of those films that just doesn't pack the punch after it's first viewing.",Carrie
149,cinematic_aficionado,One of my favourite thrillers,10,29 May 2004,"I have really enjoyed watching Carrie, time and again.It has all the elements I want in a thriller/horror movie. It has suspense, it keeps you interested, quite good soundtrack, you van feel throughout that all builds up to something and the climax is just pure adrenaline. One of the most freaky ever.Though it features a cast of unknown actors (Travolta was not popular at the time), they play very well and the outcome is just fantastic.I would highly recommend Carrie to all thriller lovers as a piece of very good cinematography.10/10",Carrie
150,Nightman85,A thoughtful and engulfing classic!,10,26 July 2006,"Excellent big screen version of author Stephen King's first novel is not only a suspenseful teen drama, but a touching character study too.Social misfit spends her days mocked by her classmates and harassed by her fanatically religious mother, then she discovers that she has the power of telekinesis...Director Brian De Palma made a number of top-notch suspense thrillers during the 70's and Carrie is surely one of his finest works. The story of this film is a compelling one because you not only feel sorry for the teen misfit of the title, but you also want her to find happiness. It all builds into a powerful drama that packs lots of thrills, occasional humor, and strong emotional tones. De Palma lends his usual stylish direction, drawing out the suspense and at times making the movie quite hypnotic with some inventive camera work. The lovely music score of Pino Donaggio is also a nice touch.Perhaps the best thing about this film though is the wonderful cast! Sissy Spacek does a touching portrayal as our title character, who turns to become quite frightening in the climatic prom scene. Piper Laurie is a powerhouse actress in the role of Spacek's crazed mother. Amy Irving is likable as the teen girl who wants to help the outcast. William Katt is strong as the hip jock who becomes one unlucky prom date. Supporting cast Nancy Allen, John Travolta, and Betty Buckley also turn in good performances.Carrie is a classic that should be appreciated by all film lovers, not just those that enjoy the horror genre. It's a must-see.**** out of ****",Carrie

152,jhaggardjr,Very good horror/drama,8,18 November 2001,"""Carrie"" is a movie that launched alot of careers. The movie is based on a novel written by a then unknown horror writer named Stephen King (I believe ""Carrie"" was his first novel). Director Brian DePalma became famous for directing movies with a Hitchcock-style theme (he'd go on to direct ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blow Out"", and ""Body Double""). Sissy Spacek, who plays the title role, received her first Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance as an unpopular girl who's teased continuously by her classmates but then turns the tables on them by using her telekinetic powers as a source for revenge. John Travolta, Amy Irving, and Nancy Allen would go on to bigger projects (Travolta and Allen both teamed up with DePalma for ""Blow Out"", and Allen also starred in ""Dressed to Kill""). And Piper Laurie returned to the big screen as Carrie's religious fanatic mother (she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). ""Carrie"" is one of the better movies based on Stephen King material. It starts off as a strightforward drama, has a few darkly comic moments in between, and ends as a disturbing horror film. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, ""Carrie"" is still effective, thanks in part to the good performances by the entire cast, good screenplay adaptation, and good direction. *** (out of four)",Carrie
153,Ali_John_Catterall,The raven was called Sin,9,19 November 2009,"Brian De Palma's split-screen shocker, where Grease meets American Gothic, remains as powerful and disturbing as all blazes, thanks to its smarter-than-average source material (Stephen King's debut novel); some powerhouse performances (a pitiful Sissy Spacek in the eponymous role and a bonkers Piper Laurie as her religious maniac of a mom); and its unearthly sense of creeping dread.Despite its messy climax (fancy a bucket of pig's blood all down your prom dress, lady?), the Godmother of High School Horrors isn't that saturated with red stuff - a salutary reminder to horror makers that haemoglobin isn't the be-and-end-all of the genre. Then, of course, there's that ending: the most notorious jump-scare in the history of cinema. Gets ya every time.",Carrie
154,JakeBrinkman,"It has it's ups and downs, but it's a breath of fresh air for horror",4,20 November 2019,"Carrie is... interesting. The intro is bad, the story is excellent, the climax is okay, and the ending is terrible. The lows and highs are incredibly unbalanced, making a barely average film overall. The most notable impact the movie has is that it's not a horror movie, but rather the first movie that's about horrific things from the ""monster's"" point of view. It's just as easy to care about the monster as it is for her victims, which is a notable accomplishment.Beginning at the intro, several things right off the bat show poor directing and editing decisions. The locker room nude scenes are disturbingly gratuitous, especially since all of the girls are supposedly high school age and at least one is pre-pubescent. The sound is mixed horribly. Loud and high pitched noises have horrendous audio distortion, so shouts are incomprehensible and screams sound more digital than human. Granted, I'm not sure if the audio is equally bad from every playing source (I watched it on Amazon Prime on a device that handles loud and high-pitched noises well). The ""music"" is terrible, randomly inserting 2-second horror sound clips out of nowhere at absurd times. Lastly, Laurie (the mother) is an awful actress. Carrie has a Southern accent, but her mom keeps switching between American, English, and Scottish dialects, often switching mid-sentence.With the intro out of the way, the story quickly sucked me in. Spacek (Carrie) acts extremely well. It's easy to connect with her plight, and her emotional moments are very convincing. Her struggles and her newfound place in the world carry the movie effortlessly to the climax.*Potential spoilers below*The climax is decent. The split scene was an interesting choice that served well to portray a sense of chaos, and it also helped cover up the fact that things were happening slowly or with poor special effects on either single screen. The brief pause was good to signal the change of pace, and continuing climax at home was exciting. Laurie (the mom) finally starts to occasionally slip into a Southern accent, but now she's switching between 4 dialects instead of 3.Unfortunately the film decides to conclude on the worst of terms with a series of illogical moments. I understand the symbolism of the mom's position, but it's impossible for her to be suspended that way, and it's far too obvious that she's just standing and holding herself. Lying on the floor or on something at an angle would have had the same symbolic effect without breaking the immersion. The entire thing with the house is just stupid. I'm hoping it didn't end up like the dream sequence and that Carrie actually pulled it down, but it didn't seem like it was intentionally done by Carrie if it was her fault. The doctor is an idiot for thinking a high school senior is too young to remember a traumatic event. The music during the conclusion also goes back to the absurdly placed horror sounds.",Carrie
155,AKS-6,Great direction by De Palma,7,27 October 1999,"[This comment contains SPOILERS.]I have seen ""Carrie"" two times. The last time was just the other night, the first time was when I was very young, probably around ten or eleven years old. As those of you who have seen this film can imagine, I was scared half to death watching ""Carrie"" the first time. The scene where the mother gets crucified was very disturbing to me back then. Well, that was ten years ago and I must say that the film did not scare me this time. I still find it rather unsettling, but not scary.However, the film is great!! It may seem contradictory to say that a horror film that didn't scare me is great, but it's not [contradictory]. Brian De Palma has put the film together in such a brilliant way that everyone, whether they are scared or not, must admit that it's a good film. The editing (great use of split screens), the acting, the weird camera angles (e.g. when Carrie and Tom are dancing), the music, the script
I really liked this film, and one thing *did* actually make me jump: the final scene involving Sue and an arm that looks uncannily like Carrie's... I give this film 7/10. Yet, I can't stop thinking about how great this film would have been if it had ignored the horror in Stephen King's novel and skipped the bloodbath at the end and written another ending. I know that seems contradictory as well, but I really think that De Palma handled the bullying, the pain Carrie feels, and her problems with her mum in a brilliant way. The horror didn't have to be there at all, as the story is so strong in itself. Just a thought.",Carrie
156,DavidSim240183,Slightly flawed. But Carrie is a must-see,8,21 February 2007,"Carrie was the first novel to be written by Stephen King. Although I'm not sure if it could really be called a novel because its so short. 240 pages which is not very long. Carrie is a story that would have looked better in a novella. But since it was King's first story, it was forced to stand alone. And a compelling page turner it was too.The story of a lonely, sheltered and emotionally stunted girl who after years of being bullied by her classmates and tormented by her religious fanatic mother develops telekinesis when she gets upset. The book took a third person viewpoint made up mostly of interviews and documentaries, but the film takes a more standard approach from Carrie's POV.The film begins in the girls locker room. After being humiliated in a game of volleyball, it gets worse when Carrie has her first period in the showers. The girls being the complete bitches that they are show no sympathy at all.Carrie gets no support from her mother either. Margaret (a larger than life Piper Laurie) is a devout Christian who believes sex is forbidden and all men are evil. When she learns of her daughter's first period, she believes its a sign of evil coming out in Carrie. Margaret forces her beliefs onto her daughter in bizarre ways like shutting her up in a cupboard, and making her pray to a grotesque shrine of Our Lord's crucifixion.Carrie's inner turmoil gets to the point where she can move things with her mind. Director Brian De Palma is careful the way he shows off her developing power. Small touches like Carrie forcing a kid off his bike and making a mirror shatter (although De Palma has an annoying habit of using a Psycho-like musical score during these moments) are early signs of bigger things to come.Nancy Allen is a revelation as Chris Hargenson, the bitchy ringleader of all the girls who torture Carrie. When she gets forbidden from attending the Senior Prom because of what happened in the showers, she's the one who comes up with the ultimate humiliation. On the night, Chris rigs a bucket of pigs blood to be dumped on Carrie in front of everyone. The moment where she unleashes her power in all its fury.For the most part, the film version of Carrie is a largely successful rendering of the book. De Palma's direction is solid and efficient and also has some nifty flourishes too. One set-piece that stands out in my mind (moreso than the Prom) is the very creepy scene when Carrie and Margaret are having dinner in front of a painting of The Last Supper. The cinematography bathes the room in complete darkness, illuminated only by their presence.Also De Palma does a quite superb job of setting up Carrie's eventual humiliation. Starting with the shower scene. Which in turn leads to one of the girls regretting her actions, and setting up her boyfriend to take Carrie to the Prom. While at the same time Chris is working out her own malicious scheme. And its all perfectly capped when it seems Carrie has finally got what she's always wanted. Acceptance. Which is all shattered in an instant when Chris plays her hand.The film wouldn't be half as effective as it is without superb acting, and generating real sympathy for Carrie. And it has to be said Sissy Spacek was a real find. She makes you really feel for Carrie and her torments. And the way her extraordinarily bright eyes communicate volumes about her pain makes her performance all the more impressive.Piper Laurie is not far behind. She gives total conviction to what is essentially a raging lunatic. When she's giving speeches about God's plan for us all, she sounds like she really believes what she's saying. Its a role that borders on parody but somehow Laurie convinces us.Carrie does suffer from a few flaws though. Although the Prom scene is the one moment everybody talks about, I felt it was a little rushed. Its supposed to be a culmination of years of pain and torment being unleashed, and its surprisingly over in a matter of minutes. Not to mention the fact De Palma can't resist shooting the scene in split screen which is only distracting. It doesn't add anything.Carrie is also a film that looks very dated. The fashions and hairstyles had me in hysterics at times. The scenes with light, bouncy 70s music just don't work at all, and doesn't fit the tone of the film. And the ending falls into cliché more often than not. It resembles a few too many slasher movies. The idea of Carrie's home falling into a fiery pit of her own creation is innovative. But that final scene is a bit hackneyed and doesn't make much sense. Even though its a genuine shocker.But I still recommend Carrie. It may have dated over time. But it still holds a certain power. And anyone who's ever felt like an outsider will find much to admire.",Carrie
157,gibbs-18172,Original and the best version by far,10,21 March 2020,"Way back in 76 before Danny Zuco had tried winning the heart of Sandy or had been struck down with Saturday Night Fever he was slaughtering pigs and knocking around with girls that were still in college ( yes i know he went back to Rydale High later).
He was also terrorising Sissy Spaceck who out of 4 attempts (76,02,12 carrie 2 rage) the queen of them all.I will pick apart the others in their own reviews but this classic King adoption remains one of his finest works, one of the greatest films i saw as a kid on videotape and without the multi million CGI and SFX that we have now or what the other 2 versions had in the 21st century at their disposal.This depended on good old fashioned acting capabilities, you feel for Carrie from the Start and Sissy takes you with her on such a ride that at the end you actually cheer inside even though you know its wrong.A tale of the bully and the bullied both loosing.

158,emperor_bender,"Pretty good, but not what I could call ""Stephen King classic""",6,22 February 2008,"This film was very interesting. There were a lot of ups and downs throughout. I liked this movie, I really did. I liked a good portion of the characters, and the story was well-told. But this just isn't my favorite King movie by a long-shot. I know I sound sadistic since this is his first book-movie adaptation, but I just can't honestly say this is my favorite movie. But don't let that stop you from watching it. It was well made and everything. My biggest grievances are the pacing of the movie, some plot holes, and some of the characters. The pacing here was off, things that should have taken place didn't, or took too long to. Some things in the movie were not fully explained either (like why Chris is such a bitch). And some characters needed to be taken out (like Chris, again). Chris was an angry bitch for seemingly no reason whatsoever. John Travolta's character didn't seem to have a mind of his own. I don't know why his name is on the DVD cover (It says ""Sissy Spacek / John Travolta""). Hes not even much of a main character and is WAY overshadowed by the annoying girlfriend Chris. The ending was sort of lousy as well...but, I don't rate movies badly just for a few flaws. Which is why I gave this a 6/10 and not a 1/10 (as over-dramatic movie nerds do just because a movie has some flaws). I recommend this movie to fans of Horror/Drama movies. 6/10.",Carrie
159,Gafke,"Queen Bees, Wannabes and Carrie...",10,10 January 2004,"Nowadays, we have literal truck loads of books on how to deal with our tormented teenage daughters. We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film ""Carrie"" already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film - to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens, who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period - incredibly late - finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out. Of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing. With her the onset of her menstrual cycle, her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately, no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell, her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody, fiery apocalypse, as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course.Carrie is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed. It features great performances by Sissy Spacek as the severely damaged Carrie, Piper Laurie as her delusional mother, Amy Irving as the one teenage girl with a streak of compassion and guilt and Nancy Allen as every nerds nightmare - the Popular Girl with no morals, no feelings and no mercy.For having been written by a man (Stephen Kings first novel) this is a powerful portrait of what it is like to be a teenage girl...and an outcast one at that. The hope, the anger and frustration, all are strong and realistically portrayed. This is a film about the monster within us all.",Carrie
160,EthanBJones_03,Recommended,6,27 October 2017,"'CARRIE' - 1976Directed by Brian De Palma{The Wedding Party; Singers}Starring Sissy Spacek{Prime Cut; Badlands}, Piper Laurie{The Hustler; Son of Ali Baba} and Nancy Allen{The Last Detail; Forced Entry}Plot Overview: Carrie(Sissy Spacek{ is a young girl, in highschool, who is bullied for being different and every night must go home to her abusive, religious mother. After Carrie receives her first period, in the middle of school, her bullying becomes more frequent, all the way until she is about to burst.Before I watched this movie, I made sure to read King's novel. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. So I went into this movie rather excited about the possibilities. And after watching it; it was fine. Yeah. It was alright. I liked some changes, disliked others. I wouldn't gloat about it being a masterpiece but I certainly wouldn't dismiss it as awful. It's a fine movie. That's the best way I can sum it up.What are the movie's main positives? Sissy Spacek as Carrie was a phenomenal performance. In a disturbing way, I bought into her being a depressed, troubled, poor, tortured soul, and constantly felt sorry for her in all the barbaric abuse she had to put up with. It was a performance that could have certainly won an Oscar; it was that good.Another excellent performance would be Piper Laurie as Carrie's mum. THIS was a genuinely terrifying performance. I don't like religious nut jobs at the best of times so one of them having complete power and control and dominion over me is scary enough. Add Laurie's twisted and demonic performance as the literal embodiment of Satan, and you've got a fantastic, chilling and memorable performance that could also have EASILY won the Oscar.Most of the remainder of the acting(except one person) was pretty good. Nancy Allen was great as the sadistic and cruel Chris. Amy Irving succeeded in her limited screen time at portraying the remorseful and sorrowful Sue. William Katt was also good as the cheerful and helpful Tommy Ross. With the exception of one person, no one did a genuinely poor performance in this movie, for me at least.Another massive praise I can give the movie is the remarkably unsettling way it is shot and edited together. De Palma's remarkable skills made moments in this movie chill me to the bone. I was constantly uneasy and on the edge of my seat, and De Palma masterfully drums up atmosphere and suspense until we reach the climax. Pino Donaggio's excellent score also helps in this brilliant creation of suspense and makes the movie constantly put me on edge.I love the original Stephen King story and therefore the aspects that do carry over are excellent and horrifying to behold. They do, however, make quite a number of changes. One of these changes, I absolutely loved. I won't spoil it but it was a genuinely creepy and horrifying moment of the film. It legitimately sent goosebumps and shivers down my spine. That is the only change I liked however, which I will now elaborate on.Obviously books cannot be translated to film word for word, and things either need to be altered, removed or condensed to make it a pleasant viewing experience. But the sheer amount of the third act that they condensed down made it annoying to watch. I was looking forward to seeing certain scenes and moments but they either cut it out COMPLETELY or edited it drastically. One of them was a specific way in which something happens to a major character. They COMPLETELY change how this happens to them and I really, really disliked that. The movie would have been fine at 2 hours, if they let the third act flourish like it was supposed to.And now for that actor who I mentioned before. John 'The Madman' Travolta. I have no issues with this man. Is he mentally unstable? Yes! Does this benefit his roles? Of course! Is he at least a fun actor? Definitely! I don't have issues with the man as an actor but there was something about him in this movie that I just REALLY did not like. He just wasn't that good in the movie. The character he plays was a very interesting one in the novel. I was pleased with how much of the character remained but not with how they portrayed him. I just think that Travolta was the wrong guy to cast in this role. He doesn't fit the role, in my honest opinion. Overall, I do like this movie. It maintains chunks of the original story, each of which is a delight to see on screen. It contains a steady series of excellent performances, and it features a very uneasy atmosphere. But I detest how much they altered the third act. I feel a little bad for marking it down so much but I really think it shouldn't have been changed. The climax of King's novel was fantastic, this is just lazy and uninteresting. But as a whole I do recommend this movie. I'll rate this movie 6 'Disturbing Shower Scenes' out of 10!",Carrie
161,Marc_Israel_365,To the Devil with false modesty!,8,30 April 2013,"Sissy Spacek made Carrie an anti-hero as the sympathetic mousy creature coming into her own being as a teenager and, of course, a telekinetic freak of nature. Piper Laurie is possessed as the jilted bible spewing sinner of a mother while Nancy Allen, John Travolta and Amy Irving bring the confusing high school years back to life. As the telekinesis is shown and not overly explained, it is the drama and action that take center stage. Brian DePalma' s stylish treatment of Steven King's classic hasn't faded too much despite the TV movie score. Yes, high schoolers are cruel kids to those not in the clique, but is revenge so sweet? The last 30 minutes may even keep you away from high school reunions. The special effects don't always sail but this prom night has gone down in horror history and up in flames!",Carrie

Sissy Spacek is excellent as the outcast Carrie White.I'm not giving it a 10 because early in the film they're playing volleyball on concrete (with too many players on one side), which would cause a lot of injuries to the players. It's played on grass, sand, on a smooth surface indoors or in water. Also, because of the ridiculous line by Sue's mother at the end, claiming that she's young enough that she'll forget about the massacre that she witnessed - she's 18, not 3!",Carrie
163,tankace,How bullying and puberty affect a person.,9,29 August 2017,"Carrie is one of the most iconic horror film in history and De Palma directing and shooting makes you understand everything by the images and cinematography ,how the characters feel, why they feel like that. The result is you can understand their actions through the film and their motivations, though at times a bit shallow, you can get why they do it. Also Brian De Palma shows very well the working of the senior high school students, from the unnamed hierarchy, to the cruelty the teens are capable off it goes with out saying if you had a difficult years in school you will sympathize with Carrie and even rude for her. An other thing worth mentioning is that the cruelty in house and at school can twist the way a person sees things and in the final scene of the infamous school dance we see that in a very realistic and disturbing manner. As for the subject of puberty is demonstrated by the telekinetic powers Carrie gains after her first Luteal phase. And gradually she starts to disobey her religiously fanatical mother, accepting complements as a good thing and even dancing with her cavalier. However there is and a dark side to that : she can now pretty easily hurt anyone how hurts her physically or emotionally and it is dangerous as innocent people may and do get in the cross fires.In general puberty is depicted like a new power coming out from the person and there two bad outcomes from it :When it isn't put in check becomes cruelty (seen in the girls bullying Carrie).The other possibility is when it comes in the hands of a person who was continuously bullied then the tables are turned and the hunted becomes the hunter, basically the quote of Nietzsche ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee."" becomes a reality ,just showing that the goodness and kindness how can be lost and even the most cruel maybe they do it just to get respect like in high school of instance.OK I will close mist analyses here for I may over did it. However this is a great adaptation of Steven King and perhaps the most faithful book-to-film take from all the films and series that have been based from his work so far ,together with the Green Mile, Misery and Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.",Carrie
164,akshatmahajan,Why is it cult classic?,6,6 July 2021,"I never intended to watch Carrie but after reading so much about it's legacy and cult following, I decided to watch it.Movie's story was different for that time and could have been a better movie if there would have been better direction and execution. There were a lot of ups and downs throughout. The story was well-told but the pacing of the movie was bad. The pacing here was off, things that should have taken place didn't, or took too long to.Also, there were some plot holes and some of the characters performance were so bad. Some things in the movie were not fully explained either, it was just like story is going on without any reason. Showing climax in split screen was worst idea. Thr climax could have been so much effective but it was just fire and scream.Overall, you should not watch this movie because of it's has cult following but you should watch it if you like old time horror/ drama/ psychological thriller.",Carrie
165,glgioia,Old before its time?,6,19 July 2009,"Stephen King's modern classic about high school bullying with a little dark supernatural sprinkled in of course. It is over 30 years old, but it watches much older mainly because DePalma is as usual trying way too hard to homage/imitate someone else's direction style while at the same time putting way too indelible of a 70s dorkism stamp on the texture. Much about the pop culture of the 70s is rather non-nostalgic and cringing camp, and a film like this one so completely bathed in the decade's cheap cologne, very justifiably suffers. Carrie has some effective horror scenes, maybe even a couple iconic ones, but these are too often followed by wandering Film School exercises that leave you scratching your head as to the whereabouts of an editor. The background score is soap opera grade and distracting. The performances are very good and the casting of the hate-ables is spot on. PJ Soles and the chubby obnoxious guy from Miami Vice shine as the hard to look at, too cool for school loathsome antagonists. Yet as with virtually all King works, the book is more satisfying than the film for lots of reasons. You lump all of these many negatives together, and the result is a film that really can no longer be watched in its entirety and survives only for about 15 minutes of its effective and disturbing horror imagery, which Im sure you could just you-tube and spare yourself a wasted evening.",Carrie
166,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Deserves it's reputation.,8,8 March 2012,"The opening credits scene in Brian De Palma's Carrie shows us the inside of a high school girl's locker room, De Palma immediately using his angelic tone as he slo-mos through shots of naked girls frolicking around with each other. Watching this scene I became very worried, fearing that De Palma was going to turn in another one of his D-grade faux-porno disasters and that this was going to be an unfortunate experience for me. We eventually get to the titular girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who sensually soaps herself up in the shower before having her first period, which she responds to by screaming for help, clawing at her classmates and then being bombarded by them throwing pads and tampons at her. For me, it all came off as hilarious in the worst of ways, and I was most certainly worried about the outcome of the film.About half an hour later all of my fears were gone, as Carrie quickly made a turn from this bizarre camp into something much more sinister and wickedly entertaining. De Palma has certainly delved into the camp before to mixed results, but here he transcends it, creating a high-drama high school horror that is exhilarating, hilarious at times and at others downright chilling. None of this could be achieved without Spacek's performance at it's center, a stunningly immersed work that dives right into the insecurities and pain of this character. Anyone who has been bullied in school can find something to relate with in her and I found myself going right on the same emotional journey with her, all thanks to Spacek's wonderfully empathetic work. It's an impressive evolution she goes down, from the mousy abused to the terrifyingly powerful, and Spacek is convincing for every moment.Special note should also be given to Piper Laurie who, as Carrie's psychotically religious mother, brings an intimidating terror into every moment. There are some scenes that sent chills through my bones but none did it more than the image of Laurie chasing us through the house with a knife in her hand and a haunting grin across her face. Boosted by these great performances, De Palma is able to bring his high school hell motif full circle in wonderfully entertaining ways. That angelic tone that he establishes right off the bat is present for the whole thing and just becomes more and more appropriate as the film gets deeper into it's religious themes.Even my complaints with the shower sequence ended up being thrown out the window when things came around to the bathing scene in the final act. The contrast between these two scenes was so well-done, perfectly capturing the evolution of this character. When we first see Carrie in that shower she is so lost and insecure, and the small appearance of blood sends her into a frenzy. Then, when she gets into her tub at the end she is literally bathing in blood, but she has no fear or nerves. She is calm, the blood serving almost as a catharsis, a rebirth for her. It's a serene quality, making the next moments all the more frightening. I do think that there are some sequences that De Palma drags out a little too much, trying to utilize a building suspense when his talent for thrills really lies in a more in-your-face approach. It's a small complaint though and only occurred once or twice in an otherwise high energy horror classic.",Carrie
167,jayjaycee,"Chillingly crafted, atmospheric adaptation",8,8 October 2020,"""Carrie"" is a 1976 horror film directed by Brian De Palma starring Sissie Spacek and Piper Laurie.
⚪
All in all, the first adaption of Stephen King's breakthrough novel casts a spell by superbly mixing high school angst and familial burden with the occult and supernatural, and thus sensitively shows, by the example of one outcast girl, dazzlingly portrayed by a young Sissie Spacek, what bullying and oppression might cause and that growing up as teenager among teenagers is a real horror many tend to underestimate.
⚪
The movie for day seven is a debutant of last year that bewitched me so much that it has since then received a fixed spot in my annual Spooktober schedule, and hence I also own this absolutely stunning mediabook. Stephen King has been my literary idol since my teen years and I have read almost every single one of his stories, hence it is a shame to admit that I still haven't got around reading the source material to this one. Regardless of how great or terrible the original novel might be, this adaptation is terrific as a film in general. Years before De Palma depicted the rise and fall of Tony Montana in the masterful ""Scarface"", he brought the tale of a shy girl with telekinetic abilities to life and created a moody horror flick that has written movie history ever since. Aside from the eclectic subject matter, that ranges from popularity things in high school, bullying and growing up in a toxic household to telekinesis, religious fanatism and believes, it is even crafted in a skilful way as well. The cinematography and editing allow the viewer to feel the whole story on an extremely close level, and the musical score rounds it up even more perfectly. I always feel bad for Carrie, the awkward but in fact pretty outsider, and thanks to the memorable performance by Sissie Spacek, identify with her a lot. As someone who hasn't had the greatest time during high school, I can confirm that the whole concept offers many occasions of unsuspected terror, and this film perfectly captures a myriad of those situations. From the infamous shower scene to the gruesome finale at the prom, it is a fantastically captured, superbly built up experience. It also wouldn't be as astonishing as it is, if it wasn't for the equally mesmerizing performance of Piper Laurie as Margaret White, the fanatic, overprotective mother of our protagonist. As I mentioned already last year, their chemistry is genuinely impressive and a reason why it all appears so incredibly realistic. Oh, and it has wunderkind John Travolta in one of his early roles. Can it be terrible, then? Well, all fun put aside, I extremely adore this classic and love to rewatch it at least once a year. De Palma achieved something memorable and set the bar very high. In case you still don't know what I mean, this year I will also be checking out the remake as well. I remain curious and definitely don't want to underestimate Carrie at all... Just saying.",Carrie
168,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Scary And Suspenseful Horror Classic With A Brilliant Performance From Sissy Spacek. Brian De Palma And Stephen King At Their Best.",10,23 November 2013,"Carrie is one of the greatest Horror Films ever made,an Excellent,Scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is filled with amazing direction,great performances from Sissy Spacek and the rest of the cast,a fantastic script and a beautiful,haunting film score. All those elements make Carrie a classic and Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,Carrie tells the story of Carrie White(Sissy Spacek),a quiet and shy 17-year-old girl who is bullied and tormented by her High School classmates and lives with her Mother Margaret White(Piper Laurie),a religious fanatic. While at school,Carrie discovers she has telekinetic powers,an ability to move things with her mind. Later,Carrie is asked to the prom by popular classmate Tommy Ross(William Katt). Unfortunately,Carrie and Tommy don't know that there is a prank planned for Carrie at the prom and the prank will lead to deadly and tragic consequences. Carrie is an brilliant film from beginning to end and was an amazing breakthrough film for director Brian De Palma and Author Stephen King because it was the first big box office hit for De Palma and the first Stephen King adaptation to the big screen while also being one of the all time great Horror movie classics and one of the best Stephen King adaptations. Carrie is a great movie that is very scary,powerful and truly suspenseful,intense and dramatic,stylish and tragic and is a movie that will haunt you not just physically but mentally as well from the first time you watch it. I think one of the reasons Carrie is not only a Horror classic but a classic film in general is the way it deals with themes such as bullying,revenge,being an outcast,wanting to be accepted by your peers as well as dealing with the strings and arrows of teenage life and all of those themes in the film will always be relevant and timeless because there will always be bullying and feelings of being an outcast among people of all ages. Carrie is scary and suspenseful because this film deals with monsters not Zombies,Vampires or large Werewolves but a monster of a different kind:human beings. While there are good human beings in the film like Carrie and a few other people, the other human beings in the film are evil beyond redemption because of the things the evil characters do to Carrie. The film is also scary in the situations and haunting imagery that director Brian De Palma shows which is very nightmarish and dream like that makes the movie frightening,disturbing and atmospheric. The suspense in Carrie is done with great build-up the most suspenseful sequence in the film being the now famous prom scene which is one of the greatest scenes in movie history. What's amazing about the prom scene is the way De Palma builds the tension with the prom scene with Horror,romance,terror and dread all at once and when the build-up stops there is a terrific pay off that is scary and powerful. The prom scene and the whole film in general is a Cinderella story with a Brian De Palma and Stephen King twist. Carrie is a movie that also works as a great character study of Carrie White one of the finest and iconic characters in the history of movies and literature. Right from the very start of the film we as a viewer relate with Carrie because like Carrie most of us have been outcasts,had no friends or have been bullied to the point where we want revenge on our tormentors. When we see the relationship with Carrie's Mother we sympathize with Carrie because of the torture she goes through living with her Mother and we root for Carrie succeed and not to live in fear. Carrie is a classic character that you will never forget and one of cinemas definitive outcasts and anti hero's. The screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen is terrific and mostly stays true to Stephen King's book while taking out the Crime Drama flashback element of the novel and making the story leaner and meatier. The ending of Carrie is amazing and one of the scariest and greatest endings in movie history that will shock and chill you to the bone and make you jump out of your seat. A classic ending.The whole cast is great. Sissy Spacek gives an excellent,unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance as Carrie White,with Spacek bringing depth,sympathy and sadness to the role. A powerful performance by Spacek. Piper Laurie is brilliant in her Oscar nominated role as Carrie's Mother Margaret White,with Laurie being scary,terrifying and having great scenes with Spacek. Amy Irving is wonderful as Sue Snell,a classmate that wants to help Carrie. William Katt is terrific as Tommy Ross,Sue's boyfriend and Carrie's prom date. Nancy Allen is great as Chris,one of Carrie's bullies. John Travolta(in his film debut)is outstanding and funny as Billy,Chris' boyfriend. Betty Buckley is fantastic as Miss Collins,Carrie's coach. P.J Soles is fun and memorable as Norma,one of Chris' friends.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera and bringing a haunting and beautiful visual style to the film. De Palma also uses his trademark split screen shots for one of the suspenseful scenes in the film. Amazing direction,De Palma.The score by Pino Donggaio is fantastic,haunting,beautiful,intense and truly adds to the film's nightmarish tone. Powerful score,Donggaio.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Brian De Palma,Stephen King,Sissy Spacek,or films in general,I highly suggest you see,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror classic that is Brian De Palma and Stephen King at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Carrie
169,GeorgeRoots,She's With The Most Popular Boy In School...,9,29 November 2013,"I don't know why, but that's one of many lines uttered in the original trailer that just lingers in my head. Cue the haunting lullaby jingle, and the best prom scenes ever committed to film in their hazy, unearthly quality. All have gone on to cement Carrie's legacy with utter charm, featuring superb performances from both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.Stephen King's first ever published novel. Carrie (Sissy Spacek) is a bullied girl, who lives with her very over bearing Christian mother. She has her first period embarrassingly in the girls locker room, and afterwards bizarrely begins to develop telekinesis. What begins as a simple regret and apology from one of her classmates, another girl has ridiculously cruel intentions that will affect prom night and everyone attending.A wonderful set-up, leads to a wonderfully crafted movie. Brian De Palma had brought to screen a wonderfully clean, so-so horror story with great success. In the wake of many other heavy hitters such as ""The Exorcist"" (1973), ""The Omen"" (1976) and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) etc. Sissy gives us a teenager all too real, and saddens me that the genre has lost these strengths and character qualities in most horror movies nowadays.Final Verdict: A very re-watchable and timeless classic, that has gone on to influence pop culture and so much more. A definite must see. 9/10.",Carrie
170,mnpollio,Never a huge fan of this film,6,22 April 2008,"I have always had a hard time understanding the love that people have for this film. While billed as a horror thriller, even as a kid I never found it especially scary or thrilling. I think part of that comes from making the protagonist so identifiably sympathetic and the targets of her climactic wrath so ridiculously villainous that one can only walk away thinking the majority had it coming. I have never read Stephen King's original novel so I did have a fresh take when watching the film, and I had a hard time with some of it. It would still be a few years before director Brian DePalma hit his stride with Dressed to Kill, Blow Out and The Untouchables (before falling into veritable obscurity), and I find his direction really uneven and awkward here. The film seems to veer in tone from dead serious scenes to comical scenes that seem to come from a teen sex comedy of the era. DePalma is also overly impressed with utilizing cinematic trick shots, like split screens and fast-motion, which are distracting and really add nothing to the mix. The underdog theme really appeals to me, but the details of the story are unconvincing. For instance, I know that there were (and are) mean people in high school, but I don't believe that I have ever seen such en masse nastiness as what is depicted here - it is so over-the-top as to suggest a misogynistic fever dream. Carrie is relentlessly brutalized at school and at home, and only some of the time are the actions of the perpetrators believable. In light of this, Carrie's gift never seems much of a ""curse"" and one just sits back waiting for her to vent her rage. Some of the issues I have are this:1. The trick played on Carrie seems to me a bit ridiculous and disgusting. I really envision very few teenagers (OK, truly none) coming up with such an idea, especially involving the murder and mutilation of animals to obtain a copious amount of blood to throw on her, when any easily obtainable liquid substance would do for their purposes. Plus the unreliable positioning of the bucket with a single rope - chances are the blood would have gone everywhere but on the target.2. Are we really expected to believe that after such a ghastly incident all of the students and teachers would then laugh hysterically over the event without making any move to help her, including the sympathetic gym teacher who has acted like a mentor to her? One poster suggested that the universal laughing was in Carrie's mind, but after several viewings of the film there is nothing to suggest that the laughing is anything but literal as depicted by DePalma. As such, their reactions are completely ridiculous.3. Finally, are we really expected to believe that Carrie in her rage would ultimately harm or kill the people who have shown her kindness along with everyone else? Not only did her date appear to be falling for her and conducted himself like a true gentleman, but it was obvious even to her that he was shocked by the trick and was almost immediately injured in its aftermath (in a really stupid way!). Are we to believe that with the type of person Carrie was that she would thoughtlessly allow the unconscious guy to burn to death in the flames? Not to mention to cruel way that she dispatches the gym teacher.The film does have another great thing going for it other than its underdog story, and this helps lift above the mundane and silly. DePalma either had a great eye for casting or a superlative casting agent. Sissy Spacek was fully worth her Oscar nomination and cuts a sympathetic and appealing figure as Carrie. Piper Laurie is a cruel delight as the quintessential religious zealot as depicted back in the days when such people were considered fringe lunatics rather than mainstream Americans (oh, the good old days!). While their characters are unbelievable, both Nancy Allen and John Travolta turn in memorably vicious efforts as the ""masterminds"" behind the plot. William Katt, Amy Irving and Betty Buckley are all appealing as the various people who take Carrie under their wing and unwittingly set her up for the fall.",Carrie
171,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Wonderful,7,18 June 2008,"This terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel was directed by shock maestro Brian De Palma for maximum, no-holds-barred effect. Sissy Spacek stars as Carrie White, the beleaguered daughter of a religious kook (Piper Laurie) and a social outcast tormented by her cruel, insensitive classmates. When her rage turns into telekinetic powers, however, school's out in every sense of the word. De Palma's horrific climax in a school gym lingers forever in the memory, though the film is also built upon Spacek's remarkable performance and Piper Laurie's outlandishly creepy one. John Travolta has a small part as a thug, De Palma's future wife, Nancy Allen, is his girlfriend, and Amy Irving makes her screen debut as one of the girls giving Carrie a hard time.",Carrie
172,ThrownMuse,the horror of menstruation,7,16 January 2005,"A sheltered teenage girl is viciously taunted by her classmates and abused by her religious fanatic mother. With the onset of menarche, she realizes that she has telekinetic powers. Like many horror films in the 70s, this one moves at a slow pace and culminates in a shocking horrifying extravaganza.Carrie was a personal favorite of mine when I was a teenager. Watching it as an adult, I look back on it fondly, but it isn't as exceptional as I once thought it was. I suppose I identified with Carrie and saw her as a sort of an icon. Now I am able to see beyond that and pick-up on other themes of the movie that are simultaneously frustrating (considering the film is both written and directed by men) and intriguing. Most significantly, Carrie's special powers are associated with her first menstruation, and ""becoming a woman."" Her mother treats Carrie's first period as evil--Eve's first sin is also Carrie's sin and she needs to repent for the rest of her life. Carrie ignores this at first, but ultimately believes that her mother (who we find is a ""woman scorned"") is right, as illustrated by the notorious pigs' blood scene. This is a much more complex theme than I initially realized, and it could be read as either slightly feminist or slightly misogynist, depending on how you interpret it.On to the performances. It is hard to believe the lead actresses were nominated for Oscars for their roles. Piper Laurie terribly overacts (apparently she thought the film would be a comedy, so this is likely De Palma's fault) and Sissy Spacek's performance makes Carrie seem more ""special"" than sheltered and abused. The movie does feature some incredible and innovative camera shots that are always fun to watch. I still enjoy Carrie, but not as much as I did when I was a mad-as-hell teenager. My Rating: 7/10",Carrie

174,Emerenciano,Enough to have a good time,7,22 April 2002,"""Carrie"" is not and unforgettable movie, but it is good enough to make people sit back and enjoy 100 minutes of talented Sissy Spacek, playing the protagonist who has the power to make things move by using the power of her mind. It's not the first or last movie about telekinesis, but Spacek's achievement and De Palma's direction makes it good and enjoyable.Nothing but a simple ""senior prom"" movie in the first half, ""Carrie"" becomes an interesting thriller in the last 30 minutes or so. Actually it may be considered a terror movie, but with no exaggeration in the visual effects. Of course it was made 26 years ago, but tons of make up and blood wouldn't fit ""Carrie"". It would certainly spoil the plot.John Travolta, Amy Irwing and Nancy Allen, young actors at the time, are also in this movie. My rate 7/10",Carrie
175,I_Am_The_Taylrus,A Great Horror Film(SPOILERS),8,18 February 2007,"SPOILERSI really enjoy watching movies based on Stephen King's novels. My favorite is the Shining. Carrie is a very good movie based on his novel, but it is not as good as everyone says. Still, it is an entertaining and scary movie. There are not a lot of scares in the film, but the end is shocking, even though every horror fan knows it. Anyway, there are not a lot of scary scares in this film, despite the fact that this film is haunting.Here is the plot of Carrie. Carrie is about a teenager named, well, Carrie. I never would have expected that. Anyway, Carrie is constantly teased and abused at her high school. If that was not bad enough, she is forced to live with her abusive and ultra-religious mother. Carrie has telekinesis, though. Anyway, a girl named Sue feels sorry for Carrie so Sue asks her boyfriend named Tommy to go to the prom with her. At the prom Carrie and Tommy are elected Prom King and Queen. Then pig blood is dumped on Carrie. She goes insane. She uses her telekinesis to burn down the school and kill everyone, except for Sue. Carrie goes back to here house and kills her mother after she tries to kill her. Then Carrie accidentally uses her telekinesis to smash down the house, killing her, too. Sue puts flowers on Carrie's grave. Then a hand pops out of the grave, but it was all a dream.Overall, this is a fantastic movie. By the way, the hand popping out of Carrie's grave was a dream, not the whole movie was a dream. The hand was obviously Carrie's hand, by the way. Anyway, this is an entertaining and haunting movie that a fan of horror will enjoy. You will also feel very bad for Carrie. Her telekinesis went just too far. You will also feel very bad that she dies. The acting in this film was great, from being ultra-religious to making people feel sorry for you to making people care less about you. This is a great film, just, in my opinion, not as good as everyone says.8/10Recommended Films: The Rage, Misery, and the Shining.",Carrie

The other girls taunt her mercilessly, throwing Tampax at her and screaming 'PLUG IT UP, PLUG IT UP!'. The gym teacher (Betty Buckley) gives detention to all the girls, and refusal of their Prom tickets (if only she actually DID prevent all of them from going to their Prom) if they don't do it.School bully Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) has an argument with the teacher, and ends up slapped (very deservedly!), but most importantly, excluded from the Prom. So, when she finds out Carrie, who is trying to become her own person and get away from her mother, will go to the Prom with none other than Tommy Ross (William Katt with the Perm From Hell), one of the most Popular Guys in their High School and boyfriend of Sue Snell (Amy Irving in her first movie role), who felt guilty for the 'plug it up' affair and decided to help Carrie, Christine (curiously, a name reused by King for another source of Evil - the car Christine from the book (and film) of the same title) decides to get help from her boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) and prepare a heinous joke - a bucket of pig's blood, ready to be dumped on Carrie just as she is going to be the happiest she'll ever be.Little does anyone know Carrie has the psychic power of telekinesis, enabling her to move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind...Probably, it's weird to say it, but 'Carrie' is the movie that illustrates best the issues of bullism and faints, and blows the pathetic stereotype of girls being all best friends of each other, swapping makeup and gossiping about boys to shreds, Modern Feminism be damned.A movie not to miss, especially if you were popular in high school, to have an understanding of what the other kids who weren't popular were going through.",Carrie

We begin to learn more about our bodies and minds than we probably ever wanted to know. It's a time plagued with zits, mood swings, and awkwardness. Both the Stephen King book and movie capture adolescence in all its mystery. The movie opens with what appears to be every high school guy's fantasy, then quickly turns to shock (and perhaps even empathy) as we're introduced to Carrie. Carrie is the most unpopular girl in high school, picked on by the jocks and cheerleaders, made fun of by everyone. With that constant bombardment at school, you'd think Carrie would find solace at home... Not a chance with her totally-bonkers mother who spouts religious drivel and forces Carrie to repent for something that is completely normal (however embarrassing it may be.) Along the way, Carrie discovers that she can move and levitate things. Even though we're shown little moments of her telekinetic abilities, the filmmakers wisely downplay it to show us the brutal horrors of high school and adolescence. Here is a movie that boldly shows us real teenagers in mostly real-life situations. However, that's not to say that special effects take a back seat. In fact, following the famous ""pigs blood"" scene, we're treated to one of the greatest displays of destruction ever witnessed. The only part that was a little weak is the very ending, but only because it's been copied innumerable times since then. Sissi Spacek is dead-on in the role of Carrie. In the book, she's described as overweight, which Spacek isn't, but I believe that Spacek's thinness helps accentuate the deep vulnerability that's central to the character. Piper Laurie is equally wonderful as her zealous mother. In my opinion, next to THE SHINING and SECRET WINDOW, this is the best King movie!",Carrie

And yes, obviously you're not supposed to care about any of the bullies, but I don't care about Carrie, or Tommy, or Miss Collins, or anyone else either.It has a pretty serious case of Tomb Raider syndrome, where the writers seem to expect you to care about the protagonist based purely on how much trauma/damage she endures, which I quite simply don't. And when I don't care about any of the characters, and the plot is completely indistinguishable from any other high school film where the shy girl comes out of her shell - at least until the very end, then I just can't fathom why this is still considered one of the best Stephen King adaptations - or hell, even one of the best horror films of all time.It's got some good direction, and Sissy Spacek does sell the character really well, but that's honestly kind of it for what I can say I found really impressive.And man is Brian De Palma creepy in that opening scene...",Carrie

182,MovieGuy109,Better than most horror,6,20 September 2011,"Carrie-**1/2- Worthwhile- Directed by: Brian De Palma. Written by: Lawrence D. Cohen, Stephen King (novel). Starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, William Katt, John Travolta, P.J Soles, Priscilla Pointer.Stephen King's creative novel is turned into a high-powered De Palma thriller in this story of a high school outcast (Spacek) who learns she has telekinetic powers and finally snaps after being pushed too far by her cruel classmates and her Christian extremist mother.Carrie is a horror film by all means and succeeds pretty well as a horror film and even goes a step further by providing social insight into an alienated girl's true feelings toward society under the craziness of her mother (Laurie in a great performance). It even has Hitchcock elements in it that add to the intelligence to the experience. Yet De Palma is not the most fluid storyteller and his dramatic shift between sentimental, anti-bullying tale to bloody horror film does not gel the way it should.Also, De Palma uses a split-screen during the film's violent sequence. It's as if the carnage on the first screen is not enough for us and he wants to see more blood. He almost insults his filmmaking by saying he is not putting enough on the screen in one image but needs two to give the message of the sequence. His Hitchcock elements do not always work, simply because he does not have the same skill the master of suspense had.There is no doubt that Spacek's character represents a minority of kids out there and De Palma gives Carrie a voice amongst the growing suspense that makes a few noteworthy social points but this is a horror film that acts as a parody of Hitchcock and a new brand of feminine horror which many films would capitalize on later. King loved the adaptation and I wish I could have liked it as much as him.",Carrie

We get the flashes of the magical prom mixed in with Kris planning to dump the pig's blood over Carrie. The plot of the shy girl getting back at her bullies is a satisfying one, but with the added idea of telekinesis makes an even more exciting movie. The acting was really well done by everyone! Sissy Spacek puts in a good job as the lead Carrie, Piper Laurie is convincing as Carrie's crazed religious mother, and I REALLY thought Amy Irving was wonderful as Sue Snell. John Travolta, PJ Soles and Nancy Allen were great too as the villains. All around, a really good cast.It's always fun to see bullies get theirs in movies, but 'Carrie' takes it up a notch. I'd recommend this for sure to every horror fan. It's well acted, got a great cast and tells a pretty satisfying but sad story.8/10",Carrie
184,antagonist117,Carrie makes up for its excesses with a smart script,8,11 November 2013,"Teen horror is a minefield of a genre, and all too often strays into exploitation, silly casting, and heavyhandedness. ""Carrie"" isn't above such criticism, but at least it compensates for its missteps. After getting off on the wrong foot with an egregious locker room scene, director Brian de Palma reins it in and puts together one of the best Stephen King film adaptations. The fact that some of the male actors look like they're in their 30s, or that John Travolta's accent is not of this world, hardly matters because the script is so intelligent and the story so easy to get wrapped up in. The mother's religious ramblings don't sound like run-of-the-mill gibberish, but rather seem to hint at specific personal demons and to spring from the head of a real character who contains multitudes and contradictions. This is true also of the film's other adult lead, Carrie's gym teacher and mentor. She has a good read on the alpha girl bullies, the hangers-on, and the outcasts in her class, but this savviness doesn't make her immune to the occasional and serious miscalculation. In a great scene in which she interrogates a girlfriend and boyfriend she suspects of pulling a prank, her zeal to protect Carrie blinds her to the little clues that we pick up on: the girl is trying to do the right thing but doesn't know how to express this clearly to the adult, and the boy is vain and flip but clearly not the type to plan a complicated revenge. The film's many plot threads and idiosyncratic characters pay off in a big way with the famous climax, but the movie has a hard time settling on an ending after that and tosses in some needless ""I see what you did there"" shots that, if nothing else, provide a bookend to the excessive opening.",Carrie
185,lorcan-61881,Brilliant teen horror film!,10,1 October 2016,"Carrie is one of the best horror films ever no question about it. I love the acting,the drama,the horrific prom scene and now I...come...to..talk...about...it. Carrie tells the story of a young 17 year old outcast who is bullied every day by Chris,a horrible classmate. Each day,Carrie goes home having to face with her maniac religious mother who thinks of everything as a sin. One day,Carrie is asked to prom by a popular classmate,she thinks it's a joke but it's really one of the bullies who feels ashamed of what she did to poor Carrie. Carries mother grows angry about this as Carrie demands she attends. Carrie attends the prom but Chris has been expelled by a gym teacher who feels so sorry for Carrie so that means no prom for Chris so she decides to humiliate Carrie by pouring a bucket full of pigs blood on her. When this event happens,all of her classmates start laughing even her gym teacher then Carrie gets angry and uses OH YES I FORGOT she has telekinetic powers to kill them all,Carrie sets the school on fire and walks out,Carrie goes home and her house is covered in candles,Carries mother cuddles her and tells her her first time with her father. Carries mother stabs her and Carrie falls down the stairs and uses her powers to stab her mothers with loads of sharp items. Carrie kills her and starts to scream crying as the house breaks down and it sets on fire. Carrie and her mother lie in a cupboard dead as the house crushes to pieces. The next day,Sue is in bed asleep as she has a dream of her putting flowers on her grave when suddenly DUN DUN DUN Carries hand pops up and grabs her and the movie ends. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!",Carrie
186,Chaves7777,"Revenge, sweet revenge",10,26 December 2006,"I remember films adaptations of Stephen King stories like the crazy man in ""The Shining"", the famous evil clown that represents the fear of the kids in ""It"" and the most gorgeous ""fan"" that all writer wants have in ""Misery"" and all are good. But don't has, like that Cole Porter song ""thing"" that ""Carrie"" have.The plot is about a girl who have a bad mother, who don't have friends, who have bad classmates, who have a power. That power is the telekinesis ... and she is a good girl, but... ""Carrie"" is not a regular movie, there is blood but not like a regular movie. The film, based in the first novel by Stephen King, was directed by Brian De Palma. I have not seen more movies of this director, i want get ""The Phantom of the Paradise"", but ""Carrie"" make me know that Brian De Palma is a good director. With the touching music of Pino Donaggio, ""Carrie"" makes me scream ... but, like the film, is not that regular scream. Is a scream that becomes from my body. The movie makes you chills a lot ... besides has an impressive cast like Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen and Beety Buckley.Please, if you have not see yet, don't let anyone tell you about anything more of the plot ...when you see it, you know why.""Carrie""... you've got that thing...*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any",Carrie

When the high school ""in crowd"" torments her with a sick joke at the prom, she lashes out with devastating and deadly power.This film is so well made that Hollywood should never ever had remade this.

188,Casey-52,What more can be said about this classic?,10,30 April 2000,"Of all the Stephen King big-screen adaptations, I find this to be the most entertaining, then ""Cujo"" and ""The Shining"" behind it. As my title says, what more can be said? This movie IS a classic, despite what some people say. Of course, ""Carrie"" is more of a drama than it is a horror movie. The elements of horror are very underplayed until the last 20 minutes of the movie. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie should have won the Oscars in 1976! They were more than deserving and make the movie stand the test of time the most. If we depended on William Katt's white-boy Afro or Amy Irving's platform shoes, ""Carrie"" would be forgotten. Yes, the hairdos, the clothes, and a lot of the lingo is very VERY dated, but fun to watch. Brian DePalma does his best directing, I think. The use of the split-screen is great, I love that technique! And of course the prom sequence. Who can forget it? I think every teenager in high school should be forced to watch this movie, then maybe indifferences wouldn't seem so significant anymore. This used to be my favorite movie when I was undergoing lots of personal problems in high school and I'm proud to say that I've seen it well over 100 times! Everyone should at least see it once, it's well worth it and holds some of the most memorable movie images of all time!",Carrie
189,BoydudeReviews,"A dated, yet terrifying classic.",8,3 November 2018,"This film is just weird, mean spirited, shocking, scary and intense. And I think it works. The film is dayed, but I just love the style i how the chsracters talk, the cinematography and soundtrack. The main girl who plays Carrie, Sissy, is the star of the film. Even the lady who played Carrie's mother was excellent. A film worth watching every Halloween.",Carrie
190,LanceBrave,Her Fragile World Shatters Apart,9,5 November 2013,"The influence of ""Carrie"" can't be understated. Stephen King went from a minor bestseller to an international success. Brian DePalma, known before for absurdist satires, was changed into the predominant thriller filmmaker of his age. It launched the careers of Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, William Katt, John Travoltra and, most importantly, Sissy Spacek. The movie's critical praise was acknowledged with two Academy Award nominations, unheard for a horror film. Finally, the film introduced the final jump scare into the horror movie cliché library, something every major shock film of the next two decades would rip off.""Carrie"" is, ultimately, a simple story. Meek, poor and telekinetically gifted Carrie White suffers abuse at school from classmates and at home from her religious fanatic mother. Sue Snell, Tommy Ross, and Miss Collins attempt to help poor Carrie, to save her. Vindictive Chris Hargensen and her doofus boyfriend plan petty revenge against the girl for mostly imagined wrongs. The plot is engineered to build towards the climatic prom sequence, each storyline coming together. The whole story takes place over no more then a few days. The structure is precise, elegant, and functional.The story is also a coming of age story. The film begins and ends with blood in bath water, representing different losses of innocence. The emergence of Carrie's powers is tied directly with her first menstrual cycle. Her character arc is ultimately framed as a struggle against her mother's authority. Her psychic abilities give her the strength to fight back, to strike out on her own. Dowdy and plain at first, Carrie goes through a ""Beautiful All Along"" transformation, charming Tommy at prom, suggesting that, had this not been a Stephen King story, she could have gotten away from her mother, had a normal life. King's original book was a epistolary novel, showing the events from the outside looking in. The film refocuses on Carrie, showing her world, her side of the story.For a fact, whenever the movie shifts away from Carrie, it suffers. De Palm's past as a cult filmmaker occasionally pokes through. A long sequence of the girls in gym is odd, with upbeat music and comical angles, adding little to the story. How about the scene of Tommy and friends trying on tuxes, which features bizarre fast motion? Carrie's Mother isn't the most complex character. She's little more then a raving, religious lunatic. Only near the end, when explaining Carrie's conception, does the character seem to be more. Piper Laurie plays the part as operatic theater, driving her intensity to absurdist heights, most evident during her orgasmic death scene, writhing in religious agony. Chris is similarly cartoonish, a sadistic, evil queen bee. It's no fault of Nancy Allen, who plays the part to its fullest, simply an example of thin writing. William Katt, several years away from his light comedy hero roles, is nearly flat as Tommy. Katt tries, occasionally showing some depth under those golden locks, but frequently comes off as a brainless jock.Spacek owns the film and, when the focus is on her, ""Carrie"" shines. Her big blue eyes and freckled face conveys such a strong vulnerability, a deep sadness. You feel for the character, want to protect her. As the prom night goes on, as you see her smile and come into her own, a deep melancholy comes over the film that almost brings me to tears every time. Because you know her happiness is going to be short-lived. Despite occasional misinterpretations, ""Carrie"" isn't a revenge story. Carrie's psychic wrath at the prom isn't righteous nor is the audience meant to enjoy it. Instead, it's high tragedy. You're watching her fragile world shatter apart and the terrible fall-out from it. ""Carrie"" is ultimately an incredibly sad film. You forget that between showings, only remembering De Palm's stylistic flourishes or the intense effect scenes.De Palma's highly stylish direction occasionally verges on melodramatic. The multiple quick-cut close-ups on Carrie's glaring face or Margret chopping a carrot drawls too much attention. The infamous De Palma split-screen nicely shows Carrie's powers but are an exercise in style, not story. The dinner scene between Carrie and her mother, though beautifully shot in deep shadows, puts too fine a point on it when lightening strikes after Margret's dialogue. Ultimately, De Palma's direction works for the film. His repeated use of double focus, different items in the foreground and the background, provide depth to the frame, supporting the themes. The turn-table shot of Carrie and Tommy at the prom probably goes on too long but beautifully illustrates both her heavenly feeling while subtly suggesting that things are about to go out of control. No sequence is better constructed then the lead-up to the prom massacre. Another one of De Palma's trademarks, a long, single shot, revolving around the room, setting each puzzle piece in place brilliantly.Pino Donaggio's score is also hugely important to the film's success. The score is beautiful, dreamy and romantic when it needs to be. Carrie and her mother each have a leitmotif, a mournful oboe for Carrie and pounding, psychotic piano for Mom. During the prom, Donaggio's score fluctuates from silent to foreboding, slowly building tension. While the actual massacre is happening, the score is almost non-existent, treating the violence starkly, honestly. Unlike De Palma's direction, the score is always honest, building and supporting the story's emotions Except for the shrieking, Hermann-esque ""Psycho"" strings that play whenever Carrie employs her powers. This was no doubt De Palma's idea, the Hitchcock humper.Though infamous, I almost feel like that final jump scare is unnecessary. It's an exploitation movie move in a film that is anything but. However, that final image, of Sue's mother cradling her on the bed, the room womb-like, a warm parental relationship, the kind Carrie never had, recalls the story's whole point. ""Carrie"" is a devastatingly sad, powerful horror picture, showing that the genre can explore and plunge emotions far deeper then fear or revulsion",Carrie
191,WubsTheFadger,Carrie,8,11 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFor a film that was released in 1997, it has held up extremely well. The story is simple but has some very complex foreshadowing and a vast amount of symbols. The ending is shocking and left me stunned.The acting is the one thing that is outdated. John Travolta, Piper Laurie, and Betty Buckley are e few of the actors that performed in an outdated fashion. William Katt performs very well though.Sissy Spacek is the best part about the entire film. Her character has been tormented with hatred and animosity for no apparent reason and we can clearly see that in her performance. Spacek does her character justice and shows us that old films can be great.The music is another high point for this film. The pacing is very slow in the beginning and in the middle but it picks up speed towards the third act.Pros: Simple yet complex story riddled with foreshadowing and symbols, William Katt's performance, great use of music, amazing ending, Sissy Spacek's performance, and seeing Sissy Spacek nakedCons: A lot of outdated acting and very slow pacing in the beginning and in the middleOverall Rating: 8.4",Carrie
192,welhof1,Felt empathy towards Carrie!,7,1 November 2019,I've never been a big fan of Stephen Kings movies but this one wasn't bad. You already knew going into it how it would end but it was a fun ride.I really felt empathy towards Carrie. When the prom scene came on I found myself vocally cheering her on. I love when directors can create that emotion.The ending was a little ambiguous. I read the wiki plot summary afterwards and it answered some questions that weren't explained in the movie.,Carrie

I finally caught it on Monstervision, but alas the movie kept dragging and I could barely stay awake for the climax.  The story is interesting and has some good acting (the white family).  But a horror film this is not. Perhaps the best I will remember the film is that it was the beginning for so many stars.(viewed TV: rating 6/10)",Carrie

First I just wanted to say Sissy Spacek was excellent in her role as Carrie White. I will now post my lesson below.The things they do to Carrie in this movie are some of the most nasty things that I have ever seen. The locker room episode was beyond belief. There was no reason at all for throwing pads at her when she got her period, teasing her, doing whatever they damn well pleased to her and especially at the end which was the worse when they threw the buck of pig blood all over her. There is no justification in killing, however this movie does teach a good lesson to do unto others as you'd have done to you, which is the Golden Rule.",Carrie

198,jake-law123,Depressing rather than scary.,5,18 February 2011,"This movie depressed me rather than scare me. It was horrific at the end, but everything else is just depressing. I know Brian De Palma was just following the book by Stephen King, and thats just find. But in general, the plot, and the depression was so terrible I just couldn't like it. I'm not saying De Palma could have made it better, just didn't like the story itself in general.It revolves around a shy high schooler named Carrie who is constantly picked on by the girls at her school, and her abusively religious mom. She soon finds out that she has telekinetic powers. She's asked by the most handsome guy in school to prom, where a few girls plan to play another trick on her, little do they know whats in store for them.A lot of the film is just her being treated like poop, until the final climax in the end, which is downright terror. I think my favorite character is the gym teacher, the only person in her life who has sympathy for her, and does her best to help her. My least favorite character by far was the mom. A complete psychopath!I just couldn't take the depression in this film. It calls itself a horror film. Though most of the film just seems like a teen drama, that is until the end. I was so shocked by how badly Carrie was treated. I mean my God, she was freaking hated to death. Looking at her would make any other depressed person not feel as bad. Most of the characters consist of mean girls, crazy psychopaths, or Carrie. But what do you really expect from Stephen King, not to mention this was his first novel. Mix that with Brian De Palma's love for violence, depression and gore, and this is what you get.Nothing but a nonstop series of depressing moments. A few parts were entertaining, but in general didn't do it for me. Like I said before, Its not really De Palma's fault, its just the idea in general. So its actually Stephen King's fault. The movie wasn't really bad, just didn't like the idea of the plot, so maybe the movies not that bad, but this is what I think of it.",Carrie
199,arishsankar,This is probably the best film adaptation of a Stephen King novel.,10,24 November 2018,The reason Carrie is still held in such high regard as a horror classic is very simple: it's all in the sheer directorial bravado. De Palma at the top of his game.,Carrie
200,thedarkhorizon,"A classical Stephen King tale - turned into beautiful, horrifying poetry.",7,29 November 2019,"I watched it for my course on film history and how it shaped the horror/thriller genre afterwards. Carrie got De Palma a breakthrough -
and personally, I was totally stunned by the poetry in this film, that I was totally NOT expecting. I've seen 'Taxi driver' already and had an idea on De Palma's style/voice that can be felt in Carrie already.I am not a huge Horror-fan, also not into Stephen King's stories, so it took some willpower to see it - but that was soon forgotten - the introduction of the film was so beautiful, setting the tone for the film. That's how great pictures are created!It is filled with beautiful and then psycodelic imagery when Carrie visits the annual Ball with her new crush and it turns into a total nightmare. The light is already colorful and dreamlike, just like her dream come true - and then, as a bucket of blood is dumped onto her, she runs insane with her telekinesis orgy.
I am amazed how basically the whole scene turns blood red (I now understand the reference (?) in SUSPIRIA (2018), same built-up, similar complex chaos-orgy...).Basically the whole movie thrives on its sound design, mimicking the screeching violin sounds (PSYCHO reference?) and the beautiful symphonic interludes in calmer scenes. It gives the whole movie another, supernatural layer.The 'horror' builds in the long shots, the slow narration, the wonderful music - not a lot of splatter is used (apart from some stabbing with knives) and the whole plot focusses more on the scary unknown hidden inside a silent, pretty girl. (To be honest - with a troubled mother like that, who would not become a 'freak'? I am sure Carrie could feel her whole life misunderstood and unaccepted. That's the true horror!)Also I love the lens / camera equipment the DOP chose, a blurry filter softening all the faces, light and creating noise. Sure, it was normal in the 60-70s, but it fits so well: in the last scene, a class mate of Carrie walks towards a graffiti smeared post in shape of a cross and her white dress bleeds the light due to the blur like an aura around her. Magical!So, I understand now, why De Palma is truly an artist and a pioneer of cinema.",Carrie

202,tom_koopa,Fantastic movie!,9,29 January 2012,"Carrie is about a young, timid girl in high-school who gets bullied around and mocked every day. At home she has to deal with a very strange and quite possibly disturbed mother. Because of this she has no confidence and has nothing good to say about herself. This all changes slightly when she's invited to the prom by one of the (more) popular boys. Carrie discovers she has the power of telekinesis; the power to move or influence objects with the mind. It seems to trigger whenever she's in stress, is angry or is confused. Things are building up when one of the girls in Carrie's class is denied entry to the prom, and she blames Carrie for it...---After watching this just now, I have to say... wow. Just wow. This movie is truly amazing. The movie has a fantastic build-up and it's great to see so many elements in this story come together, for good or worse. I was on the edge of my seat for the 2nd half.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek as Carrie steals the show. She portraits her role as a confused, scared young woman with much power and emotion. Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is another amazing role in this movie. None of the other characters look bad; they all play their roles just fine.Another thing I'd like to point out what's good about this movie is the music. Very fitting, strong (and also very unnerving) music that plays throughout the movie.I'd recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys dramatic stories.

Okay, i won't focus on that.Comparing this movie with the one played by Chloe Grace Moretz, there were some pros and cons. I like Carrie played by Sissy more than by Chloe because Sissy's shows extremely weirdo and scary face. And those screaming she made really deafening. Wow, she is just amazing. Was her throat okay after doing that? But for her mama's role, I like it more by Julianne. I think she is far more terrifying and freak and maniac than Piper was.

206,Minus_The_Beer,The Queen of King Adaptations,10,15 October 2017,"High school is tough. The awkwardness, the alienation, the struggle to find your place among the cliques while also carving out your own identity. It's an uphill battle that never seems to end. Well, high school is especially tough for Carrie White. When she's not being mocked and ridiculed by her cruel classmates, at home her domineering, god-fearing mother berates her on a nightly basis. When a cute boy invites her to the prom, her luck seems to be improving. Unfortunately, her budding telekinesis abilities get in the way and, well, let's just say her night in the spotlight turns into a living nightmare for all involved.Brian DePalma's compassionate and stylish adaptation of Stephen King's iconic novel remains a classic for good reason. ""Carrie"" perfectly captures what it's like to be shunned, ridiculed and alienated. The director brings a certain touch of class rarely associated with the horror genre, elevating the film above a mere splatterfest and into an absolutely heart-breaking character piece. The artsy camera work combined with a touching yet haunting score by Pino Donagio give the film a distinct flavor that stays with you long after the carnage has come and gone. Sure, there's (literal) buckets of blood, but the true heart of the film is Sissy Spacek's fragile and endearing turn as the titular character. As the sequel, TV adaptation and (sigh) remake have proved, Spacek was born for this character and virtually no one else is fit to fill her prom dress.The first of many Stephen King adaptations, ""Carrie"" (along with Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"") is absolute perfection. Not a moment of film is wasted and the entire supporting cast is on point. Karen Allen and John Travolta play the worst of the bunch, but the true villain of the piece of Piper Laurie's bone-chilling turn as Margaret White, Carrie's horrific mother. There's a lot packed into these 98 minutes and, unlike high school itself, it goes by rather quickly. Expertly paced and crafted with absolute care, ""Carrie"" is queen of the King adaptations without a doubt.",Carrie
207,jed-estes,Love The Ending,10,20 August 2006,Brian De Palma was at the top of his game in the 1970's and 80's minus 1973's Sisters and 1985's Wise Guys. Carrie is a film that proves this fact. It is a disturbing depiction of a girl trapped in a horrid body (although Sissy Spacek does not look that bad it just proves her acting capabilities) and tormented by every one in her life. Her mother hates her because her mother has a fixation on God and sees every thing that is not done her way as evil and hell worthy. Her classmates torment her when she has her first period at 17 and does not realize what is happening to her. This scene is striking and sad to see a girl become a women in such sorrow conditions. But all of this is nothing compared to the rampage ending. Throughout the film Carrie slowly discovers how to use levitation powers and this culminates in the end when she is forced into hysteria and her powers are unleashed on her fellow prom goers in a bloody orgasm of death. In the film she takes her whole class out minus three people (Two she takes out latter and the other would get in the sequel The Rage: Carrie II) This scene is staged beautifully by Brian De Palma who makes great use of his recurring split screen movement. This film is awesome and supplemented by it's cliff hanger ending. Which at the time was not really meant to be a cliff hanger at all as it was the 70's and almost no one ever thought of a follow up back then. See this.,Carrie

210,KatMiss,MELDING OF TWO GREAT ARTISTS,10,18 July 2001,"""Carrie"" is a melding of two great artists, in this case, Stephen King, who wrote the novel and Brian DePalma, who directed the film. This is a tense, exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both, but DePalma does it. King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. DePalma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely, with the exception of the ending, which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better, in my opinion. (King himself liked the finale and the film, as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre ""Danse Macabre"")As is the case in most DePalma films, the technical credits are superb. The cinematography (by Mario Tosi)is extremely effective; colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a DePalma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio, and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and DePalma. (Bernard Herrmann died shortly after ""Obsession"" was completed) Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Body Double"" are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. ""Carrie"" is no less brilliant, as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do: enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in ""Sisters"", ""Obsession"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Raising Cain"". But it is the performances that make ""Carrie"" stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film; the second would be Sigourney Weaver for ""Aliens"")She manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way. (Just in case you didn't know, Spacek was a DePalma regular, but off-screen; she was the art director for several of his early pictures). Also, ""Carrie"" marked the return of Piper Laurie to films after a too-long hiatus (her last credit was ""The Hustler"") Here, she plays Carrie's mother. Again, a lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama, but Laurie resists the temptation. Her performance is a real knockout and also garned an Oscar nomination (she should have won, but typical Academy genius set in and gave the prize to Beatrice Straight who was in ""Network"" for a whopping 10 minutes and really didn't do much.)Also, as a side note, this film also is a start for some future DePalma regulars such as John Travolta (his first major studio film) and Nancy Allen (her first major role)What I really liked about ""Carrie"" is the absolutely perfect ending. I had commented before that ""Sisters"" had an absolutely perfect ending. The one thing about Brian DePalma is that he knows how to end a picture. ""Dressed to Kill"" had a really good one, although some people hated it as well as ""Blow Out"". ""The Fury"" has the greatest ending of all the DePalma thrillers. A small note to finish: In 1999, ""Carrie 2"" was made by profiteers at MGM. Despite a rich premise, the film was an artistic failure.  DePalma had nothing to worry about. The sequel (retread might be a better word) lacks everything that makes DePalma's original so good. Rent or buy the original, on tape (in pan-and-scan or widescreen)and DVD (widescreen)and forget the sequel, even if they give it away.**** out of 4 stars",Carrie
211,ksdilauri,"This ""Carrie"" is all that's needed, thank you.",9,6 August 2019,"The story's been oft-told, with a string of remakes and sequels, but this original version stands alone. It's the combination of direction, writing, musical score and powerhouse acting that makes 1976's ""Carrie"" the only one that was really necessary. A talented filmmaker, Brian DePalma's signature touches are all there, (including his brief gratuitous, softly-focused nudie shots for which I deducted a star....okay, it sounds prudish in 2019, but they're unnecessary and don't add anything, except maybe for horny guys.) Still, the overall result deserves its classic status, largely due to the cast. Even the secondary performances are natural, with standouts by Betty Buckley and Amy Irving. But it's Piper Laurie and, even more so, Sissy Spacek who run away with this movie--though she lost that year's Oscar to Faye Dunaway, Spacek was compensated with other 1976 Best Actress awards, including the prestigious New York Film Critics' prize. The concise screenplay allows for more character development than most similar films.....it isn't bogged down with unnecessary shocks and gore, allowing for character development. Overall, Spacek doesn't play her as a creepy ""horror icon""----her Carrie White is sweet, sad and heartbreaking, and you just want to hug her and make everything better for her. In fact, as a 20-year-old back in 1976, I kinda fell for Spacek as she began to bloom at the prom. (Ironically, the cheesy way the film is advertised---with the grisly shot of the blood-soaked Carrie---doesn't do justice to her multilayered character.) Please, Hollywood, no more versions of ""Carrie"".....this original is all that's needed.",Carrie

Carrie does get back at all those that wronged her, but it comes with such a steep price. The performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are two of the best the horror genre has ever seen and they were rightly nominated for Oscars for their hard work. I can't think of a better director for this film than De Palma who makes the entire prom sequence (not just everything after the prank, but the whole thing) into a masterwork of suspense.",Carrie
213,FrankBooth_DeLarge,The type of horror you don't find these days,9,24 July 2005,"Carrie is a teen horror film that isn't mindless a slasher flick. It is a horror film that does have a great, now famous climax, and it follows how a tormented teenage girl is pushed over the edge. This is the type of horror movie that focuses more on the characters than on the blood and gore. The story is about Carrie White. A pretty, but shy and abused teenage girl. Her life at school is a living hell, as she is ruthlessly tormented by the stuck up popular girls, and her life at home isn't any better. She lives with her mother, who is a psycho religious nut that thinks everything is a sin and strongly enforces religion upon her. To add up to Carrie's misery, her mother never allows her to have any friends. One day in the school shower room, Carrie had her first period. She was never taught about menstruation, and she freaked out. The other girls thought this was hilarious and humiliated her over it. The gym teacher punishes the girls involved by taking away their privilege to go to the school prom. While one of the girls, Sue, feels sorry for Carrie, the most popular girl in the grade, Chris, is upset with the fact that she is banned from the school prom. Chris plans a revenge against Carrie. At the same time, Sue asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom in order to make things better for her. Not everything goes well. Carrie has a rare gift known as telekinesis. When she is pushed over the edge at the prom, everything goes awry, and ends up with one of Hollywood's most famous climaxes, and one of the bloodiest scenes in movie history. Carrie is the type of horror film that you don't find these days. It has blood, but it focuses on the character development. This is a very smartly written story, mainly due to the fact that there is no real villain. Carrie did what she did out of rage, Chris was just an uptight popular girl, and Carrie's mother was just trying to protect her daughter from what she didn't like about the world.This is Stephen King's first novel to be published, and remains to be one of his best. The performances in this movie are great, Sissy Spacek is excellent as Carrie, and this movie was John Travolta's acting debut.This is one of the all time greatest horror movies, and should be seen by any King fan, or horror fan.",Carrie

Equally humiliated and mistreated in the school, the girl's fury explodes during the prom party, and using her special capacity she leads off a massacre.Cruel and violent film directed with mastery by experienced Brian De Palma.As he demonstrated later on with ""The Fury"" (a thriller with Carrie Snodgress and Kirk Douglas) and ""The Untouchables"", De Palma doesn't open concessions and in ""Carrie"" he narrates with a touching eye the story of a girl who suffers for her difference in a direct and painful way.But it is in the most shocking part, in which the hate, resentment and the girl's pain come to the surface, that he is consecrated as the most probable Hitchcock's successor : abusing of quick cuts, slow motion and division of the screen in two or more plans, he demonstrates that he has the domain over the language of the violence,in one of the most distressing and unforgettable sequences of cinema history.",Carrie
215,IrisNo11,Torture Leads To Terror!,5,14 July 1999,"Usually they say that the first film is better than the sequel, but in my opinion, the sequel was better.  I liked ""Carrie"", but it was strange, because this one is from the the late 1970's, and the other is twenty years older.  And since the 90's is my generation, looking at the 70's one was strange.  Chris, Nancy Allen's character, has Farrah Fawcett hair, John Travoltra looks the same only younger, and Amy Irving (who returned in the second one as Sue Snell again) looks the same, only her hair wasn't as curly.  Also, since it's the 90's and technology has improved, the part when Carrie's anger destroys those who have teased her wasn't as graphic as the second one.  Yet don't get me wrong, I liked the first ""Carrie"".  It was great, but not as great as the second one!",Carrie
216,InaneSwine,One of the best movies ever made,10,5 September 2006,"There are few books-turned-movies that one can truthfully say that the movie is better than the book. However, this terrifying and disturbing masterpiece from director Brian de Palma is one of those few.Carrie White (played by Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek) is a bullied outcast who secretly possesses the gift of telekinesis: the ability to move objects using forces of the mind. When she is asked to go to the senior prom, her life seems to take a turn for the better. But when a cruel joke is played on her, she finally snaps, forcing her to exercise her terrible gift.The first hour or so of the movie is a powerful lead-up to the film's climax, where Palma unveils one of the most terrifying scenes in cinema history.

218,williambendavis-933-218958,"Not scary at all, but not a bad film",7,22 December 2014,"Is it scary in the slightest? No, but in this case in isn't really a bad thing. It's story, while not very original, is well told and keeps your interest throughout all 96 minutes. The trouble with a lot of non scary horror movies is that they become incredibly boring very quickly. That does not happen here. Carrie herself is a extremely empathetic character who you come to care about quite a bit. You see how she's treated at school and at home and it strikes a cord, at least it did with me. You want to see her be happy and when she starts to feel happier, you do to. The last thing that makes this film work is the last oh say 20 minutes or so. The use of slow motion and sound (or the lack thereof) create an incredibly tense atmosphere, and I applaud the filmmakers on their decisions. So, Carrie is not a scary movie, but it is by no means a bad film. It relies on other things to keep it entertaining. (Oh yeah, I forgot. No jump scares throughout the whole movie! It's a miracle!)",Carrie

The whole long take, starting with Carrie and Tommy's table and ending with the same table, after the election announcement, is one of the coolest shots I've ever seen, probably only matched by Mr. Robot's ""eps3.4_runtime-error.r00"". It's so sad when you know it's coming to see how sincerely Tommy and Ms. Collins have tried to make Carrie have a good time, but the blood dump and everything that follows it, all those shots with the split screen, the sound effects, Carrie, all covered in blood and walking through the flaming chaos... it's all a part of a formula for a memorable experience.I might not have been familiar with John Travolta when I was a kid, so it was a nice surprise catching him over here.

221,jcanettis,More of a Good Drama Than of A Horror/Thriller,7,24 March 2005,"When I first saw ""Carrie"", I expected to watch a different type of film. By having read the plot outline and some reviews, I had prepared myself to watch a thriller. Yet, I discovered that ""Carrie"", although it contains typical horror/thriller elements (such as frightening scenes, at least for the '70s standards), is actually is a drama; a good drama, in fact.The story revolves around an introvert and shy girl, Carrie (Spacek), who faces the sarcasm and teasing of her schoolmates. Moreover, the poor girl cannot even find peace at home, as she has a tyrannic mother (Laurie) who is obsessed with religion at the border of madness. When Carrie gets invited at the school prom by a charming boy, things for the first time seem to be going well for her. Yet, everything gets spoiled, as the arch-brat of the school, Chris (Allen), decides to play a very dirty and humiliating trick to her. Carrie, who has telekinetic powers, but who until this point has not actually used them on purpose, goes berserk, and things start to really go wild from here...Brian de Palma does a good job in focusing on the hardships that poor Carrie endures, and how these affect her personality. I found the first scene (where Carrie has her period and gets ridiculed by the other girls) especially disturbing, as it shows vividly how her environment treats her in the most inhuman and mean way. As a matter of fact, I believe that the point of the film has been to primarily portray the multiple psychological traumas that Carrie faces, rather than focus on her telekinetic abilities or her revenge. And this is actually the strongest point of the film: One cannot help but be deeply touched by the outstanding performance of Sissy Spacek, whom we watch going through her cruel ordeal.The other performances range from good (Buckley) to average (Allen, Travolta, Irving). Finally, Piper Laurie is very good as the evil mother.All in all, 7/10.",Carrie
222,R_O_U_S,King is possible,8,14 January 2004,"The trivia about this film are often trotted out, but more important is its effectiveness as a piece of sheer terror. Forget the rest of the film - it's the moment after Carrie's final humiliation, when the doors slam shut. It's the look of complete distraction in her face as she does it. It's De Palma's virtuoso use of split-screen throughout what follows. I never thought the famous ending matched up to this.",Carrie
223,Snake-666,A classic!,9,23 September 2003,"Perhaps one of the only genuinely good Stephen King adaptations, Carrie' follows the tragic tale of Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a young girl who is continually made to suffer at the hands of her bullying classmates and not helped by her overbearing, religious mother Margaret (Piper Laurie). Carrie, however, is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed(?) with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so, it seems, do these potentially lethal abilities. Brian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek's performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film. Somehow managing to perfectly embody the typical school life of the usual high school outcasts, Spacek was able to bring to everyone the appalling life that so many teenagers are forced to tolerate. From the opening scenes where Carrie is utterly humiliated at the hands of her classmates after Carrie's hysterical reaction to her first menstruation, to the painfully wretched ending it becomes nigh on impossible not to sympathise with Spacek's character. Spacek was quite rightly Oscar-nominated for this performance. Spacek's performance was enhanced by fellow Oscar-nominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religious-nut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance. De Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie's powers he focuses on the torment (and the tormentors) of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a one-dimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous `Prom Night' scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.
Carrie' is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fast-paced horror as it is presented as a heart-breaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast (which features John Travolta in an early role) was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris, the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed, with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for Carrie'  9/10.",Carrie

225,Vince-5,One of the best,10,5 May 2001,"May contain minor spoilers, depending on your interpretation.Carrie is a stylish, well-cast, immensely powerful movie. Sissy Spacek is amazing as Carrie, a tortured teenager who discovers her considerable telekinetic abilities and attempts to take control of her life. Just when she seems to be truly happy for the first time in her short, miserable existence, a cruel bitch of a classmate hauls out a grotesque practical joke that amuses everyone and leaves Carrie enraged beyond the point of endurance. What follows is one of the most terrifying and satisfying sequences in movie history.I can certainly relate to Carrie. I can't tell you the number of times I came home from school near tears because of something those disgusting sadists did to me...only to find that no one really cared. It's just ""what kids do,"" I was told. When Carrie finally got even at the prom, I was on her side all the way, because--and I don't care who criticizes me for this--THEY DESERVED IT. Carrie wanted to avoid such an incident, but they made it impossible. This movie and its fans have taken a lot of heat lately because of certain events in the news, when common sense will tell you that if you torment someone enough, their self-control will give out and they will strike back. The best way to prevent violence is to leave people the hell alone, but no one seems to understand that.This movie is a must for those who can understand its themes. The low budget is utilized to great effect. The art direction is wonderful, illustrating the pain and horror lurking in everyday life--the White bungalow, for example, seems like any other house on the outside, but is a jumble of shadows and twisted religious images inside. Director Brian De Palma is at his flamboyant best, especially during the nightmarish split-screen climax. Piper Laurie excels as Margaret, Carrie's fanatical mother from hell, and provides some very frightening moments. And of course, the image of Sissy Spacek covered in blood, except for her bulging blue eyes, is one that will remain with me forever.",Carrie
226,zombiefan89,A perfect cinema classic!,9,3 May 2013,"I don't really even consider Carrie a horror movie. Sissy Spacek was just to adorable to find threatening, even when she went fully homicidal. Everything she did felt justified. However, if I had to say the biggest issue with the film was the ending. It made no sense at all. Why did they blame Carrie for the gym catching on fire? How did they know Carrie didn't die in the gym with everyone else? There were no survivors except the two antagonists, but they died shortly after. Let's say there were survivors, Did they all unanimously accept that Carrie had psychic powers and caused the fire? Why and how did they blame Carrie? It was like Light Yagami in Death Note, who could kill people by writing their name down and thinking of their face as they do it. They accepted that a notebook could kill people WAY too easily! No court on Earth would have convicted Light Yagami of being ""Kira"" because there was NO solid proof!

Most of Carrie's classmates pick on the young lady, but Sue (Amy Irving) is sympathetic. Some of the other students decide to play a prank on Carrie without realizing the consequences.This isn't a perfect movie, in my opinion, but it is a good way to pass the time and it is a movie that really makes you feel sympathetic towards Carrie.",Carrie
228,Dandy_Desmond,A Modern Tragedy,10,25 August 2013,"I watched Carrie again for the first time in years, having seen the trailer for the remake with Chloe thingybob from the god awful Kick Ass. Its a tragic tale about a shy girl called Carrie White who seems to get abuse and bullying by almost everyone she meets, her mother, classmates even annoying kids on bikes. Her mother is a religious nut case, therefore she has had no knowledge or understanding of the world and is left open to bullying from other kids due to the fact she is different. What no one knows is how different Carrie really is. She is already realising she can move things with her mind at the start of the movie, therefore its not dragged down with learning to use her 'powers' etc and instead concentrates on the story. For the story is not only about her ability, its an all too human tale of someone looking for acceptance, to be loved and its this that makes it so memorable. Its a very cruel movie for several reasons. First of all the bullying is quite nasty and humiliating, secondly then with help of one of the few sympathetic class mates Carrie gets her dream date for the prom (after initial scepticism) and during the prom she is genuinely happy for once in her life and these scenes are very touching. As a viewer we know its not going to end there however, we know the fall will come and DePalma expertly creates the ominous atmosphere before the bucket of blood comes crashing down all over her. What comes next is a split screen massacre as Carrie wipes out almost the entire Prom Night goers in a rage fuelled inferno. Carrie is a film that has that magic mix. DePalma's sure direction is excellent (even the quirky touches such as the fast forward work for me) Sissy Spacek, words are not enough to explain her shattering performance. It really is something. I've always been a fan of Pino Donnaggio and his work here is one, if not the best soundtrack he has ever done. Highly recommended.",Carrie

As usual, Brian de Palma creates the strongest visual experience. I know little about King´s novel, but this film´s strong side is it's visual impression. Brian de Palma´s direction is more or less beautiful but was the split screen necessary this time? Sissy Spacek´s acting is really good. She was once one of the few people able to play a younger individual with high reliability. It is not uncommon that an older actress or actor plays a younger character but it is seldom as convincing as Spacek makes it. It is true that too many of the characters are stereotyped but Brian de Palma´s way to doing this makes ""Carrie"" to a good movie and it is one more proof that Brian de Palma is a talented director.Note: I found ""Carrie"" at times much more touching than scary.Rating: 7+ of 10.",Carrie
231,starlit-sky,A Horror Classic,8,13 February 2011,"Carrie is a bona fide horror classic. In my opinion, it is one of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever made (if you are a Stephen King fan like myself, you know how hard it is to adapt his books to big screen). Brian De Palma did a terrific job of bringing Carrie to life.This is a story about a very vulnerable girl with a super power: she can move objects with her mind, known as telekinesis. Her mother kept her sheltered. Piper Laurie portrayed Carrie's mother really well, a religious fanatic who has lost touch with reality. As a result, Carrie is disconnected from society and not living a very normal life. She is constantly bullied at school by other girls.The score is one of the most important elements of a movie but this is especially true in case of horror movies. Carrie's score is just amazing. You can get chills just by listening to the soundtrack. I especially love the way how the score sets the atmosphere of the scene. I have seen many horror movies but Carrie is special in the way how the score sets the tone so perfectly well. SLIGHT Spoiler ALERT******One of my favorite scenes is right before Carrie is crowned home coming queen; there is a dreamy music playing intervened by ominous music and it switches back and forth creating drama and suspense at the same time.I think Carrie deserves a minimum rating of 8.

Not to say, that Carrie was one of the lesser Stephen Kings books, they completely raped his creation by this one. As for the main plot it stands OK, but it doesn't concentrate on the psychological concept of the story at all - the main thing in all Kings stories. No wonder why final scenes just comes from nowhere and looks totally fake - Carrie wasn't established as the character who could actually go to that point of madness, they didn't gave any kind of story of her early life and her psychological condition is never really described that well. All the performances sucked, her going crazy and killing all the people is extremely unsatisfying, mostly because you don't care about any of these characters due to sh*tty character development - you don't hate them, you don't like them - you just don't care. Music is extremely out of balance - none of the scenes had proper music and the slow-mo or no-sound effects were completely useless and ruined all the atmosphere there could possibly exist. They completely missed the point with this one and I can't even begin to imagine why so many people like this abomination. STAY AWAY FROM IT. Go read a book, yes, as I said, it's not that good like some others but at least you won't have an urge to kill someone, for creating such a worthless pile of doodoo.",Carrie

(Not that the smug audience I saw it with at a second-run theater recently in Portland could stop laughing as though the emotional responses at the end were ""camp"" or ""grindhouse,"" but I digress!) ""Carrie"" is touching, moves through various modes with alacrity and assurance, serves the Stephen King novel well (with his insistence as a project of yanking horror from the ""Gothic"" into the suburban, modern-life settings), and introduces us to a host of new actors, all working at their best. What's really impressive is how nothing harped on, belabored or hovered over; you ""get it,"" of course you do, and there's nothing else to do but move on. (As simple as Hitchcock cutting out ""establishing shots"" -- who needs to cut down the narrative momentum just to cut to a shot of the Eiffel Tower, or the Empire State Building, just to show us what city we're in? Some things seem *obvious* now ... ) A good watch, even if you weren't looking for it, particularly. If you've got two hours to spend, this'll seem like a pleasant rejuvenation.",Carrie

241,theterminator-92378,A terrifying story and a tragic look into life as a teenager,7,1 October 2018,"Carrie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story in film to date and still stands up to this day. The Story follows Carrie White a normal high school student who secretly has telekinesis powers and she will understand the powers she has and has to overcome her over protective religious mother and the school bullies who want to hurt her and the prom is when all of her powers are reveled.
The cast is lead by a amazing preformance by Sissy Spacek as Carrie and she can perfectly portray a lonely high school student. Piper Laurie is Margaret White the controling mother of Carrie who uses religion to shelter her daughter from the world and she is also one of the great major parts of the movie and her preformance is so super. The supporting cast is Amy Irving
,William Katt,John Travolta,Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley the supporting cast is also one of the best parts of the movie as well and they really bring out the characters from the book.
Carrie is such a great adaptation of a Stephen King novel and while it is a carzy story because a girl can move things with her mind but it's more than that it is story about how high school can be a rough lonely time and Carrie is a view on how some people are treated at high school and that bullying is a part of that time in a teenagers life and King made that a very good point which can be relevent to some youths in modern life. Carrie is a great movie and it defently is a movie that starts off like a teen movie and it becomes a horror movie very quickly and it is a great example of a Stephen King story adapted right.",Carrie
242,lauraeileen894,Gut-wrenching horror that is high school,10,1 February 2007,"""Carrie"" is easily one of the best horror films ever made, a well-acted, yet difficult to watch display of the gut-wrenching horror that is high school. Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is a meek, introverted teenager who is treated with irrational disdain by everyone around her. Her vile classmates mock and humiliate her at every opportunity. Her teachers either patronize her or barely acknowledge her existence (the principal, in spite of being corrected numerous times, calls her ""Cassie""). Even worse, her own mother (Piper Laurie, who all but devours the scenery) is a man-hating, religious fanatic who forces Carrie to pray in a locked closet. Carrie's so used to being put upon, she's unaware of the fact that there are actually people who support her. One is no-nonsense gym teacher Miss Collins (stage veteran Betty Buckley), who defends Carrie against her heartless classmates. After Carrie is humiliated by the popular girls when she experiences her first period in the locker room shower, Miss Collins punishes their leader Chris Hargenston (Nancy Allen) by denying her prom ticket. Chris, a promiscuous, soulless queen bee, blames Carrie for her misfortune, so she convinces her idiot boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to help her exact a truly despicable revenge against Carrie at the upcoming prom. It is also on that fateful day that Carrie discovers she has telekinesis, which at first frightens her but later empowers her, undoubtedly because it's the only thing in her life she has control over. Meanwhile, another unlikely supporter for Carrie is Sue Snell (Amy Irving) who's a real high school oddity: a mean girl who truly regrets her nasty ways, so she attempts to make it up to Carrie by having her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) ask Carrie to the prom. Tommy, a dim but decent sort, agrees and Carrie accepts, though not without a bit of hesitation and bewilderment. Mrs. White tries to prevent Carrie from going to the prom by nastily telling her that Tommy will stand her up and that everyone will laugh at her. The newly confident Carrie, however, refuses to be cowed again by her mother, and goes to the prom with Tommy. Carrie is euphoric at the prom and Tommy truly enjoys her company, but, thanks to Chris's cruelty, heaven immediately turns to hell. Carrie's pent-up rage is finally unleashed as a nightmarish inferno in which no one will escape. ""Carrie"" overcomes its potentially uninteresting teenage angst story thanks to Brian de Palma's direction and its well chosen cast of actors. Spaceck received an Oscar nomination for her performance; a rarity in horror films, but she truly earned it. Spacek makes Carrie a realistic, sympathetic character, and Carrie's innocence, insecurity, and ever increasing fury feel all too real. Spacek was actually in her late '20s at the time of this movie, but with her downbeat posture, wide, frightened eyes, and her long hair that she seems to use as a burqua, she does a seamless job playing the type of unpopular girl we all should have been nicer to. Spacek also does a convincing job displaying Carrie's temporary new happiness and confidence: her posture is straighter, her hair shinier, and during the early prom scenes, Carrie's new-found radiance really transform her from ugly duckling to swan. It's beautiful and touching to watch, and all the more devastating, knowing how quickly it will end. Laurie seems to have too much fun playing Carrie's abusive, Bible-thumping mother, and she's easily one of cinema's most awful mothers, right up there with Mrs. Vale from ""Now, Voyager"" and Mrs. Iselin from ""The Manchurian Candidate"". Two underrated performances come from Buckley, playing the type of teacher we all wish we had in high school (well, how many teachers nowadays would have the guts to punish the popular kids?), and Allen as the bitchy Chris. Forget Rachel McAdams in ""Mean Girls""... Allen creates the ultimate popular girl from Hell. Chris is a foul-mouthed, gum-smacking, Bonne Belle lip gloss-wearing vixen who always seems poised to say something nasty, and even her smile is more like a sneer. She and Billy are such a hateful, dysfunctional pair that their comeuppance is ""Carrie""'s most cathartic experience. While the prom climax is indeed terrifying (and the iconic image of a blood drenched Carrie will stay with you forever), I view ""Carrie"" as more of a tragedy than a horror. Carrie is a victim of our society's prejudice against shy, quiet people. As teens we take out our petty insecurities on shy people by mocking and torturing them. As adults we overlook and dismiss them in the workplace. Over thirty years since ""Carrie""'s release, nothing has changed. That's the real tragedy.",Carrie

The film directed by De Palma is well adapted and directed. While it is not scary I would say it is extremely tense. The conflict between Carrie and her domineering religious zealot of a mother are truly brought to life well. I thought it was interesting and truly a rare adaption which lives up to the material it is based on.

The actors are all excellent, and the effects--pre-CGI--hold up today. Yes, there are deaths, but it is not about a bunch of teens who are picked off by some silly villain in a hockey mask, or with razors for fingers, or even Michael Myers in his mask. Every character has a believable motivation for his/her actions, given each character's background, history and involvement with Carrie. And again, the actors all give stunning, believable performances. ""Carrie"" is a masterpiece of horror films. And Carrie herself, the victim, is totally believable - and we empathize with her.",Carrie
248,eytand94,Carrie: Classic King,10,16 October 2012,"On paper, ""Carrie"" was, and still is, one of Stephen King's greatest literary creations, one that almost didn't happen. It is a moving but disturbing horror-drama, unique and frightening in every way. Since film adaptations of King's novels are mostly hit or miss, this story had to be made correctly and with enough class and scares to mark a memorable place in the film-goer's mind. Unsurprisingly, Brian De Palma's 1976 adaptation of ""Carrie"" is brilliant.Working from a script by Lawrence D. Cohen, the film brings us the story of Carrie White, a mousy, quiet high school misfit who suffers at the hateful hands of her peers and takes tremendous physical and emotional blows from her overly religious psycho of a mother. Only one adult, gym teacher Miss Collins, truly looks out for her. After a terrible experience in the girl's locker room, classmate Sue Snell takes it upon herself to fix things for Carrie by persuading her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to ask Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts, and at first, prom night is an exciting and engaging experience, until someone pulls another joke, a prank that goes way too far. Then people begin to laugh. That's when Carrie takes her revenge. The school doesn't know that Carrie has a secret power, and tonight, she's going to use it to her full advantage.De Palma's ""Carrie"" is a respectful adaptation of the book, one that hews closely while making some appropriate changes. There are two ways to view this film: as a drama and as a horror movie.From the dramatic standpoint, ""Carrie"" hits all the right buttons as the viewer is subjected to what could be the worst case of school bullying ever committed to celluloid. The torture Chris Hargensen and her fellow females inflict upon our poor title character is overwhelming and shocking, especially in the opening shower scene, which is iconic for its heavy amount of nudity. You feel sympathy for Carrie, which is intimidating because of the transformation she undergoes in the third act. She is an ugly duckling, the shy little fish in a big pond.The behavior of Margaret White, Carrie's mother, is arguably as cruel as that of the teenagers at Bates High School. A nightmare of a woman who dedicates her time to tea and the constant reading of the bible, Mama's own sins have convinced her that since her daughter is now a woman (Carrie has her first period at the beginning of the movie), she is equally but unjustifiably guilty.On the flip side of the coin, there's the horror aspect, and boy, is that important. ""Carrie"" is a perfect scare show. When it's scary, it's very scary. When it's gory (and it has to be), it is very gory. Certain times, the film is also surreal and hallucinatory. When Carrie gets doused in pig's blood at the prom, are her peers really laughing or is it all in her head? We don't know, but from the look in Carrie's eyes, we tell right away that she is angry. The prom scene is a disturbing, epic sequence where a moment of bliss turns into utter chaos. It's an excellent turning point for the movie.The cast, filled with young talent, is led by the unforgettable performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie as Carrie and Margaret White. Spacek, at the time, was almost 30 years old, but still looked young enough to play a teenager. She was almost not given the part, but her determination and personal makeover earned her the role. She is pitch perfect as Carrie; she puts in the perfect amount of sympathy before taking a hard left turn. It is a wondrous and gut-punching performance that got Spacek a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The same is equally said for Laurie, who viewed Margaret as a satirical look at religious stereotypes. Her performance recalls the portrayal Jack Nicholson put in for Kubrick's ""The Shining,"" another Stephen King adaptation. One can't tell if she's being over the top or if her method acting is making her disappear into the character. She scares us probably more than anything that could be prevalent in Carrie's personality. Her monologue at the end of the film is absolutely chilling.Brian De Palma's direction is spot-on and creative. Split-screens are employed with some of the most horrific imagery, and his other sequences are almost dream-like.The movie is finally helped by Pino Donaggio's unsettling score, which, in this viewer's opinion, is one of the best musical orchestrations in horror movie history. It is, at some times, sweet and lullaby-like, but other times screeching (echoing ""Psycho"") and dread-filled. There's really no other score like this one.Overall, ""Carrie"" is a classic horror film through and through. Its religious and pubescent metaphors make the viewer cringe, the casting is unbelievable, the scares are palpable, and it does all of this well while sticking closely to its source. There's no movie like it, and after 36 years, it shows no sign of aging. It will have you seeing red in the best of ways. King fans, be not afraid. ""Carrie"" is completely worth its status! P.S. The ending still makes you jump!",Carrie
249,oyason,a glimpse of the bitter cosmic gumbo ya ya personified,10,7 March 2003,"The fortieth anniversary of the release of this masterpiece has come this winter. Many people know this work and many less remember how jolting it was when it appeared on the big screen that year, and much of its impact is lost in the age of audience addictions in the United States that require constant jump scares, endless action clichés and cgi. But CARRIE was released in a time and moment when plot and character development mattered a lot more than they do now, and it is small wonder that this little grand guignol garnered as many academy award nominations as it did. It is safe to say that everybody knows the story, what with the popularity of the original King novel and the many poor remakes that have been made. So I won't recount any of that here. But even now, some of us still marvel at its subtle depiction of an ugly side of U.S. character that manifests in public schools, a sense of entitlement that magnifies the organic tendency of adolescence to unwarranted cruelty. Stephen King's CARRIE is an exercise in terror, but under Brian DePalma's masterful cinematography and pacing the story line developed into a meditation not only on the given story-line but a reflection of who we were becoming as a people long before the emergence of one Donald Trump. Consciously or otherwise, CARRIE is a masterful satire on that ugliness, the bland acquiescence of middle class life, the vast limitations of orthodox faith,enforced isolation and the death of curiosity in our culture. That seems a lot to claim for the work, and I would never say that this was the director's intent. It wasn't. It's just that, as the Situationists used to say, certain home truths come creeping out in popular form/expression, whether we would have it so or not. However, this sort of dialogue was alive and thriving when the film was made in those post Vietnam and post Watergate years, which gave us a genuine look at where we were headed. And it is for this reason that all of the remakes have been so unsatisfactory. The latter films focus on social ugliness and revenge and have no sense of subtlety or wit. The big money that backs film making in the United States today would have us believe the absolute worst about ourselves, but that's not what's going on with the original.CARRIE is pure fantasy, a nightmare, but one that has a rigorous unspoken underpinning. Her character even at its most malevolent is far from the ""evil bitch"" caricature that people laugh about, it is actually the rage of an energy some ""primitive"" cultures called the Corn Goddess. It is sweet and benign when not insulted by the ugliness of who we can be, but wrathful when pushed to the limits. And though I am sure this is far from any of what the director consciously intended, all of those things are there for those with eyes to look. The work is marvelous, a glimpse of the bitter cosmic gumbo ya ya personified, and this is why if our sad world is still alive a thousand years from now, people will still be talking about this film.",Carrie
250,Nigel St. Buggering,The last word on high school,9,1 August 2000,"If you're looking for the definitive statement on the experience of high school and being a teenager, forget about ""The Breakfast Club"".  ""Carrie"" goes deeper and more effectively into the subject than any shallow John Hughes treatment could ever hope to.Of course, it's all served up with a large dose of allegory.  Regrettably, few of us ever had the capacity for revenge that Carrie White does.  But the truth is here:  the mindless cruelty of fellow students, the first attempts to establish independence from parents.  This horror film has more reality to it than any ten ""realistic"" teen films.Additionally, it's in this early DePalma film that we first see his obsession with Hitchcock take shape.  Much of the camera work and editing is reminiscent of ""Psycho"".  Even the music score, though credited to a composer as original, is easily recognizable as a cobbling-together of Bernard Herman's ""Psycho"" score, particularly the music from the shower scene, which is used whenever Carrie's power manifests itself.The ending is legendary by now, and makes ""Carrie"" one of themost imitated films ever made, though few imitators have done their version with so much style and intelligence.",Carrie

252,PeterBradford,this film isn't even remotely dated,10,29 June 2019,"Watching this film, some 43 years after its initial release, is a revelation. It's well made, superbly photographed, and features a stellar, phenomenal cast. Piper Laurie, lured out of retirement after 15 years, is amazing as Margaret White. She looks too young to be Carrie's mother (the producers originally wanted Joan Fontaine, a good dozen or more years older than Laurie). But Laurie's performance is outstanding. She has so many memorable lines, some that I still quote to this day. ""Pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you."" Sissy Spacek puts 110% into her portrayal of Carrie. William Katt is a shining star who, amazingly, never got another role he could sparkle in like this one. Amy Irving play the level-headed part, understated for maximum sympathy. P.J. Soles is delightful, and it's clear why Carpenter was thrilled to get her for Halloween (she was a bigger name than Jamie Lee Curtis at the time). Nancy Allen is unforgettable as Chris. Sydney Lassick and Pricilla Pointer both put in good work in their parts. And John Travolta, in a part only slightly larger than in The Devil's Rain, gets second billing...lol. Check it out!",Carrie
253,LuvSopr,Horror in broad daylight,9,8 October 2016,"Many horror films belong in the night, where murder and ""punishment"" roam free, films where daylight is just precious lost hours building up to what will soon unfold when the sun sets. Carrie, until its momentous final scenes, is bathed in California sunshine, warm in temperature but not in temperament, as we are slowly shown the many different factors that will cause Carrie to break. The prom and the aftermath are night shots, eerie and deadly, but the last moments return to the sunlight, and to the false comfort of the day. This is another Hollywood product where everyone looks just a bit too old to be a teenager, but it doesn't really matter - in a way the slight lack of believability just adds to the surreal nature, and the material still hits home. For a film that is about bullying and the consequences of cruelty, De Palma remembers to include a number of moments of kindness and support, chiefly from Betty Buckley (whose performance tends to be one of the most underrated aspects of the film) as the fair-minded gym teacher who tries her best to help Carrie, and William Katt, the dreamboat, the top man at school who slowly goes from part of the taunting and humiliation of Carrie to falling in love with her. It's Buckley and Katt who unwittingly bring out what Carrie becomes, because they make her think life doesn't have to always be terrible. They upset the balance of her school and home life just as much as the nasty bullies do.Carrie is often described as a revenge film, and I think one of the reasons the modern remakes have faded into oblivion is because they focus too much on the revenge aspect. In a post-Buffy world, there is more of a posturing about some type of BAMF getting payback amidst the angsty soundtrack and arch one-liners. The tragedy of Carrie is that she doesn't get revenge - she causes wholesale carnage. She doesn't spare good people, as she does in some other version of this material. She kills everyone because she is no longer able to differentiate between friend and enemy. She essentially ""dies"" when that bucket of pig's blood falls on her. It is a startling reminder of the cost of bullying, of what happens to people who are ground into the dust by day after day of unrelenting abuse. Only when she returns home does she briefly go back to what she was, just long enough for her chief abuser to kill her and end the cycle in the only way it could be ended. One of the benefits of modern life having no set trends or styles is that it allows us all to reassess what it means to be ""dated"" and to question why something is passe just because of old clothes or hair. This film, much like Carrie herself and what made her who she was, will live on forever.",Carrie
254,kensirhan-86198,Unrivaled & Unequaled,1,1 December 2020,"Suddenly out of the blue the other day it came to me, a piece of music that had captivated me to tears on 1st hearing, which I hadn't heard in quite awhile - & on a youtube rehearing (sans the background scenery) had lost not a bit of its haunting beauty. The opening theme of Carrie is so indelibly atmospheric, at complete odds with later tragedy, it's impossible not to be moved by it, if not always to the weeping heart stage. At 1st introduction it took maybe 12 seconds, if that slow, for my soul to wrench & ducts to brim, then just before I set to blubbering like a '50s housewife over a soap opera, cruel reality dashed in - & it was a terrifying rollercoaster ride of angst, laughs, dread, suspense & finally open-mouthed wide-eyed horror. Those who like their guts spilling out of bodies instead of buckets will sneer at such a notion & get their Scream or Saw or other type graphic gorefest on to their liking; but were they faced with the more plausible events in Carrie than the ramped up fantasticals in other long drawn out blood-flood series, they too would be screaming their lungs off desperate to escape. Of course some of those crew tried to inject more graphics into the story of Carrie, for hopefully That'll Show Em! increased profits & greater notoriety, which happily flopped like a school of beached fishes. That Dollyweird colony will never learn when to leave well enough alone - be it sequel or Ree-Boot - so we have only to wait for the next announcement of the latest attempt to breathe new air into a production that didn't need it for another roaring good time laughing at their pitiful projects.

Meantime those who love Carrie just as she is, 44 years later & counting, can marvel at how things turned out given the proposed alternatives, e.g. casting & directing, that would have not worked anywhere as well - & suggest that film colony take blind aim at other pieces etched in cinematic history for future laughs.

255,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,29 March 2016,"Carrie is about an unusual girl named Carrie who has telekinetic powers and is raised by a fanatically religious Christian mother and attends a high school where she is picked on by other students. Partly out of compassion and partly due to the fact that she can't go to the prom, a girl asks her popular boyfriend to ask Carrie to go to the prom with him. Other students learn this and plan a cruel prank on Carrie at the prom which is carried out resulting in Carrie using her telekinetic powers to take deadly revenge. This is a very good movie. It's an anti-religion message movie in that it shows the harm that can result from someone having an extremely religious mind. It's also an anti-bullying movie in that it has a completely innocent and nice girl being bullied especially when the outrageous prank is done. One of the very powerful aspects of the movie is that the mother is supposed to be compassionate towards her daughter but she is almost nothing but religiously insane to her. This is especially powerful when Carrie comes home after the prank and her mother tries to kill her. And Carrie kills her in defense which upsets her and that is sad and powerful.",Carrie
256,joshfedderson,"A Story about a shy, timid, and frightened girl with an extraordinary but deadly gift",10,21 October 2017,"In our lives we all feel shy and timid, especially when we were teenagers trying to figure out who we were. Steven King's story of ""Carrie"" explains that to an excellent point.Carrie White is a shy, timid, and frightened teenage girl with absolutely no friends, her mother is a religious nut case who thinks everything wrong is a sin. On top of that girls at school tease her and make fun of her. But Carrie keeps a secret, that no one, not even her mother knows about. In situations when Carrie is extremely upset, she can move things with her mind also known as Telekinesis. The first half of the movie she doesn't know what to make of this, and the only one who seems to actually care about Carrie is her High School Gym Teacher.During the movie you feel bad for Carrie, a lot of us don't realize what bullying can do to our minds. During these times, the film shows us how innocent Carrie is, especially during the shower scene when she has her first period, the poor girl is totally frightened and the other girls are just standing there and laughing at her and throwing Gauze pads. Throughout the film you just want to help Carrie, the film makers do a good job of showing how innocent she is. One day a boy ask her to the prom, an unsure Carrie rejects him at first, but then as time goes on she goes against her mothers wishes and goes with him. The prom scene is one of the best points in the movie, I won't give away things but her power or ""Gift"" goes full out of control, it just shows how much anger and resentment the timid Carrie kept bottled up inside and how at this point she literally releases a ""Hell have no fury like a woman scorned"" power against all those who were against her, as well as those who cared for her. The story of Carrie has some value or morals to it, A shy timid girl is trying to fit into society but her mother and background do not help at all with that. At some points in our lives, don't we all feel like Carrie? We try to fit in with others, but yet we get mocked and scorned because we are different then those around us. I know in High school I did see a lot of that, people had their own groups. I for one can sympathize with Carrie because, honestly, in High school I was a loner. Sure, I had a good group of people I knew but mostly I did things by myself, I was shy and timid just like Carrie and yes, I did get made fun of now and then. I think this movie would be good to show high school kids because of the morals and values it teaches, but then again it is a horror movie and rated R. But I liked Carrie because I could relate to her is some ways.The Ending of Carrie was sad, being innocent the poor girl finally realizes that her unique gift is a curse. And her mother, being the nut job that she is shows just how insane she is at the end of the movie. But then again the ending makes you think if Carrie is really innocent or not, by a creepy dream of one of her classmates have. The ending scared the crap out of me, but that's just another fun trick the Master of Horror has up his sleeves. 10/10 for Steven Kings ""Carrie""",Carrie

It is a great story written by Stephen King and a sheer thriller brought to life. The only problem is the effective events towards the end are fast and are not acknowledged enough to understand the character much.

There's really no villain here. The tormentors aren't all bad, and Carrie's mother is only doing what she thinks will prevent Carrie from suffering eternal damnation.It fares much better as a drama. You truly feel Carrie's pain, and the way Carrie's treated is disturbing, but not really scary.But even as a drama, it doesn't fully succeed. The character development is sketchy and superficial, the psychological and emotional states of the characters are never fully realized, and there's nothing biting or thought-provoking.The performances are very good. Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deserved their Oscar nominations. Another standout is Amy Irving, as a fellow student who takes pity on Carrie. Irving's dream sequence at the end is the best part of the movie (I'm not going to spoil the scene for you, you'll have to watch it yourself and be amazed).",Carrie

Plus it features John Travolta in his first breakthrough big-screen performance, Sissy Spacec, Betty Buckley, P.J. Soles, and William Katt, among others.

262,m0rg16,I was disappointed,6,28 July 2004,"The legendary Carrie, which everyone has seen and everyone loves. Man, when I read in the newspaper that it was going to be aired, I just had to see it. When I sat infront of the television, I was somewhat confused by the opening shower shot. Naked girls? It felt like a pretty unnecesary shot, but perhaps someway, in Brian De Palmas mind, it was necessary...The plot is: Carrie White is a girl who goes to Bates Highschool. She's an outsider who has no friends of any kind. The only relation she has is to the gym teacher, who's always nice to Carrie, trying to help her. And then there's her mother, who is an overly religious fanatic who, perhaps, should seriously consider turning to another religion before she dies from praying to much. Carrie has one strange ability, however... She can move things with her mind. Toss objects, unlock doors and open them with a mere thought.
Suddenly, her world is turned upside down as a boy in school asks her to the prom. At first she thinks that it's just another trick, so that the popular kids can get her to the prom and them laugh at her. But as time goes on, she's not so sure anymore... And it also seems that her mind gets more and more powerful.I didn't really like this movie. First, it took off to fast. 50 minutes into the film, Carrie was already on her way to the prom, and we all knew that that was going to be the climax right there. At the prom, we got some character development, but nothing really more. It just drags on, until the splitscreen finale (which I'm not going to spoil) starts. This so called ""legendary"" scene, was not quite so good as I had imagined it. It was kind of tame, actually. But for 1976, I can forgive it.The actors do a pretty decent job at their work, but none of them stand out, except perhaps Piper Laurie, who portrays the mother. I really wanted that person to die from the first scene I saw here, and that means Piper did a good job with her. Sissy Spacek plays Carrie, but I really didn't care for her. Nor any other actors. Even John Travolta, who has a supporting role, doesn't really stand out, but everybody's gotta start somewhere, right?
Nothing else is really remarkable about this film, except that De Palma's loooong scenes, makes sure that 100 minutes seem to fly by, somehow. It feels like we are given less, and that it takes to quick for the film to establish Carrie's character, and then plunge her into the prom... Well. I didn't like it at least. But I will give it some credit, for keeping some cool questions unanswered until the end. You'll see. They are pretty much unrelevant to the story, yet interesting.5/10",Carrie
263,style-2,Low budget magnificence,8,31 January 2005,"Sissy, pole-vaulting into immortality by playing the avenging angel of all oppressed and abused teenagers. Holding up as a camp classic for 25 years, as well as being referenced and spoofed in dozens of other films, *Carrie* is a spectacular production that radically upped the ante for future teen-scream horror fests. As the socially-retarded, but secretly powerful Carrie White, Spacek plays her character with a sincerity that is heartbreaking. When, as part of a vengeful joke, she is elected Prom Queen, and is doused with a bucket of pig's blood, her powers of telekinesis go wild, and everybody pays. DePalma takes us on a wild visual ride, with spectacular cinematography - an opening sequence of the girls' locker room is as dreamy and erotic as odalisque painting by Ingres, but it quickly devolves to one of the most distressingly graphic and disturbingly camp scenes in all filmdom  that of the menstruating Carrie on the floor of the shower being pelted with Kotexes by her classmates screaming, ""Plug it up! Plug it up!"" The scene is only the first of many ugly surprises DePalma has up his sleeve. It is Sissy's stock-in-trade to play a character who has deep respect for, yet rebels against, her upbringing - often that of ignorant (but never stupid) white-trash from a bad gene-pool. In most films, she ultimately rises above her milieu and proves that a good heart will conquer all. *Carrie* is no exception, even though Sissy's character does not survive this one. It is the physical change from the impossibly-freckled, socially-retarded waif into the vision of 70s loveliness that enters into many of Sissy's portrayals, and Sissy expresses these changes in such a way to make the viewer look forward to them. She does not disappoint. Many aspects of the film have entered into the lexicon of film  the famous bucket of blood falling in slow motion sets off the ugly chain of events culminating in mayhem that has seldom been portrayed more shatteringly than the conflagration at the prom. The split-screen recording of the bloodbath at the end, cutting away all sound except for the dripping of blood, is magnificent. As quotable as *Valley Of The Dolls* and *All About Eve* (""I should have killed myself after the first time he put it in me."" ""I might have known it would be red."" ""I can see your dirty pillows."" ""Take off the dress, we'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.""), *Carrie* will live and die  forever.",Carrie

However, one girl, Sue Snell feels bad for the way Carrie is being treated and asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. However, prom night will lead to a frightening disaster that will have the audience on the edge of their seats. Overall, this movie was really good.

268,chimera3,Watch Out for the Quiet Ones,10,8 September 2017,"I will never forget how old I was when I first read this book and saw the movie: I was eight. Granted it was rated R, my mother did not care. Then I got her and my middle brother to watch it with me. They loved it. In every high school (or grade school, for that matter), there is always that person who is bullied by everyone else and that person who tries to step in and stop it. What's sad in this day and age is that bullying has become such commonplace that nobody can stop it in time and the person who is the victim, nine times out of ten, will take their life. The gist of this is to, as the title states, watch out for the quiet ones. If you bully them long enough, they will do something to get even with you. You don't even need a timeless classic like ""Carrie"" to tell you that. In my opinion, this is definitely one movie that all school bullies should sit down and watch until they get the picture. When they're done watching it, they may actually break down and apologize to that person (or maybe they don't) for all that they've done to them.This is scary with a capital S. Ignore the two CGI-filled remakes that came after this. They can't even measure up to the shocks and scares that are developed with this one. A word to the wise: I try not to watch this in the dark. Keep a few lights on with this one. Enjoy.",Carrie
269,Vastarien202,Sad fact of life,10,17 August 2007,"I remember reading the book in 6th grade and feeling so very close to Carrie. I was the outcast for all of my schools, no matter where we moved the monsters would find me. I wished so hard for powers of my own, but I never got them. This is a wonderfully done film, and a true landmark of its kind. While the fashions and music have dated considerably, it's still a great study of how our culture eats its young alive, and even encourages victimization of others, through religious intolerance, social class, perceived intelligence as a threat, and on and on. The true ugliness of American culture is all here, and we hope you like what you see. The sad fact is, most of us nerds never get our day, we just quietly die in bedrooms and hang from swingsets. We are the ones who get punished for ""acting out"" when simply trying to defend ourselves from butt holes. Those same jerks never get anything more than a slap on the wrist, while we get suspended. Is it any wonder why so many of us die young?! Some of us choose to take a few of our tormentors with us, but let's be honest, the Columbine Kids just couldn't AIM. That's the real tragedy, not a bunch of privileged snots. Carrie avenged us all.",Carrie
270,Shinwa,Just a classic,9,27 November 1998,"The most amazing thing about Carrie is that for at least the first hour and change, there is scarcely any indication that it's a horror movie. When the tone shifts dramatically at the end (and the tone does shift dramatically a lot), it packs that much extra punch. This is also a serious downer of a movie, though I'm sure many viewers will sympathize with the outsider's retribution theme. One of the three most successful Stephen King adaptations (The Shining and Misery being the other two), this is helped immeasurably by Brian de Palma's flair. Call him a Hitchcock-wannabe all you want, this film has style to burn and most of its gimmicks work. Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie, and Piper Laurie is riveting as her mother. This is #4 on my list of all-time horror movies, if anyone cares.",Carrie
271,Lee-112,Never gets old,8,19 September 1999,"I love this movie so much.  This is one of the few movies i've seen that never gets old.  Great performances by all the cast.  Especially by Piper Laurie, and Sissy Spacek.  Betty Buckley is wonderful as always, and it's funny to see a young John Travolta in the mix.Even though this film isn't scary, it's actually kind of sad, it still remains to be one of my favorite horror films.  If you haven't seen this, then you should go out and rent it.  It's a great film, with great actors, and one of the few movies that measure up to the books by Stephen King.",Carrie
272,conspracy-2,Excellent Storytelling,10,29 May 2000,"This is a classic film. So I had seen it before today. But I was a kid, and I seem to remember the shock-scary parts as the catalysts to my nightmares, and not much about the rest.Today, I saw it again, armed with a huge backlog of movies. I have seen enough to discriminate the bad from the good, the mediocre from the excellent. And Carrie is certainly excellent.OK, so the premise is at first glance a little weird and far-fetched, but hey, that's Stephen King. What Stephen King also does is to somehow get these far-fetched situations blended in with believable reality. He creates a sort of grey zone between horror and reality. I suppose that's what makes his books frightening enough to entertain millions.Anyway, this is not a litterary review. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a girl in her senior year of high school, raised by a fanatically christian woman (excellently played by a psycotically frizzy-haired Piper Laurie). She is teased and made fun of because of her naivety and oddness.So, a stereotypical bitch girl in Carrie's class, looking hideously 70s right down to the 'who wears' short shorts, plots a nasty, nasty surprise for Carrie. Without giving too much away, this surprise comes right at a time when Carrie is truly happy, for the first time in her life.It is in this classic scene, before and after the prank, that you see that Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie. She is introduced in the film as a shy, odd-looking, bland girl. Before the prank, she beams and smiles and she is beautiful. The change is truly remarkable. After the prank, well, she is pretty scary. All these attributes are contained perfectly within Spaceks appearance and acting. It's a shame we don't see her in more movies.The storytelling, as I have said in my one-line summary, is excellent. The foreshadowing of the prank is subtely and deftly introduced, so that the viewer knows in advance what's going to happen. Everyone, it seems, knows. Everyone but Carrie. We feel sorry for her and are on her side afterwards as well. This is something of a feat to pull off in Hollywood's 'white-teeth-big-jaw-squeaky-clean-super-hero' ideal.Carrie's internal development (excuse the pun) is paced just as well. Her growing rebellions against her mother, her realization that there is more to life than bible bashing...all the way through she blooms. The symbolism is perhaps a bit overstated in places (Who ever saw a Jesus figure that looked quite like that?) but is none the less quite effective, and drenches through the film appropriately.Brian DePalma is excellent at making movies that appeal on many levels. As a kid, I liked the scary parts. My mother, whom I watched it with, enjoyed it for the human interaction and the bitchiness of the girls and their 'reward'. I, as I have pointed out, enjoyed the pacing and the whole imagery of the film. Something for everyone.Oh, wait. There is one thing. The sight of Tommy Ross (William Katt) in his tuxedo is just awful. He is supposed to look sexy - the big catch at the prom - but his huge curly hair and the large lapels on his turqouise suit under his enourmous bow tie serve as a hideous reminder that the seventies were The Decade That Taste Forgot.",Carrie
273,lerkim,Oh....Thats freakish...,9,22 January 2008,"It is rarely i give a horror movie more then 6 or 8 because normally they are all just well basically the same, i am never really scared or even shocked but boy this movie changed that. Carrie is a movie based upon the great writer Stephen King and well you know he is really good at this, he knows what ticks in our minds but not every movie gets you going as much as this does. Also not many can relate to the young generation like this.Story 10/10 The story begins with a portray of a young woman bathing and then suddenly beginning to bleed not understand why. This is Carrie she seeks out help from the girls right next to her, she is frightened by the blood not knowing that it is completely normally, but instead of getting help from the girls she is picked on in a harsh way. This some can relate to if they were picked on in school by bullies on others and not being the cool one but instead the outsider. But something is different with Carrie, yes she got the power of telekinesis and uses them when she gets angry or sad. then the story tells a lot of what happened until the big bang at the prom night when she finally uses her powers for all to see.Actors 10/10 I love Sissy Spacek now and why? well she shows something not many actors can real emotions i don't know how she did it but you feel with her every moment meaning you will actually almost vision being right next to her or sitting watching her at the prom. When she cries you do, when she is scared you feel a chill down your neck and when she uses her powers you actually in some way will want to cheer for her and thats sick. I don't believe any of the others characters does just what she does so i wont say more about that.Music N/A Well in some way your used to these kind of samples and such if you have seen a movie from that decade or even some new ones so that does not really matter that much.Overall 10/10 Well i was freaked out especially at the last scene where Sue Snell is pictured as some king of a white angel perhaps, when she puts the flowers down on the ground and the hand of Carrie comes up from the ground i got the biggest shock in my life i was actually shaking and only Stephen King can do just that so overall this is a classic and a horror movie that should only be praised to the end.",Carrie
274,seeingbystarlight,"""I knew they'd hurt my little girl.""",7,30 July 2018,"These are the words Margaret White says, as she's about to stab her daughter Carrie to death, as punishment for going to the prom.I have seen both movie adaptations of this story, read the novel, and can honestly say that if I had to choose a favorite version, I'd pick this one, if -for no other reason- than because of the outstanding performances of both Piper Laurie, and Sissy Spacek, both of whom shine like new pennies.There is also the presence of John Travolta, early in his career, and Amy Irving early in hers.Though not one of my favorite movies, this film does have something of it's own to offer. It's one of Brian DePalma's best, and will haunt you long after you've finished watching it.What's striking about this story, is the rush one can get from pushing an already racked, and fragile creature over the edge...And the dire consequences that can come from that action.Shy and mousy Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) has been the butt of every cruel joke since toddlerhood.Raised by the fanatical and insane Margaret White (Piper Laurie), Carrie's home life is hell, and her school life is not much better.Constantly demeaned and humiliated, Carrie is surrounded by kids who have no compassion for her situation, and do everything they can to make it worse...That is until pretty and popular Sue Snell (Amy Irving), feeling genuine remorse for her actions, asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to the prom...But there are certain others in the group, among them Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), and Billy Nolan (John Travolta), who see this prom night as a perfect opportunity to do some mischief with an appalling stunt...not knowing it'll be the one that kills them.And not even the caring, and compassionate Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) can stop things now.People say Carrie's gifts are evil.It would be more accurate to say that this is what happens when mean people start preying too much on the weak, and the helpless.Like a myth or a spook story:Don't bully innocent people. Or powerful forces will get you.

275,RElKO,One of the best Stephen King adaptations.,9,25 July 2000,"This movie is an adaptation of the first book Stephen King ever wrote, and i think it couldn't have been better.First of all, it's directed by Brian DePalma, who made some dreadfully boring thrillers (Obsession), but also some very suspenseful thrillers (Dressed to kill, Body double). This falls into the second category. It also has some great actors at the start of their careers. After this movie, Sissi Spacek, Piper Laurie, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving became highly respected actor/actresses.What makes this movie work so well is the involvement with the characters. Carrie, the main characters is a tragic and (aside from the supernatural powers) very realistic character. Who hasn't know a very insecure, shy teenage girl that the more popular people used to pick on. Only this time payback is a bitch. And although the way Carrie executes revenge on all those who have taunted her is very violent, you can't help but sympathize with her after all she's been through. Here was a girl who after a very unhappy childhood was given a glimmer of hope by being chosen as the prom queen, only to find out it was a setup for the most disturbing, embarrassing humiliation possible. Sissi Spacek is especially great at this point, when she's lost all her marbles. Piper Laurie is fantastic as the domineering, religious fanatic mother, and the likes of John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving are pure evil personified as heartless classmates of Carrie who are relentless in their badgering of her.Weakhearted people should brace themselves for the final shot.",Carrie
276,thomas196x2000,Definitely a mixed bag,6,31 January 2007,"Someone here said this is in fact a monster movie, about the monster inside us all. I will second that, but it's really a movie about psychological torment.This is a movie that starts out well--despite being rather distasteful in the opening sequence--and builds from there. However, there are so many plot holes and illogical developments that the film never really holds together well.Is it scathing satire or is it not? The film pulls us in two directions. It's sweet when Carrie likes the poem in class, yet the instructor who mocks her acts like he's in a goofy commercial. Characters bounce between doing serious things and comical things. What's with the Baby Elephant Walk music during the girls' punishment, and the fast motion tuxedo gag? Betty Buckley's performance is the best in the bunch. There is something interesting about her being both angry at the girls for committing such a heinous act towards Carrie while at the same time being irritated that Carrie won't apparently even try to help herself. However, did we need the extra touch of Carrie's menstrual blood on her shorts as she paces the Principal's office and discusses the situation with him? The major over the top piece is with Carrie's mother. The woman has no compassion, and it's hard to believe that she would go so far as to kill her own daughter. I didn't buy it, and I thought it was a cheap way to make the viewer hate the mother. How much more convincing and interesting it would have been if the mother was at least something more than a two dimensional cardboard religious nut case stereotype.Further, her madness and religious extremism portrayed here comes quite close to Christian-bashing. Why are the Christ figures in her home purposely scary looking? When Carrie's mom is killed, is it supposed to be funny or is it just more bashing when the flying knives eventually do her in and cause her to form a position as if she was crucified on a cross? Or how about the church organ music when Carrie goes home after the school burns down? There are other problems here. How on earth could dozens of kids decorating the gym just completely miss a huge bucket of blood in the rafters with a big rope on it, for what, days on end as the work continues? How did Tommy get killed, or even knocked out, by an empty tin bucket? Why did Carrie imagine seeing her gym teacher laughing at her? (It might have worked better, if the filmmakers wanted you to believe that it was all in her head, to show the laughing from her point of view and then cut to the schoolmates and teachers looks of horror in reality) What exactly was burning in a primarily an open gym? Why did Carrie's house fold in on her, she herself was not making that happen.For me, the jaggedness of the movie will always keep it from being a really good movie, aside from moments that are in fact very well done.",Carrie
277,tommyson,Overrated,2,9 January 1999,"""Carrie"" has to be the most overrated movie of all time. It starts off promisingly, but nothing decent happens until the final 15 minutes. Brian Depalma rips off Hitchcock at every turn.",Carrie
278,saeedahmedsasoli,This is a great film.,10,20 November 2020,"What I really liked about ""Carrie"" is the absolutely perfect ending. I had commented before that ""Sisters"" had an absolutely perfect ending. The one thing about Brian DePalma is that he knows how to end a picture. ""Dressed to Kill"" had a really good one, although some people hated it as well as ""Blow Out"". ""The Fury"" has the greatest ending of all the DePalma thrillers.Carrie is an abused teenager with a void where her self-esteem should be. Her mother is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens, who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are, for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period - incredibly late - finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie, who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death, freaks out. Of course, her classmates find this terribly amusing.Carrie is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce, and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed. It features great performances by Sissy Spacek as the severely damaged Carrie, Piper Laurie as her delusional mother, Amy Irving as the one teenage girl with a streak of compassion and guilt and Nancy Allen as every nerds nightmare - the Popular Girl with no morals, no feelings and no mercy.For having been written by a man (Stephen Kings first novel) this is a powerful portrait of what it is like to be a teenage girl...and an outcast one at that. The hope, the anger and frustration, all are strong and realistically portrayed. This is a film about the monster within us all. That aside--this is a great film.",Carrie

Already, 37 years and I have to say that this Carrie one of the best horror movie I've ever seen.Unfortunately, I'm not read this Stephan King yet, but I guess great screen writing come from great source and great screen writer. Another most important part is great acting. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie really bring this movie to higher class. They're both creepy and remarkable.I think this is called horror movie. Just horror. And it deserve praise.",Carrie
282,horrordude_666,Strange but great,7,17 February 2003,This movie I found was very scary but didn't have much killing. The mom was the best kill. I did think it was very good but was unusual. The mom was the best character. The way she treated her daughter was disturbing because she thought everything Jesus didn't do was a sin. John Travolta was good in it too. Sissy Specek was a very wise choice.,Carrie
283,Adrian-32,A horror classic,9,17 March 1999,"Brian De Palma`s ""Carrie"", still remains as one of the most unforgettable and enduring horror films ever made.  This harrowing, chilling and riveting movie takes a look at a very popular subject; adolescent cruelty.  Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a withdrawn and sexually repressed misfit who also possesses psychic powers. Brian De Palma`s famous prom scene is electrifying, but it is the final scene between Carrie and her mother that will both disturb and haunt you. ""Carrie"" is a very distinctive horror film, that combines chilling horror and tragic poignancy, creating a genuinely good movie that should be watched again and again.",Carrie
284,Adrian-32,Great movie,9,21 March 1999,"""Carrie"" is basically a film that shows how destructive human anger can be. A true horror classic, director Brian de Palma made ""Carrie"" a film that no one else could touch.  To some, this film isn`t scary at all. I partially agree, the first sixty minutes of this film can almost pass for a drama. On the other hand, ""Carrie"" exudes a distinctive eeriness and intensity that is more effective than blatant gore and horror. Sissy Spacek`s performance as Carrie White is nothing less than brilliant. Piper Laurie is equally good, playing Carrie`s religion-frenzied, psychotic mother.  High school has always been a hot concept for films, and this film focuses on a real adolescent issue; adolescent cruelty. It can be painful and unpleasant, but for Carrie White,it was pure hell. To top it off, she has to endure her mother`s madness AND understand her new-found psychic powers.  De Palma`s stylish but gloomy direction makes this film riveting, from beginning to end. ""Carrie"" also possesses a quality that a lot of horror films do not, poignancy. You can easily sympathize for Carrie and her sad life. Even when she unleashes her powers, destroying everything in her path at the end. The conclusion of ""Carrie"" is very disturbing and almost upsetting, because the protagonist`s battle to win some compassion ends terrifyingly and tragically. Carrie`s deadly wrath was unfairly triggered, but she had to pay the ultimate price. Powerful and chilling, ""Carrie"" is a horror film that should be enjoyed, appreciated and cherished.",Carrie
285,Adrian-32,Chilling,9,15 May 1999,"The horror classic, ""Carrie"", is not just a one-dimensional horror film, instead it is a rare combination of high school drama, science-fiction/fantasy, and tragic horror. It is a very chilling film in the way it concentrates on teenagers, sexual repression and terrifying retaliation. Director Brian De Palma did an excellent job unraveling the film`s plot, and attracting attention to its important elements. Sissy Spacek`s performance as the title character, Carrie White, is remarkable, and it is the film`s main highlight. What makes the movie so interesting is that the ""force of terror"" of the story is just a shy, teenage girl who also happens to possess telekinetic powers. Carrie is taunted by her classmates, tyrannised by her religion-frenzied mother (played superbly by Piper Laurie) and still must understand her sexual outbreak of psychic forces. Carrie`s compassion-deprived life is almost difficult to watch, and it makes the viewer feel sympathy towards her. ""Carrie"" is well known for its prom scene climax. Brian De Palma`s famous camera tricks are present here. It may not seem realistic, but that`s because not everyone has psychic powers. The film shows just what might happen if someone gets pushed too far, and the violent retribution they would put in effect. What makes ""Carrie"" such an effective film that it ""fantasizes"" about revenge in a cruel adolescent society, but still remains grounded on how even the most innocent person can be driven over the edge.",Carrie
286,bjhadse,A Faithful but Dated Adaptation.,7,17 October 2011,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a hopelessly awkward teenage girl: loathed as a pariah by her classmates and abused by her profoundly Christian mother (Laurie Piper). The only person who shows her the slightest human kindness is her gym teacher (Betty Buckley), who rescues her from the torments of her classmates when she gets her first (incredibly belated) period while showering after gym. Along with her late-coming adolescence, Carrie develops telekinesis, which she hones despite her mother's accusations of witchcraft. Sue Snell (Amy Irving), one of Carrie's tormentors, tries to make up for her actions by convincing her boyfriend (William Katt), who Carrie has a crush on, to take her to the prom. Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), however, despises her punishment for what she did to Carrie and wants to make her pay.""Carrie"" (1976) demonstrates an intense level of fidelity with the novel upon which it is based. Brian DePalma demonstrates his technical proficiencies as a director in his realistic (if extreme) treatment of adolescence. The problem arises, however, with entrenched in the decade of its origin the film is. It is hopelessly, infuriatingly, obviously seventies. The decisions to use of kaleidoscope lenses, to rotate the camera opposite the rotation of Tommy Ross' and Carrie White's dancing and the a-typical use of sound after Chris dumps pigs' blood on Carrie - while it certainly conveys its cinematic message with all due clarity - are hopelessly dated techniques that permanently entrench the film in its specific time and place (instead of existing within a sense of timelessness).Fans of Stephen King's novels will find this to be delightfully faithful to his novel (a statement which cannot be said about even some of his best adaptations). Fans of horror films - as well as distinctly seventies films - will likewise find this to be a welcome and fairly-executed inclusion into their folds.",Carrie
287,mcrpghk,Carrie is the embodiment of all the young people who have been bullied,10,7 March 2021,"I find it amazing how this film manages to approach bullying in such a frightening way and at the rewarding end, Carrie is like any introverted young man in high school, especially if you're the quiet and friendless type, so much so that I believe that's the reason the movie works so well.It's amazing to think that everything this character suffers on screen is still so close to our current reality, if not worse, and I think that's also a reason the movie is great, you sympathize with Carrie in the first minutes of the film by mocking and even assaulting the girl just for having wronga pass in Volleyball.One thing I should point out is how the characters are humanized, since at some point in our lives we were probably rude, rude or even mocked by that person, not least because young people don't have much idea how stupid they can be with others, and that's what happens here, some of the students who mock Carrie aren't necessarily bad , are just idiots at times, but just like in real life some of us get bad after realizing we had a bad attitude, and we tried to correct that mistake, just like the character Sue.I find the perspective of Professor Collins and Tommy interesting, since she is first despite wanting to help Carrie and see her happy, she knows how complicated she is, at one point she asks Tommy ""Wouldn't you feel ashamed for showing up with her at the dance?"" And that may sound rude at first glance, but we're all like that, as much as we don't mock someone in the face out of respect nothing prevents us from saying what we really think when that person isn't there, and about Sue's boyfriend, it's realistic the way he hates bullies but also doesn't want to relate to her. , no one wants to be near the strange student when young, even though they have nothing against him.Religious extremism is also very well addressed with the mother, interpreted very well by Piper Laurie, the character can not accept that he has human desires like anyone else and treats his whole life and consequently the life of the daughter in a literary way regarding what the Christian Bible says, and of course this can generate nothing more than brainwashing , maternal dependence and fear of socializing with others.And what about Carrie? Well, director Brian De Palma could not have chosen the actress better to embody in this role, Sissy Spacek is the perfect combination of beauty and terrifying, no other actress who came to try the same role or similar roles had the same charisma and grandeus as this actress, all she feels us as viewers feel together, just as we feel satisfaction every moment when she uses her powers as defense or revenge , the face of the character when entering Berserk mode is the vivid illustration of the feeling ""I'm sick of it"", not to mention that the fact that she does not move an arm to do everything she does is a demonstration of a gigantic force.The only thing I feel could be better at in the movie are the deaths at the party, at times the hoses watering people and they've been slipping are somewhat as caricatas, other than that, this movie works perfectly.",Carrie
288,rabhy,One of my earliest encounter with De palma,10,26 August 2020,"I don't know how many times I have seen this movie.
Carrie gets to know about her superpower ( decades before superhero movies were famous) that she is telekinetic and she can move things after a tragic incident took place in her school life, her mother is God fearing woman and looks at Carrie as if she has committed a sin.
In third act of film another tragedy happens when Carrie's batch mates manipulate the prom Queen results and declare her as prom Queen.
Now she uses her powers to avenge.
Brian de palma's camera technique ( split screen and diopter shots) deserve special attention.
This movie kickstarted many people's careers including John Travolta, Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie (relaunched), Amy irwing, William Katt, Betty Buckley, Nancy Allen, Stephen King and Brian de palma himself.
This movie stands outs as one of the finest horror movies from 70s way better than follow up movies that were made to bank on Carrie and miles better than Kimberly pierce directed disastrous Carrie",Carrie
289,morticia64,Guilty pleasure from the 70s,8,29 October 2021,"""Carrie"" is not just a horror film based on the supernatural; it's also a reminder of how horrible life can be as a teenager. The fear of not fitting in and not being accepted is just as strong as the power Carrie unleashes on those who wronged her.This film is a reflection of the 1970s and the social hierarchy in high schools everywhere. Cliques. Bullies. The angst of fitting in. As if Carrie didn't have all these things to deal with, she had a mother who was a religious zealot who made Carrie live as if she was in a cult. With the help of a kind gym teacher, Carrie found the acceptance and support she was lacking from her mother. As she builds confidence, her supernatural abilities build up as well. We begin to think that Carrie can turn her life around. But...Carrie ends with the famous, much talked about scene where she gets her revenge. It's disturbing that she chooses to kill even those who tried to help her.This movie is required viewing if you are interested in a film that reflects 70s culture or if you are a Stephen King fan. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are outstanding as is the supporting cast, especially the actors who play the mean girls. This is a dark, depressing movie. We all knew a Carrie in school who doesn't fit in, who doesn't have a good home, who is bullied. In this movie, you get a glimpse of how they really feel. You won't feel good when it's over.",Carrie
290,Movieman-133,"Carrie is an interesting, horror tragedy",9,13 May 1999,"The first time I watched Carrie I was only in the sixth grade and I was very terrified and shocked that this drama about such a sweet,  innocent girl could turn into such a terrifying horror experience.   When I watched the movie,  I had no idea what to expect and when I saw the bucket,  I was praying that It wouldn't fall--how naive I was.   I just saw how beautiful and innocent Sissy Spacek was and the thought of blood dropping on her was completely unimaginable.  This is one of those horror movies where people would really care about the protagonist,   and this is important for us to Sissy as a tragic figure,  rather than an evil horror killer.   Ever since my first viewing I have grown to love this movie.  I bought the novel, which is much more detailed with Carrie thoughts on discovering her powers and the very detailed account on Margaret White's relationship with Carrietta.   The whole first hour of the movie I was expecting to be scared but after continuously watching it,  I realized that this is just a nice drama with high school kids.  The characters were well developed, even though I do admit that they were pretty much cartoon figures--which I liked.  Sue Snell was the brown haired nice girl;  Nancy Allen was the blond sexual meanie,   John Travolta was the dumb druken bum, Betty Buckley was the nice,  caring teacher,  and William Katt was the blond jockey Prince Charming.  I loved all these supporting characters,   even though I wanted them to show a more loving relationship(sexual) between Tommy and Sue.  The story was wonderful and that is why the Prom scene came as such a horrifying shock,   I didn't expect that such a provocative drama would turn so horrifying.  There are some reviews that say Carrie is not a horror movie,  maybe not in the first hour but the death of Laurie is undoubbly shocking.  I was young and all of a sudden I saw knives flying and I couldn't believe what I was watching. It was so surprisingly fresh,   something that I have never would expect or witnessed before.   The hand coming out of the grave shocked me because I had no idea what would happen.  I was cautious when watching the scene but I just couldn't fgure out what happened and then Boom--the hand.    This was the most frightening moment of the film because it so unexpected,  at least they filmed the knifes flying before they popped into Laurie.  Even before the prom scene,  images as the crucifix, watching Carrie being dragged across the kitchen floor into the praying closet,  the pigs being slaughtered,  Margaret's fanatical lines,   and the bloody horrifying scene of Carrie's first period.  Maybe this is not 90's horror but the scenes are certainly bizarre and entertaining. I give the movie 4 stars because even though I've watched it about 8 times,  it still thrills and entertains me. The music,  the characters,  and Sissy Spacek's prescence cannot be forgotten in this high school drama which is garnered into an interesting and psychological horror film.  Better than any of those Hitchcock films.",Carrie
291,manusanchez90,Excellent horror mystery thriller! 8!,8,11 June 2013,"I have seen many movies based on books written by Stephen King. In fact, I would consider myself a King's fan if I had read, at least, one of the numerous books he has written. ""Carrie"" is one of the best of them I saw. King's traits are very visible in this story: his sense of humour, horror, supernatural elements, mystery, drama, good performances, etc. The fact that John Travolta acted in the movie and that Brian de Palma directed it made me wish to watch ""Carrie"". Moreover, I am looking forward to seeing its remake. This movie is wonderfully directed with the right pace and duration. Brian de Palma did a very entertaining job with a very good script. The story is about a teenage girl who has telekinetic abilities and is bullied by her schoolmates. She lacks of a social life and is not like most teenagers. Moreover, she lives with her mother, who is a very possessive and mad women left by his husband. I prefer not to tell anything else about the plot not to spoil. The cast is mainly composed by Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie and John Travolta. Sissy Spacek delivered a solid performance, maybe, a little bit overacted. The performances are very correct. The story is original and the capacity of entertainment is really high. The plot and the performances are the strongest points of this movie. There are several shocking scenes which are very amazing. In conclusion, this is a must-see for those like the stories from King. 8.",Carrie
292,lists-9,Brilliantly-done tragedy,9,22 August 2001,"Almost everything about Carrie is brilliantly done. It is a tragedy in the fullest sense, with the outcome inevitable from the start. Sissy Spacek's faultless performance seems to have the ability to make almost every viewer (male or female) empathise with her character, and the result is a sad film, but a genuine emotional experience. The supporting cast hardly put a foot wrong (Piper Laurie is particularly memorable) and Pino Donaggio's music is just right. As a 1970s film, it has dated only in that the styles of clothing and some of the attitudes now seem rather comical.I was dismayed to see another comment on the IMDb that the film was poor because there wasn't enough gore! I feel this person has totally misunderstood what good horror films are (or should be) about.Perhaps the only wrong note is the shock ending, which is admittedly effective. This tends to undermine everything that has gone before, by portraying Carrie as a monster. By that time it should be obvious to an intelligent viewer that she is the main victim in the story.",Carrie

Piper Laurie as her evil mother makes an equally strong impression and takes what could have been a silly role into something dark and sinister. The supporting cast of teens and teachers is ever bit as excellent as Spacek and Laurie and they all create a believable environment for Carrie's ticking time bomb.Director Brian De Palma is at his very best here. He uses color, split screens (and diopters), and slow motion to create brilliant sequences of suspense.",Carrie
294,Tralequang,A horror that makes you feel,9,15 May 2020,"There's hardly anything new when one watches this movie in this day an age, since too much has been talked about it, and the plot is by no means convoluted.
Nevertheless, my experience of watching the known was still an excellent one, as the directing and acting was excellent.
Much compliment is to be given to the White family, for both of them was portrayed so logically and poignantly. In the mother, you see a religious fanatic with all the facial expression and holy teaching and shaky voice. In Carrie, you can see a bullied girl with her fear of the unknown, the crave to get alone, the apprehension from pain, and most painfully the joy in being accepted.
The highlight of the directing lies obviously on the blood stained scene, most remarkably the build up to the explosion. The audience is led through all the emotions, namely happiness seeing nervous Carrie get treated well, then worry witnessing the voting trick, and finally exasperation as Carrie was not saved from the public humiliation. The slow motion, the score on top of the muted room, the fruitless help from the classmate, and the jubilant smile on Carrie made it painful for the audience to continue watching, knowing very well what would happen next.
The anti bully theme is obvious in this movie, as well as the anti Christ, most notably symbolised by the manner and position of the dead mom.
All in all, Carrie is a solid school movie, with excellent acting connecting with the audience's feeling.",Carrie

She's just a little different that's all. Even though it's not her fault, she has to pay for it. Carrie is a movie that shows how difficult it is to be a teenage girl at times and how it is to be made fun of by her own classmates. But she has abilities that many teenage girls doesn't have: she's strong enough to ignore it and pretend like nothing. Her classmates is even cruel enough to do a terrible mistake to her on the prom night. When she finally get the feeling that she fit in, they ruin it by doing something nasty that makes Carries abilities to make something near her explode when something goes very wrong.

296,meganmarie-19902,Carrie Is A Class Of Her Own,10,6 December 2018,"Brian De Palmer gave us some high-quality thrillers throughout the 1970s and Carrie is the best one he has directed. A man of such quality teaming up with horror genius Stephen King is only going to create a masterpiece.
So, the film centers around Carrie White, a bullied misfit with no friends, no confidence and unaware of her telekinesis. Not only does Carrie endure torment at school, but she also puts up with her psychotic mother's abuse at home. One day at school the bullies push Carrie too far and she snaps, they turn the shy teenager into a vengeful young woman hell-bent on revenge. The final 40 minutes of this film when Carrie's full powers are on display, is one of the most iconic scenes in horror history.
Whilst this film brings a dark satire to the high school horror, it also touches upon serious social issues such as bullying. The power of this movie brings you so close to Carrie, you can relate to her, share sympathy and can understand why she did just snap.",Carrie
297,Efenstor,One of the best attempts to un-kitsch King,7,15 September 2008,"I'll be short: the movie is very well directed, acting is great, photography is notable, plot is mediocre (as always with King) and the very idea is as old as schools exist. I always wondered: can King write a multilayer and profound book at all? Movies made after his books often overshadow his books because of direction, acting, etc. but it's always obvious that the plot, King's creation, is always weak and has nothing to think about after the movie's ended. You can remember spectacular scenes created by a cinematographer, wonderful acting but never can remember anything wonderful about characters' minds. The only exception from this rule is ""The Shawshank Redemption"", but still even there is not much originality, even there you cannot find any inside work in the characters' souls. Have they souls at all? As to Carrie, it's again a typical kitsch about a peer-terrorized girl raised by a religion-obsessed mother. The characters are so cartoonish that sometimes even incredible acting cannot bring them to life (especially it concerns Carrie's mother). There is nothing much to discuss. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would. Watch and decide yourself whether you'll watch it ever again or not. As to me I don't know, because the filmmakers did their best and their work looks really great. 2 out of 10 for the King's work and 5 out of 10 go to the filmmakers.",Carrie

Motivations are barely explored and we get from point A to point B without much time for looking around to see what's causing what. Sissy Spacek is marvelous. Nancy Allen, too. Travolta is a joke, the least threatening bad boy ever.Of course, finances played a big part on why they were rushed. King needed money to eat. De Palma needed it for special effects.

302,BrianCTyler,My favorite horror film of all time,10,3 February 2006,"CARRIE (1976) directed by: Brian De Palma starring: Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, and John Travolta plot: Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a haunted teenage girl. At school she is constantly tormented by her peers and at home she is abused by her fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie). One day in the girls showers, Carrie has her first period. Having no knowledge of this important event, she freaks out, thinking she is dying, and the girls have no sympathy, they just laugh, chant and throw tampons. While pretty Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and has her boyfriend (William Katt) take Carrie to the prom, mean-spirited Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) conspires with her boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to make Carrie the target of a horrible prank on prom night. What everyone doesn't know is that Carrie was born with the ability to move objects with her mind, and she is pushed too far on her one special night.my thoughts: I love this horror film, and it is my favorite. The story, the directing, the cast, and the score all meld together to make the perfect horror film.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek made me really feel sorry for Carrie. She showed us that Carrie was smart, creative and sweet deep down inside and she was actually very pretty. Piper Laurie scared me as Margaret White, very crazy and over-the-top in a scary way. Her dialog at the end was perfect and she was a very interesting character. Amy Irving is great as the popular girl who actually shows some sympathy for Carrie, and even gives up her prom ticket and date for the girl. Irving plays the character very sympathetic yet very naive. William Katt was also very sympathetic as the brave Tommy Ross, the most popular guy in school taking the least popular girl in school to the prom. The guy also has great hair lol. Betty Buckley did good as the gym teacher who understands both Carrie and the mean girls. Nancy Allen, John Travolta and P.J. Soles were great mean kids. Nancy Allen was pretty and whiny, John Travolta was goofy, and P.J. Soles was annoying in a hot way.Brian De Palma is one of my favorite directors and his work was especially great here. I loved every shot he put in this movie, the only complaint is that his work in the opening locker room scene make him seem very peeping tom-ish, a theme he puts in a lot of his films. His camera-work mostly shined in the prom scene.Pino Donnagio provides one of the greatest horror scores ever. It changes mood with the film. It can be scary, suspenseful, beautiful or sad.So if you want a great dramatic horror film with perfect acting, directing, writing and music, then definitely check out CARRIE.",Carrie
303,saywardstudio,my favorite horror movie of all time-definitely contains spoilers!!!,10,19 September 2005,"I first saw this when I was about 10.... I never saw anything coming, everything was very scary and surprising. The film starts off the bat with the whole concept of the film, teenagers and their interactions with each other, especially with Carrie White. I feel that Sissy Spacek was THE actress for this job, I don't think anyone could have pulled it off quite as good as she could have. She is a grown woman, and yet she totally looks like a young girl. I love her country-ish accent, and her looks in general fit the part. How can I put this? WHen she wanted to look angelic, she could with very little effort, but when she wanted to look scary, she could do that, too! It's magic! Honestly, I think the whole cast was perfect, and this is probably why this movie is probably my favorite , all generas combined. The girls were truly vile towards Carrie, and it felt real. The mother played by Piper Laurie was brilliant, too. WHile she was mean to Carrie, it seemed she was more over the top with her than actually beating her up or anything. (Like dragging her into the closet, throwing her drink into her face when they are at the dinner table.) She is just so wrapped up in her religion(which by the way she has it all out of proportion!) that she forgets everything else, I think. Of course, Carrie getting her period was the ultimate sin (to her) and everything gets weirder from there. WHat an ingenious mind for Stephen King to come up with this tale. A group of kids throwing pig blood on a girl they hate (wrongfully)at the prom? They had it all worked out, and thought they were so brilliant. Carrie sets them straight, though. Maybe that's why I love this movie so much is that the person you feel the most for actually gets back at her attackers in the most heinous ways, in ways in which they deserve. (Example..the little kid saying ""Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie!"" gets knocked over on his bike for his offense,which wasn't nice, but wasn't really a big deal. The pig blood thing was a much bigger deal, thus payback was MUCH worse.)After everything is said and done, Carrie goes home and realizes, perhaps, her mother is right about everything after all, and after she bathes, she is with her mother, saying, ""Momma, hold me,"" and she does, and then her mom stabs her, literally in the back! This was one of the weirdest parts of the movie to me, because I think after the prom thing Carrie would have been more apt to go along with her mother's views, no matter how wayward. I guess her mom was just around the twist by this time, though. I find it eerily ironic that she dies in the same pose as her psudeo-savior statuette in her 'prayer closet'. The end was one last little freaky thing, when the hand comes out of the rocks. Of course, I was 10 the first time seeing this, it was dark and I was already scared out of my wits from the previous scenes. Of course, MY mother jumps out at me when the hand comes up, when that scary music is going, and I fall off the end of the couch! It was the greatest!This is one of THE classic stories and movies of all time,psychological,thrilling, suspenseful,everything! Highly recommended!",Carrie
304,Brian-97,A horror classic,9,12 November 2005,"Brian DePalma's film version of the classic Stephen King novel has held up remarkably well as a horror classic. The timeless story of teenage angst gone horribly wrong still manages to scare new generations of a viewers. There are many who can relate to Carrie White's sheltered teen. Sissy Spacek gives a riveting portrayal in the title role. She inhabits the role, and was a smart choice by DePalma. You manage to feel sympathy for Carrie despite her eventual crimes of passion. This is a true testament to Spacek's Oscar-nominated performance. Also great is Piper Laurie (also Oscar nominated) as Carrie's religious fanatic mother. Due to Carrie's repressed life at home, and the ridicule she receives from her classmates at school, she uses her considerable telekinetic powers to wreak havoc on all of her tormentors in the film's frightening final half hour! One of the best of the King movie adaptations, and must see for fans of classic 1970's horror. If you liked ""The Omen"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"", you will love ""Carrie"". 10/10",Carrie

The film is too fast and forgets far too much to concentrate on the psychology of the characters. On the other hand the film has a big chronological problem compare to the novel, we get lost a little bit and everything does not seem logical: for example how can Billy and Chris foresee the blow of the bucket before knowing that Carrie goes to the ball? Simply because the film is too fast! Therefore the film can be a good horror film (but not more) for those who don't know the book and almost a disaster for the fans! Especially that the atmosphere is not completely there either and the actors are rather weak besides the impressive Sissy Spacek which almost saves the movie by herself! And what to say about Brian De Palma's obsession for Hitchcock? Unable (once again) to impose his own style, he goes as far as copying in a hideous way some details of ""Psycho"" (the music, the knife), but so significant and so famous details that we start to think of the other movie during some seconds by wondering which film we are watching! Anyway the conclusion is simple: read the novel or wait for somebody else to make a better adaptation! (4.5/10)",Carrie
306,kostasxrysogelos,Far more than a horror movie!,9,19 November 2007,"Well, Brian DePalma hasn't topped this movie yet! I saw it recently (for the fifth time maybe!) with some friends and I was astonished to find out that there were things I hadn't noticed! It's such a wonderful movie. It combines harmonically so many genres: college movie (one of the first), horror, light comedy. And Mrs. Laurie is breath-taking as Carrie's mother, while Sissy Spacek is, once again, over the top. And finally, there's the music: How can one describe the fascinating prom-song (I never thought someone like you..., sung wonderfully by Katie Irving); simply magical.About the art of the film, I would like to comment a thing or two: Notice the symbolization of the colors: White, black, red etc. There is always a secret message in the color of the characters' clothes. Secondly, the structure is amazing. I am amazed by the way DePalma constructed the movie; the moods change in a very convincing way(comedy-->irony--> horror etc.).To be brief, I am proud to say that ""Carrie"" is one of my favorite 70s films.",Carrie
307,gopal4320-840-668506,Bullying can have unexpected consequences,8,15 November 2013,"I really liked this movie when it came out, it is a true classic still drawing an audience almost 40 years after it was made as well as being studied in film classes.This time around I found much of it ugly. I thought it was an ugly movie about ugly people but that's just me. My reaction doesn't detract from the genius of the film.Could anyone besides Sissy done the character of Carrie justice? Sissy's performance was pitch perfect and Laurie Piper's portrayal as Carrie's insane mother was other-worldly. She and Sissy richly deserved their Oscar nominations.De Palma used a few innovative camera tricks. For instance the stomach-churning dance scene was done by placing the actors on a spinning platform and then spinning the camera around them in the opposite direction. As he gradually speeds up the spinning we become disoriented and anxious. Something's not right here but we don't quite know what it is.Sue's eerie walk to visit Sissy's house in the dream sequence at the end of the movie was filmed with her walking backwards then played forward in the movie. Her luminous quality was created by filming at night under artificial light.The ending, of course, was unexpected, horrifying, and guaranteed to frighten even the most steadfast viewers.This was Stephen King's first book and he received $2500 for the film rights which would be about $14,000 in today's dollars. That turned out to be a steal but considering this was King's first novel and to have it made into a movie was a break for him. He approved of the movie saying it is ""good"".",Carrie
308,domsimmonds,Their not gonna laugh at this!,7,23 September 2018,"Thank you!! Over 40 years old but what a well made horror story. It took me a while to process at first, as I wasn't sure about how to feel with Carrie being all innocent and sweet, then turning into a raging killer. And I have to say, I was actually kind of routing for her the whole time! This film just kept on continuing to shock me in so many ways.....without JUMPSCARES!!!!!!!!! It just builds and builds and builds. You really feel for the Carrie, and just hate the girl whose always bullying her. And they don't try to be subtle with the main antagonist, at the end when Carrie is drenched in pigs blood, her and John Travolta actually try to killer Carrie by running her over....Jesus Christ. It's so messed up by the end, the audience is routing for Carrie, to seek her revenge!!! Plus, the film ends as it should, finishing off loose ends and a fait that's inevitable for Carrie. It's a well directed film and has a lot of religious imagery, but only present when the mother is around....which works perfectly, as when Carrie is away from her mother, she's just a normal girl, wanting to fit in. It's like Pretty in Pink, mixed perfectly with Horror right at the end. Well made, well directed and may I say well acted. Truly a top horror, and certainly better than the tripe were watching these days regarding horror.",Carrie
309,VernonPope,Spacek's Finest Hour?,9,10 September 2001,"It would almost be enough that this is based on a Stephen King novel, but that it is also a breakout role for Sissy Spacek, supported by the likes of John Travolta and Amy Irving is almost too much.  This is a true thriller; it has mystery (what are her powers, and what are their limits?) and horror. This is on my ""not to be missed"" list!",Carrie
310,bmxrountree,A Thriller,9,14 July 2002,"This will always be one of my favorite horror movies. The first time I saw it was on tv after reading about it and thought it was going to be pretty good. It blew my mind away and I had to get the video. However, I couldn't believe the girl's locker room scene which I thought was going to be a lot of steam like the tv show.Sissy Spacek ( Carrie ) and her crazy mother ( Piper Laurie )made the perfect couple. And from what their house looked like , it fit them just right.My favorite part is when she gets revenge on everyone at the Prom. The music was good, she's standing there not moving a muscle with her eyes wide opened, the fire hose is attacking everyone like a snake, they're yelling and screaming for help, then all hell breaks loose. It just doesn't get any better.if anyone would like to talk to me about this movie or any other please e - mail",Carrie

I watch the stories read made into movies as a part of a ritual.I love Carrie. Simply superb story, Considering the fact it was the first book of King. The movie, lived up to my expectations. The movie makers did change things but well the most important essence was captured.Carrie - Tommy Ross pair was gorgeous. The Chemistry was so good to watch. John Trovalto role isn't so significant but watching him so young was definitely surprising. The ending, before closing credits, was quite scarier then the Climax.Brilliant emotional display by the mother- daughter in their scenes together. After all the superhero movies of today with super abilities saving lives and tiring viewers like me, Carrie was a perfect horror relief.A must watch for King fans.",Carrie
312,horror3333,The best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.,9,25 June 2004,"I wanted to see this movie when I was 10 (in 2000), but I wasn't allowed because of the nudity. Probably two years later I was allowed to watch it, and I thought that it was great. Sissy Spacek did a wonderful job as Carrie White, the typical tormented teenager...with mysterious powers she is just getting used to. Talk about puberty problems! Anyway, Piper Laurie just plain freaked me out. Her portrayal of Miss White, Carrie's mom, send chills down my spine. She was just so strange. I had read the book, and knew about the prom scene. I couldn't wait to see that part, and when it came on, I was like ""wow"". It was done brilliantly. The soundtrack to the movie was very wonderful (I just won a copy of the CD on eBay). I thought that it was actually better than ""The Shining"". 9/10",Carrie

I can relate to being the one everyone were pecking on, being tricked and everyone laughing. I was ""lucky"" and ended up in the nicest class at our school, so I was treated with some degree of respect, but still - I know that feeling and it does make you want to get even.Being a fan of Stephen King and Brian de Palma I must say this movie really has not lost its sting. There are very few movies from the '60s I can really say I like, most of them are trash. This one is in my opinion far more emotional and cruel than most movies today. Not having a standard Hollywood ending does really help too.",Carrie

315,lukehere99,Possibly the best horror movie of all time,7,29 July 2013,"Let me start by saying that I had not read the book before the film and I was only watching because I had seen the trailer for the upcoming remake. So I started it with no expectations at all and just had nothing better to do. Now down to the review. Right from the beginning this movie entices you in with a lovely period scene in a shower. I had no idea that this was going to happen and was quite surprised because it was handled very well and the actresses were not sexualised by Brian De Palma at all. Next was the entrance of Carrie's not so terrifying mother played by Piper Laurie. Maybe when this came out in 1974 she was scary, but now she's more....really really funny. This is really the only bad thing I can think of about the movie, with the exception of a pointless sex scene later. The next 40 minutes of the movie run pretty smoothly containing simple camera work and medium acting, with the occasional completely pointless sex scene. To make it even worse it has John Travolta in it! But then about 50 minutes in the prom scene arrives which I have already read about on Rotten Tomatoes and is in my opinion....actually not in my opinion IT'S A FACT! One of the most awesome movie scenes ever! Which is surprising because the special effects are a bit dodgy, but I won't deduct points for that because it was the best for the time. After Carrie has awesomely killed a gazabillion people at the prom she decides to go home and change into her pyjamas, which was bit weird considering she had just murdered loads of her classmates. But I won't deduct points for that because it's probably something to do with her telekinesis/puberty experience. Then her mum (who is one of my favourite unintentionally funny characters of all time) stabs her in the back LITERALLY! while they are praying, another reason why I'm atheist folks. Overall CARRIE is one of my favourite movies of all time. Possibly the best horror movie I have ever seen. Starting off at 10 (obviously) I minus 1 point for Piper Laurie being unintentionally hilarious. Then minus 0.3 points for a pointless sex scene. And finally minus 0.2 points for Carrie killing loads of people then going home as if nothing has happened. So I give Carrie- 8.5 out of 10 and 4 stars.",Carrie
316,the dude-3,Ode to Hitchcock falls short,7,21 February 2000,"Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" has been said to be his ode to Hitchcock. Unfortunately such a claim isn't justified.  Brian De Palma imitates much of the master's style, specifically that in ""Psycho"" as he uses the same pitching music and a similar mother-offspring scenario.  But, what starts off as a great movie dealing with powerfully emotional issues of social ostracization and physical and emotional maturity turns into a cheap blood and gore fest.  Where Hitchcock triumphed with subtlety and masterful editing De Palma fails with explicit gore and split-screens and that awful jesus-christ pose Carrie's mother is in at the end was so stupid it was funny.  Scariest moments occur in the first half of the film.",Carrie
317,Tremor,They're all gonna laugh at you!,9,27 May 2000,"""Carrie"" (1976), directed by Hitchcock disciple Brian DePalma, and based on the novel by Stephen King, is one of my top ten favorite horror films. The plot centers around Carrie White (played to perfection by Sissy Spacek), a shy, awkward teenager who possesses the powers of telekinesis (the ability to move objects at will), which she unleashes with great fury against her cruel classmates and religious fanatic mother (Piper Laurie, in a wild, wonderful performance) on the night of her Senior Prom. Among the cast of high schoolers are: William Katt and Amy Irving as popular couple Tommy Ross and Sue Snell, who are sympathetic towards Carrie's plight; and John Travolta (during his pre-superstardom days) and Nancy Allen as Billy Nolan and Chris Hargensen, the couple who initiates the cruel Prom Night prank that results in Carrie's wrath and the subsequent bloodbath. The entire movie is a tour-de-force, especially the climactic ""crucifixion scene"" between Spacek and Laurie (who deservedly earned Oscar nods for their indelible performances). DePalma's use of slow-motion, soft focus lenses and split screen are effective, and Pino Donaggio's musical score is superb. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And that ending! The dream sequence in which sole survivor Amy Irving, looking like a zombie bride, is attacked by a hand from beyond the grave as she attempts to place flowers on Carrie's burial site, started the ""it was all a dream"" trend in horror films (used again effectively in ""Friday The 13th""). My score: 9 out of 10. The only Brian DePalma film that surpasses ""Carrie"" on his impressive resume is his 1987 non-horror classic ""The Untouchables"".",Carrie
318,magnie,Greatest movie shock scene ever,10,21 April 2000,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSWho cares if De Palma was stealing Hitchcock's style if he came up with something as powerful as Carrie.  The final scene is probably the greatest shock scene (or if you must ""jumpy bit"") in movie history, even the tiger scene in Apocalypse Now.  Anyone who didn't jump out of their seat while watching that scene was either drunk, dead or lying.  It's been imitated countless times, but Carrie cannot be bettered.",Carrie

320,Mother_of_all_Opossums,A fantastic King adaptation,8,18 July 2004,"I have always been a sucker for adaptations of Stephen King's work. People have always complained about crappy adaptations of one of horror's most popular authors, but I have found so many guilty pleasures in movies such as Pet Semetary (1989) The Shining (1980) and even It (1990).This is one movie, that even King haters, do not deny the brilliance of. This film cemeted the careers of director Brian De Palma, actress Sissy Spacek (who gives a chilling performance as Carrie) and the previously mentioned Stephen King, at least when it comes to film, and does not disappoint.Everything about this film is worth it. The plot is good, the visuals are good, the atmosphere is good, the acting is good. This film is highly recommended.",Carrie
321,Reiko_95,Slow story build-up but worth the time - a lesson we should all learn from,7,6 February 2008,"Now here's a great director that knows his ABC's when working behind the camera. Good angles, fine continuity, good dialog, great acting from everyone - especially from Sissy Spacek. I gave this movie a shot the first time back in '87 and i was extremely satisfied at the end of the 95 minutes. I think at some point in our lives we'd all wish to be like Carrie, to exact vengeance on those who did us wrong big time but then again we realize Carrie's way is out of our hands and find other ways to compensate for it even if only once. Yes, I can relate to Carrie, being what she was therefore i can understand that what she did to those animals,was well deserved by them not just for mistreating her, but doing it in such a horrible way. The extent of human imagination is sick sometimes and leaves scars that never fade even with time. See, about Carrie, it's like this: you don't screw with me i don't screw with you, but if you're asking for it and i mean ASKING FOR IT, then you got what's coming to you, no excuses. All she wanted was to be left alone but the world around her, the harsh reality of people not being able to understand certain aspects of human behavior, didn't quite ""agree"" with her and the outcome was major HUMILIATION. And for what? Because she didn't fit in? That's the sorriest excuse I have heard to humiliate someone for.But then again there are people and there are people. Anyway i think and this is just my personal opinion, that Mr. Stephen King thought of all these aspects in a subtle manner when he wrote the novel, and still the subtlety can clearly be seen not only in his book but also and probably even better in the 1976 motion picture directed by Brian De Palma. This movie and the novel as well are a lesson in life that teaches us not to mess with things that are better off left the way they are, alone, in any given situation. To understand this you don't need to read between the lines the action unfolds right before the viewer's eyes. You have to understand that a person can take so much but when you cross the line there's no telling what that person is liable to do, and in Carrie we see - even though fictionalized- the exact extent of what damage a person's rage can do. This rage of course in real life is felt when unleashed in different ways. Hell, i wish i had telekinetic powers:D To sum it up, those losers deserved the wrath of Carrie, they had it coming to them and Brian De Palma did a fine job transferring the story of Stephen King's novel on screen especially for those who didn't have the patience to read the novel. Fine work Mr De Palma and Stephen King as well for if it weren't for his novel the movie wold probably never have seen the light of day.",Carrie
322,Christianchancellor,"The first ""horror"" movie I ever watched. Back when I was 6.",9,9 August 2020,"Carrie, what a brilliant novel, and a brilliant film. You can never go wrong with Carrie. Brian De Palma had a different direction in the film rather than the book. But all I gotta say, is the last 30 minutes of this movie is one of the best endings of any Stephen King adaptations ever. I'm actually shocked that this movie is only a 7.4 on IMDb. This will be the movie I can show my nieces and nephews, my children, my grandkids, on how to make a perfect little horror film. This is seriously one of a kind.",Carrie
323,iKickstand,"Drawn out, irritating and disappointing",2,14 July 2011,"I had been greatly looking forward to watching this one for a long time and after finally doing so I honestly can't see what people like so much about this drawn out, stupid, annoying, wet flannel of a horror film.For an allegedly famously scary movie, it took so long to get to any sort of horror it was a joke. It wouldn't have been so bad if the buildup content was interesting but what we have instead is child-like garbage dialogue from John Travolta and Nancy Allen's characters (along with comedy slap noise and school ground insults - most of this movie felt like a spoof to me ) and a repulsively irritating mother who will definitely prevent me from re-watching the film. Everyone know's what is going to happen at the end by the poster or DVD cover so by the time the slow-mo bucket scene at the prom was dragging along at snail's pace, I was virtually screaming out JUST PULL THE ROPE ALREADY!! Of course the only highlight of the film following this scene (all the destruction/revenge bits) went so quickly compared to the rest of the picture, that I felt robbed.The only savior came at the very last scene, when even when I'd guessed what was coming it still made me jump a little. Truly a below average movie which I'm sure could have been filmed much better had someone else directed the Stephen King story. After seeing so much praise for this, I am very, very disappointed.",Carrie
324,TheCharles,Puberty can be rough,9,2 March 2016,"One of the best things about Carrie, is that the makers successfully create empathy and sympathy for their main character. I don't think I have to point out that it makes a movie so much more enjoyable. It's something that lacks in today's Horror movies. Carrie White is brought to life by Sissy Spacek's outstanding performance, who I believe was the perfect pick for this role. The pace is quite slow and there's not too much going on for the most part. The plot consists of a slow build-up which builds towards a climactic scene. I won't spoil anything but it's easily one of the most amazing scenes I've seen on screen. The portrayal of high school cruelty combined with telekinetic powers is simply a recipe for disaster.Being a fan of his other work like Scarface and The Untouchables, I was pleasantly surprised as De Palma's name appeared in the opening credits. The fact that I could expect unfiltered graphic violence was a good way to start the movie. He even made fantastic use of split- screen techniques, which I'm not really a fan of in most cases. Neither did I expect John Travolta, which was pretty funny. Carrie, based on Stephen King's novel, feels authentic yet refreshing at the same time. I guess puberty is rough for some teens..",Carrie

I think it's fun and very entertaining even though it's not a truly great piece of cinema, I mean.Sissy Spacek is fantastic and I always thought she was an underrated actress despite her Oscar nomination(s) for her acting work. She should have been the star of a lot more movies/TV shows. This is one of her earliest and best starring roles.It was and is a very ""campy"" movie, it is kind of predictable and silly at times but oh man the first time I saw it I thought it was so scary, especially the scene at the school dance.

Carrie instantly won the cult film title. There is truly quite a few brilliant moments in the movie, especially when it comes to Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie acting, memorable cinematic climax ,engaged art camera and directing .

The acting was remarkable, the music gripping, the direction good, and the plot amazing, even touching at times, something that isn't usually expected of horror movies. Piper Laurie was brilliant in this, and was exactly how I had pictured Margaret White in the book.

It's about a bullied misfit in 1970s high school with special paranormal abilities. The conditions for the story start from bad at the beginning, then it slowly climbs towards good by the climax, when it suddenly drops down to bad again and gets worse to a very sad ending. The climax scene is pretty effective with being frightening by being really chaotic and really brutal. The last few scenes are definitely the scariest,saddest, and most powerful. The story is very moving, so you can see why it's a classic. The direction and screenplay are kind of average until we get to the prom scene, but then they get really good. The effects and music are also very scary, but the music sounds exactly like that of Psycho. I thought this was a great film, but more of a tragedy then a horror film.",Carrie

His first novel, and my personal favorite was ""Carrie"". ""Carrie"" was an engaging, intriguing story, and I was on the edge of my seat literally just reading it. First of all, I would like to say that ""Carrie"" was an incredibly better book than movie. Still, I gave it a 9 out of 10. The book was like off the scale. 12 out of 10 or something. I loved how the book got to the ending. The movie was still scary, but they took away some of the story from the book. It would've been cool if they'd left some of the scenes alone. Oh well, it's all you can expect from a book made into a movie. I was totally afraid of Carrie's mom. What a freak! She was constantly worshiping God, but at the same time looked like the devil. The only Stephen King movie that came close to this, was ""Pet Sematary"", which was horrifying. Stephen King is a wonderful writer, and I thank God that his wife pulled his first story out of the trash can. Otherwise, we'd have no ""Carrie"". Once again, I give it 9 out of 10.",Carrie

332,andrewbarry6336,What a Disappointment,5,25 November 2013,"I never watched this movie in till last night. I was born in 1990 but I love going back and watching what my dad calls the classics. This is one movie I just never watched but with the remake out now I decided to watch this before I saw that one. I couldn't be more let down.For those of you who don't know this movie revolves around a teenager named Carrie(duh right?) who doesn't fit in with anyone at school. She gets her period while taking a shower in gym class and because her mother is a religious fanatic and doesn't tell her how her body works, Carrie thinks something is really wrong and when she asks for help they all bully her and pick on her. The catch is she actually has telekinetic powers and she slowly learns how to use them throughout the movie. The movie continues from there all the way in till prom where she is the center of attention thanks to a very cruel joke. I really thought I would enjoy this movie but unfortunately I didn't.Before I say why I didn't like this movie I did feel for her character and what she went through. I thought it was set up very well and just because it was set up in 1976 didn't detract anything for me. Bullying is bullying to me so that has nothing to do with it. Something was just off for me in this movie. Everything seemed to work but by the time the credits rolled I asked myself Why Didn't I like this movie? One reason is actually the prom scene. I know it is 1976 and the effects aren't as good as today but she managed to kill people with a fire hose? That scene was so boring to me and the whole time Carrie is just staring real hard at everyone. I found her portrayal good all the way in till that scene. After that her acting was dumb ed down. Her mother was one of the worse acting jobs I have ever seen. She was a religious freak but she didn't creep me out because most of her time on screen I thought she was trying to be funny. Carrie's gym teacher did do a good job though but not good enough to save it. Overall it wasn't a bad movie and I didn't go in with any expectations. It is just this movie gets so much love and the remake keeps getting bashed more than recent remakes. So I told myself either the remake is that bad or the original is that good. Well I can't speak on the remake but this is not that good. I also believe in judging a movie on its own merits instead of comparing two movies separated by almost 37 years. In-less it is a shoot for shoot remake which I read it is not, I don't see how it can be any worse. If it is I guess I am missing out on something. I give it a 5 outta 10. I love almost any horror and sub- horror genre but this movie just didn't do anything special for me. I consider it below average.",Carrie
333,CEBaum,Surprisingly inappropriate in a modern age,3,6 November 2013,"Only, three minutes in, I was shocked – I didn't remember the pervy, * literally * soft porn scene. High school girls run naked through a gym locker, soaping themselves and whipping each other with towels. Sissy Spacek rubs suds in between her legs as she starts her period.Elevator music and Vaseline lens shots are turned on their head when she get "" The Curse"", and thinks she is dying because nobody told her about it. Enter a bunch of classmates including Amy Irving in her screen debut as Sue (later Mrs Spielberg) and Nancy Allen as Chris Hargensen, the school pin-up. None of whom are under 18. In fact, Spacek was 27 the year Carrie was made. Amy Irving was 24, and Nancy Allen, 26 (two years later, she was Mrs De Palma). Not really the 17 year-olds they are meant to be here. Thank God, after all that nudity and soaping.And so we debate the poetry of "" The Curse"". Carrie is a gifted telekinetic – or is she cursed? The others smell her difference; like a pack of wolves on an injured deer, they taunt her as she wails in the still-running shower – saved at last by the pneumatic Miss Collins (Betty Buckley, also an ex of De Palma's). A woman barely older than the ""girls"", cast as their teacher. I let this one slide. But.When we come to the ridiculous ""detention"" scene, the girls are berated by Miss Collins, and the viewer is subjected to several minutes of girls in tight shorts bouncing, bending and stretching. Another misogynist bit of movie making by De Palma. This scene is not only completely hammy, but is accompanied by terrible comedy music I can only describe as some weird organist beating off to Sesame Street. He employs the deep field, ""split screen"" effect here, probably egged on by cinematographer Mario Tosi and his Panavision Split Diopter Lense, which gives this look used in many horror and sci-fi movies such as The Andromeda Strain and The Boston Strangler. And – um, a Hitchcock look.The issue in general here is there is no story left – Stephen King's original tale is so pared down by De Palma that the viewer is just waiting. Waiting for the big Prom scene at the end. Why this is, maybe, is that De Palma didn't mine that treasure chest of female angst deep enough – and unlike Stephen King who had wife Tabitha at his side filling him in on female psyche (He dedicated ""Carrie"" the novel to her: ""This is for Tabby, who got me into it – and then bailed me out of it."") De Palma misses the mark without this personal input. Wide.So The PROM. Frankly, I don't remember it being this lame. Carrie is kind of covered in blood with her big shot breaking out a fire hose and dousing everyone *to death* with water. Not really very scary. Somehow everything is aflame after a mic sparks and kills two male teachers we don't care about. She kills poor Miss Collins who did really nothing to deserve it, and actually comes across as the most ealistic actress here, with a board, cutting her in two. De Palma, with Tosi, more or less trademarked split screen depth of focus for this type of horror action. He uses it many times in the film, both to highlight Carrie's utter alienation – or indeed the alienation of Miss Collins from her students.But as much as he pioneers, he apes. Every time Carrie uses telekinesis, the Psycho shower violins creak up. The high school is called ""Bates High School"" instead of Ewen as in the Stephen King novel. It's a bit obvious, and not in a good way. And he uses the ""multiple ending"" as in Hitchcock's Topaz, ""forming a kind of syllogism"", says the book Hitchcock, Past And Future. Is the film over, or is there more? I jumped only once, a minute from the end – and many other horror movies have used these tropes to varying degrees of success – this is certainly an influence on the fantastic ""Drag Me To Hell""'s end scene.Despite this version of Carrie being thoroughly dumb and having script dialogue that reads like Murder, She Wrote or worse (at one point Amy Irving's mother says "" Oh, I didn't hear you come in"" despite them being seen clearly in the kitchen together for around three minutes immediately beforehand), there are reasons, albeit car-crash-viewing reasons, to check this version out – it does give origin to many horror clichés and it's entertaining to discover them first time around.I can't bring myself to call it a classic, and you may feel you need to skip huge swathes of the film just to get to the prom scene, which you will probably find disappointing. I felt that the women in this film had been used to make De Palma's vision in a way that left a dry taste in my mouth: the nudity and sexual overtures are presented in a voyeuristic fashion that voids their value immediately.I can't help thinking that in the hands of director Kimberly Peirce, known for her profound understanding of women in Boys Don't Cry will do a much deeper and broader job of the material, and with the sorts of technology used in 2013, surely she can do something more sinister with the prom scene than the humongously spraying penile extension of De Palma's fire hose...

334,KirstenJackson,"Fantastic, Definitely A Favorite Of Mine",9,26 April 2005,"I read the book ""Carrie"" by Stephen King and I enjoyed it very much. The film I saw was the 1976 version and it was fabulous! It wasn't so scary you were on your toes all the time, but it was suspenseful enough to make you jump! Carrie is the story of Carrie White (Spacek), the girl with telekinesis abused by her mother Margaret White (Laurie) and the girl who is constantly picked on at school. On her prom night, one prank goes much too far, causing Carrie to use her telekinetic powers to get revenge on them all, for every dirty trick they'd ever pulled on her. The acting in this film is phenomenal by all actors and the musical score is great. I can totally see why this film bloomed Sissy Spacek's and John Travolta's career, it was excellent! I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who, as the tagline states, has a taste for terror.",Carrie
335,Yodelling Llama,horror? or social commentary...,8,29 July 1999,"The fact that Carrie has been pegged as a horror film is typical of numerous instances of Stephen King novels turned films.  And, like many of those films, Carrie is not strictly a member of the horror genre.  Although it does have many elements that one might associate with the typical seventies/eighties horror flicks, Carrie does much more.  The fact that Carrie herself has telekinetic powers is almost irrelevant, except as a method by which one can disassociate the instances from ""real life.""  The real purpose of Carrie is to illustrate the far-reaching effects that child abuse can have on a society in general.  Far be it merely an issue that affects the child's life alone (although one might hesitate to describe this as ""merely""), the perhaps exaggerated documentation of the events surrounding Carrie's prom are horrific because they are distinct possibilities when a given parent raises their child in an atmosphere such as existed in the White household.  Extreme instances of religious overtones aside, the fact that Carrie's mother referred to her (essentially) as a mistake in the end is the final cause of the destruction of so many lives. Also, DePalma saw it fit to criticize most severely the mild abuse of peers, as well as the isolated humiliatory incidents.  On the whole, Carrie is a horror picture because it is not that far from our own high schools and towns.  Excellent usage of King's novel, despite his misgivings about its less-than-dogmatic interpretation.",Carrie
336,jackcummins-56515,"The Original, The Best, The Underrated?",10,18 February 2020,"Everything about this movie is perfect. The direction, the pacing, the novel loyalty, the acting, the score. Everything is simply amazing. This all leads to a scene in horror film in which your never seems to ever forgot. This has lead Carrie to be one of the most recognisable staples in horror. However, it also seems to be overshadowed by other 70s horror flicks such as: Halloween and The Excorist. While the film is not actually that scary until the unforgettable prom scene, the film focuses on how wicked bullying is and how it can effect the victims.Overall, the masterpiece of a movie with a wonderful score, acting and direction. A definite must watch.",Carrie
337,jamesharrah,Perfect. 10,10,24 April 2009,"I have seen this movie I know at least 50 times or more, but to this day the acting of Sissy Spaceck (Carrie) & Piper Laurie (Margaret White) still astound me. Sissy was perfect as the mistreated, picked on teenager and Piper went over the top as her religious fanatic mother. It is in all reality the best revenge story, and anyone who was ever picked on in High School can relate to Carrie and deep down wished they had the power to do what she did.Granted, I did read the book and it is in my opinion one of King's true masterpieces and this version deviated a bit from the book. Brian DePalma himself said that back in '76 there just wasn't the technology to put on screen some of the effects of what Carrie could actually do, like making the fire come from the sky and pretty much destroy the whole town. But that is O.K. I still love this movie. And no matter how many times I do see it, the Prom scene with the bucket of blood shocks me because of DePalma's tight direction for building it up and the music just built it up even more.Although by todays standards this movie is lame and tame according to some, I disagree. This really wasn't a horror movie. It was more suspense and nail biting tension which is lacking in movies today.The sequel ""The Rage: Carrie 2"" was a joke. All it was was a blood fest. And the remake that was ""re-imagined"" for television, even though it was more faithful to the book, lacked the suspense of the original. Angela Bettes did an OK job as Carrie but Sissy she is not. And I did not like Patricia Clarksons portrayal of the tyrant bible beater. Piper nailed it completely. And besides, it was too digital for me. Even when the blood was dumped on Carrie you see a quick fake digital shot of blood coming out of the bucket and it just kept coming and coming and coming and coming. No real shock value of just ONE splash of blood as in the original. So the remake gets a 5 out of 10. It did not need to be remade. It was fine as it is. Convincing acting (to me both actresses deserved their Oscars for which they did not get), great direction by DePalma which all together made for a classic that to me still holds strong today.",Carrie
338,SenoritaTorres,A masterpiece of teen horror!,10,6 March 2007,"It's the same in most schools. Girl or boy gets bullied for being different. Shy, strange, unusual, etc. Stephen King wrote a book about such a situation and they turned it into one of the best horror films in recent history.'Carrie' is one of my favourite films, for many reasons. It's funny, it's sharp, it's scary, and it's tragic, all at the same time. Sissy Spacek gives a stunning performance as the tortured and bullied Carrie White, living with her religious fanatic mother and suffering the trauma of her first period at seventeen years of age. What should be an exciting time for her is one of misery and bitterness because her own mother didn't think to tell her about the female cycle-and when to her horror she finally began it in the school locker rooms, she was subjected to laughter and humiliation from the other girls, who resorted to throwing tampons and sanitary towels at her. However, actions can have consequences, and I've never enjoyed watching a film so much before. I read the book before I saw the film, and I wasn't disappointed. Brian De Palma was faithful to King's story, and cast wonderful actors to play these important parts, and they were all important to the plot, whether big or small. That's what was so wonderful about 'Carrie'.Spacek fully deserved her Oscar nomination for this performance. She was 27 years old when she played a 17 year old Carrie, and she pulled off the lost and alone little girl to perfection, and completely surpassed herself when Carrie finally snapped at the end. Her pairing with Piper Laurie as Margaret White was dynamic, one of the most interesting screen matches ever, and the two actresses conveyed the volatile mother-daughter relationship perfectly. Carrie didn't understand why her mother thought that everything, including periods, dating and sex was a sin, and thought that maybe by mixing with the other students properly, she could fit in and be treated like everyone else. Even when she realised the extent of her powers, all she wanted to do was not have to use them and be like other people. Her need for normal life and her craving for her mother's affection was heartrending, poignant and brilliantly conveyed by Spacek.I loved Amy Irving's performance as the remorseful Sue, one of the popular girls who feels so sorry for Carrie and guilty for the locker room incident that she asks her own boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. Of course, anyone who has seen this movie will know that things don't go quite according to plan at the prom, thanks to the evil plotting of biggest school bully and glamour princess Chris Hargenson (a great performance from Nancy Allen) and her deadbeat boyfriend Billy (hilariously played by John Travolta). I don't want to completely give away the ending if you haven't seen this movie but I can tell you it's shocking, dramatic and incredibly moving.Naturally, compared to horror films made nowadays Carrie is extremely dated and didn't have the same kind of effects they can use now, but the effects that were used in this film (including the sound effects) were terrifying and realistic, and made you realise that anyone with those kind of powers can be capable of anything when driven to the edge. Fantastic script, wonderful acting, brilliant direction. 'Carrie' is a ten out of ten.",Carrie
339,harveyrock12,Carrie Ripped my heart within 90 Minutes,9,18 January 2012,"This is a beautiful film , It shows the things in life that some people have to go through , late puberty,bullying,parent abuse. These are all subjects this film covers very well. Now when I heard the storyline that she had telekinesis I thought that it would make this film unrealistic but turns out it was strongly believable. The emotion that Carrie suffers, touched me and this is one film you won't forget , its a amazing novel as well. Carrie will touch your heart and it has a life lesson to it that bullying can cause to drastic consequences. The likeliness of a girl with telekinesis killing everyone is out of the picture. But people who have been strongly bullied and have no support try to kill themselves. This film powers that so strongly. The only aspect that i didn't like was that in fact its labelled as a horror film when its more supernatural. However the ending made me jump. Carrie touched my heart and will touch anyone who has one believable and great acting 9/10 teenagers all around the world will be able to relate to this one.",Carrie
340,gab-fan22,Bitterly disappointing horror film,4,26 October 2012,"When I first heard about how good Carrie was and how it set a standard for horror films, I was expecting a great film experience. However, Carrie to me was not only not a great film, but an extremely overrated one at the very least. My issues with the film lay more towards the storytelling where for 60 minutes of the hour and a half film it was like watching a 1970's version of Mean Girls. Shy loner girl is made fun of, humiliated by the popular girls and the storyline revolves around that in a very boring and pathetic pace. Sissy Spacek who is one of my favorites did do a good job in the film, especially in the final sequences of Carrie going mad at the prom, but there wasn't enough of a back story into the full range of her powers and the ""terrifying"" scene had none of the spine-tingling or heart-stopping elements of Halloween, or Jaws. Also people say Spacek was the first actress to be nominated for an Oscar in a horror film, which is incorrect as 3 years prior Ellen Burstyn was nominated for her role in what's been called the scariest film ever The Exorcist. Piper Laurie was also surprisingly good even more so considering it was her 1st film role in nearly 20 yrs. and is able to portray Margaret in a somewhat humorous, yet also unsettling way and really deserved her nomination. The rest of the cast is good, and De Palma's direction is decent Carrie just doesn't have any sort of real horror and is not the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.4/10",Carrie

342,ricky_may1,Beautiful Tragic and Dreamlike horror,10,16 November 2010,"In 1976 Stephen King and Brian Depalma came together and working from King's material crafted one of the best movies ever created. The film tells the tragic tale of Carrie White (played marvelously by Sissy Spacek) a mousy abused girl who suffers endless torment at the hands of her classmates and fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie who's also incredible). However, one of the girls Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels guilty and sets up her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take her to the prom instead of her. Another girl Christine Hargensen(Nancy Allen) gets her juvenile boyfriend Billy Nolan (John Travolta in a very funny role) to play a prank on Carrie. Little does everyone know Carrie's dark secret: She is Telekinetic and once the prank is pulled, a holocaust of destruction is released like non ever seen before.This Classic from the 70's is flawless in every way; the acting is all top notch the effects are remarkable and the ending is haunting and tragic at the same time. The fact that Carrie even causes the death of the two people who reach out to her proves that not even the truly innocent survive all the time.",Carrie
343,epa101,So sad and so brilliant,10,9 July 2005,"First thing to say is that, even if you don't like the film, the music is absolutely brilliant. It's hard to describe; classical, but heavier than normal. I've never known anyone who doesn't like the music.The story of a girl who is bullied at school and at home is heart-breaking and Sue Snell recognising her duty to help Carrie gives the film an uplifting part. What Carrie does for revenge is wrong, but she does not gain anything out of it. It's a very, very sad film overall, where nobody gains and all the tragedy could have been so easily avoided. The mindless brutality of Carrie's classmates have disastrous effects. The insanity of the mother is not as over-the-top as in the novel, which I personally thought was an improvement. Sissy Spacek is really good as Carrie. The scenes when she acts nervous and scared are best; she looks a little unusual and this suits the character.I've read the book too. The film is a fairly faithful rendition, but there are bits that are different. It's not quite as sad as the book and there are bits of humour here and there. Tommy Ross is less of a character here and the part of Carrie's infancy is missing (because the scene went wrong and they didn't have enough money to film it again).I love this film, although I'm not sure whether someone who was Popular at school would find it so effective.",Carrie
344,burly,stylish but empty,6,27 April 1999,"DePalma is little more than a mediocre Hitchcock.  He is certainly gorier than the master, but there is not much else to recommend him.  Having once been a high school student, I can safely say that no one in ""Carrie"" acts even remotely like anyone I have ever known.  Having known many religious people, I would say that even the craziest and most fanatical of them did not much resemble Carrie's mother.  I did find DePalma's use of a split screen during the movies big scene to be quite interesting but even that seemed little more than a stylistic trick to enliven a rather ludicrous killing spree. De Palma is interested in shock rather than story and gore rather than character.",Carrie

But this film is the perfect way to adapt a Stephen King novel. The success of this classic is based on two main columns : Brian de Palma and Sissy Spacek. Those two just made the movie in such a way that it became a real classic and a reference in the genre. Thanks to Brian de Palma completely inspired and motivated in making this film as a director. BDP is a big Hitchcock fan. The references to Hitchcock in this film, particularly in the score (reference to Psycho's score) is obvious. But BDP used the camera as a good director should do. He used every angles, every shadows.. The camera is moving, showing us the story. BDP understood what cinema means. Remember the famous scene of the blood pig bucket. All is done in slow motion and even put more tension to us. Then he used the sharing screen thing, the ""split screen"". Putting different images, different shots in one screen. But the talent of BDP is above all in his way he directed the actors. This is the job of a good director. The casting is terrific.And Sissy made us speechless.This film had been directed with great talent and intelligence indeed. It deserves to be ranked as one the best horror movie of all time and indeed one of the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel. A masterpiece not to be missed !",Carrie
346,Kronocide,Unique horror,8,24 June 2004,"I watch horror movies like I watch a fantasy or science fiction flick. What I want is usually the paranormal mystery that needs resolving, and the revelation at the end. I live for the twist. Very few horror movies have actually scared me. I can think of two. Trouble Every Day, with Vincent Gallo and Béatrice Dalle, made me feel genuinely sick in a way that no other movie has and like I thought none could. The other is Carrie, which made my hair stand on end several times. I mean, I was seriously creeped out.I think that for me it was a combination of DePalma's imagery--Spacek is a truly haunting figure, pure nightmare stuff--and the script. And here's what makes Carrie unique. It is actually a character-driven horror story. It just doesn't not follow the mandatory horror movie formula, but it takes its motivation and narrative momentum from the very realistically depicted inner torment of the protagonist. This had the effect of emotionally grounding the story for me, so that when all hell breaks loose, and the blood-drenched Spacek stares at us with empty eyes, it was the proverbial fist squeezing my guts.Recommended viewing, especially if you are wary of the boring standard-compliant stuff.",Carrie

348,Disarmed-Doll-Parts,Outstanding horror/teen drama with a fantastic 70's atmosphere.,8,12 April 2007,"Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a misunderstood young high schooler with a freakishly obsessive Catholic mother (an amazing performance by Piper Laurie) who borders on Neo-Nazi. She is horribly bullied at her high school, especially by the sadistic Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen), and basically ignored by every person who isn't putting her down. So when token nice girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) decides she wants to build Carrie's confidence by giving up her place at the prom and telling her kind hearted jock boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to invite Carrie, Carrie's mentor Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) smells trouble. Sue promises all is well and Tommy ad Carrie run along to the prom. But when Chris and her dimwitted boyfriend Billy (John Travolta's second role) devise a horrible and humiliating prank, they don't take into account what has manifested inside of Carrie after all those years of torment, and how it will effect them in the films horrifying and very memorable climax.Brian De Palma's famous horror film, adapted from Stephen King's chilling novel, is often noted as the ultimate in teenage revenge films. De Palma used his distinctive style to make a chilling and original horror film that really is the best example of 1970's horror, the style, music, clothes, acting, dialogue and pretty much everything in the film is like a time-warp. The editing very original and you can tell the makers of the film enjoyed creating it.The acting is very fine, some of the best in any horror film out there. Sissy Spacek is great as the sympathetic freak, but at times you wanna slap her, she's so incredibly pathetic. Like when she's screaming about her period, running around nude. I can understand that she didn't realise what was happening, but running around like a lunatic, and bleeding on people through your vagina isn't gonna inspire sympathy from them. But since I read the book, I understand that was the intention. Piper Lurie was absolutely fantastic as the looney mother, and all the other performances were pretty passable. I have to mention PJ Soles. Her character was so awesome, I'd even go as far a to say that she was one of the (many) highlights of the film. Her character added a quirky charm the film that couldn't be matched by anybody else. Some of the themes explored was Carrie's journey into adulthood, shown through the way she learnt to control her powers and discovering different parts of her body and different things she can do, most obviously her first period and her telekinesis.Overall, CARRIE is an outstanding horror/drama.

The way Brian de Palma took the time to set up everything for that magnificent prom sequence is just astonishing. The tonal shift is brilliant, he managed to make a teenage drama with horror, slapstick comedy in small bits and a lot of heart in the central character, not to mention the fantastic ways he explored bullying and puberty together with demonic powers.He developed everything so well that even the ending, confusing as it is for those viewing it for the first time (not the ending itself but the why those things happened), grips our emotions and we are fully emphatic with the characters. I even dare to say that our empathy goes to every single character since there is enought insight to understand why they are the way they are.

I will never forget the image of this pale girl, with a look on her face of horror, embarassment, shame and raw emotion, covered in blood and through her eyes, the whole gymnasium, stands and laughs heartlessly at her humiliation.Carrie was a landmark for me, as I'm sure it was for a certain Mr King. It displayed for the whole world to see that school,(high school, secondary school) could actually be hell. In my mind Sissy Spacek was born to play Carrie White. She encapsulated all the emotions and feelings so well, your heart couldn't help but go out to her. In my mind this is a horror, but not in the sense of Carrie White's telekinesis, but of life, and of the people in it. Those who just wanna push things that little bit too far, for some nondescript reason. The girls squealing for Carrie to ""plug it up"" when she gets her first period and has no idea what it is, and when they start throwing tampons at her, is alot more frightening than most of the episodes of Carrie's telekinesis,(with the exception of the 2 final incidents). Piper Laurie's excellent portrayal of the religiously fanatical Magaret White, her determination that Carrie is first dirty and polluted which eventually gives way to her belief that Carrie is evil, is disturbing viewing especially considering that at the crux of this all, Carrie is her child. A WORD OF WARNING: De Palma's version differs from Stephen Kings novel, however that does not make it bad, since the initial essence is there. Carrie is an unfortunate victim of circumstance, trapped in a world that she does not control, one thread that is evident in both the film and the novel is that Carrie's ultimate empowerment and her decision (arguably based on instinct and reaction)to initiate it, leads to destruction of the town and finally of herself, but throughout the whole thing she remains, unsure and often even unaware. Carrie is a victim you care about and you understand the revenge she exacts upon her classmates and the redeemed Sue Snell(Amy Irving), however, you get the feeling that Snell's attempts to bring Carrie happiness is slightly a case of trying to forgive herself for descending into madness in the girls locker room. The final scene (one of the best classic endings of a film ever:discuss!?) is a final triumph for Carrie, her final revenge, her gift to Sue Snell, her legacy. But throughout the whole film, never was this more a case of just an innocent victim of circumstance. A triumph for King and De Palma, (plus a chance for De Palma to home his skills down, in particular his trademark split screen filming).

In the book there was a lot more about carries mother which I found very interesting. I can imagine how hard it must be to make a movie exactly like the book but I think they could of put more from the book in the movie. In the movie everything seemed to happen in a flash but in the book there was a lot more suspense.

I expected to be scared, It's about a teenage girl who's prom is completely ruined! She wants revenge! REVENGE! They could've used this so much better but they didn't.What annoyed me more was that I felt more excited about the pig's blood scene then angry for Carrie, and when it finally came, it just felt like they could've done so much better, and when Carrie started her rampage I just didn't feel anything.I'll admit that was the best scene in the movie, but only because everything else was just so forgettable.In the end, this is a pretty ordinary film for me.

356,aparna-1,Taste of vengeance...,9,22 July 2005,"Good movie.I have always liked Hollywood movies  they have a theme, a morale, they teach - and they teach a hell lot.Story of a girl with a very strict Mother  a hard core Christian  very religious minded and follows the Holy Bible word by word. Tries her level best to raise her daughter in best possible ways  giving her the basic necessities, educating her, providing her food and wants to keep her away from obscenities, cheapness and vulgarity etc. It's a movie of the 19th century , so now you can well understand how difficult it is for parents to give their child a healthy environment.Now what makes an environment  Neighbors, newspapers, magazines, TV, Internetschool friends etc. is'nt it ? yes it is.Few turning points of a girl named carrie : 1. at the age of 7, she asks a shameless nude woman lying nude in the garden what her breasts were all about ! Now S L U T woman are the kinds who can lie like that in front of public to watch  no mother  a righteous one  can ever stand her daughter being exposed to such vile women  so she beat her up  the poor lil' carrie ynderstood nothing. Mother thought that she is just doing the right thing.2. Mother never told daughter about Chums (periods, Menstrual cycle  which the girls now-a-days are seen celebrating in the TV advertisements)! it comes to her as a surprise in school  other class mates make fun of her  except one girl (very attractive African girl with sparkling eyes  I really liked her eyes  do not know her name). Later of course all the girls are given a dose of a lifetime by the Instructress and she throws Tampons at them  to teach the girls a lesson  The Instructress was also very attractive to look atI like such chiseled facial features .3. The good friend of Carrie requests her boyfriend to ask Carrie for a date to the College fest PAM .or something. He agrees and asks Carrie out. Carrie who had read in magazines and in fairy tales since her childhood about Prince Charming coming and etc. was very happy.4. In the meanwhile Carrie had learnt Telekinesis ( Mind Control and contacting the subtle world) through the Internet  since she was alone and hardly had any friends and other stupidities like partying, picnicking, gossiping etc. she could concentrate and even succeed in receiving the services of the Subtle world.5. She tailors a dress for herself  a plunging neckline- revealing her cleavage and shoulders  to her mother's horror  her mother could not stop her as she had come to know of Carrie's super natural powers.and was rather afraid of her. She tries to tell her of some 13th chapter in Bible (I have not read the Bible in so much detail actually  sorry!) - where it has been stated that women who seduce and wear such vulgar outfits burn in hell for eons !- but Carrie does not listen.6. In the mean while the other students  of idiot and sick parents , decide to drench Carrie in Pig's blood ! and by cheating, makes her win the dance contest she is invited on the stage to be given the award (my heart cried for her as I knew that soon she will be drenched in blood !)  and her happiest moment becomes the saddest moment for her .not because of God but because of children belonging to parents who are greedy, sick, jealous, vamp-ish and villain-aceous IDIOTS.7. Anyways  in order to give a lesson of a life time  the Higher Subtle Level  blocks the hall doors and many of them die - suffocated within the walls  short circuit happens  many students ..who were not even aware of what some miscreants had done  were burnt to death ! (quite like burning in hell.most girls actually wore revealing outfits by the way) they all die because of the mistake of a few (4-5 of them) Idiot-rabid-street-dog born sons and daughters ! 8. Back home , her mother sees her all smitten in blood and concludes that Carrie, after all paid for her disobedience and wearing that kind of outfit enraged the Gods and is thus fit to be killed ! She tries to drown her in the bath tub  but since Carrie had access to super natural powers by now, kills her Mother instead.9. The Director therefore has tried to teach the world that  for supporting truth, purity and innocence, the Higher powers can finish, annihilate the entire world order.as it happened in Ramayana and Mahabharata, Sir Mosses broke the two slabs of 10 Commandments (the first time) on seeing the people, he had taken the risk for, dancing like pigs with nude women, cheap wine & black wealth ! 10. Beware people !",Carrie
357,Jim-480,A masterpiece,10,28 August 1999,"First of all, for those of you that for some reason deny this as a horror movie, you are fools.  It is a drama, yes.  However, a movie doesn't have to have beginning-to-end violence to be considered a horror movie.Secondly, there is a lot of complaining about this movie being boring. Those are probably the same people that liked Armageddon, and there is no way that those people can possibly be pleased.If you haven't seen this movie, go out and rent it right now.  It is that good.  It don't believe I have ever cared so much about the characters and story. (Spoiler ahead) When Carrie receives the award at the dance and is standing under the bucket of lamb's blood, I noticed that my heart was actually beating faster.  I am sometimes disappointed with my distance from movies - I didn't think Blair Witch Project was scary - but I my heart was actually pounding, a personal first.I thought the most powerful and telling scene is when Carrie gets locked in the closet for the first time, after telling her mother about her first period.  When she was on her knees crying because she didn't understand her period and her cold, heartless mother stood over her denouncing her, I thought that was as great an instance of acting and character development as any other in movie history.Stephen King should be credited for his wonderful story.  I personally think that King is overrated as a writer, (The superior quality of a few of his works are nullified by the large body of crap that he pens) but he wins with this one, and Brian De Palma, well, what can you say?  His visual style (reminiscent of Hitchock, yes, but is Hitchcock the only one that can ever use certain filming techniques?) is elegant and suspenseful, and I am sure that very few, if any, others could have made a movie this good. (Kubrick comes to mind.)In short, do what you can to own this movie.",Carrie
358,Filmmaker 13,Sissy Spacek's creepy eyes,10,1 December 2006,"Sissy Spacek has the creepiest eyes and Piper Laurie had a crazy menace on her face. I gave the film a 10/10 not because it was brilliant film-making, but for one simple fact: It actually scared me. This is odd because I saw the film when I was a kid, but it made no impact. I caught it again on cable the other night and I got a little scared seeing Sissy Spacek's wide open eyes when she destroys the high school and Piper Laurie's creepy smile (reminded me of the old people in Mulholland Drive)as she attacks Carrie. This is a most notable feat: a scary movie that was actually scary. The film accomplished what it set out to do; an amazing achievement that many films today unfortunately are not able to do.",Carrie
359,deathinleamington,Chilling,7,14 July 2005,"I first watched this when I was 17 (I am 32 now) and recently I managed to get hold of a copy and thought ""I wonder if it's still any good?"" - it really is! It's more of a psychological thriller than a horror film, but that's not to say there aren't any horror moments. The maltreatment of Carrie by almost everyone else in the film is a constantly recurring theme, which, due to superb directing and screenplay, avoids becoming repetitive - the film favours Carrie's view of her world above all other characters, allowing you to become absorbed. This makes a lot of the film quite uncomfortable viewing, but it demonstrates just how brilliant the director is at manipulating our emotions.I'm not quite sure how much this film may have aged - I am from England and have no idea if the 'senior prom' is as an important event now as it was 26 years ago - and of course hairstyles have changed. It hardly matters, however. It's still a great way to spend 98 minutes - oh, and watch out for the ending!",Carrie
360,JBurd,"Superb Movie, this is how horror should be!",8,29 August 2006,"When we think of horror, we think of ""slasher"". We think of Ghostface running around stabbing people, and we ""Whats New"", or of Leatherface, swinging his Chainsaw into the sunset, and we think ""Thats Campy"" or of Jason haunting the camp he died at, and we think ""Well, thats nothing new!"". But, then we see Carrie, and we think ""Oh...my...god...!"" Carrie, directed by the wonderful, talented Brain DePalmer, was actually a book, by, Stephen King. With these two minds at work, how could we not get something totally incredible? Carrie, isn't just another horror movie. It is a old idea, finally brought to the screen for millions to watch. The reason it is so good is because it is done so perfect, and it is done so delicately, and mad to tenderly...that the finishing product throws a movie at you that you didn't expect.Carrie, is our typical high-school misfit. She is mad fun of bye the lots of peers (the popular kids?) and the ones that don't make fun of her, probably are the ones spreading the nasty rumors. To make matters worse, the place were everyone should feel safe, her home, is just another living nightmare, making school a warm-up for her. She lives with a religious fanatic mother, who has her fare share of problems as well. All along, Chris Hargenson, accompanied with her boyfriend Billy Nolen, have a deadly surprise waiting for Carrie, and the most important night of her life...that will change everything, forever! But what everyone doesn't know, is that she has powers to move things!Now, after reading that dry, one dimensional summary, you might not think it is that good, but you must watch the movie, the you will know.What makes this movie great is it isn't just a horror movie, but a drama...the interactions between everyone, the good that people do, that only ends up causing more chaos. How truly evil people can really be, and...making the unbelievable, believable. Carrie has so many levels and hidden things, you might want to watch three times to really see it for what it is worth, not just a horror, but almost the study of humans...of course, it is very scary, indeed. You might also want to bring a pillow...just in case.The movie fast-paced, but wonderful telling of Carries life, just sets the tone. Starring Sisspy Spacek, who does a job nobody else could do with the role of Carrie, really will make you think. It also stars Piper Laurie, queen of the stage, playing Carries crazy mother. Her performance is done with so much power, it will make you shiver. Meanwhile, the rest of the cast does a wonderful job, and keeps you on your feet with Betty Buckly, Nancy Allen, who does a wonderful job portraying your classic, high-school bully, Amy Irving, as the kind-hearted, but misguided, Sue Snell, William Katt, as Tommy, Sues kind-hearted boyfriend, Jon Travolter, as Billy, and PJ Soles, who always shines no matter what role she is playing.Watch Carrie today!",Carrie
361,cinematicparadox,The most inspiring movie I have seen,10,24 June 2007,"If there was something wrong with this film, it would be hard to pick out. It is amazingly acted, greatly scripted and everything a good film is supposed to be. It is my favourite film of all-time, and I couldn't stop talking about it for weeks after I first watched it. And then I got a reason to watch it again, I did my speech on Sissy Spacek, and I got the DVD out because Carrie was the main movie in my speech. Sissy Spacek was amazing, every scene with her in was special, she made Carrie White an emotionally-charged psycho. And what about Piper Laurie, she was just the most irreplacable character there will ever be, and I'm sure Sissy was scared of her just a tiny wee bit. The rest of the cast, Amy Irving, William Katt and Nancy Allen were amazing teens. I didn't like John Travolta's performance, it just lacked what the rest of the cast had going for them. Carrie has a sparkling script with added funny bits to remember it's a teen movie not a blood-sucking horror!! The moment Carrie gets soaked in blood, it's just so weirdly unreal to watch, ha ha. So I'm going to end this with my favourite tag line... IF YOU'VE GOT A TASTE FOR TERROR, YOU'VE GOT A DATE WITH CARRIE!!!!$$WICKED$$",Carrie
362,markdcampbell,Classic Standard Horror,8,30 October 2001,"I won't get into the story. It's been told. What I will say is that Carrie resides as one of the best high school bully pictures of all time.Before Jamie Leigh Curtis was dubbed scream-queen, this flick made everybody jump, cringe, and shun away - not from terror, but from the story itself.Perhaps one of Stephen King's most poignant novels about the ""terror"" of growing up and being different. Castout. Weird.The shower scene alone makes the viewer shrink.This film makes you feel like the fox AND the hound.Brian DiPalma did this story a great justice.peace out!fizz",Carrie
363,rayesh_g,A Chilling and spellbinding horror movie from a master of suspense.,9,22 August 2009,"Brian De Palma's Carrie is a unique gem in the genre of horror, made with love to offer a great piece of entertainment. De Palma who is without a doubt has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, often uses the great master's edgy mysteriousness mixed with humor to create a masterful character study. Carrie, the young protagonist is a pale faced teenage girl who is shy, quite, strange, weird and anything else that one could describe as a trait of an outsider. She is a sad result of extreme religious oppression, forced onto her by her overtly religious mother. A walking ghost, she wears the same generic clothes with no sense of style, wanders alone in school and hardly ever communicates with people. She is in a mental prison created by her mother, for she is not allowed to go to the prom, talk with strangers or experience the bliss that a young teenage girl meant to. This confinement causes her to tread more dangerous territories. She has a mysterious ability to control objects around her with her thoughts, and the inescapable abuse and hate she suffers causes her to use these powers with devastating results. De Palma, who went on to make a slew of classics after Carrie, is seen experimenting with the trademark visual styles that would propel him to the forefront of great directors. The opening credits sequence which is a slow motion shot of the girl's locker room is hypnotic and at the same time shocking for it's eroticism that makes one think that anything could happen in the movie. The director has an uncanny ability to manipulate images to create a certain emotional depth in the characters, simultaneously building surprise and suspense. The acting in Carrie is another if not the best aspect to appreciate in this movie. Most actors who are making their debut appearances are quite effective. Carrie played by Sissy Spacek, looks as if she had almost worked herself into a state of trance during the climatic scenes, making her portrayal of Carrie more shocking and real. Carrie's mother played flawlessly by Piper Laurie brings humor and craziness to her character. John Travolta, Nancy Allen and the rest of the supporting cast adds vibrancy that makes the movie flow according to its agenda. Carrie is an entertaining horror movie wonderfully made to give the audience the shock of their lives. It avoids all clichés of the horror movies of today which are nothing but gruesome portrayals of human torture. This very reason is why Carrie is filled with humanity, humor, suspense and surprise for it intelligently avoids letting the Butcher make the film.",Carrie
364,armo_852,More than just a horror film,8,16 January 2004,"SPOILERS POSSIBLE When I first saw this film (only about three or four years ago) I was not overly impressed. It seemed to take an age to get interesting. That's why I was baffled by Stephen King's taste in films, despite what an exceptional author he may be (IT is his best novel). He supposedly loves this film, yet hates Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', which is undeniably a masterpiece.However having recently viewed 'Carrie' for the second time my opinion of the film has changed. It is still nowhere near the film 'The Shining' is but I do appreciate it a hell of a lot more. 'Carrie' is not just horror, in fact King and De Palma have stated it isn't horror. Of course it is horror. But it is also a teen high school 'coming of age' film. It is one of the first films to focus so intently on the goings on of the school institution and how young individuals cope with their transition into adults. This is the part I found slow first time around, and in parts still is.However Carrie (a perfectly cast Sissy Spacek) has more problems than the average teen or even of the average bullied, loner teen in that she has a religiously obssessed and psychotic mother and, oh yeah, the power of telekinesis. This difficult stage of a young person's life is even more difficult for her but up until prom night she is able to bottle all these problems up.The massacre of prom night is pure horror and brilliantly handled by De Palma. The tension is expertly prolonged as Amy Irving's character follows the path of the rope to the bucket of blood and then as the mob laugh in silent slo mo at Carrie's humiliation. The violence is not just Carrie letting loose all the frustrations and anger in her life but also De Palma letting loose after trying to build it all up so gradually. It's almost as if he thought what the hell, I've managed to contain this for over an hour, now i'm just gonna let her rip! The crucifiction of her mother with the kitchen utensils is equally shocking. The jump ending is excellent too.And yet, regardless of the undoubted evil Carrie allowed herself to be taken over by (which proves her mum right with the point about her having the devil's power) we are willing her on. And that is even scarier.
It does have many flaws (such as the inadequacy of Nancy Allen and Travolta's death and the actual way the schemers get Carrie to the stage at the prom in the first place) but it is top rate horror in the final half hour. 'The Shining' has no flaws by the way.",Carrie
365,kenji9083,Mean Girls vs. Social Outcast with Telekinetic Powers,7,3 July 2020,"Not really a horror film and definitely not scary. More about high school mean girls picking on Carrie. Carrie is a social outcast with a Bible thumping, emotionally abusive and over the top mother. Carrie becomes the victim of a school prank which causes her to let her powers loose on everyone. Sissy Spacek was good. Piper Laurie's character was way way over the top, to the point where I think that is what was intended. Travolta's role is small. Thought about giving movie only a 6 but adjusted to a low 7 based on fact this is a very 1970's movie.",Carrie
366,grandmalop911,Was my favorite movie for the longest time.,8,27 December 2000,"I never liked the beginning (but I guess no straight female would, bunch of naked girls running around the shower room) which actually stopped me from watching the first time i had a chance. I left the room thinking ""what? am I in 6th grade health class?"" But the next time it was on TNT I was stuck at home and decided to give it a go. Quickly realizing i had made a mistake by giving up on it the first time the beginning is after all essential to the plot. ""Carrie"" became my favorite movie. Finally I bought it realizing how much I missed watching it during the long gaps between it being on TV. I now have the framed receipt hanging on my wall. (only movie receipt I have ever framed and there's only one other movie in the world that I would frame the receipt of if I could get my hands on it.)I think what I like most about the movie is it shows people aren't born bad they just snap under the bad will of others. Carrie missed out on her chance of a good life because of everyone else. You have this sweet shy girl who gets pushed to her breaking point and does indeed break. It forces you to look at the people who made her snap and lay some of the blame on them rather than just Carrie. Which is a value I think is overlooked in real life. The last thing I have to say is I strongly suggest you do not see the sequel!! Damn the sequel! What are these people trying to do? Ruin a classic?",Carrie

According to supplemental material on the Special Edition DVD, however, King apparently admires De Palma's and Cohen's version very much.In my opinion, King's ""Carrie"" novel was brilliant and powerful.  It actually WAS horrific and the level of emotion invoked by King was intense. The film adaptation does not come anywhere close to portraying the extremes to which the character's personalities and situations have gone.  Granted, perhaps the novel's characters are not particularly dynamic or complex. But they are effective, fun, and enjoyable.Some of the camerawork, sound and visual effects intended to be ""suspenseful"" are just plain hokey.  Well...actually, most of the film is. John Travolta???  Give me a break.How can this film have possibly earned Academy Awards?  Especially considering the usual pretensions of the Academy.

I heard it was really good, and I enjoyed the book, but like most Stephen King adaptations, the movie sort of ruins the book for me. Since I really enjoyed Carrie as a book, I was reluctant to ever watch the movie until my aunt told me it was really good. She doesn't read the books, but she's good at telling what I'd like. So when I found it one day at a movie store for only eight bucks on DVD, I decided to get it. I got home and immediately loved it. It was amazing. From the shower scene to the ruined house scene, the movie was truly creepy and sometimes just all out scary. The acting was amazing, especially Piper Laurie as the crazed Christian lunatic mother. And what I think made me really go for this movie was that it stayed true to the book except for two parts, which were just as awesome if not better than the book. Carrie is a great movie for any horror or drama fan.",Carrie
372,HorrorCreepshow,A horror classic for the ages!,10,31 December 2011,"What can be said about Brian DePalma and Stephen King's masterpiece that hasn't already been said before. It became a smash phenomenon upon first release and has, not surprisingly, grown in popularity after years of VHS, cable TV, DVD, and Blu-Ray. But has it held up? YES!Carrie tells the all too real story of a bullied girl who gets no support from her religious freak of a mother who'd rather lock her in a closet and tell her how much she's sinned from getting her first period than trying to notify teachers of her plight. Luckily for Carrie, and not so luckily for her classmates and mother, she possesses a great power - one she can't control. Carrie is essentially a dark modern fairy tale. It's Cinderella territory all the way, but with a darker ending. Carrie doesn't get through her moment of glory unscathed. Instead of a glass slipper, she leaves a trail of blood back home with her. What could have been a simple fun exploitation film (see: Jennifer) is made all the richer by Stephen King and Lawrence D. Cohen's vivid characterizations and tight plotting. The actors are all universally stellar. Sissy Spacek takes Carrie from pitiful, heartbreaking, and ultimately, scary as hell! As her psychotic mother, Piper Laurie is more than up to Spacek's powerhouse performance. She's truly one of the most terrifying characters ever committed to celluloid, mainly because we all know someone just as unstable as her. Nancy Allen and John Travolta (in his first big leading role) are equal parts hilarious and pure evil...and boy, do they make evil look good. Amy Irving and William Katt both radiate kindness and warmth, as does Betty Buckley as Ms. Collins, the kindly gym teacher who seems to be the only responsible adult in the film. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Brian De Palma's exquisite direction. He was labeled as a Hitchcock imitator back in the day, but it's really nothing more than homage. His camera effortlessly glides through the sets and characters in the film. The crowning of the prom king and queen has never been so nail bitingly intense. Carrie is a simply perfect horror film AND a perfect film. It just is! It's filled with heartbreaking drama, pulse pounding suspense, plenty of humor, and a few jump out of your seat shocks! How can you ask for more?",Carrie

I honestly don't understand the ""it's not scary"" mentality!Now, whether you want to call this horror film or thriller or whatever else is up to you, but I think Carrie's scope cannot reaches beyond just one genre! It is a thriller, but at the same time a very humane movie. You can feel the girl hurting, you hate her mother, you dislike her friends! This movie wasn't made for cheap scares: every scene is brilliantly captured. The scary parts may be rare but when they are there you just can't move from your seat!The acting is also excellent, Sissy Spacek of course deserving most of the credit, but that is not to say that the other actors aren't great too.Concerning the script, all the credit goes of course to Stephen King. When you see this movie you can really tell the difference between an artist like him an some cheap Hollywood writer (Scream?). There is so much more to the story than: -Booooo! -Aaaaaa!So, if you want to see a ""scary movie"", go see Scream or some other shallow horror film. However if you are looking for a terrifying but also moving film, Carrie is just right for you. And please, if you must put this work of art into one genre, its  better if you put it in social drama rather than horror film. Of course it's not scary! It's MUCH more than just that.",Carrie

379,kennethcarino,"A truly, deeply, cynical film. A classic for millenia.",9,7 July 2015,"Carrie is a classic horror film that will be remembered for millenia. It is a moving coming-of-age drama-or thriller-or horror. In any case it is about a shy, sweet girl played by Sissy Spacek who inhabits in a cruel world. Her mother is a religious zealot who abuses her whenever she thinks Carrie committed a sin and her high school peers shun her. Many viewers will find the film not scary at all but it is not meant to make your guts jump out. No, it's a metaphorical tale of growing up and a deeply cynical one too which you will find at the end of the film.I will not spoil anything but I will just say how the film starts and it starts off in the girl's locker room. The camera pans along the misty room and we see the girls gossiping, chattering and dressing up. The camera finally focused on to Carrie who was showering. This scene is very sensitive, sensual, emotive only made possible by the synergy of music and cinemotgraphy establishing Carrie as a sweet and innocent girl whom we should sympathize. As she showers, blood flows down down her feet and shocked as she had never had period, or known, menstruation before. It is a premonition of things to come. It is the cinematography (the lighting and lenses) and the music which are the key elements that made Carrie such an effective film that it is thanks to Brian De Palma's direction. In particular, the music is used to build up and accumulate the tension especially before and during the infamous prom scene. I, being a film buff, I could see Brian De Palma took pages from film making textbooks by emulating German Expressionist movies for lighting to create horror and Citizen Kane and 2001: A Sace Oddysey for using music as an alternative to tell the story.The cast in the movie is excellent and they all have great played their roles really well. Of course the star of the show is Sissy Spacek and she balanced her role well by not being a typical vulnerable, damsel-in- distress and yet you will feel truly sympathetic towards her. As one reviewer said, she did not need to cry for you to feel sorry for her. The mother, played by Piper Laurie is a class A religious lunatic whom you would feel absolute contempt for abusing her own daughter. Similarly, Carrie's peers abuses her and you would feel so angry that you would want to take a dig at their faces with your fist. Now, if the above emotions are what most people felt, it means the cast have been really good with their role. As a matter of fact Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were nominated for their roles.Before concluding the review, I would like to offer some analysis of the movie to tie the review with my summary. The film Carrie is indeed a coming-of-age story but not your standard one. It is not even a standard horror film which may put off some people expecting jump scares and monsters. No it is far more mature and smart. It is a deeply, deeply, deeply metaphorical tale of cynicism and the world. Carrie is growing up and she is not prepared for the real world. She is your typical teenager (not considering the telekinesis) torn apart by pressure from the twisted idealism of her mother who do not teach her properly about the world and from the cruelty of her school colleagues. Only her gym teacher Miss Collins and Sue Snell showed genuine care.Overall, the I love Carrie and it has universal themes and message very relatable to all of us who went through the troubling teenage years and to those still in their teens. I don't see any bad points other than it is not a conventional horror which some people complained. Nevertheless, Carrie is a memorable and a classic horror film.",Carrie
380,thegreathealer,There Will Be Blood,9,13 April 2017,"For a film so nominally fixated on the clash between religious fundamentalism and the ungodly notion of supernatural forces, it's little wonder that Brian de Palma's 'Carrie' has provided these past five decades with such rich pickings. From adolescent rites of passage to the horrors of high- school life, 'Carrie' works both as satisfying revenge drama and carefully unwound thriller, cranking up the tension in suitably Hitchcockian style as the used, abused and ultimately natural force of Carrie White (a surname befitting one so pale, ordinary and forgettable that even her own Headmaster is incapable of remembering her Christian name despite being frequently reminded of it). 'Carrie' also carries with it the resonance of the all-too frequent occurrence of unhappy and murderously charged teenagers taking out their fantasy retribution in any of a hundred or so high- school massacres across the gun-loving states of America. It chimes so strongly with a modern, frequently adolescent audience because it depicts so well the pain of not fitting in at a time when being accepted as part of a crowd is never more important. Carrie speaks to the awkward, shy and desperately lonely loner in all of us. If reaching adulthood is itself an achievement against a backdrop of teenage trauma and suicide, then Carrie's own journey is a tribute to the forgotten faces that are lost along the way.The 1970s in Hollywood were richly mined, not least in the horror genre, by a number of tropes that continue to resonate today. The likes of 'The Exorcist', 'The Omen' trilogy and of course 'Carrie' itself all take as their starting points the metaphorical transition from child to adult as a breeding ground for evil. While Regan McNeill's puberty erupts into demonic possession and Damien comes to understand his own demonic status as the embodiment of the Devil of earth, Carrie White instead is baptised into womanhood by the visceral letting of her first menstruation. Here the very mechanics of a young girl's sexuality is itself a watershed for other, deadlier forces. Already able to manipulate objects by sheer thought alone, Carrie's buried and bruised personality is caught between the extremes of peer rejection and ostracisation, and a domestic life with a religious zealot mother whose own trauma is now turned back onto a daughter taught only that sex is sin, piety is the only salvation and (ultimately) death the punishment for living. Whether one can read more into Mrs White's own sexual baptism - rape trauma? parental abuse? - is not entirely clear, but the zeal with which she condemns herself and her only child to a life devoid of pleasures both of the flesh and not is evidence enough that religion and sex are never an easy mixture.The Prom - which is laced throughout 'Carrie's narrative with all the subtlety of showing a loaded gun in scene one - of course provides the ultimate stage for Carrie's second baptism, this one into demonhood. Director Brian de Palma cleverly draws visual parallels between the blood-caked Carrie of menstruation with the blood-soaked Carrie that is humiliated at the crowning of her perfect, fairy-tale evening. And the irony of Carrie's own persecutors themselves providing the transitional enzyme for her final ascension fits with the film's overall wrathful fulfilment. While the notion that 'no good deed goes unpunished' remains as true when considering the 'innocent' victims of Carrie's conflagration, be they the gym teacher who provides a motherly support sorely lacking at home, or the well-intentioned teenagers that concoct for Carrie a prom date, only to be either killed or so heavily traumatised that one suspects the horrors of Carrie's retribution will be felt long past that summer night.De Palma's rich fairy-tale is nothing of course without a wicked witch, and 'Carrie' arguably has two - bitchy alpha-female Chris, whose myopic hatred of Carrie is as fundamental as any religious zealotry, and ultimately Carrie herself: denied the fairy-tale crowning of her unhappy life by a cruel and malicious stunt that has her bring down her own short-sighted vengeance upon those both deserving and not. Carrie's retribution of course cannot come without a fatal personal price, and when she returns post-massacre to her domestic nest, hoping for the soothing reassurance of a mother misguidedly proved correct in her assertion ""they'll all laugh at you"", she instead is slain. Surviving only long enough to exact her own suitably symbolic execution, pinning her mother to the walls with kitchen implements that visually mimic the crucifixion.Robbed of a desired for score by Bernard Hermann - whose same year 'Taxi Driver' soundtrack proved to be his final work - De Palma instead calls on the services of regular collaborator Pino Donaggio, who in a suitably honorific style even mimics Hermann's iconic 'Psycho' score to provide the psychic stabs of Carrie's powers (well, if it ain't broke don't fix it). The performances de Palma elicits are second to none, with especial plaudits for both Spacek (embodying the ugly duckling/beautiful swan journey Carrie takes, before terrifying us all with her final act flourish) and Piper Laurie as her deranged mother. Both actresses were Oscar nominated if ultimately unrewarded in a category notably shy of even acknowledging the horror genre, but to be fair the entire cast of newbies and oldies (John Travolta marks his first on-screen appearance here) are equally assured given a script that clearly gave enough (bloody?) meat to even its most secondary of characters.Remade in 2013,and with a woman director calling the shots, Carrie 2.0 promised much but delivered little. Only Julianne Moore's channelling of Piper Laurie's cruel and obsessive mother even begins to draw favourable comparison. While Chloe Grace Moretz is far too pretty and pleasing to capture the transformation that Spacek managed with lesser bone structure. As a result the film falls into the forgotten cauldron of recent remakes such as 'Evil Dead' and 'Blair Witch': bloody, but ultimately bloodless.",Carrie
381,harmonyrose10,Fantastic!,10,12 October 2013,"In my opinion this film is absolutely a fantastic film based on the novel by Stephen King. It had an amazing setting and really focused on how bullying can make you go insane. Sissy Spacek's performance of Carrie White a timid shy girl was amazing and she portrayed the character very well. Piper Laurie's performance of Margaret White her religious and crazy mother was brilliant and she portrayed and acted really well for this character and is what I expect to see in a character like her. Brian De Palma's Carrie is a true horror film and very unextraordinary. An amazing tale of a misfit named Carrie White who causes telekinetic chaos on her town. I recommend if you want something different and not too creepy, to watch Carrie.",Carrie
382,naturegirl12,There's a reason why Carrie is the only one of this genre I'll watch...,10,25 August 2008,"Truth be told, I'm an absolute chicken when it comes to horror films. Yet I've loved the story of Carrie White for years, simply because I don't see it as a horror as much as I see it as a tragedy. Anyone who was ever bullied knows what I'm talking about.Now, before I go on my soap box, we'll talk about this movie. I finally saw it a couple of weeks ago and it was everything I expected it to be. True, there were some parts that seemed a lot more funny than I think they ought to have been, but the truth is that the good outweighs the bad. True, some of the acting is laughable, particularly with Chris and Mrs. White (I realize that many people enjoyed Piper Laurie's portrayal, but I found myself laughing at her instead of just hating her guts and I truly believe that that shouldn't have happened), but then there were the real gems, like Sissy Spacek and Betty Buckeley. As far as I'm concerned, Sissy IS Carrie, and I found myself weeping the closer we got to the inevitable ending that would end in her character's downfall. As for Betty Buckeley's Miss Collins, she's the sort of teacher that everyone wishes they had and Betty played her beautifully.My only true complaint is that the Black Prom scene was way too rushed. I really thought that having the split screen ruined the effect it was supposed to have, in my mind. I realize that hardcore fans will despise me for this opinion, but I don't really care. All the other scenes, especially the opening one in the locker room, were amazing and built up to the unforgettable climax (I'm speaking more about the aftermath of the prom, actually) with the proper amount of foreshadowing. That's really all I have to say, except that I wish that Sissy was in more films that got a lot of publicity, because she really deserves it after helping to create this masterpiece.",Carrie
383,Snowman-6,Disturbing!,8,17 November 1998,"This is a pretty good schlock horror movie, like the Excorcist but not at all as scary.

What she does here is so special, so untouched by older movie references and so strong, that you wonder how you registered any of the plot, supporting cast or other element that make the movie work (although there are : Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is amazing, the original novel by Stephen King is one of his best, and that also makes it work). Possible runner-up in that category : Amy Irving in DePalma's The Fury.",Carrie
385,allgood-2,Carrie,8,29 December 1999,"I have to say, this movie was not what I expected. I hated it the first time I saw it because I was expecting horror, which only came in the ending. I saw the sequel, which inspired me to see the original again, tthe second time I liked it. If you want to see it, remember, it's more drama that horror. Overall, it is very good and I give it a 9 [out of 10]",Carrie
386,gailbob006,Carrie,10,16 June 2006,"I have always wanted to watch this film. I searched the film up on the internet and Piper Laurie starred in it as Margaret White. I thought well i have seen her in another film. She acted with Mel Gibson TIM. She was brilliant in that film. She took a great part as Mary Hotton. That was the first film that i ever saw her in and i liked her. Well when i watched Carrie(my second film that I've seen her in) she was even more fantastic. When i watched Carrie she acted as a religious freak who wore purple cloaks and red fizzy hair.Who always would carry a bible with her and a black bag. She took a brilliant part and her cloak had suited her. I thought that the film was brilliant and i knew some of the actors from previous films. I knew John Travolta from Greese and P.j Soles who starred in Halloween. I had seen this film 10 times now. My dad always complained that i was watching the film too much. But i didn't care. But i have to say that Piper Laurie was the best. But she took a great role. The third film that i have seen her in is Trauma she was the killer and i couldn't believe it. A little brat had killed her. There again she took a great part. At the end of Carrie i realised that she cuddled Carrie.Before she stabbed Carrie and she also cuddled Mel Gibson who played Tim. Carrie fell downstairs and Margaret was walking about with a knife in her hand to try and kill Carrie but it didn't work because Margaret forgot that she had powers and Carries powers. Flying knifes then the knifes had hit M and then second minute you see she was just stood there still with knifes stuck to her hand. What was disappointing at the end was i saw Pipers legs walking when Carrie moved her. But it didn't matter about that because she did well, well she has acted really well in films and she deserves a celebration. But i have read reviews that she has acted with Sissy Spacek who played Carrie in the past. I thought that they acted together really well. Thank you for the good film",Carrie
387,teshnair,"This is not a horror movie, but one that should not missed.",8,4 July 2014,"I find it intriguing that this is quite often put in to the category of a horror film. I saw the movie nearly 40 years after it came out and, surprisingly, enjoyed it very much. This may be a disappointment to those who watch it, expecting a horror movie. It is not. There is no horror aspect in the movie at all, except perhaps for the contrived religious leanings of Carrie's mother. Carrie herself is a victim of her mother's unrealistic faith as well as a subject of her college mate's cruel pranks. Socially isolated and frequently ridiculed by most, except for a few handful who sympathize with her, Carrie hones her telekinetic skills which she initially uses to defend herself and ultimately to exact revenge on her college mates when she is pushed to her limits. Through the length of the movie, you tend to like Carrie for the girl she is, trying desperately to fit in, to belong and you sense the hurt she feels at being rejected or ridiculed. Even as she exacts revenge, it is easier to support her than to condemn her for her actions.Sissy Spacek, as Carrie, did carry the movie entirely on her shoulders and she did a fantastic job of it. From putting on Vaseline on her hair at the auditions for this role to getting her nomination for Academy Awards, this movie belonged to Sissy all the way and she will always be remembered for it.Overall a great movie, and sure not one to be missed. It has everything in it to be a cult classic.",Carrie
388,Proudtoberandom,Favorite Horror Film,10,30 July 2014,"This is definitely my favorite horror movie. From the acting to the special effects, everything in this movie is spot on. Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie, a bullied girl who finally snaps when pig's blood is dumped on her at the prom. She's mousy enough to understand the bullying, but pretty enough to feel bad for her. All the actresses playing the bullies truly radiate hatred during that beginning scene and their dreadful chorus of ""plug it up."" And Piper Laurie truly fills the role of Carrie's religious and abusive mother. Carrie is the perfect bully victim. Anyone who has been bullied has wanted to get revenge, even though it's hopefully not as extreme as Carrie's, and Carrie is definitely admirable as that one kid who finally has enough of it. The split-scene telekinetic rampage at the prom is one of the most beautifully executed movie scenes I have ever seen. From the movie's beautiful opening to the stunning and terrifying conclusion, Carrie is a scary yet wonderful film, with the strongest anti-bullying message I have ever seen. Highly recommended.",Carrie
389,Zed1999,The first Stephen King movie!,7,14 January 2021,"As far as being an adaptation of a book, Brian De Palma's CARRIE is about as faitful as they come. Though not a perfect movie, it has built quite a reputation for itself, even for a teen-drama movie. As old as it is, CARRIE still holds a dark and depressing ambience all the way from the bleakness of the 1970s. The score is very good (though unfortunately some of it is literally ripped from Bernard Herrmann's PSYCHO soundtrack) and De Palma does a very good job of keeping the pace moving at a tolerable level... because let's be honest, we're all here for the big final act of prom night - which is obviously where the movie sets itself into Hollywood history.
As someone who has read Stephen King's (debut) novel CARRIE, I'll argue that this is probably the closest we'll get to a perfect CARRIE movie. Sissy Spacek, even with her seriously distracting Texan accent (isn't the film set in MAINE?!), her performance as Carrie great. She is believably unnattractive, even by Hollywood standards, and that goes a hell of a long way in creating an actually 'real' bully victim. 2013's CARRIE starred Chloë Grace Moretz who, let's face it, would fit better as the hot popular girl Christine Hargensen (""Hargenson"" in the movie), the antagonist. This film also saw John Travolta in one of his earliest roles on the big-screen, and he gives the film a little comedy relief while also doing a good job filling the boots of Billy Nolan, Chris's boyfriend and secondary antogonist.
Carrie's mother, portrayed here by Piper Laurie, does a great job of making a believable religious fanatic, despite the fact that she thought this film was a comedy when she was filming it. She easily carries an unsettling presence in the film and is perhaps the scariest thing after the gruesome third act of the film.
One thing I personally disliked was the ending. The book closes rather poetically with a character suffering a menstrual period much like Carrie did at the beginning, but here in the movie, that same character is greeted by a zombie-like hand that plunges out of Carrie's gravestone, gripping her in a dreamy slow-motion sequence. All the while this is happening, music that would go well with the wicked witch of the west blasts in our ear-drums. Cheesy, much? Thankfully, it is revealed to be a nightmare. Furthermore, even King says he prefers this ending. That's that, then.
Either way, despite its imperfections, and the fact that a lot of great scenes from the book are replaced or simply cut, CARRIE is a classic horror that sits up on the great horror pyramid with Friday The 13th, Halloween, Dawn Of The Dead, and so on.

393,Andrew Burnet,"Shows us the brutal, twisted fantasy of those tortured by others.",8,20 July 2003,"What made Carrie that much more brutal (and some of the scenes are) is the fact that in reality people are like this. The Telekinetic powers Carrie possesses are the dream that comes to a tortured and bullied kid, as they lie awake at night waiting for the nightmare they call life to end. They want to strike back at those who have constantly hurt them. Whether they truly deserved what came to them is immaterial. This is how some people in the world feeluntil all that is left is a rage against everything and anything. It doesn't matter what. When someone is tortured and humiliated that much, you can't expect anything other than pure fury deep down. To blame Carrie for inspiring bullied children to commit such acts is horrific and naive in itself. The true tragedy of Carrie, for me at least, is that this does happen. Carrie shows a reality for some children, in a brutal way. It doesn't show these poor kids what to do. It shows us what they what to do. With bullying, it is the cause that needs to be addressed, and not the symptoms. Stop and think what it must be like for these people. A good film, well directed and written, with some powerful images and acting.",Carrie
394,memoryofyourface,Horror movie that isn't so horrible.,2,29 December 2003,"The movie ""Carrie"" has an excellent reputation as an horror movie. It's been selected as one of the best horror movies of all time by some British people and its sequel has been made after almost thirty years. So, when I started watching it, it was with great anticipation and a blanket to hide in the unbearable scenes.But you know what? Carrie is not scary at all. Except the last ten minutes and a couple of scenes in the beginning, the story is told as if it were some kind of a Cinderella story. I was watching it with a couple of ten-year-old kids in my house, and I had to literally scream at them to stop asking when it was going to get scary. They were a little scared when Carrie was using her supernatural powers covered in pig's blood, but not too scared. On the other hand, I found myself enjoying the romantic sentiments of the movie; I know I shouldn't but I did. If you take out the last part of the movie, you've got yourself a nice ugly duckling story. I wonder why the movie was made as horror and not a romantic comedy. It's basically what this movie is about for most of the time. Also there are some religious references that might offend some of the viewers.In conclusion, it's a unworthy horror movie. In fact, it's an unworthy movie. If you're trying to catch a horror flick, just pick any other horror movie instead of this one. You won't miss very much. I promise. 2/10",Carrie
395,usernumber655321,Fun but flawed,7,15 August 2012,"The movie is still fun, but when people throw out ""best movie ever"" in every other review I tend to get a little more critical than I might otherwise. It all hinges on the pig's blood. Having just watched it, I can say for sure that there is no way the 'Chris' and/or Travolta character would have even known that Carrie was going to the prom when they initially decide to get the blood. It seems to me to be a glaring writing flaw given her being all 'social outcasty'. Why would they assume she'd be going? It is doubly noticeable given the fact that the gym teacher explicitly says at one point that you can't go to the prom if you don't have a date. It would not seem a safe bet for them to make that she would go at all. You would think it would be a given that they would assume she definitely wouldn't be going, being such a supposed 'loser' and all in their eyes. In general, the pacing and structure of the film suggest it was a bit of oblivious film making, like it hadn't really occurred to de Palma to establish nancy allen and travolta's knowledge of her going to the prom. Anyways, I really like the film, but this part of it was a bit irritating.Also, why would nancy allen try to run her over when she does? Why would someone assume Carrie had used telekinesis? It is hilarious when you think about it. Of course, we as audience members know that is what happened at the prom, but how would they have known it was Carrie that did it? Did she just think; ""oh, must have been Carrie using good ol' telekinesis to murder off all our friends, not just some random electrical calamity. I'll run her over with my fancy red sports car""?",Carrie
396,eatpajdittsvin,Evil Creates Evil,9,3 November 2010,"Wow. Just wow. I saw this yesterday and I can't stop thinking about this movie. It's probably the second best horror film I've seen second to Aliens, although I'd say the label ""horror"" isn't quite appropriate. I think it's certainly scary to some extent though.I won't repeat the plot since plenty of reviews do already.This is a beautiful movie. The music just works (in my own opinion, I've heard differing views on the matter). The visual direction is excellent.The beauty of the movie is just an auxiliary however; what really matters is the effective story, acting and characters. One really notices that there's a strong source in Stephen King's novel.We are through some elements of foreshadowing mercilessly led down a path to hell, quite literally. On the other hand, the individual events can be very unpredictable (the menstrual blood as the first example). It's the perfect combination to make a movie interesting, in my opinion.Carrie herself is incredibly realistic, and is more genuine than most, both as a result of very good acting and a solid script. Her character is complex - we feel sorry for her a good part of the movie, but at one moment while walking home after the prom stained with blood, she seems more like a demon returning to its lair after harvesting souls. We are forced into re-evaluating our opinions on her after the overly brutal slaughter.Carrie's mother, in sharp contrast, is an over-acted archetype of a religious zealot. This contrast and the relationship with Carrie is of huge importance. She is what we love to hate, and for a good part of the movie she seems unconditionally evil and wrong. But nothing is as easy as it appears to be...Further supporting characters are also archetypes, but it achieves the purpose of reinforcing Carrie's character. We find more characters in the ""love to hate""-category here in the girls that bully Carrie and cause the sequence of events leading up to the prom slaughter. However, do they really deserve death for what they did? No, and that places us in a moral dilemma where we were rooting for Carrie, but where she severely overreacts beyond any reasonable level.In fact, I'm going as far as saying that in one way, it truly is the devil coming back from the prom and that Carrie's mother in a twisted sense is more right than we want to admit, and it terrifies us. I also interpret the events that follow as further tokens supporting my theory: Ultimately, the house falls apart as punishment of unrepentable deeds.I'm not the kind of person who usually tries to find hidden meanings in movies. This movie however... Let's just say it is not only a revenge fantasy as some have claimed. It is a tale of how evil creates evil. It is a display of how not being able to back down and not pushing it further leads to out of control disaster.",Carrie

As Director De Palma makes sure the audience is fully aware of our protagonist's hardships and consequent psychological states, he avoids a simple story where a demonized monster brings harm to innocent lives. Carrie's telekinesis abilities develop alongside her womanhood, and she becomes able to powerfully assert her justified agony onto those who mistreat her...and onto everyone else in her world. Furthermore, this movie presents us horror with a source that is not unknown, the most notable being religious extremism, social cruelty, and the persecution of femininity. Lastly, the movie does a fantastic job in constantly manipulating us as viewers into thinking things are safe. Warning: it is all a trap, because this is a twisted story where hopeful aspirations lead to the most terrible outcomes. For being blatantly but intelligently horrific with significant allusions to our societies treatment of womanhood, I give this movie a 7/10.",Carrie

Amy Irving also did a wonderful job as Sue Snell, Nancy Allen as Chris, the villain and finally Betty Buckley as the Miss Collins. Priscilla Pointer and P.j soles did also very well. The men can't be left behind since William Katt and John Travolta also perform extremely well. The directing is also great, Brian's best work by far.

There are only very few things that keep it from getting a 15, namely some zooms which disturb the movie a little. But other than that this is a brilliant movie. Brian De Palma plays with structure, he uses the classic 5 act structure instead of the Syd Field 3 act structure. He places the climax far within the movie instead of at the end. After the prom, there is no more turning back. The end is obvious and there is no way to turn it. Brilliant.

404,jnazander,Nonsensical teenager drama movie,2,16 December 2019,"I don't know why there are so many positive reviews praising it, probably because of nostalgia, but I'm going to write honest, objective review without any nostalgic baggage.First of all, this movie is not horror, it's a high school drama movie with 10 minutes of horror tacked on at the end. We have Carrie, a nerdy high schooler who happen to have magical telekenetic powers for some reason. But those powers are only used during the last 10 minutes of the movie, so you can forget about them for now. She is bullied for not knowing about her own period (she is a nerd who never read about basic human biology?) And later the bullies get rightfully punished.We learn that her mother is a religious nut who is obsessed with praying for forgiveness. At first that looks creepy, but after several scenes it just becomes predictable and comical.After about an hour of drama-related scenes of Carrie going to her first prom and the evildoers plotting revenge against her, the main plot point happens - she gets blood dumped on her and everyone in the audience laughs (as opposed to real life, where everyone would be horrified and would run to help her). Then Carrie remembers that she has magical powers and uses them to destroy everything and kill everyone in the building (I guess it's a plausible reaction considering everyone in the audience laughs, but still, that's kinda over-the-top). Everyone dies except for the actual evildoers. Do they run the hell away from there? No, they choose to... try and murder her by running her over with a car. But her magical powers prove to be stronger and she blows up the car instead.So why didn't she use her magical powers any other time? Why not in during the shower bleeding scene? Are we supposed to believe that she never used them up until now and nobody knew she had them? That's extremely stupid. That's like superman-disguising-as-clark-kent level of stupid. If anyone in the movie actually acted like people in real life do, none of that nonsense would have happened.In conclusion - a nonsensical teenager drama movie with a stupid unrealistic plot, with some over-the-top horror and gore tacked on at the end.",Carrie

406,mateosuperkick,One of my favorite stories ever,10,22 November 2020,"An incredible ride. While it's missing many of the perspectives from the book this encapsulates Carrie's story to perfection. Out of this and the two remakes it's the best Carrie you'll see, Sissy. There's nothing I'd say that could improve on this movie.",Carrie
407,RicardoLopez116,Overrated,10,23 May 2007,"Hmm... let's summarize the film, shall we? Girl abused in school and at home kills everyone at prom when a prank is pulled on her. This film just falls beyond my intelligence. The acting is mediocre, the directing style is annoying, and it's extremely predictable. Oh, you mean you didn't know she was going to exact her revenge? DePalma is a very bad director. I don't understand how he can get so many fans, and how he is still being hired by movie studios to direct films that will surely become a critical flop. I say he quit his job and become an accountant, same thing with the people who give Oscars.The only pro for this film was the beautiful score, but not even that makes up for this mess of a film.2/10",Carrie
408,mhudsondevout,Love this original movie,10,21 October 2012,Not sure why this one needed to be remade. Amazing movie. I love the way the real blood gets you to buy into it. Just the image of her covered in blood at the end of the film is so amazing. In today's films there is not such beauty. Carrie is undeniable. Truly love this classic. Her powers and Sissy's performance above all takes the cake here. I assume (not being an actor) that the depth she had to reach to stretches beyond what has been called for in parts she was more rewarded for. Amazing the way that works. Must have seen it 12 times. Own the VHS. Pretty funny how the teaches are smoking when they talk to her in the principles office. They should have had the ashtray fly up and knock one of them out though.,Carrie
409,americanadian25,A Masterpiece In Horror...,10,4 August 2005,"...Yes, it is a masterpiece. Carrie is an excellent movie based on the excellent Stephen King novel. This movie is a classic that appeals to hardcore horror buffs and others too.The Plot: Carrie White is an outcast to her friends at school. She is the girl everyone picks on, she isn't very pretty, she is awfully shy, and people seem to hate her for no reason. Her mother, a obsessed and at times psychotic devout Christian, abused her daughter in the most terrible ways. Things begin to look up when Carrie is asked out to the prom by one of the most popular guys in the school. Prom will be a night to remember... if they live through it.The Good: This movie is a classic and definitive film in the horror genre. It set many standards for the horror movies that followed it. This will probably forever be remembered as Brian De Palma's most famous movie, and it is easy to see why. Carrie has some of the most impressive direction and cinematography I've ever seen. You will believe it when you see it. The acting is superb. Although some of the actors may seem a tad to old for teenagers, I think they are good. Sissey Spacek gives a groundbreaking performance as Carrie, the character who made her a star. Piper Laurie was the perfect choice for Margaret White, Carrie's crazy mother. Most of the supporting cast excels too. Also, look for a pre stardom John Travolta, in his first major motion picture performance. The movie starts out with a creepy and dramatic theme, and picks up into a scary bloodfest for the finale. May I add, the final scene is so crazy, it will make you fall out of your seat.The Bad: Some of the acting in this film is merely average at best. My other complaint about this movie is how it deviated from the book at the end, but it sticks to its source very well until then.Overall: Carrie is a must see! I Give it a 9/10!",Carrie
410,CarrieWhite2013,Has Virtually Nothing To Do With Stephen King's Novel ! Watch The 2013 Version Instead !,1,8 May 2014,"I used to like this film a lot, and watched it several times, and didn't even bother reading the Stephen King novel (who is my favourite author, of whom I have read 13 books) as I thought that it would be the same than the '76 film. Similarly, I wasn't that interested on the 2013 re-imagining of the novel (which is NOT a remake of the 1976 film, as so many people wrongly think) for the same reason: didn't think it would be better than what I had already seen. Oh boy was I wrong!!! The main reason why the 2013 version is SO much better is because it follows the novel much closer: it's mainly a drama with horror, unlike the '76 version, which didn't care about what the poor Carrie White went through and just wanted to scare the audience about a poor innocent and bullied girl, which I find disgusting. The re-imagining, right from the start, gets you into Carrie's shoes, and you FEEL her pain, from being bullied every day, unlike the previous version where you never cared that much about her, since the screenplay didn't bother with that. The 2013 version is ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING while the '76 one is just your average teen slasher, with the main character using telekinesis to kill others instead of knives as the main difference.As well, the acting is BEYOND THIS WORLD on the re-imagining: Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore are both phenomenal and should have won Oscars, with the rest of the cast (specially Judy Greer, Portia Doubleday and Ansel Elgort) being also fantastic. Compare this with the '76 version, where the acting was so over the top that both Amy Irving and Piper Laurie thought their characters were comic (and you can read this in the trivia of this film right here on IMDb): the first one thought that her character was for comic relief as she spent most of the time in the film bickering like an idiot with her boyfriend (unlike the novel, where all their conversations are deadly serious) while Piper Laurie admits herself that she overacted so much that she thought the film had to be a comedy. No more comments are required about the acting, as it's clear, other than even though Sissy Spacek was quite good, Chloe Grace Moretz was not only much better, and had the right age for the character (which in the book is a teenager and not someone approaching her thirties, like Sissy Spacek was when filming) but looks much more like her as well (as Carrie is described in the book itself) as well as acting far more similar to her, by, for example, being far more vocal and less naive than the '76 character (again, just like in the novel).Some of you may think 'but King himself liked the '76 version a lot'. Well, even though I'm his biggest fan, I have to admit(and everybody knows really) that he is no expert at films, as shown by his direction and screenplay in the terrible 'Maximum Overdrive' (1986), on his multiple horrible screenplays, such as for the terrible 1994 TV adaptation of his fantastic novel 'The Stand' (and several others) and on choosing the not so good director Mick Garris to direct several of his book adaptations, such as 'Riding The Bullet' (2004), 'Desperation' (2006) 'Sleepwalkers' (1992) and others. Somehow in all the aforementioned adaptations the story always changes from being extremely dark in the books(as typical in King's books) to something far lighter which even approaches soap operas in theme.Everything else is also much better in the 2013 version: phenomenal and heartfelt direction by Kimberly Peirce ('Boys Don't Cry'), vastly improved screenplay written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, beautiful and haunting music by Marco Beltrami (unlike the Psycho rip-off of the '76 film) and far better special effects, to name just a few aspects vastly improved from De Palma's film.Do yourself a favour and forget about this film and instead watch the 2013 version HONESTLY: that is, not just to criticise it but to discover what a fabulous film it is, and using your own mind to decide whether you like it or not, not what others have said.",Carrie
411,zacharyduresky,A Magical Melodrama!,10,15 August 2013,"Carrie is a film that makes you feel so many different emotions. Scenes like the infamous ""period"" scene will make you feel disgusted. The gym detention scene will make you laugh. The dance between Carrie and Tommy will touch you're heart. The climactic scene where Carrie unleashes her powers and kills everyone will have haunt your nightmares. There's drama, romance, suspense, comedy, eroticism and horror, everything you cold possibly want. But at its core, this film is a melodrama. This is a melodrama about an abused and taunted teenage girl who just wants love and acceptance. Then she discovers she can move things with her mind. At first she does nothing evil with it, and still tries to get accepted, and manages to do so. But then after a cruel prank involving pig blood, she's now out for human blood. Everyone dies, and this evil she finally unleashes leads to her demise, just like any other tragic character. This is easily my favorite film by director Brian De Palma, and my favorite film based on a Stephen King story. This melodramatic piece of genius never stops satisfying me, and just gets better and better every time I watch it. I highly recommend this to all who are unfortunate enough to have not seen it.",Carrie
412,filmclassics44,Carrie (1976): The Horror Film that Requires a Box of Kleenex,10,23 June 2017,"Carrie (1976) is a cult classic that inspires many filmmakers to this day (such as Quentin Tarantino). This is also the first film that got me interested in horror movies. What is intriguing about this film, is that it does not play like a classical horror story. There is a lot of heart to the story of Carrie, with this version especially, thanks to Sissy Spacek's more than well-deserving Oscar nomination for ""Best Actress."" Thinking about the other actresses considered for Carrie White gives me the same feeling as if Shirley Temple played Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" instead of Judy Garland. Sissy Spacek truly defines the role of Carrie White. She portrayed everything that the audience needed to root for her and sympathize with her; she was extremely sweet when treated with kindness, fearful whenever somebody approached her, and justifiably ANGRY when pushed too far. Carrie (1976) is what told the world that one of Hollywood's greatest actresses existed. Piper Laurie, another unbelievably well- deserved Oscars nominated performance as Carrie's psychotic mother, Margaret. Because of Piper Laurie's extremely frightening performance, the audience loves Carrie even more, feels her frustration and despair, and it's because of her mother that her life is, literally, Hell. Margaret White is an example of a horror movie character that is even scarier than a monster like Michael Myers or Freddy Krueger; and that is because of how real she is. The supporting cast is also extremely memorable, many in their first major roles, or even debut roles (like John Travolta). Amy Irving as the compassionate Sue Snell, William Katt as her hunky, love-able boyfriend Tommy Ross, Nancy Allen as the purely evil Chris Hargensen, John Travolta as her psychotic and goofy boyfriend, PJ Soles as Chris' malicious bff (the one with the red baseball cap), and of course, Betty Buckley as Carrie's PE teacher, aka ""fairy godmother,"" Miss Collins. The whole supporting cast truly made this movie what it needed to be, the pillars for Carrie, and the shoulder weights for Carrie. The prom scene, one of the most memorable and jaw-dropping moments in horror (or just) cinema history. I have seen this film approximately 150 times, and each of those times, I really do believe the bucket will miss as I'm watching Carrie having her only Heavenly Cinderella moment. And there's never a time I've watched it and not told her to get off the stage. That is the brilliance of Brian De Palma, and the cast/crew of Carrie (1976). The cinematography (Mario Tosi) brings you right into the film, and the both beautiful and haunting melodies of Pino Donaggio bring joy, fright, and extreme sorrow to this picture. Overall, Carrie (1976) is such a beautifully disturbing, tragic motion picture that brought a whole new level to the genre of horror. Carrie White is arguably the most loved horror movie ""monster"" because of Sissy Spacek's surreal portrayal as a broken girl, who wants nothing but a life of happiness that she never gets, even when she gets super, super, SUPER close. This is a movie that deserves to live on and on, especially to show what could happen when you push somebody to the edge; after watching Carrie (1976), you'll never want to pick on another person again.",Carrie
413,Sandrahst1,"Great 70s horror film, even better than Exorcist!!!",10,20 May 2008,"Oh I totally love this film!! I even drove 20 miles to buy it on DVD. I haven't watch the DVD yet, but I did saw the film on A&E Channel. De Palma, did a great job in directing this film. So totally a novel put into film. I got so fascinated with this movie that I have to keep on looking up for more references about it (even the cast) on the internet. Sissy Spacek's performance is outstanding!! I totally give her thumbs up! I like the way how Amy Irving portrays Sue Snell, oh shes so hot!! Especially in the end where she was dressed in white and visiting Carrie's burnt lot with the flowers, shes looks so pretty! Everything in this film was well-written. If I was living in the 70s and someone ask me which horror film I like, I say ""Carrie""! I haven't seen The Rage: Carrie 2 yet, but I will and review it later. Anyway, good film! Highly recommended!",Carrie
414,jamie-96822,Or at least 9.5,10,4 November 2017,"This version of Carrie is one of my favorite adaptations, no one of my favorite movies. I'm not a fan of horror or Stephen King but I read Carrie a long time ago and was blown away (I actually listened to Carrie on audiobook and it was narrated by Sissy Spacek). Speaking of Sissy Spacek, can anyone top her as the telekinetic outcast? (Maybe Angela Bettis) Sissy just oozes Shyness and Loneliness. I just want to hug her all throughout. When she smiles after winning Prom-Queen I just could not help smiling with her. Piper Laurie is really over the top as the mother, but the director asked her to be that way so much she was convinced that she was starring in a dark comedy. The Remakes are clearly based on this one while also claiming to be more faithful.",Carrie
415,Masterofthesky1985,"An Excellent, Simple Horror Film... one of the Best Ever Made.",9,1 May 2007,"A simple story used in a powerful way, Carrie is truly one of the best horror films ever made. Brian dePalma's amazing job of developing a seemingly simple story is nothing less than superb. The film is pragmatic, simple and to the point and uses horror in a very imaginative and revolutionary fashion, not through tension or spontaneity, but through building up and finishing off with a powerful climax. Carrie is an adorable protagonist with whom we can identify ourselves with very well and with whom we might feel a pity and solidarity. The script is absolutely fantastic; the scenes have a rhythm of their own and are beautifully merged into the next. The story practically writes itself but nevertheless allows us to see very lively and lifelike characters. The cinematography is excellent, as are most of the aesthetics. The shots are absolutely sensational, especially the shot just before Tommy and Carrie are turned into Prom King and Queen (in a sequence of two minutes with no cuts and ample usage of both dollies and cranes) and the sequence immediately following the blood spill. The film brilliantly portrays the nature of adolescence society, and never once does it overstate, exaggerate or step away from realism. Apart from being a very simple story, it would be hard to find something against this brilliant feature. With simplicity as its only enemy, the film's ending and the death of Ms. Collins are the only parts of the feature we might have changed, but this is very much trivial very much my own personal point of view. The feature is wonderful as it is, and its simplicity is what makes it great.",Carrie
416,pkeo03,Plot Errors...big plot errors,3,3 December 2013,"""Carrie,"" when I watched it in the 70's I thought all the teenagers were in on the plot to humiliate Carrie. I watched this movie recently and what I picked up was a huge flaw in the synchronizing of the plot. The story is that unknown to her peers Carrie developed telekinesis abilities. Because of the opening scene where she is humiliated she's seeking help though it is her first period. After the initial scenario, we are brought to Ms. Collins lecturing the girls with the humiliation brought down on Carrie.To top it off her mother is a total religious fanatic, having a warped idea of Christianity. This is the reason for the issues Carrie has to deal with; she is sheltered. It's obvious the religious beliefs that are thrown at her are from her mother's warped belief system. It is obvious when Carrie and her mother are communicating to each other that Carrie is very normal.Her mother dressing her down and keeping her sheltered is what is having her peers make her their scapegoat. We skip to the part where Chris is plotting revenge against Carrie for the gym teacher punishing the girls for their horrible treatment of Carrie in the shower. Chris walks off in anger set on revenge. Sue tells her to shut up, and to forget the whole thing.Sue is beginning to mature emotionally; realizes that everything Ms. Collins is telling them is true. Carrie is a teenager like them, she has feelings.The following scene Sue is talking to her boyfriend Tommy wanting him to ask Carrie to the prom. She feels she owes it to Carrie for all the horrid scapegoating that was done to her. Not just the shower room but other things that the viewing audience isn't privy to.This is where the error comes in. From a point of synchronizing it 'seems,' as if Tommy and Sue are plotting against Carrie with Chris. This isn't the case and that is where the film loses it's validity. First: when Chris is talking to Billy going down on him etc, it's obvious Sue knows nothing about Chris's idea of a sick revenge plot on Carrie. It""s just a 'coincidence' Tommy is asking Carrie to the prom the same time Sue, Billy and Freddy are out slaughtering pigs. When I saw this movie as a teenager, I thought the 6 of them were in on this devious scheme (Norma, Freddy's girlfriend as well). When I recently viewed it I realized it wasn't that at all. Chris had no idea that Tommy was going to ask Carrie to the prom. She was planning to place the bucket of pig's blood over the podium where Carrie and Tommy were standing. In previous scenes Freddy is making plans to collect the ballots for prom Queen and King to sabotage it all so Carrie and Tommy would win. Carrie would be standing under the bucket of blood. What made me realize this flaw is Sue in jeans and a sweater leaves her home at 8pm (here is the mistake with timing). Sue is leaving at 8, the ballots were being collected at 8, but Tommy told Carrie he would pick her up at 8! The timing is off as everything is supposed to take place at 8! Regardless of that error, Carrie's walking up the stairs of the podium with Tommy by her side; everyone is happy and applauding them. Chris walked off during the time of detention,as a result was denied entrance to the prom. however,she and Billy somehow get in, is hiding underneath the podium staircase with the rope leading to the pail of blood over Carries head. Sue gets there and is behind the podium, happily looking at Carrie with Tommy escorting Carrie on stage. It's obvious Sue didn't expect that Carrie would win, she's smiling as she feels this will be a new beginning for Carrie. As she is watching, she notices the rope is wavering. Sue peers up and sees the bucket though doesn't know what it contains. She does realize that it is going to fall on Carrie and whatever it contains isn't good! Sue follows the ropes and sees Chris and Billy under the podium steps, and is about to pull the covering to reveal the two and their plot. Before she does, Ms. Collins eyes her, and walks quickly over to Sue grabbing her. Sue is frantically trying to explain what is going on but Ms. Collins isn't listening; she drags Sue off into the corridor. As the door closes, the pail of blood falls down over Carrie, as a shocked audience watches the crude scenario. When the blood hits Carrie, Tommy sees what happened,is yelling,and reaches out to try and pull Carrie off the stage. Before he could the empty pail hits him on the head, he's knocked to the floor. The error is the unbelievable synchronizing in this particular scene as it could possibly be connected with Sue, Tommy Chris and Billy. It's obvious Sue had done a huge turn around, and wanted to help Carrie into acceptance.Something was cut which destroys the movie plots validity. The rest you all know from viewing. This is why I gave the movie a 3 rating.",Carrie
417,zackcboyd,Carrie a classic American horror story,9,15 October 2017,"Carrie is both disturbing and horrifying. And for a horror flick that's obviously a good thing. Most of the complaints about this movie are that it is ""not scary."" Whoever believes this, however, apparently has never met people, because Carrie's main villains seem all too real. The main villains are not a vampire or a redneck with a chainsaw but are instead a bunch of sexually awakened teenagers and an overly protective mother. These characters on the surface don't sound scary, but Carrie brings out how evil and sadistic these characters can all be. The real to life villains makes Carrie feel truly unique and worth watching over 40 years later.Carrie, played by Sissy Spacek, struggles to fit in with a sexualized society full of ""mean girls"" and a mother, Piper Laurie, who plays a religious nutjob hellbent on protecting her daughter from said society. The conflict between her mother and a sexualized society forces Carrie into becoming a social outcast. An isolated Carrie is a strange protagonist. As sometimes, you will feel strong sympathy for her character, but yet as soon as you feel her pain, you will just as quickly become completely horrified by her. This dichotomy about Carrie as a character makes her an iconic horror movie protagonist that you will never forget.The movie has many interesting themes worth taking note of like sex, religion, parenting, womanhood, isolation, and bullying. For exploring so many different and pertinent topic, Carrie, as a film is much more powerful than the horror flicks of today that are instead all about cheap jump scares and plastering the screen with guts and gore. Carrie does a little bit of that, but it also explores some deeper and more interesting societal issues. It is worth a watch just for these reasons to see if you agree or disagree with some of the larger messages.In sum, Carrie is a fantastic horror film from beginning to end. It gets the tough balance of making a film both scary and relatable as you will feel like you have met these characters before in real-life. Since Carrie was filmed in the 1970s, however, it may scare away some modern audiences because of the outdated film quality. Luckily, the superb acting and thoughtful script make it still worth the watch. The 1970s atmosphere also makes it extra haunting. Because watching Carrie filled with retro relics, hairdos, and clothing made me feel like if the portraits in my high school Health class textbook came to life and were destined to suffer a terrible fate. For this reason the classic film Carrie is wicked haunting!",Carrie
418,eddy_guitar_lover,"""Carrie"" remained today as good as it was in 1976",10,19 March 2006,"""Carrie"" is the movie made by Stephen King's first novel. For those of you who don't know (altough I doubt there are a lot of people who haven't heard of this), ""Carrie"" is the story of high school student Carrie White, who is constantly bullied by her classmates. As if this wouldn't have been enough, her mother is a religious fanatic, who thinks life itself is a sin. In the first scene, we are brutally introduced in the harsh high school life (I can't tell more, see for yourselves) and see just what Carrie's classmates really are. And so, Carrie must find a way to survive all these attacks. And she does... She soon discovers that she wields a special power: telekinesis. At first, she uses TK without actually realizing what she is doing, but then, she can control her power pretty good (she was never able to fully control it, but she made real progress). Now, the movie is a little different of the novel, but the major facts written by Stephen King are in the movie too. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie are the stars of the movie, being an astonishing mother-daughter duo. Their relationship is much more special than an ordinary one. They love and hate each other with the same passion, and they are often unpredictable. You never know what's gonna happen until the very end of the movie, it's like being on a roller-coaster--now it's going up, now it's going down, and you're going with it. Same is ""Carrie"", due to Sissy Spacek's brilliantly performance. You feel what she feels, and you almost feel sorry for her on that fateful Prom Night... Carrie was always the weak one, every cool kid's target for teasing and taunting, the one that never fights back. But on the Prom Night, which was supposed to be magic and ""a night to remember"", some of Carrie's classmates take things too far, by throwing pig's blood on her just as she is crowned as the Prom Queen. The moment is full of drama, suspense, and, eventually, horror... ( it's shown in the theatrical trailer) Than, she gets revenge on them, using telekinesis. The storyline is really interesting, but the special effects are really bad, due to the period of time the movie was made (yep, no special effects in 1976). Sissy Spacek and John Travolta really bumped up their careers after this film, and you'll understand why when you'll see it. The scary part of the movie (they say it's a horror film, I can't tell why) is not so scary and only lasts a few minutes. ""Carrie"" is most of all a drama, and trust me, the movie won't scare you, but it will make you think. Betty Buckley, the Broadway singer, has an important part too. If you haven't seen ""Carrie"" yet, just go and rent it, it's worth it. You know what they say, if you've got a taste for terror, take Carrie to the prom.",Carrie
419,judean-26201,Pretty good overall!!,7,10 January 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. It was such a creative way of telling a story of a telekinetic girl who struggles with an abnormally religious mother and a school packed with bullies, sexual harassment, and unaware teachers. Although this adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King is an everlasting horror classic, some things could've been better.I think my least favorite part was the sound. Even though this was released in 1976, movies like Jaws had great sound, so I don't know what the deal was. Everything sounded extremely cheap and were not scary or original at all. The other thing that would have made this a better movies would have to be the ending. If the movie ended a lot earlier than it did, it would have felt more fun to watch. Everything was so dragged out, and didn't need everything it included.",Carrie

421,chris-975,Classic - One of my Top Ten Movies,9,18 January 2002,"I saw this movie a few months ago and it shows how great horror films used to be made. Now they seem to rely on gore to try and grab the audiences attention! Those who have commented on this movie and says there is a lack of gore truly don't know what makes a great movie. I for one resent the use of gore in these latter known splatter films these days and as usual the more subtle and imaginative approach works best.As one user pointed out this isn't specifically a horror movie, but rather a movie about horror. About a girl who is bullied and harassed by her schoolmates then finally takes revenge.Sissy Spacek deserved her oscar nomination as the mis-treated Carrie and Piper Laurie was equally impressive. I also liked Betty Buckleys performance as the gym teacher who tried to help Carrie.I found this film both moving and memorable. And it just goes to show that movies like this are just too rare today as we are always treated to the comedic popcorn movies for general no-brains audience attention.Highly recommended.",Carrie
422,marc_kinsey,A truly harrowing experience.,10,6 February 2001,"Upon the first time of watching 'Carrie' I found it to be the most disturbing and upsetting film I had ever seen. In fact, after having watched it on a number of occasions since, I can safely proclaim it as a masterclass of how to manipulate and emotionally ruin your audience. Certainly, this is integrally due to the performance of Sissy Spacek in the title role. Possibly the most memorable role I have ever encountered, it pushes me to tears at each screening. Certainly, a big ambition of mine is to actually meet the actress, just to prove that she isn't as distraught as her character. Sorry if I'm gushing about the movie, but it is the only film that continues to shock me every time I see it - not due to the bloodbath finale, but at the sheer depth of cruelty forced upon 'outsiders' at school. The graffitti proclaiming 'Carrie White eats shit' on the wall of the sports hall, as she looks through the window, still makes me feel sick to the stomach. Perhaps I was a Sue Snell at high school (never instigating the bullying, but still participating), and I do feel that screenings of this film should take place at all schools - the most effective anti-bullying film I've ever seen. So absorbing is Spacek's performance that it's easy not to notice the wealth of talent in the film - Piper Laurie, Nancy Allen, John Travolta and Amy Irving. Certainly not my favourite film of all time (far too uncomfortable to watch) but certainly one of the most intelligent hollywood offerings I've come across in my short life.",Carrie
423,feliciadayton,all hail the classic,10,21 April 2006,"this was not the first time i watched 'carrie,' nor will it be the last, not if i have anything to say about it. every time i see it i leave convinced this movie is a metaphor for man's fear of female sexuality and yet have done little to further this belief. the greatest evidence i find to support this belief is the correlation between carrie white finally getting her (much delayed) period, a sign she has become a woman, and the development of her telekinetic powers. previously lacking this skill, with the onset of her menstrual cycle it is only moments before carrie is flipping ashtrays and, soon after, obnoxious boys as the ride by on their bicycles. there's piper laurie's comment regarding how, eve was weak. had she been stronger perhaps she would not have tempted adam, which led to knowledge of themselves as sexual beings, and their banishment from eden. if carrie's mother had only been able to control her sexuality then perhaps she would not have engaged in premarital sex and none of this would have happened in the first place. where i find myself hung up is the significance of carrie being covered in pig's blood before all hell breaks loose. there's clearly something in the fact that she is drenched in the blood of a female animal, like a giant menstrual flow, and then finds herself incapable of controlling her own powers",Carrie

Maybe this original version isn't so close to the book, but this version still wins. If you like horror movies then this movie is for you!",Carrie
425,lady_gaby,Carrie,10,17 May 2007,"Carrie is the best movie i have ever seen.It's humane film with a lot of feelings.I agree it's sometimes a thriller,but in my opinion it's a drama movie.It's really sad when they are nasty with Carrie,she didn't deserved that.Sissy is very sweet=)I learn how nasty are the people from this film,it's my favorite forever and ever. And it's much more better that the 2002 remake.Why does this so good movie need a remake? (sorry for the bad English,i'm not from here) I can watch this movie a hundred times,it's just my hobby to watch Carrie =) And Sissy Spacek become to my favorite actresses,of course. It's worth to watch it,because you can realise that Carrie isn't that bad...of course she is not.It's sad,it's a drama,but some people say it's a horror.No,it's not scarry,if you want to find a scarry movie take Psycho or something else,but not Carrie.The film is more than ""just a horror"".The book is very interesting,too.In fact it's more interesting that all films about Carrie,because it's longer and...it's different than the movie. So if you want to see a sad and humane movie,watch Carrie...",Carrie
426,roupoalabash98,King's 2nd Best Adaptation (Behind The Shawshank Redemption),10,25 December 2008,"This movie is literally Stephen King's 2nd Best movie Adaptation (Behind The Shawshank Redemption), and best horror book to movie adaptation. De Palma is able to perfectly capture the emotionally charged and sad reality of wretched Carries troubled teenage period. This movie delivers us Spaceck's and Laurie's arguably best and signature roles. Frankly the whole movie wouldn't have been the same was it not for the performances of these 2 women. The movie has one of the best and most memorable movie openings, it has one of the best movie climaxes, and most important of all it has THE best and most SHOCKING movie finale. All these make Carrie a close perfection in cinematic horror!",Carrie
427,B_v_K,My Favourite DePalma film so far!!,10,5 March 2009,"""You were warned never to push Carrie to the limits. Now you must face the evil consequences""-(Poster tag-line)This is a terrifically made film and also my very first review on IMDb.This is a brilliantly made movie. One that's gonna be with me for years to come. Let me tell you my experiences with DePalma. Ever since I got into film I heard the name Brian De Palma I don't know why.You should have heard a lot of other names before you ever hear his name except in my case. Ever since 14 I know the name DePalma and that he had a movie by the name of 'Scarface'. The first DePalma film that I have watched is 'Scarface' too! I thought it was just nice and had forgotten about it.And After about two years or so the movie begins to haunt me like so many other films in my life.Oh, by that time I had already seen two more films by him that were popular-M I and the untouchables.And So I watched Scarface again at the age of 18 and it blew me away.I mean it is terrific!! This time I enjoyed the direction and everything came back for me. I once again watched The Untouchables and M I and this time I liked them both. And discovered this gem: DePalma. I started my voyage through De Palma just like I once did with Scorsese and Tarantino. And so I watched Blow Out, Sisters, Carrie, Carlito's way, Raising Cain, Snake Eyes, The Black Dahlia, Redacted, Casualties of War, Femme Fatale, Body Double etc and I am kind of in the middle of my voyage and I am yet to see a lot of him and I have to say that Carrie is by far my favorite of him although all of them are just greats! Telekinesis:- the ability to move or change objects without touching them by the power or concentration of mind. Carrie:-Its been known what Carrie is about Carrie is a high school senior girl who is given the ability of Telekinesis by birth.Maybe with a purpose because she is shy and always need a place among her friends. I mean she is always abused and bullied by her friends until one special night she is pushed too far.....""If only they knew she had the power""..... So that's it. She is shy, beautiful, and intelligent who is always bullied by her friends, sirs, neighbors etc.Even her psychotically religious mother make fun of her sexuality and would lock her in a bathroom, insides of which are obscure looking and frightening.All this created Carrie White's disturbed persona and the horror that is yet to be unleashed!The movie has a frightening and claustrophobic feeling created around Carrie White's home.The whole film has a sad,horrifying atmosphere. This is clearly visible in Pino Donnagio's score and the cinematography.Oh man the camera work!! Its one of the most important aspects of the films. I have to say among the best in De Palma films. It has a whole 70's feeling to it.Like when during the prom scene when Carrie and Tommy dances in one of the classic shots of all time,The camera moves around them very slowly at first. We can see the lights illuminating the hall shines behind them striking at us. the colors and everything makes it a beautiful shot and one of my favorites in the movie. The cinematography captures the whole 70's atmosphere and feel and styles like no film other than Dazed and Confuzed and Zodiac (for me). This is my favorite Stephen King adaptation.Its his first novel ever published. This movie marked the debut of future Hollywood star John Travolta and also the first collaboration between De Palma and Pino Donnagio.The character of Margarete White was excellently portrayed by Piper Laurie needless to say.She said she thought Carrie would have to be a comedy because her character is too over the top! That's right her character is that of a morally disturbed religious person.This is an actor's and a director's movie at the same time. But the one single performance to which to which all credits must go is Sissy Spacek.Nobody could pull off such an amazing and realistic performance as the abused teenager Carrie White other than for her. I mean Spacek is born for this role. Carrie is so cute and adorable and we feel for her unlike many other movie characters only to find that she can't be that adorable for too long, Thanks to her! This is a cleverly edited movie. The Scary scenes are perfectly edited in the De Palma fashion so to be enjoyed by us. The use of split screen along with Sisters is one of the bests in DePalma films especially the one with three shots in one frame. It triples up the terror of the scene. Its hysterical!! and funny at the same time.Brian De Palma proved through this film that he is an unpredictable director in every way, who is to be feared of!!I Mean Here's a director that can do anything...almost anything, So beware!!The story by Steven King is something that slowly develops its way through the characters. I mean this is a character driven film that thrills.For me this is a touching, atmospheric, sad and nostalgic teenage drama apart from being a horror film. This is more of a character study than a science-fiction horror.Everyone thinks this is a pure horror film. well Its not a horror film of that fashion. Its not Psycho.Its not Haloween. Its a hysterically moving film which is up there in standards with films yet to come. It will never be dated whatever happens.Like every other De Palma film it entertains on many levels.I have seen it four times and It got better each time I watched it. Carrie:-10/10 Direction: Flawless!!",Carrie
428,jcsahli,The master of suspense (or is it exploitation?),10,7 August 2009,"Despite coming from an era where special effects and slick technology weren't handy resources for creating exciting or interesting horror movies, Carrie must remain one of film's finest examples of raw, sophisticated and devastating tension, created under a modest but virtuosic budget and with a rare capacity (even today) to play with the audience's emotions in a blunt, visceral manner. It is done with Hitchcock in mind, although merely in technique and in tone, never in the themes or the subject of horror or suspense. Most of the film's core one must thank to Brian De Palma's exploitative and lurid manner of maintaining suspense and revering classic horror architecture: stock characters, Gothic camp, and an obtuse, over-the-top view of cruelty and madness into a film that remains a perverse yet instantly accessible and strangely easygoing classic.For me, De Palma has been not only Hitchcock's most faultless copycat, but still in all his elegant pastiche, manages to be a rougher-around-the-edges and more disturbing version of his mentor. ''Carrie'' is based on Stephen King's novel, but his movie version almost seems like a revision, not an adaptation. De Palma's Carrie pays up more visually and technically to any other work in his oeuvre, than to Stephen King psychologically intense and bleak novel. After all it's the same De Palma of always: slightly humorous, greedily destructive, still managing again to ludicrously inject in typically pulpy, sensual fashion heaps of veiled erotic undertones, harsh melodrama and wrenching violence. Case in point is the almost soft-porn locker room scene, steam pouring all over the place and a dreamy, kitsch score by Pio Donaggio leading us to the porcelain-skinned figure of our heroine, as she showers in slow motion. Suddenly while soaping her virginal body, she realizes that period blood has poured almost imperceptibly through her thigh. This macabre detail abruptly halts this ethereal introduction and instead introduces us to Carrie's steamless reality and the vile snake pit of tormentors that plague it. The image of those luminous teenagers roaring from laughter and darting Carrie's flaccid, awkward, moist body with tampons is a perfect example of DePalma's exhilarating sensationalism. The shock factor is later replayed for us in magnified close-up when we see the brainless principal of the school subtly notice Carrie's period blood in the shorts of Miss Collins, her onlyprotecting teacher. DePalma is a master.He also wants us to feel tension, not just empathy and sadness for the protagonist, and he builds it like a pressure cooker, dread piling up as we learn about Carrie's eerie supernatural power and the treacherous plans her classmates have for her. We also witness plenty of domestic horror between Carrie and her mother, a psychotic religious wacko who is held responsible for most of Carrie's delayed, repressed sexuality and social immaturity. What's fascinating is that the White household is played tongue-in-cheekly Gothic: all dark, candlelit, rusty, creaking woodevery time Miss White enters the scene, Hermannesque orchestral music plays as if the Count of Dracula had just arrived at his castle while the guests were waiting. When Carrie arrives home at the end, organ pipe at full volume guides the girl through corridors filled with thousands of candles, almost as from the Exorcist. DePalma is a sucker for stylistic excess, culminating in the voodoo-like Christ Carrie is supposed to pray at when Momma locks her up. Even in the flip-side, the lively, colorful high school scenes Carrie will always observe with retirement are played up against a backdrop of cheesy 70's funk.DePalma plays with point of view, lightning (there is even a flash Frankenstein-type lightning striking at an outwards shot of Carrie's house), music and actors in a way that makes Carrie what Psycho was to the 50s, a bag of shock tactics and muddled, yet humane psychology to guide the audience to a point of inevitable, larger-than-life catharsis. The prom scene reminds me of what tragedy was for the ancient Greeks, sporting a conclusion so intense the audience feels a harrowing sort of purge. DePalma's camera pirouettes around the overblown, glitter-ball romanticism of the prom set-up, one-hit wonders from the 70's looming from the speakers, to perfectly capture Carrie's new position, one of enchantment and almost ecstasy yet led by obvious mistrust and terror. It slickly leads up to that infamous slow-motion, silent and almost palpably sick scene of humiliation and violation. All the mayhem that comes after, shot in deep red, is an almost orgiastic example of DePalma's baroque virtuosity.As in post-data, I would like to comment that the only time that curiously, DePalma is subtle is in monitoring the high school scenes. The school Adonis has a blonde afro, the antagonist is blond, dressed in pink, and eye-rolls and swears more than actually talking, and her friend, dressed even to prom with a cap, only grins and giggles throughout the whole picture. Yet nothing else in this respect is one-dimensional, DePalma is a master of technique and he uses nothing more than again angles, actors and dialog to perfectly capture the complicity, familial sense and high exclusiveness of junior high, through silences, looks and hurried conversations. There is no sketch-artist portrayal of the high school jungle; it all remains quietly realistic. It wouldn't hurt to point out that one of the popular girls is fat and has glasses, not your pretty girl prototype, and I'm glad DePalma did create a hairspray-stinking but thoroughly human high school.Yet again Carrie is not a film you will remember for speaking against or preaching a bit on the hell that high school is for some. Or a haunting tale about what religion extremism does on some. You will plainly remember it as the exploit-y story about that girl that got teased cruelly and killed the whole school in response. Yeah it's that kind of story, and with pride.",Carrie
429,w_qidan,Carrie: an emotional explosion of deeply wounded heart!,10,6 January 2012,"Carrie was the victim of humans selfishness. It happens a lot of times, in many places, when a weak, broken school-boy or girl get abused, bullied and humiliated.Carrie is more than just a movie. What Carrie did shows us how big the rage that could come out from a little weak person. And that big storm Carrie riven was the the results of bad influences of her classmates. This tells you that you should never underestimate someone who looks weak, and that the rage is always far more stronger.Carrie is the first horror film that has a deeper meaning. And that's what made it different from other horror movies",Carrie
430,jmdb23,De Palma and King. What more do you want?,8,12 October 2020,"You could hardly ask for a better movie based on King's debut novel. It captures the essence of the book perfectly with only some changes and Brian de Palma makes it his own with many of his signature trademarks. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie both received nominations which were obviously well-deserved. Spacek's innocence and Laurie's insanity are pitch-perfect. Brian de Palma and Stephen King are a match made in heaven, or since we're talking about horror, maybe hell?",Carrie

432,Zorica_Splendum,Classic horror masterpiece,10,27 October 2013,"Absolutely fabulous horror movie, with a shock at the end. One of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever made. It's all in DePalma's brilliant directing and genius acting by Piper Laurie and marvelous Sissy Spacek, she made Carrie an emotionally-charged psycho. Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen, John Travolta, and Betty Buckley also made this movie remarkable. My favorite scene which is probably many peoples favorite is when Carrie snaps with pig blood all over her stunning white gown which was a fantastic contrast and screaming and terror falls onto peoples faces. The plot is fantastic, effects are excellent (don't forget it's 1976) Sound is great,creepy and full of tension. Amazing movie, 10/10 def.",Carrie
433,JrFan7390,Absolutely wonderful! A masterpiece,10,1 March 2005,"This is a masterpiece of cinema! Carrie is treated so cruelly by her classmates and she finally gets them back! The prom, the mother's death, and the ending with the bloody hand are the best scenes in my opinion, particularly the first two, just because of the rightful vengeance in them. Everyone in this movie poured their hearts out in their roles. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, Betty Buckley, William Katt, and P.J. Soles were all brilliant. John Travolta's performance was good, but it definitely was the worst of them all. Billy Nolan is a complicated character, and he is probably the one that changed the most from the book. In the book, he never smiles and never really enjoys life until the pig clobbering scene. In this one, he looks like he's high all the time (which he probably is.) All in all, an absolute masterpiece!",Carrie
434,benholland1991,Excellent,10,21 August 2005,"This is my favorite film ever. It is so well acted and the characters are all believable, its a very sad film and i cant help crying at the end. Its not a very scary film, but i don't think it was meant to be that scary, apart from the end! Watch this film, it is a classic! It is about a girl who gets her first period in the showers in school and her class mates just make it worse for her by throwing tampax at her etc. Sissy Spacek plays the role terrificly and Piper Laurie fills the role of the maniac religious mother. There are also some very funny moments in the film especially an exercise scene where a rather large girl is getting rather exhausted. Happy viewing. A really really great film",Carrie
435,Danactor4,A triumph!,9,24 August 2005,"""Carrie"" is quite possibly one of the best films I have ever seen. It is not quite the classic it is hailed as, but it has all the elements of a great film. And more.Sissy Spacek made her name with this film, and befittingly so. Her acting is so incredible. That first look of confusion on her face when she sees the blood flowing out of her is so innocent, so genuine, that I almost thought I was sitting there in that locker room watching it all happen in real time. Her female tormentors are cold and merciless, and I nearly cried out when they began hurling sanitary napkins at her.The chief tormentor, Chris Hargensen, is played by Nancy Allan. And she delivers. She has the perfect image of a glamorous, popular girl. Although unlike the novel, she's more of an oversimplified girly girl who plays a mean trick, not the ruthless Chris Hargensen of the novel who goes out of her way to hurt misfits. But this Chris is a more realistic one, and it makes the movie easier to understand.Then what of Carrie's mother, Margaret White (played by Piper Laurie)? Her first scene shows she's an amiable woman...kinda creepy, what with the overly religious routine. But she seems okay, right? Wrong.Margaret arrives home after Carrie's ""incident"" in the showers and gets a disturbing call from the school. She turns from amiable religious woman, to heartless religious zealot. She bashes Carrie around with a Bible, saying what she has done is sin and that God's vengeful hand is at work. (Just a note, but the musical that spawned from this film, ""Carrie: the Musical,"" had a very compelling and bone chilling song in this scene) She then drags her into the closet to pray, all the while quoting an unheard of section of the Bible entitled ""The Sins of Women."" The closet is very creepily designed, with a grotesque cruciform figure with glowing eyes.All in all, the film basically builds up to the big finale. There are a couple of things worth mentioning though. Betty Buckley (who also played Margaret White in the musical version) delivers a good performance as the gym teacher, although her motives as to why she is helping Carrie are kind of subtle. John Travolta fills the role of Billy Nolan, Chris's scuzzy boyfriend, pretty well. William Katt and Amy Irving (portraying Tommy Ross and Sue Snell) are both respectable as well, but both, especially Katt, don't get enough time to really develop their characters. For instance at the Prom, Tommy kinda just falls in love with her out of nowhere. Most of the cast is at, or above good acting throughout. But Spacek and Laurie continue to do wonderful, the other being the only person they truly love and hate. Spacek especially. You literally FEEL her emotions. When she's upset, you're upset. When she smiles, you smile. And you really feel her hope building throughout the entire prom. Speaking of which, I thought the whole slow motion scene was kind of dragged out. Just drop the stupid pig's blood on her already! Although the scene where she's imagining everyone's laughter is very effective.As for the destruction scene itself, I craved more blood. It left a bit to be desired, considering most of them just kinda died. It was almost...well, humorous watching her spray them with the hose and then watching them tumble over the tables and chairs.The final scene at the White Home however makes up for this. It being both Spacek and Laurie's final scene, they go out with a bang. The set is extremely eerie, with candles everywhere. The one thing I didn't like was Margaret was just kinda hanging out behind the bathroom door when Carrie went in to wash. And then just walked right up to her. Laurie's motherly holding and stroking makes you want to go ""Aww..."" and it looks like for the moment, Carrie might be all right. But Marge unexpectedly pulls a knife on her, and she rolls down the stairs. The look in Laurie's eyes is utterly petrifying, especially when she does the sign of the cross over her with the knife. But uh oh. Margaret forgot her daughter's got telekinesis. Carrie impales her, so that she eventually mimics the appearance of the cruciform in her closet. Laurie's dying breaths are extremely convincing, and Spacek nervously looks away each time she allows herself to look. Feeling pained and remorseful, she grabs mom, takes her into the closet and caves the house in.Later, Sue Snell dreams about leaving flowers at the sight of where the White Home once stood, when Carrie's dead hand gives her a good IL' yank and scares the audience. No matter how many times I watch it, I never can exactly time when the hand grabs her.All in all, this film is just one wonderful piece of work. You should watch it, whether you want to see the novel's tragic plot put on film, Spacek and Laurie's marvelous performances, or even if you just want to see Nancy Allan naked. Nine out of Ten.",Carrie

438,Jewel102791,I loved it!,7,8 February 2006,"This movie is the best movie I've ever seen! It is my favorite movie of all time and nothing could replace it. The first time I saw this was in the seventh grade after school. I've heard from people that they thought it was scary, I saw that day and I quickly fell in love with it. It was always on after I got home from school so I would watch it. I never rented the movie because for some reason I didn't want to. One day when I was on vacation in New York I asked my mom if we could rent it. I was really bored so I thought a movie could be good. I watched it 3 times and then I had to return it. A month later in the summer I asked my mom if we could buy it from amazon and she did. It came in few weeks. I was so excited that I watched it all the time. I still never get tired of it. I at least memorized all the lines from the movie and saw the features for over five times. I just love it so much it became apart of me. The casting in the movie was superb. Sissy Spacek was excellent as Carrie White. I thought she was perfect. She showed so much emotion, hurt ,and anger that I really felt sorry for her. Piper Laurie was very scary as Margret White. She was such a religious freak that it made me almost want to kill her. Amy Irving was also great as Sue Snell. At the beginning she seemed mean but more throughout the film she was nice and she felt sorry for Carrie. Nancy Allen as Chris, she was such a bitch. I literally hated her I wanted Carrie to kill her at the beginning of the film. John Travolta as Billy Nolan he was dumb and cute at the same time. I really liked him in this film. William Katt as Tommy Ross, he was nice. He was such a gentleman to Carrie that I really liked him. P.J. Soles as Norma Watson, I hated her as much as Chris. She was like a little sidekick with Chris. She was always wearing that red baseball cap that it drove me nuts. Brian DePalma is a genius. This film was so great, I'm so glad he directed an Oscar nominated film that proves how talented he is. The special effects were amazing. I loved them. The score was tremendous! I want to get the soundtrack to it so bad. Overall the film is amazing and beautiful, if you haven't seen it I suggest that you should. So for me I LOVE CARRIE!",Carrie

The scene where Carries house burns down was amazing.The prom scene in the original was better than the one in the remake.Amy Irving was a better actress than Kandyse McClure.My favorite part is when Carrie comes home from the prom and the organ music is playing and her house is filled with candles.",Carrie

441,carriewlives,Book and Movie,10,11 July 2008,"This story has been my favorite for a very long time now. Whether it be the book or movie, both are told with an eerie yet sympathetic view. Carrie was an unfortunate character, an outcast by no fault of her own. Her parents had very strange and horrifying religious perspectives on life. And poor Carrie suffered the most from this. I think there's a little of her in all of us in one way or another. As a young girl in high school, I was made fun of by the popular kids. I'm not saying I didn't have friends because I did, but on the whole everyone feels like they don't belong. The movie was very well done. The roles of Carrie and her mother were nominated for Oscars, which at that time, for a movie categorized as a horror film(which it wasn't) was unheard of. Sissy Spacek definitely earned that role. For all the die hard fans of the story like me, I strongly suggest the T.V. remake done in 2002, starring Angela Bettis in the lead. I'm looking for the ultimate T-shirt based on this story lol. This movie gets a rating of 10/10 from me, but if I could vote higher it would rate above 100.",Carrie

Then, she gets whacked to death in the belly with something that swung from the ceiling. This never made any sense to me. If Miss Collins had to die in the film, she should have died more heroically, and not as a villain who emulated the school-girls' hatred for Carrie. Miss Collins' character is completely ""out"" of the character that was developed during the whole film. I haven't read Stephen King's book, and I suspect the screenwriter for the film was given license to create what he/she wanted to. However, it always disturbed me that Miss Collins laughs at Carrie's fate. Also, in this scene are overdubbed verses of how the principal called her ""Cassie"", making Miss Collins as venal and uncaring as the principal. Can someone explain the reason for this?",Carrie

Sissy Spacek gives an excellent performance as Carrie, a shy, naive, and beautiful teenage girl who was abandoned by her father and is bullied by the other girls at school. She lives with her mother who is devoutly religious, but whose understanding of God's will is warped by severe mental illness.When Carrie is invited to the prom, her mother forbids her to attend. However, Carrie defies her mother, failing to respect her prescient warning that everyone would laugh at her. At the prom, Carrie is further victimized by her cruel peers, after which she becomes the instrument of God's wrath. Many are killed. When Carrie returns home, her mother tries to murder her because she believes it is God's will. God gives Carrie the strength to defend herself and kill her mother, suggesting that even severe mental illness does not excuse sin in God's eyes. In the end, Carrie is burned alive for her sins.Many will cheer when characters who were mean or insensitive to Carrie suffer violent deaths. Some may even be pleased to see her mentally ill mother murdered. However, few will like seeing the very sympathetic main character also punished by God; I think this was a brave choice for a hollywood movie.",Carrie
451,masterlomusic,NOT A CLASSIC,2,14 October 2021,An absolute bore. Terrible acting. Horrifically boring plot. The climax is a terribly bland school prank. It's honestly hilariously bad for modern standards. Literally nothing happens for 95% of the movie.People rating it high must be boomers with nostalgia goggles.,Carrie

453,Blanco_11,"""Classic""",8,31 March 2007,"This movie is a classic and I loved every moment of this movie. Great acting. Anyone who doesn't like this movie (if there is anyone) can go f@#% themselves! I recommend this movie to anyone!It's creepy and eerie. Even the music is good! You will want to get into the TV screen and give Carrie a great, big hug. You'll feel sorry for her and hate her abusive and demented mother! This original movie is MUCH MUCH better than the Television remake. It has way better acting. I gave it a 8/10 because it was one of the creepiest movies ever but I kinda thought it was a little short. If u haven't seen this movie, go see it. You'll be glad you did.",Carrie
454,vikas-vvr,Sickening to the gut,3,16 April 2008,"I generally vote for movies and never comment or write a review. But this movie made me break my habit. I felt so sick and empty after watching it, I had to break my habit. One of the major reasons probably for such an emotional outburst would have to be the number of stars IMDb has bestowed upon it. Why this movie of all things? This movie does have its moments when the director is trying to showcase the character's powers, but miserably fails in developing any character. Reactions surprise you or leave you thinking what the hell is going on frequently in the movie. The movie leaves a lot of loose ends untied.I also found the acting quite uninspiring, especially from the protagonist. Blessed with a character to make a career out of, she delivers one of the most placid performances , I have seen.",Carrie
455,baur,Like all movies based on S. King - a flop,3,19 February 2002,"This movie is really bad. You can defend it with nostalgia, horror movie classic, Stephen King novel, but in truth - this is a bad movie. I don't regret I saw it, but I wish I would not have payed money for seeing it. It's the same with all the Stephen King movies - great novel, good idea for a movie - bad movie. (besides Stanley Kubrick's The Shining)",Carrie
456,rcherry10,Classic,8,18 May 2011,"In the 1976 movie Carrie, the main character, Carrie White is portrayed by Sissy Spacek. Carrie is abused by her mother, Margaret White (played by Piper Laurie), and bullied by kids at school. Carrie gets angry and uses her telekinetic powers to burn and kill everyone who has been complicit to her pain.Carrie's last name is the first hint to the audience of Carrie's purity. Her appearance and mannerisms continue this image. Carrie is innocent and naive, despite the prevalent culture of the 1970's. Margaret White wears clothing that is reminiscent of early Puritans. However, her voluminous red hair fits the image of a witch more readily than a Puritan.The setting of this movie could be any town in the U.S. There are really no distinguishing factors to the location. In a horror movie, this generic location is important. Viewers must feel that something similar could happen right around the corner, or even to them.Most of this movie is shot from a third-person perspective. There are a few close-ups that could be seen as a change in perspective so that the viewer is looking through Carrie's eyes; when Carrie and Tommy vote for themselves as Prom King and Queen, and when Carrie is reading about telekinesis. At the end of the movie, the viewer is shown a kaleidoscope view through Carrie's eyes of people laughing. This view is meant to show the viewer that Carrie has had a mental break; she is no longer in touch with reality. The viewer can see that Carrie thinks everyone is laughing, when most are not.The religious symbolism is everywhere in Carrie's home, from the basic architecture of the home to the pictures on the walls. Scenes shot inside the home of Carrie are dark, even the scene where Carrie walks in to find hundreds of candles burning. The only scene in the house that is not dark is when Carrie's mother is planning to kill Carrie. The lights are suddenly turned on in this scene. The movie makes frequent reference to blood and a red hue is used extensively in the final scenes. Along with menstrual blood comes power: the power to control things, the power to attract men, the power to control men, power to compete with other women, power that attracts negativity from other women, and lastly great power of destruction. The protagonist, Chris, is sexually promiscuous and frequently licks her lips at the thought of blood. Carrie is pure and the blood scares her.The scene where Carrie is dancing with Tommy makes use of interesting camera angles. The camera looks up at the two of them, elevating them in the viewer's eyes. The camera spins as do the dancers. The effect is almost fun-house. The viewer is brought more into the movie and made to relate more to what Carrie is going through at that moment. She is so happy that it is dizzying. Every time Carrie uses her telekinetic powers, there is a sound in the background that is reminiscent of the noise in Psycho before someone dies. This allusion to Hitchcock continues with the back-lit image of Chris' hands on the rope. The technique that is used is clearly the same as is used in the shower scene of Psycho. The combination of incredible acting, meticulous sets, great dialog and character development make this a classic film. The issues that it raises are still relevant today.",Carrie
457,snittyjibber,An unsettling piece,8,26 November 2003,"This film made an immediate impact on me when I first saw it over 13 years ago, and it inspired me to read the book. Despite some inconsistencies (name and location changes) the basic premise of the film remained true to the original Stephen King novel. Here we have a female teenage outcast, bullied mercilessly throughout her school career by uncaring classmates, who for one brief shining moment finds her 'place in the sun', only to be brought down in one horrific act which sets in motion a terrifying chain of events.Possible spoilers on the way:The film itself is a wonderful time capsule, and the retro, '70's feel certainly adds to its appeal. The fashions, the cinematography (split screens, trippy camera angles), the somewhat stilted acting from some of the cast members and the music - a particularly bouncy snippet of was utilised in the disappointing 'sequel' - all contribute to the film's special character. Piper Laurie's shrill, repeated cry ""they're all going to laugh at you!"" at the film's defining point prior to Carries 'moment', coupled with Carrie's reactions are still disturbing and poignant when viewed today.A couple of issues though, the early scenes in the girls showers were a real eye opener (I almost expected to see Bo Derek splashing around in a corner, ala '10'), while the Hollywood tendency to cast actors well above the age of the characters they played was glaringly obvious here, in the prom scenes some of the male extras were moustached or even balding!As others have commented, Carries disposal of Miss Collins is also disturbing, her only 'fault' was allowing herself to be swept up in the cacophony of laughter prior to Carrie's holocaust.Overall, ""Carrie"" is an unsettling piece, dealing with an all-to-familiar theme - teenage cruelty.",Carrie
458,worldcomingdown71,A great tale for everyone because everyone has been a Carrie at some point.,8,21 November 2013,"This is one of my favorite movies of Stephen King. It meant a lot more to me when I was in high school because I was not loved in high school by any means but I still enjoy watching it as an adult. The idea of having this secret ability especially something like telekinesis is awesome for lack of a better word. She had nobody to talk to but her telekinesis gave her something to distract her from all the hateful kids (and her mother). My distraction from high school was movies like this one. Anyway back to the film itself. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I find it hard to imagine somebody could be so traumatized by something they didn't really experience first hand. It's not like Sue was inside the gym dodging the swinging electrical wires, the flames, and the bodies. Yes she witnessed it but that is all. That would be like me having PTSD from watching a war from a distance. I'm sorry to ramble but I hate movies that end like like Friday the 13th. It really irks my taters. But don't get me wrong I love this movie and I recommend everyone to see it at least once.",Carrie
459,KoraySackan,Carrie and Religions,8,16 January 2017,"When we look at what caused Carrie to become a monster, we can easily find plenty of valid reasons: conservative, authoritarian and despot characteristic of the mother, the cruelty of her friends, thoughtlessness of her teachers and more... Actually, she is an innocent, unfortunate girl. Let's think of the tragic event happened to her at the beginning of the film. She has no fault but not being informed about her body. The mother and religion(s), however, should be blamed. There is a clear message about that: Religions and conservatism make us ignorant about our nature.Likewise, when we think of the other tragic event at the end of the film, Carrie still has no fault. In other words, considering the reasons behind it, the prom massacre is almost understandable and even satisfying. If we had that power, how many of us could think about the death of an innocent teacher, Miss Collins, in such circumstances?",Carrie
460,tbradley35,not Shlock horror more..masterpiece in a league of its own,10,24 June 2004,"seriously Depalma pulls out all the stops for this emotional roller-coaster ride of pre teen angst, telekinetic shocker. Certain horror films are subjected too and are evaluated by there genre. I believe this film breaks the mold and still holds onto it's crown as the original in every way..!!!!!! i.e. Exorcist another 10 out of 10 for diff reasons!!!! the shining claustrophobic and intense and lastly the Omen gr8 all rounder.What separates this from the rest is the art direction,fantastic score,Cohens script,editing,direction and lastly the conviction of the actors and their interpretation of their roles....noticeably Sissey Spacek & Piper Laurie (both nominated for academy awards for this film unheard of for horror, although Sissey was up against Faye Dunaway for Network another gr8 actress although I truly do believe Spacek deserved the Oscar) but also the rest of the cast.Spacek blows the screen away (fantastic actress)much respect and Laurie too...Lastly thanks to Brian Depalma for visualising & producing such a fab film (how proud must he have been)and the whole cast and crew for a real treat a classic that still stands up today the DVD and the extras is fantastic i recommend everyone goes and buys this formidable piece of work....Sorry without mentioning the originator of this would be sacrilegious much much much respect and gratitude goes to Stephen King...you are a genius....thank you",Carrie
461,Lkiddo0,prove that one actor can make the movie to a masterpiece,8,22 January 2014,"For me this movie was a little masterpiece. That is what I miss in the horror/thriller movies from this time. Today they try to scare you with unexpected demons or monsters who wants to kill the girl blah blah. But movies like Carrie are the really scary one. I never saw a movie like that. I was very scared by the acting of Sissy Spacek. From one to hundred she turns her face from angel too Satan himself. And this is what I mean, movies like that who give you a disturbed feeling are the real scary ones for me. It's very sad that Sissy Spacek didn't won the Oscar for best actress 1977 she really deserved it cause the movie wouldn't be that great without her.",Carrie
462,sofiapap1999,'Carrie' is definitely a masterpiece!!!!,10,23 December 2013,"I saw 'Carrie' one month ago,and i totally loved it.I'm a huge fan of horror films and and i have to admit 'Carrie' is one of my favorites movies. The story is about Carrie White,a shy girl who constantly gets bullied by her classmates and she is not helped by her over-religious,paranoic mother.Her classmates tease her about her oddness and her naivety.After she unexpectedly has her first period,she is teased by the girl more than before.The gym teacher punishes the girls who were involved , but Chris isn't sorry and she got banned from the prom.Then,Chris creates an evil plan to get revenge from poor Carrie. 'Carrie'is based on the novel of the amazing Stephen King and directed by Brian DePalma.It was released on 1976 and it was a commercial success.Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were the first actresses to be nominated for an Academy Award in a horror film.'Carrie' is definitely a masterpiece.Sissy Spacek as Carrie White gives an extraordinary performance of the poor,shy Carrie while Piper Laurie is chilling as Margaret , Carrie's over-religious mother.If you are looking for a frightening horror film with amazing portrayals , then you should check 'Carrie'!",Carrie

465,xtruecreaturex,From Prom Night to Blood Bath,8,4 December 2015,"It's the night of her senior prom, and Carrie White and her date, Tommy have just been crowned as the prom royalty. As she waves to the crowd, Carrie finally feels accepted by her peers. But suddenly, a bucket of pig's blood is dumped on her, and the bucket falls on Tommy's head and knocks him unconscious. She imagines everyone is laughing at her, it was all a trick. She'll make them pay; they will all pay for what they did to her.Carrie employs the conventions of both the supernatural thriller and the Shakespearean tragedy in order to illustrate the misguidedness and futility of religion. By portraying Carrie as an outcast, the film argues that though not inherently bad, even an ultimate good like religion can be a bad thing if taken too far. Finally, the film wants its audience to be wary of the pitfalls of not living in moderation, and just how far the influence of one person can go.All in all, this film was fantastically executed, and still carries both a good message and a good story for modern viewers. It's easy to get lost in the film so long as you can look past the 70's clothes and cheesy special effects. The acting is also surprisingly good. Sissy Spacek is able to play an extremely convincing outcast, and Piper Laurie is able to play her psychotic character in such a way that the audience sympathizes with her. My only real complaint with this film is the sound played whenever Carrie uses her powers gets kind of grating after a while. It does add a good sense of tension, but don't watch it if you have a headache",Carrie
466,rosetree_sj,An Evil Cosmology,8,11 October 2005,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! Carrie is perhaps the cruelest and most pessimistic depictions of female society on film. It is also brutally funny. Humor grounds the movie. It also disarms us, and makes the movie all the more powerful by juxtaposition. The horror is not in anything tangible, but in how horrible things act as metaphors for female society and its inner workings.I only caught the last half hour of the TV remake, but from what I saw, that version had Billy Nolan masterminding the prank with Chris being uncertain about carrying it out. This completely blows the dynamic of the original movie.One other thing I found very interesting about it is how the physical world, dream world and paranormal world must all be accepted as *true* for the final, dismal, message of the movie to come through. I actually find this movie too painful to watch.END SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",Carrie

470,seannayackeren,horror classic=fear of female sexuality?,10,16 April 2006,"this was not the first time i watched 'carrie,' nor will it be the last, not if i have anything to say about it. every time i see it i leave convinced this movie is a metaphor for man's fear of female sexuality and yet have done little to further this belief. the greatest evidence i find to support this belief is the correlation between carrie white finally getting her (much delayed) period, a sign she has become a woman, and the development of her telekinetic powers. previously lacking this skill, with the onset of her menstrual cycle it is only moments before carrie is flipping ashtrays and, soon after, obnoxious boys as the ride by on their bicycles. there's piper laurie's comment regarding how, eve was weak. had she been stronger perhaps she would not have tempted adam, which led to knowledge of themselves as sexual beings, and their banishment from eden. if carrie's mother had only been able to control her sexuality then perhaps she would not have engaged in premarital sex and none of this would have happened in the first place. where i find myself hung up is the significance of carrie being covered in pig's blood before all hell breaks loose. there's clearly something in the fact that she is drenched in the blood of a female animal, like a giant menstrual flow, and then finds herself incapable of controlling her own powers.",Carrie
