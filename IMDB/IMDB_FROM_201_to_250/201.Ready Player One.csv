0,TheLittleSongbird,"Ready, set, go in the oasis",6,30 April 2018,"Watched 'Ready Player One' as someone who got a lot of pleasure out of the book and who loves a lot of Steven Spielberg's previous work. Despite it getting a fair share of criticism from fans of the book, that there were also enough good things said about it from critics and that many of my friends said it was worthwhile persuaded me enough to see it. 'Ready Player One' left me with a mixed view (or just slightly above). As a book adaptation 'Ready Player One' is severely wanting, having lost what made the book so special. As a film on its own, which is how it will be judged by me being a much fairer way to judge, 'Ready Player One' is quite decent though with faults. It is nowhere near being one of Spielberg's best, a distinction he has not hit for a while (though for me he has not sold out), at the same time it is not one of his misfires either. To me 'Ready Player One' is a middling effort.Starting with its good merits, 'Ready Player One' looks incredible. One of those films where one is truly immersed in a world filled with a non-stop sense of wonder. The Oasis depiction is rich in wonder, adventure, vibrancy and imagination, the cool factor is also high. The special effects are pretty spectacular. Alan Silvestri provides the best score in a Spielberg film since 'War Horse' (and one of the best in the past fifteen years or so), providing a lot of energy and thrills. Nostalgia is rife with inspired cameos of numerous significant cultural characters, like the 'Jurassic Park' dinosaur and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even more numerous cultural references, highlights being the 'Back to the Future' Delorean and the Overlook Hotel from 'The Shining'. There is enough wit and intrigue in the writing and the story has many instances where it is fun and laden in thrills, the chase scenes especially. Particularly standing out is the one switching between real world and the Oasis. Spielberg delivers on the spectacle, the world building and the visual style. Although not complex or subtle, the characters are engaging enough. Olivia Cooke is very appealing and shares charming chemistry with Tye Sheridan. Simon Pegg is great fun, while Ben Mendelssohn has a whale of a time as the villain and Mark Rylance beautifully and terrifically provides the emotion and soul that is not quite there elsewhere. However, the story does tend to be lacking. There is just too little structurally in a very long, too long even, running time, no matter how many cultural references there are. With trying to take on a lot, character depth and development are sacrificed in favour of spectacle and nostalgia. Luckily those are done well, but one does wish that the characters were more interesting with the lead character in particular not having much growth.This does affect somewhat Tye Sheridan's performance, shining in the chemistry with Cooke but elsewhere it's somewhat bland and cold. The script does have wit and intrigue but it can also be exposition heavy, and it is here where the writing feels rambling, unnatural and clumsy. There are aspects of Spielberg's directing that comes over well.Unfortunately, what doesn't is the complete command of the material and giving the film enough soul and emotion (Rylance cannot bring those qualities out all on his own, no matter how well he did them). Some of the messaging is heavy-handed and the finale is far too overly-sentimental and where the sketchiness of the character development and overall depth is most betrayed.Overall, diverting and entertaining enough but was expecting more. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Ready Player One
1,bkoganbing,The most important game of his life,6,20 January 2019,"I have to marvel at the computer graphics that Steven Spielberg used in creating
Ready Player One. Sad to say I am not of the gaming generation, the fascination
of playing these games hours on end is totally lost to me. My ignorance of these
matters makes it hard to follow the plot in something like this. For instance the
Matrix series. I've watched those films and I haven't reviewed them because I'm
not sure of what I watched. This was a bit better.In 2045 the world is really a rotten place and folks like young Tye Sheridan have retreated into their own cyber world called The Oasis. It's where with
avatars they can play their own games and win and lose in a much more interesting place than the Columbus, Ohio of the near future.Sheridan is now playing in the most important game of his life. At stake is
the ownership/patent of the Oasis created by eccentric Bill Gates type billionaire Mark Rylance. It's like Willy Wonka willing his Chocolate Factory to
a lucky kid. But this is much bigger stakes.This film is more than half in animation when Sheridan meets some of his
cyber friends once again as they all compete looking for prizes in the cyber
world called Easter Eggs. Get three and he's a winner.Sheridan does meet his friends again in the cyber world and in the real one.
He also has to fight in both.What the attraction is I don't know. But I'm happy that at the end, the world
gets a shot of needed reality.",Ready Player One
2,Leofwine_draca,The film equivalent of watching someone else playing a video game...,3,23 January 2020,"Steven Spielberg's latest cinematic exercise is the equivalent of watching somebody else playing a computer game: in other words, not very interesting at all. I thought he would've learnt a few lessons with his bland Tintin adaptation, but it seems not because READY PLAYER ONE feels like one of his worst-ever movies. It's a bland and soulless virtual reality adventure in which a mundane hero plays game to defeat the usual cliched big business corporate interest bad guys. Not at all predictable, then.Spielberg fills his movie with pop culture references, which is mildly interesting I guess, but fails to make any of it entertaining for a second. The CGI animation I found to be quite shallow and insubstantial, with the same big-span battle sequences playing out over and over again that we've seen countless times in other Hollywood movies. I was longing for something more real-world and realistic and I look forward to the day that Hollywood gives up on this kind of mindless hokum. To paraphrase Jeff Goldblum in JURASSIC PARK: just because they can do these FX movies, doesn't mean they should.",Ready Player One
3,SnoopyStyle,great action adventure after school special,6,6 May 2018,"It's 2045. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is a 17 year old orphan living with his aunt in the trailer park stacks in Columbus, Ohio. The world is obsessed with the virtual reality world of OASIS and Wade spends most of his time there as his avatar Parzival. The late founder of OASIS, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), left his company shares worth half a trillion dollars to the winner of a contest he designed. The first to find an egg after retrieving three keys is set to control OASIS with his shares. After years of lack of success, Wade and his OASIS friend Aech are some of the remaining Gunters obsessed with solving the impossible game. They are opposed by corporate head of IOI and Halliday's former intern, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), with his army of worker gamers called Sixers. As they continuously play the first challenge, Wade is joined by intriguing avatar Art3mis (Olivia Cooke).I'm not reading the book and I don't think it matters. There are some nagging issues with the underlying concepts. It's in need of a few tweaks. There are some greatness from master director Steven Spielberg but it is a flawed movie. There is no denying that it is a visually sensational action adventure. Spielberg's skills are superior although this movie is a bit of a modern references scattershot. Like Goro turning into Alien, it's a lot of recognizing familiar iconic images without it meaning anything. The only truly compelling reference is The Shining. The characters are allowed to spend time in the place and it ends with a compelling lesson. That's the only well written story arc. All the rest have some sort of flaws.The first test relies on a random quote from a lifetime with little overall meaning. It would be more likely to come across the solution by accident. After years of failure, somebody should be driving off the track. Just by a process of elimination, a Sixer would have driven in reverse once. As for Sorrento, he is both omnipotent and ruthless. He's willing to kill. He has massive computer power to track down anybody. After capturing Samantha, the obvious move for him is to torture her for information on Wade and all his friends. After killing one, killing more is no hurdle. It's like Sorrento's character arc went back a step. He needs to kill off the five and tension could be build by killing them one at a time. I was perplexed by Daito and Sho's first inclusion but at least, I thought that they would make good plot devices or at a minimum, cannon fodder. The last thing I thought that they would be useful is as a real world Scooby gang. As for Wade's speech to rally the OASIS world, it should have happened sooner right after IOI blow up the trailer park. I kept waiting for Wade to call in an avatar press conference where he exposes his real identity and IOI's murder spree. Also, there is Samantha's god-awful ugly face. Yah, right. It's played up so much and yet it's only a Gorbachev birthmark. It misses a big point about that issue. She could easily cover it up with heavy makeup. Another thing, is Sorrento's big evil plan about pop up ads? Recent developments at Facebook show what actual damage to the social order looks like. This is kiddie writing by comparison in imagining the worst case scenario. In many ways, that's the problem. This could have been a deeper social commentary but it is mostly trying to be a fun videogame story. The final lesson is to go out and smell the flowers. It is the easiest and cheesiest of after school special. That's the level of the script.",Ready Player One
4,Horst_In_Translation,Ready audience go,6,11 April 2018,"""Ready Player One"" is the newest work by famous director Steven Spielberg. This 2018 movie is pretty long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, but it never drags and that means quite something. It plays a bit in the future when the world is dominated by a virtual reality video game that is basically another world named Oasis. We follow the main character Wade in there as he tries to find three priceless keys that would make him the ruler of Oasis. On the path to that, he meets many other characters, makes friends and enemies and eventually ends up on a path where he has to make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. The film is a mix of live action and animation and that is nothing new for Spielberg, even if this film takes of course a completely different approach compared to Tintin and Milou a few years ago. The story is really good at times, but the best thing for me is certainly the grand number of film and video game references and I probably only got half of them. My personal favorite was perhaps the Shining reference, also because the character was so funny with not knowing what was gonna happen next as he has never seen the movie. The very brief Ryu Street Fighter reference was gold too of course. And there is so much more. It almost feels like a cyber version of The Goonies or other traditional kids/teenager movies with slightly older characters.Sadly there were also some things I did not like as much. One would be that the love story felt a bit forced and that I felt the two did not have great chemistry. The parallel between the two and the genius and his love interest was a bit cringeworthy at times too. But that should not take away from how stunning Olivia Cooke is or from how memorable her digital self is in here. I have a feeling people 20 years from now will still talk about that character if they talk about anything from the animated parts. And maybe there were a bit too many action sequences at the end (in the last quarter) and a bit more subtlety instead of explosions could have helped. But it wasn't too bad and that is just my subjective opinion. It still takes only very little away from the film's quality and finally one criticism could be that in my opinion there really was not one single moment that really had me hold my breath I must admit.I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the book by Ernest Cline, but I heard that it is pretty amazing, so I am not too sure if I can be a judge here in terms of how well it was adapted, but it's always nice for me to see the writer of the book also being the one who wrote the screenplay or at least one of several who did. The cast here did a pretty fine job overall, there is not one that made a negative impact, but I think that Oscar winner Mark Rylance really won me over here once again with his excellent performance. He sure made the most of what he was given and is a joy to watch in every scene he is in. What a chameleon. I also spent a great deal of time here wondering about who the other virtual reality characters would be in real life and what they would be like compared to their virtual selves. But as they solved this issue quickly, they made sure that it would not get in the way of the key story here of good vs evil with the bad guy being a bit too much on his own at times and he reminded me of the one in Matrix, only that he may not have been as competent. In general, that huge company was pretty foolish and incompetent really for making it to number two in the world.So yeah, the film may have its flaws, but I still think it is closer to a ****/***** than to a **/*****. There is some great charm, many great video game and film references and all this makes it a really enjoyable watch. Maybe it is more the attention to detail and all these references than the core plot that eventually define it, but it doesn't matter anyway, because there is no way I won't give this a thumbs-down and I am genuinely curious where it can make an impact come next awards season. A must-see for all nerds who also enjoyed the likes of Scott Pilgrim etc. I very much recommend checking out Ready Player One and if Spielberg decides one day to make a sequel, then I will probably watch it too hoping it can keep the quality from this one here. I think it's possible as Spielberg is really prolific right now, even if admittedly it felt a bit different to see him make a film like this with how much he focused on politics films recently. That's all now. Why are you still reading? Go watch the film.",Ready Player One
5,Prismark10,Game on,7,29 March 2018,"Steven Spielberg has been inspired by James Cameron's use of 3D in Avatar as this is a film worth watching on 3D, with set pieces that are ready made for 3D viewing.Spielberg has also gone for a popcorn film full of cultural references to the 1970s and 80s. If you are a vintage arcade geek, a gamer or love 1980s film, this is the film for you.You can glimpse Batman, Robocop, the Tardis, Chucky the doll, King Kong. There are references to Back to the Future, Star Trek and Spielberg sends a affectionate note to one of his idols, Stanley Kubrick.Set in 2045, the world has gone to pot and the population immerse themselves in the virtual world of the Oasis. In Columbus, Ohio; Wade Watts is living in a hell hole called the Stacks with his aunt. He finds a key to an adventure left by the late designer of the Oasis. Wade with his virtual friends have to race to against a ruthless corporation to gain further keys which gives the winner the ownership of the virtual kingdom.The characters are thinly sketched, Wade does come across as naive, displaying a person who has spent more time in a virtual world than real one. The plot is straightforward, nothing very much deep here.Spielberg has infused the film with lots of fun and action. However at times it is too simplistic. When the police show up at the end of the movie, you do wonder where they were for the rest of the time as the bad guys seem to have the real world all to themselves. The villain must have a really bad memory if he needs to write THAT password down on a piece of paper.",Ready Player One
6,claudio_carvalho,"For Fans of CGI, Videogame and Pop Culture",7,24 June 2018,"""Ready Player One"" is a film for fans of CGI, videogame and pop culture. In 1982, ""TRON"" was a magic film for a generation not familiar with virtual world and other cyber concepts, causing a great impact. ""Ready Player One"" does not offer the same impact and is tiresome in many moments but entertains youngster and open-minded older people. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jogador Nº 1"" (""Player #1"")",Ready Player One
7,nogodnomasters,I'm not disappointed.,8,20 May 2018,"Several decades into the future, the world has become obsessed with a game that has many different worlds to play in. If you die playing, you go back to step one and lose everything that you have accumulated. The deceased designer has created a contest within the game where the person who solves the clues gets control of the game and the half trillion dollar empire. Needless to say, corporations play the game. The film centers on Wade Watts of Columbus Ohio. He has a group of on-line friends as they attempt to find the keys and clues. After he gets the first key, he draws attention to himself and not all in a good way. The film is also a love story. I loved the graphics in the game, more so in the beginning than end. My main criticism of the film is that it is aimed at kids but drops the F-word. Spielberg did this in ""Super 8"" also, I am not sure why he feels he needs to do this. It certainly did add anything to either film. Good classic rock soundtrack plus Bee Gees. If you want to see a more adult film, ""2047 Virtual Revolution"" I found entertaining.",Ready Player One
8,kosmasp,Game mountain,7,30 July 2018,"Which is what ""Spiel Berg"" means translated from German into English. I guess there is a joke in there concerning the movie too. But back to this one and a first confession: I have not read the book, so my review but more importantly my rating are ""free"" from any knowledge or background of that. Of course I am aware of many of the references in the movie, being a gamer myself, but also a massive fan of movies.Even so, I could not spot all of them and I'm pretty sure many out there have the same ""problem"". So if you want all of them, you probably have to watch the movie again. It might not fit in well with some of the story elements (very cliche), but it will help to keep an eye out for the references. Although for some you may want to google and find out when they come up (blink and you'll miss them).The movie itself is well made, but you knew that with Spielberg on the helm. Even if you were surprised him doing a movie like that, it still makes sense. Life is a game then ... or may become one. There is surely a lesson there somewhere ;o)",Ready Player One
9,lee_eisenberg,Was the book about the characters or the pop culture references?,5,5 April 2018,"I've never read the book on which Steven Spielberg's ""Ready Player One"" is based. I had never heard of it until I heard that Spielberg was making the movie. It's half pop culture references (much of it sensory overload, especially since I saw it in 3D), half story of a gamer taking on the CEO.It's nothing profound or complex, but if you like seeing a lot of Easter eggs from the past few decades - both cinema and music - then you'll probably enjoy it.",Ready Player One
10,jboothmillard,Ready Player One,6,7 April 2018,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was fascinated by the amount of pop culture characters and references I could spot, reading more into it, it looked and sounded like something right up my street, so I went to the cinema with high expectations, directed by Steven Spielberg (Indiana Jones, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, The BFG). Basically in the year 2045, much of Earth has become slum-like cities, so most of the population escape the desolation, entering the virtual reality world of the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), where they can be and do whatever they want, engaging in numerous activities for work, education and entertainment. The brilliant and eccentric creator of the OASIS, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), passed away a year ago, before his death he left his immense fortune and total control of the OASIS hidden within the immersive realm. There is a worldwide contest called Anorak's Quest, that Halliday designed to find a worthy heir, the first to find the Easter Egg, finding the three keys and following the clues, will inherit the wealth, and gain full ownership of the OASIS, among other gifts. This has garnered thousands to play the game, including ""Gunters"" (""egg hunters""), and video game conglomerate and virtual reality manufacturer Innovative Online Industries (IOI), its CEO Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) has a mass army of players known as Sixers (due to their six-digit identification) seeking to claim the prize. However, to date, no one has managed to finish the first quest, a vehicle race across an ever-shifting version of New York City, because when you are killed in the game world, you will lose everything you have earned in your character progression. In the slums of Columbus, Ohio, living with his aunt, is an orphaned Gunter, 18-year-old Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), in the OASIS his avatar is Parzival, his best friend is male avatar Aech (Lena Waithe), who serves as a virtual mechanic, he later befriends well-known player Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), he saves her from being ""zeroed out"" by King Kong. Wade decides to study the virtual OASIS library and archives to learn about Halliday's personal life, hoping to find a hint to finish the race, he watches footage of Halliday regretfully accepting the resignation of his partner Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg), Wade notices Halliday saying to ""go backwards really fast, as fast as you can"". So at the next race, Wade reverses from the start line, finding a hidden, safe path beneath the race track, going under all the obstructions, including Kong, he reaches the finish line and gains the first key from Anorak, Halliday's avatar, and a clue to the next quest, Aech and Art3mis, as well as players Daito (Win Morisaki) and Sho (Philip Zhao) also follow the path to finishing, and the appear atop the global scoreboards, becoming known as the ""High Five"". IOI takes interest in them, desiring to learn their real-life identities, then bounty hunter i-R0k (T.J. Miller) overhears Wade tell Art3mis his real name, so Sorrento approaches Wade and attempts to convince him to join IOI to solve Anorak's Quest, but Wade refuses. Sorrento retaliates and has his assistant F'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen) attack Wade's slum, killing Wade's aunt Alice (Susan Lynch) and her boyfriend Rick (Ralph Ineson), while Wade is rescued by Art3mis' real-life friends and taken to a Gunter hideout, where he meets Art3mis' player, Samantha Cook. Working together, Wade and Samantha look at more archive footage of Halliday, they discover that Halliday and Morrow fell out because Halliday once dated Kira (Perdita Weeks), who later became Morrow's wife, then in the OASIS, Wade wins a bet with The Curator, Morrow's avatar, and gains access to Kira's memories, leading to the second quest, as well as a special reward. Using the clue of a creator who hated his own work, they work out that they have to enter the world of The Shining, the Stanley Kubrick movie, hated by the creator of the original book, Stephen King, surviving this horror realm, the High Five each earn the second key and the clue to the final quest, which is located in Castle Anorak on Planet Doom. Zandor discovers the Gunter hideout and kidnaps Samantha, while Wade is rescued by the real-life players of Aech aka Helen, Daito and Sho, back in the OASIS they learn that IOI has erected a gigantic forcefield blocking access to the castle. Wade sends a message to all OASIS players about the activities of IOI, convincing many to join them to fight against IOI and the Sixers. Aech, Daito, and Sho lead the army of players, while Samantha is able to cause a distraction and shut down the field, allowing Wade to access inside Castle Anorak, where he sees that Sixers have found the Atari room. Sixers are trying to determine which Atari 2600 game was Halliday's favourite, choosing and completing the wrong one leads to one being zeroed out, Sorrento and Wade recognise the right game is Adventure, but Sixers who successfully complete the game are still zeroed out. Sorrento activates the Cataclyst, which zeroes out all players on Planet Doom, but the Curator's reward is revealed to be an extra life, allowing Wade's avatar to survive and continue the quest. Wade deduces that the goal is not to win Adventure, but to find its own Easter Egg, upon doing so, he is given the last key, Wade uses the three keys to open a gate in the castle. When it opens he is congratulated by Anorak, who presents Wade with a contract to sign, but Wade recognises it as the one Morrow signed on his termination, he turns it down, the avatar of Anorak transforms into a projection of Halliday, who reveals that this was a final test, one that centred on his biggest regret in life. Halliday shows Wade the Big Red Button, which will wipe out the OASIS, if he feels that is for the best, and awards him with the Easter Egg, transferring control of the OASIS to Wade, he questions if the projection of Halliday is actually him and is he is really dead. In the end, Sorrento and Zandor are arrested, IOI is heavily restructured, Wade opts to share the OASIS fortune with the other members of the High Five, Morrow offers his consultation for a small fee, the High Five decide to have the OASIS shut down for two days in a week, to coax people to spend more time in the real world, while Wade and Samantha start a romantic relationship and move in together. Also starring Clare Higgins as Mrs. Gilmore and Black Panther's Letitia Wright as Reb (Safe House). Pop culture references featured and mentioned that I recognised and spotted included: Spider-Man, King Kong, Freddy Krueger, The Iron Giant, the DeLorean time machine from Back from the Future, KITT from Knight Rider, The A-Team, Batman, the Tyrannosaurus Rex from Jurassic Park, King Kong, TRON, Last Action Hero, Stars Wars, Alien, Beetlejuice, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Superman, Star Trek, Michael Jackson: Thriller, The Shining, Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, Chucky the killer doll, RoboCop, Godzilla, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but there are plenty more. The performances are all good, especially Sheridan as the young hero, and Mendelsohn relishes being the corporate villain, for many this could be considered ""nerd porn"", something for all the geeks who love to spot all the recognisable things in the worlds of movies, television, music and games, but at the heart of it, there are also fantastic characters you actually care about, a terrific engaging story, and brilliant special effects to bring the chases, battles and action sequences to life, it only has slight predictability, there is something for everyone, a fabulously vibrant, fun and enjoyable science-fiction adventure.

11,BA_Harrison,As bad as War of the Worlds.,2,8 April 2018,"There was a time when a Steven Spielberg movie virtually guaranteed a great time, but more recently he's either concentrated on Oscar bait, or delivered mainstream entertainment that has seriously missed the mark (War of the Worlds, Crystal Skull). Ready Player one is his most disappointing film yet, a loud, garish assault on the senses with a derivative plot (Avatar meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), a glut of headache-inducing CGI-laden action scenes, and countless references to pop culture that will probably fly over the heads of many an audience (especially the younger viewers).Based on the New York Times bestseller by Ernest Cline, the film is set in the year 2045 and stars Tye Sheridan (Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse) as Wade Watts, who, like most of the world's population, escapes the drudgery of reality by immersing himself in the virtual world of Oasis. Wade, as avatar Parzival, takes part in a contest created by Oasis's creator Halliday (Mark Rylance), the winner of which will be given complete control of the popular online playground. As the first to solve stage one of the game, Parzival comes to the attention of powerful corporation IOI, who are dedicated to finding the ultimate prize: a hidden 'easter egg'. What follows is a breakneck rampage through the various digital environments of Oasis, with 90% of the action consisting of computer generated characters, none of which possesses the excitement or tension of a real-life movie.Spielberg seems to have completely forgotten how to tell a coherent story, his film a mess of ideas that prove difficult to follow, hindered by an orgy of chaotic, colourful visuals that do little to aid comprehension. There are also several comedic moments that fall incredibly flat. It's hard to believe that this is from the same man who gave us timeless classics Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park.",Ready Player One
12,paul_haakonsen,Quite worth watching...,7,3 July 2018,"I had very little expectations for this movie, especially since the ones I know who watched it said that it wasn't all that spectacular. Well, I got the chance to sit down and watch ""Ready Player One"", had the time to spare, so why not?I must say that I was surprised with the result of this movie, because it was actually rather entertaining. Sure, it had a predictable and generic storyline, but it was still entertaining enough for what it was.What really blew me away was the special effects and CGI. This was definitely spectacular, and there were so many details. I love the overwhelming amount of familiar characters that there were to be seen throughout the entire movie. There were so many pop culture characters and obscure characters that only true nerds of movies, gaming, comics, etc. would recognize. It was especially awesome to see Jason Voorhees and Spawn make appearances as avatars in the movie as well.There was a good flow to the movie and it kept its upbeat pace all the way to the very end, and that made for some entertaining stuff.I will say that the movie is worth watching again, not for the story or the special effects, but for picking out familiar characters used as Oasis avatars in the movie, that would be quite a task.All in all, ""Ready Player One"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch. And it had a lovely morale as well, and that being that people need to live their lives in the real life and not in an online illusion of a world.",Ready Player One
13,CinemaSerf,"""Enders Game"" seeks a glass elevator...",7,4 May 2020,"There is more than a passing resemblance to ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is this great looking sci-fi tale of a creative genius (Mark Rylance) who bequeaths his entire OASIS business empire to the gamer who can play the games, unlock the keys and solve the ultimate puzzle. I am neither a gamer, nor have I read Ernest Cline's novel upon which this is actually based - so can only speak from an entertainment perspective. It isn't a great film - the swapping between reality and avatar existences gets annoying after a while and Tye Sheridan as the hero ""Parzival"" is not Spielberg's best casting choice - he struggles to be convincing as either the nerdy geek or the sexy super-hero as he and sassy Olivia Cooke ""Art3mis"" determine to win this dream competition. Arch baddie Ben Mendelsohn is a sort of ""Cyber-Slugworth"" though without any real menace, from a rival company who is also trying to solve the puzzle that will hand him control of this industrial nirvana and as we see, will stop at ""virtually"" nothing to thwart their enterprise. It's end-to-end stuff and visual effects are superb but at 2 hours and 20, it is way too long for the two principal actors to spin out, despite some effort going into a decent soundtrack accompaniment.",Ready Player One

As his legacy he has left a puzzle that once solved will give the winner the OASIS and Halliday's shares in his company, worth $500 billion. A poverty-stricken teenager, Wade (in-game name Parzival), is determined to win the prize.Great sci fi drama, directed by Steven Spielberg. Highly plausible: the world Spiellberg creates could easily happen and you could easily see virtual reality experiences being how people live their lives and escape reality. The gamer world he portrays is quite accurate, from my own experiences.With this virtual world created, the plot we have in it is quite intriguing and cleverly crafted. There are times when it threatens to be TOO clever and become confusing, but any confusion is temporary as a bit of thinking clears things up.Good special effects, which you'd expect from Spielberg. Good pace, making for great entertainment.Only major negative is that the movie does degenerate into an action movie for a longish spell in the second half.

America's immediate Past, Present, and Future Political Wars are all mapped out in excruciating detail during READY PLAYER ONE, just waiting for viewers with Eyes That Can See.",Ready Player One
17,evanston_dad,Only Barely Resembles Novel,5,4 October 2018,"I can't imagine that anyone who read and liked Ernest Cline's dazzling novel could be satisfied with this film adaptation of it.Which is odd, since Cline co-adapted the screenplay. Maybe he wanted to avoid the trap of the movie never living up to its source, so he decided to take the thing in an entirely different direction so it would be harder to compare the two. In any case, what lives on the screen resembles the novel only in the barest of outlines. Gone is the cleverness of the novel and its geeky reverence for 1980s pop culture. In its place is a soulless attempt to recreate one of those adventure movies from that decade, like ""Goonies"" or ""Back to the Future,"" but without the sensibility to pull it off. Again, very odd given that the director of this film, Steven Spielberg, practically redefined the adventure sci-fi movie. But he feels like the wrong match for this material. The movie is like watching a movie about 80s nostalgia made by someone who doesn't feel it and is trying to manufacture it based on a guess as to what it might feel like.Mostly the film is just visually overwhelming. A bunch of visual effects artists vomit a bunch of CGI on to the screen to see what will stick, and the end result is to numb the audience into submission.Grade: C",Ready Player One
18,view_and_review,I was ready,7,16 April 2018,"Ready Player One was a brilliant movie about the impending digital future. The main setting was The Stacks in Columbus, Ohio 2045. Scratch that. The main setting was a virtual world called the Oasis; Columbus, Ohio was nothing more than the derelict real world that the main character, Wade, lived in. In this not-too-distant future there is gross overcrowding and real life sucks for just about everyone. No worries because just about everyone escapes this reality to a virtual reality called the Oasis. The Oasis is a virtually limitless digital world in which you can do just about anything and be just about anyone. It is the great escape. The founder and creator of this world died and left behind an Easter egg that--if found--makes the finder the sole owner and operator of the Oasis. Oh yeah, and they inherit the company worth $500B. No biggie. Of course everyone wants to find this Easter egg but the race for this Easter egg has real world consequences when a rival company will stop at nothing to win.One thing that made the movie fun and cool was the fact that they were in a virtual world. That's not new or unique but it made the CGI less obtrusive. Because they were in this virtual world you fully expect everyone and everything to look digitally generated which allows you to rate the graphics from a video game perspective as opposed to a movie perspective.Looking into the overall theme of the movie it was a bit sad though the movie never emitted a somber tone. People were happier spending their time in a virtual world being different people, different beings, different objects as opposed to being themselves doing things in the real world. There is very little that is sadder. The movie Surrogates with Bruce Willis explore this same theme in a different manner.But going back to RPO (that's Ready Player One, not the football term run-pass-option), I couldn't help but feel sorry for everyone in the movie as they frolicked around their digital paradise. They're lives were so inextricably linked to their avatar and the Oasis that virtual losses made them react demonstrably in real life. That is quite scary!The truth is we may not be too far from that as a reality. As it is we spend a lot of time in a digital world. Whether it's video games, social media, or other entertainment we are dominated by the digital world. So how big of a leap is it to have an ubiquitous virtual universe where everyone co-mingles? Your brother is in China, husband in Afghanistan, kids in college... no worry, strap on your VR glasses, put on your VR suit and meet with them on the moon, or middle earth or wherever. It could happen. But for now we'll settle for an exciting movie about it.",Ready Player One
19,ferguson-6,Easter egg hunt with goggles,6,5 April 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. While there is a massive target audience for Steven Spielberg's return to fantasy adventure filmmaking, I am most certainly not part of that esteemed group. Although I very much enjoy throwbacks and tributes, I haven't touched a video game controller in 3 decades, and of course have not read Ernest Cline's popular novel - the source material that inspired Mr. Spielberg to veer from his recent heavy dramas (the exception being THE BFG). Still, being a movie lover, I couldn't help but be intrigued by the project.
Seemingly a match made in Virtual Reality heaven, we get one of the premier fantasy filmmakers joining forces with a screenwriter (Zak Penn) who has had success with comic book adaptions, and a bestselling first novel from a geeky author. Fascinating to watch, the film plays like Mr. Spielberg's $175 million personal toy box. There is a story, though one could argue it exists solely for the purpose of pushing the visual FX envelope. A Steve Jobs-type guru named Halliday (Mark Rylance) designed a 3-part contest of skill and strategy with the grand prize being full control over OASIS - a virtual world that allows the players to be anyone or anything they desire. Since Halliday's death, most people in this dystopian future of the year 2045 spend their waking hours immersed in OASIS. Some use it as an escape from their bleak lives, while others are attempting to solve the mysteries of the 3 keys.Set in Columbus, Ohio, which we are informed is the fastest growing city in the world (why??), there are two factions vying for the grand prize: true gamers/gunters and megacorporation IOI being run by corporate villain Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Tye Sheridan (MUD) stars as Wade Watts, whose avatar is Parzival, one of the more thoughtful characters. Olivia Cooke (THOROUGHBREDS) plays Ar3mis, a rebel gunter (egg hunter) out more for revenge than victory. They are part of a group of misfits who label themselves 'High-Five', even though Parzival gets left hanging every time. Near non-stop action and relentless pacing result in a whirlwind of lights and colors and visuals that are mixed with more 1980's pop culture references than anyone could possibly catch in one viewing. As a primer, you should brace yourself for a key role from THE IRON GIANT (1999), as well as various appearances and nods to TRON, BACK TO THE FUTURE, Freddie Krueger, Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY, the Holy hand grenade (Monty Python), the infamous Big Foot monster truck, a speeding DeLorean, the 1960's era Batmobile, that hideous A-Team van, Christine from CHRISTINE (1983), John Hughes, King Kong, BEETLEJUICE, and a personal favorite, Buckaroo Bonzai. It's also a kick to see the Rubik renamed Zemeckis Cube. The most stunning sequence for this old geezer was the virtual recreation of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980), especially the focus on Room 237. It's these kind of nostalgic injections that prevent it from coming across as an overblown CGI spectacle with VR goggles.Others in the cast (more time as voices than real people) include Lena Waithe (""Master of None""), TJ Miller as a bounty hunter with some of the film's best one-liners, Simon Pegg as Halliday's former business partner, and Phillip Zhao as Sho. Surely you've figured out that this one isn't about the cast. OASIS is where your imagination rules and Easter eggs are driving plot lines. Alan Silvestri takes over the music from usual Spielberg collaborator John Williams, and delivers one of my favorite references (and one of the oldest) in the film - Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski must have been exhausted by the time filming was complete, though we can't always tell what was filmed and what was created in the lab. Spielberg is a master manipulator when it comes to nostalgia, though we can't help but wonder if he is making a statement with this being the next evolution as our society becomes ever-more-involved with their phones and personal devices. At least maybe some kid will leave this film with a greater appreciation of research.",Ready Player One
20,bombersflyup,"Watchable, nothing more.",4,31 July 2019,"Ready Player One has a grand premise, but fails to connect and the characters aren't memorable.It's a wild ride, but it's a popcorn flick without reflection. There isn't much from my childhood in terms of nostalgia, which is what I thought would be the case when it first came out and my reason for not watching it then. The music's stuff you've heard a million times and isn't good. The avatar's more engaging than the humans and part of the reason the film gets worse as it goes on. Mendelsohn's character Sorrento's completely cartoonish.",Ready Player One
21,trashgang,not for me but the 3D was stunning,7,16 April 2019,"Took me a while to see this one but my wife saw it on a plane and said it was okay. I waited so long because the further we go into Spielberg movies the less I do like them. They are more ane more into a Disney fairytale. But when my father-in-law presented this on 3D to watch I did give it a try.Starts off rather good with a lot of action going on, espescially the race with all those features that you will recognise when you are into gaming. But once that was over I didn't get a grip on this flick. It just didn't got my attention. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad but it isn't vintage Spielberg for me.But they also told me to watch in in 3D because it do adds and I agree. Due computer animation they were able to exaggerate the 3D effects. They were stunning. Especially when they are in the virtual world. But again, I will forget this movie rather quickly for a Spielberg flick.But teens will love this and gamers will love this, that I can assure you.Gore 0/5
