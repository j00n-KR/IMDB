0,nogodnomasters,Everafter,4,19 July 2021,"This film concentrates on Texas for the purge. Mexicans work for rich ranchers who must fight against the ""Everafter"" group that wants a white America (Make America White Again). They are purging the ranchers and anyone of brown skin color.Interesting and timely. Clearly the 1/6 insurrection inspired the film. I couldn't get into the characters.Guide; F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Forever Purge
1,jboothmillard,The Forever Purge,5,30 July 2021,"The series began with a home invasion movie, sequel Anarchy expanded the universe to see outside, Election Year continued the franchise, and prequel The First Purge saw how it all started, and then this fifth movie came along. Basically, married migrant couple Juan (Tenoch Huerta) and Adela (Ana de la Reguera) illegally cross the border into Texas to escape from a Mexican drug cartel and build a new life. Eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) have regained control of the U. S. government. The annual Purge and its original rules have been re-instituted, and Racial supremacy and nativism have surged nationwide. Ten months later, Juan has found work as a farmhand on the Tucker family ranch while Adela is working near Austin. On the eve of the next annual Purge, Juan and Adela join a migrant community behind a walled sanctuary with armed security to protect them. As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a Purger group, who declare themselves to be a ""Purge Purification Force"" (PPF) that intend to kill those that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. The following morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs. But shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers who have deliberately ignored the end of all legalised crime. She is rescued by her boss Darius Bryant (Sammi Rotibi) before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers. Meanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T. T. (Alejandro Edda) discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who are Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Ranch owner Caleb Tucker (Will Patton) sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T. T. to rescue his son Dylan (Josh Lucas), Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie (Cassidy Freeman), and his sister Harper (Leven Rambin), who offer them a ride to search for Adela. Nationwide news struggles to understand why civilians are continuing to Purge after it has ended. The group rescue Adela and Darius after the police van carrying them is ambushed by more Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from Austin, which is seen burning. At a gas station, they hear news reports about chaos and destruction across all states of America, with local emergency services overwhelmed, it is being described as the ""Forever Purge"". To protect non-Purger civilians, Canada and Mexico have opened their borders for the next six hours, after which the borders will close, and entry will be denied. The group decide to escape across the Mexican border through El Paso. The NFFA has condemned the Forever Purge after their politicians and representatives are targeted, and martial law has been declared across the United States to try and contain the violence. In response, the Canadian and Mexican borders are closed earlier, leaving the group in a chaotic El Paso and those who trying to cross the borders vulnerable to the Purgers. Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T. T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF. The PPF leader, Elijah ""Alpha"" Hardin (Jeffrey Doornbos), offers Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T. T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T. T. before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military base destroyed by more Purgers and they are forced to withdraw. Downtown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan trained with self-defence groups to fight against Mexican drug cartels before they arrived in the United States. The survivors all reunite at a hidden safe house run by a nearby Native American tribe. Their leader offers to transport everyone across the border as refugees. With the PPF in pursuit, Juan, Adela, and Dylan stay behind with other survivors to give the other refugees time to escape. Both groups engage in a gunfight until their ammo runs out and they fight with hand weapons. In the ensuing battle, the Purgers are killed, and Alpha takes Adela hostage. However, Juan and Dylan work together subdue and kill Alpha, saving Adela. The trio rejoin the others in a refugee camp on the other side of the Mexican border, where Cassie has given birth to her child, and Harper is with her. The group reunite to celebrate the child's birth. The NFFA is blamed for the prolonged violence as the entire country is seen burning and it has become a civil war. News reports indicate that more than two million Americans managed to cross the Canadian and Mexican borders as refugees while others rallied to fight back against the Forever Purgers. It is unclear what is going to happen next. Also starring Will Brittain as Kirk, Zahn McClarnon as Chiago and Cindy Robinson as Purge Voice. This fifth entry again makes the most of the outside destructive legal crime sprees, concentrating much more on masked racists who enjoy attacking people of Mexican descent, the survival of the fittest premise is still brutal, the amount of blood spill and explosions is fair, and the pace is reasonable, not that scary but a tense and exciting enough dystopian action horror thriller. Worth watching!",The Forever Purge
2,BandSAboutMovies,I liked it!,6,30 July 2021,"Directed by Everardo Gout and written by series creator James DeMonaco, this is yet another example of ""the last Purge"" before they announce another sequel. That said, this series has gone from middling to decent to actual pretty good to middling all over again, so I was happy that this pushes the Purge in a new direction: once the killing starts, it won't stop. Sure, the series has gotten pretty heavy handed, but if the last few years have taught us anything, it's that the Purge is closer than ever before.These films always get laughed at for the way they handle social issues and then they make over $52.8 million worldwide over its $18 million budget.Eight years after Charlene Roan's presidential election -- The Purge: Election Year -- the New Founding Fathers of America have regained control of the U. S. government and have re-instituted the Purge. Racism has gotten out of control and this years Purge seems like it will cause more damage than anyone can imagine.I mean, you can totally see how they tore this from the headlines. That's kind of why I have a soft spot for these movies, which feel like the last gasp of the exploitation movies that we love that would stare a cynical eye on what was really happening and figure out how to make some money off of it.Despite all of the film's main characters surviving the Purge, the next day the killing continues thanks to a faction called the Forever Purgers, who have decided to turn the tables on the rich and show them what it feels like to be undervalued.It's easy to be snide and think these films are a waste of time, but for some reason, I've found something to enjoy in every film after the first one. I'm really looking forward to Frank Grillo's character Leo Barnes coming back in the next film, as his journey between The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year made for a great story.",The Forever Purge
3,CinemaSerf,Violent but pointless franchise churner...,6,14 September 2021,"It's often said that the best bits of a bad film are in the trail - well, here that is disappointingly true - and the film offers little more to pad out the remaining 100 minutes than many of us will have seen in the run up to this release. There is little, if any, jeopardy to augment a frankly preposterous plot line that sees lawlessness descend on communities across the USA. The only hope for survival would appear to be a desperate bid to get to Mexico where the border is to remain open for six hours whilst Donald waits for the cement on his new wall to dry. After about half an hour I began to feel sorry for poor old Josh Lucas - is this what he has been reduced to, now? The film does have high production values - it is well put together, but the story and acting leave so much to be desired as to render the whole thing little better than a time killer with an ending that is equally flat. I saw it at a cinema, but I can't really recommend anyone pays money to see this - it will end up on a streaming service soon enough and that's, ultimately, where it belongs..",The Forever Purge
4,Calicodreamin,Not bad. Tried too hard.,5,8 July 2021,"Not bad, while message heavy I think that wad kind of the point. The acting was decent and the main cast had good chemistry. For 'the purge' it lacked the gritty fighting I would have expected. Storyline was pretty basic and had a good but expected ending.",The Forever Purge
5,neil-476,"I don't like the Orange Baby either, but don't overdo it",5,23 July 2021,"The Purge is a dusk-to-dawn suspension of all laws, including murder, the idea being it allows society's antisocial elements to get rid of it all in one burst of violent anarchy once a year, the rest of the year being crime-free. Film 1 was a decent urban pranoia horror thriller. Film 2 was an entirely seperate story set during the purge. Film 3 had the pro-Purge political party (the NFFA) trying to kill the anti-Purge political figurehead, and film 4 was a prequel, setting up the first Purge trial run on Staten Island.Now comes film 5. After 2 presidential terms without the Purge, the NFFA is in power and has reinstated it. But, in the morning, after the all-clear has sounded, a large and organised group determines that the Purge will continue until the country has been purified. A small group of people try to cross the Mexican border to safety.The Purge is a decent idea, with plenty of potential for action, suspense, jeopardy, and human interest. It is also a vehicle with scope for some social and political comment. Suspension of disbelief is crucial for movies, and who would believe a USA where people would vote to introduce a regime which was based on malice, hate and violence? Especially when those people subsequently come up with an organised violent overturning of the rule of law? Well, real life has helped with suspension of disbelief in that regard. But...I'm not overburdened with perception. I don't easily spot subtexts and subtleties, but I managed to spot the political points made here. It was hard not to since it was bludgeoned home with a sledgehammer. I'm sympathetic to the points made but, dear heavens, you're not doing yourselves any favours when your issues are drawn in black and white. Goodies and baddies, yes, but the issues should be more relatable in general terms if you want the audience on board.This was more propaganda than entertainment.",The Forever Purge
6,westsideschl,Crude Stereotyping,2,27 October 2021,"Nothing creative just crude excessive stereotyping & clichés on human behavior. Very simplistic political categorizing. (Must be the Trump influence.) Americans are more divisive than ever & the ones with the bigger guns are on the rampage. Predictable who lives, who dies. Humorously, Mexico is now the destination for freedom. The usual cheap artificial looking evenly spaced burning cars/trash along with nicely placed bodies on the streets to denote rampaging killers.",The Forever Purge
7,UniqueParticle,Best Purge since Anarchy,9,2 July 2021,"Despite controversy I loved The Forever Purge! I'm pretty sure it's the most violent installment, quite disturbing, and I absolutely love the masks/makeup. Josh Lucas did so great, refreshing to see him in a more action based roll most anything else wasn't as much. The Purge movies tend to get a lot of hate and I'd highly recommend this one! I really like the writing and producers as well.",The Forever Purge
8,Thanos_Alfie,"Similar to all the previous movies of ""The Purge""...",5,26 August 2021,"""The Forever Purge"" is an Action - Horror movie and the fifth movie of ""The Purge"" franchise in which we watch another annual purge happening but this time it does not stop after twelve hours but continues and seems that will never end.I did not have high expectations from this movie because I had watched all the previous movies of this franchise and the plot is more or less the same in all those movies. The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that ""The Forever Purge"" is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it.",The Forever Purge
9,cruise01,Mindless action sequel that will entertain with not much of a story.,8,3 July 2021,4 out of 5 stars.The Forever Purge is a good action horror dystopian film about a family lead by Josh Lucas. And a mexican couple Tenoch Huerta and Ana de la Reguera. Who get through the night of the purge. Only after a lot of purge supporters decides to continue to cause mayhem and kill after the law has been lifted. While the family are trying to find a safe haven. Which U. S. is falling in turmoil with a forever purge is continuing. They try to escape the country to escape from the mayhem.I always find The Purge films to be entertaining. They are not the best but worth sitting through for the thrills and action. The Forever Purge is a better sequel than the last few movies. And the film does seem to be the last one in the series.The film does have a lot of thrills and action that would make this worth watching. With the family escaping from a lot of maniacs while running into a war torn town with people fighting and killing each other. And the military failing to contain the chaos.The cast ensemble is good. Josh Lucas did good playing a character that has issue with working aside with Juan (Tenoch Huerta). While his wife and sister are treating him and his wife like family. Ana de la Reguera did a great job in the leading role too.The film does cross a social theme with how mexicans are escaping there country cause of the corrupt system and cartel. Like Adela (Ana de la Reguera) leaving the country to start a new safe life. Only to face the purge in U. S. which is no different than Mexico.The plot is decent as it is undershadowed with the country falling apart cause of the purge.The Newton Brothers music score was also decent. The action is plenty and entertaining. It is a worthwhile sequel.,The Forever Purge
10,damianphelps,Disappointed Purge Fan Here!,4,20 August 2021,"Its just to simple and predictable. I stood up for the last film because I felt with (First Purge) they were reflecting on life as we know it, but in a subtle way.In this film it literally has the Trump 'wall'. The nuance is gone.Degenerates into redneck v Mexican....simply not good enough for Purge.With imagination there is plenty to explore so hopefully any future instalments. Dont become Rambo 5.",The Forever Purge
11,Fella_shibby,Blame it on Trump n other fascist bigots.,7,27 July 2021,This is the fifth film in the Purge franchise and a direct sequel to 2016's The Purge: Election Year.This one has ample amount of action but somehow the tension is missing.I still enjoyed it. The sun soaked settings added more fun n it was good to see Josh Lucas aft a long time.I was hoping for an exciting showdown in the end but alas.,The Forever Purge
12,southdavid,The Searchers,5,26 July 2021,"I've not seen a Purge film before this one, but I was aware of the premise. So with no prior feelings about the series either way, I can say that I thought this was passable, but with an inconsistent story that threatens to derail it at almost any moment.In Texas, close to the border with Mexico, Adela (Ana De La Reguera) and her husband Juan (Tenoch Huerta) are living the American dream. The Tuckers, a rich white family, that employ a number of migrant workers, including Juan, prepares for the return of The Purge, following its reinstatement as an American holiday. Though they all survive the night unharmed, the following morning an organised group of the disenfranchised and prejudiced keep the Purge going and escalate to a full race war.So.. I thought that, at least the first one in the series, was a horror film and I was expecting a bit more of that for this, but really, it's an action film, particularly the longer the film goes on. There are some scenes in he first quarter that play a bit more horror influenced, but once it's clear that the purge is going to continue then it's mostly guns and explosions until the conclusion. I'm not specifically criticising the film for that, but it does move it into a particularly crowded field.What I will criticise it for though is for its unfocused plot. There are ideas introduced and not fully explored throughout. The principle one perhaps being that Dylan, the Tuckers remaining male character, played by Josh Lucas, has some racism issues of his own that are never really confronted. His, ""I don't think I'm better, but we should all stick to our own"" line is the nearest it comes, terrible message as though that is. I'd assumed at some point he'd have to make a deliberate choice which path to take, but it never really happens. It doesn't address how the organised militia group, which are constantly spouting rhetoric about cleansing America of its parasites, ties in with the group that attack the Tuckers initially, are led by an immigrant. The plot keeps changing the characters goals, which is fine but then seems to realise that the ending needs more Oomph so introduces a slightly ridiculous ""final boss"" type character about twenty minutes before the end.I didn't hate it, it's not exactly subtle with its politics but I'm fine with that, but in the end it's a shallow action movie, lacking in invention or ideas that would escalate it any higher.",The Forever Purge
13,paul-allaer,"The (unintended) timing of this film couldn't be better, making for relevant viewing",7,7 July 2021,"As ""The Forever Purge"" (2021 release; 103 min.), we see a Mexican couple, Juan and Adela, crossing into the US illegally. We then go to ""Ten Months Later"", when it's only one day until the annual Purge. Juan works on a big Texas ranch, and there are tensions between the ranch owners and the hired hands (not just Juan). The 12 hr. Purge comes and goes without much of anything happening, but then the shocker comes: ""white trash"" refuses to end the Purge, making it into a Forever Purge, with the goal of ""purifying"" the country of all non-Americans, and taking over the business from the filthy rich, like Texas ranch owners...Couple of comments: the is the fifth Purge movie, and a direct sequel to the 2016 ""Purge: Election Year"" one. This movie was mostly written and filmed in 2019 (with an original intended release for Summer, 2020). In other words, way before the Jan 6, 2021 insurrection by the Trump supporters, who would indeed love nothing better than to ""purify"" the US of all immigrants (both legal and illegal) and grab ownership of businesses. This film pretty much shows us what would happen if the Jan 6 insurrection wasn't just one city, but playing out all over the country. It is absolutely uncanny. So what does indeed happen in the film? I'm sorry but I'm not going to spoil it, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. As for the technical side of things, the movie is on par with previous Purge films. In other words: this isn't going to win any Oscar nominations. But I quite liked it, and again, the timing of this film's release couldn't be better, a mere six months after the insurrection of the US Capitol, as if the film makers rush released it to cash in on it (when in fact this should've been released a year ago but obviously COVID-19 had other plans). This makes ""The Forever Purge"" quite a political film, again unintended. I suspect that Trump supporters will not be a fan of this film, given that their ilk on the big screen don't come out looking very well in all this... Last but not least: the film's score is courtesy of the Newton Brothers, who by complete coincidence also scored the movie I saw 2 day ago, ""The God Committee"".""The Forever Purge"" opened wide in theaters this July 4 weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 25, from a quick count I did). If you are a fan of the Purge franchise, or would like to get a sense what a nationwide insurrection by white trash might look like, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Forever Purge
14,subxerogravity,I did like the last Purge movie better but this one was good,6,2 July 2021,"The Forever Purge.Wonder what Ethan Hawke thinks the monster he helps create?We come a long way from that indy thriller the original was to the action paced franchise it became but the same social commentary has not change
A strange concept of a holiday. Like the 4th of July but instead of barbecuing, we can commit any crime we want, but I noticed none of these Purge movies has ever been about that one guy who just wants a new TV set. You have to figure there is a large community of people who just plane to steel a million dollars from the bank on the night of the Purge but I'm sure those people got killed by I bunch of righteously wrapped freaks who think steeling is wrong.This Purge is about those wrapped freaks organizing themselves and deciding they never one this night to end. Taking place in Texas close to the broader of Mexico, the Purge centers around a Mexican Cowboy working for a rich boy who don't believe in Mexican Cowboys as he and his wife, a woman who believes in the idea of America, gets to..."" celebrate"" their first Purge.The purge was never a horror movie technically but it does have all the horror elements, as regular citizens become Jason and Freddy showing off their worse for one night reflecting on the type of person you really are.The Forever Purge is a good movie and the Purge altogether is a good franchise. It works simple because of a vague belief that if we did allow this to happen this is exactly how it would go down.",The Forever Purge
15,jtindahouse,Terribly bland characters and the movie drags,4,22 August 2021,"How do you make a movie with a concept as interesting as 'The Forever Purge' boring? Terrible characters. The characters in this movie are incredibly bland and it kills everything else the movie tries to do. It's impossible to care about them or their fates. This movie has other problems for sure, but they all stem from this.'The Purge' series has been a rocky ride. It started off okay, but also extremely misusing of the concept in the original 2013 film. Then the next two were great. They explored all the possibilities that come along with this inventive concept. Then the last two have just fallen apart. They need to take note of what made the second one especially so interesting. Get creative and think of all the potential there is.This one just didn't feel like there were any stakes. The whole thing is based around the survival of the characters, but they're hard to care for. There is no creativity in any of the kills or events. It is just people mindlessly attacking each other. The film feels like it drags on forever. This is the worst entry in the series yet and a major let down.",The Forever Purge

Ana & Tenoch are Mexican illegals that sneak across the border into the US and get jobs-Ana in a meat packing company and Tenoch at a ranch, taming horses-about 10 months before the next purge. Will owns the ranch and Josh is his son and Cassidy is Josh's wife. They have the usual security needed to survive a purge night but the morning after the purge they discover a group of fanatics want to make the purge an ongoing holiday-in other words, everyday. And the fanatics are not just local, they are nation wide. Now, the non fanatics have to fight to survive for the rest of their lives-or get stricter laws in place to prevent something like this from ever happening again.It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.If you like these movies-I do-it is an entertaining entry.

17,kevin_robbins,This is still worth a viewing but it isn't as good as it should be,6,21 July 2021,"The Forever Purge (2021) is a movie the Mrs. And I caught in theatres on date night this past weekend. The storyline takes place in Texas when some ranchers whose ranch is run by Hispanics, even though they believe in separatism, get caught out in the open when the purge doesn't stop when it's supposed to. After being saved by the Hispanics they hate, they'll have to work together to survive. This movie is directed by Everardo Gout (Luke Cage) and stars Ana de la Reguera (Narcos), Josh Lucas (Ford vs Ferrari), Tenoch Huerta (Spectre) and Leven Rambin (The Hunger Games). This storyline actually had a good setup, primary plot and the Hispanics in this movie were absolutely awesome delivering their characters and storyline. Lucas played his part perfectly as well. I also adored the backdrops, background events, costumes and masks. Unfortunately there's zero gore in this film. Almost every kill is done with a gun and someone getting shot. There are some intense scenes but very few good kill scenes which causes this movie to fall flat. This is still worth a viewing but it isn't as good as it should be. I'd score this a 6/10.",The Forever Purge
18,robfollower,Buckle Up -High octane adrenaline rush with excellent production value intense action and deliciously violent,8,2 July 2021,"The Forever Purge is High a octane adrenaline rush with excellent production value, intense action and deliciously violent. I new what I was getting into with this genre of film making ( which is certainly not for every body ) but for those of use who embrace this type of narrative and ""on"" the screen violent carnage; Screenwriter James DeMonaco isn't in the least bit subtle with the film's message and social commentary. The Forver Purge truly delivers in a bold exasperating fashion . Buckle -up !The Purge movies have always done something right as the casting is usually solid, with interesting choices for leading roles. It's effectively disturbing at times, and much of that is simply because the main characters are all well cast and mostly sympathetic.The Forever Purge, DeMonaco has taken the gloves off. This is a brutal, unflinching violent action crime thriller with plenty of gore for the horror gore -hound .The production value is through the roof . Incredible set pieces with an array of mayhem , destruction and plenty of pyrotechnics . I very much enjoyed the nod to the Mad Max road warrior segments of the film .The Purge franchise has always been an intriguing one. The series has explored several hot-button topics. The Forever Purge creates an interesting-looking feature. And the director certainly shows a bit of skill when bringing a little tension into the mix. A solid cast and intense action sequences, combined with DeMonaco's takedown of white supremacists, make this fast-paced entry in The Purge franchise one of its best. 8/10.",The Forever Purge

21,lukem-52760,A Scarily Relevant Action Thriller. Like A Modern Western.,9,19 October 2021,"I love The Purge films & consider ""Anarchy"" as the best of the franchise....until i saw ""Forever Purge"" which i totally enjoyed as a throwback to 70's style gritty & dusty Thriller's because for some reason this Purge really had that old school 70's feel. There's a modern western feel & look & i loved it.Maybe it was the sun-baked setting of Texas & Mexico or simply the Cowboy way the characters dress that made me think of those dusty road movies of the 1970's such as ""Smokey & the Bandit"" & ""Mad Max"" &""The Hills Have Eyes"" & ""The Gauntlet"" for example. There's definitely an old fashioned flavour to this film & i dug it.The themes of Wealth, poor, race & violence are all extremely relevant especially with the scary mess that is America & of course it's always going to be relevant but especially so for the last few years with Trumps America & the Nightmare that the country has become.Anyway the film as a film is good exciting & suspenseful fun with a good cast of characters that you like & want to survive. Josh Lucas was decent & i haven't really seen him in anything for ages!!! I thought he disappeared or something but he is here & is decent but the best characters are the two main Mexican actors who give the best performances. Veteran actor Will Patton is good too in a small role but an effect role. Will Patton is probably known as a ""Character Actor"" as he's in lots of films but usually isn't the lead role but anyway an actor is an actor & the veteran, in his 60's now, is a great actor who has Starred in many films such as The Fourth Kind, The Punisher, Halloween & Halloween Kills, Armageddon, The Mothman Prophecies & tons more!!! The southern accent & average joe quality he has is put to good use here as the old Cowboy father of Josh Lucas's character & gives a solid performance for his screen time.Here the purge boils over to the next day & the savage violence is a shocking sight to see it happening during the beautiful sunny daytime & that makes the atmosphere very scary & intense.The cinematography is excellent. The score is great.I liked this new approach to the franchise by expanding the Purge world by making the daytime chaos & showing how the purge will never end.A nice mix of characters & with a strong look at what it means to be an ""American"" & to simply be a good person no matter the colour of your skin or where you come from. I'm sure there's tons of subtext throughout the movie but to put politics aside, it's an exciting action-packed Thriller that is actually pretty scary at times.I think i liked this Purge best so far.",The Forever Purge

It's a new film so I like it to go in a different direction, nowadays we have everyone being writers and directors they judge a film based on their thoughts of what it should be and how it should end up rather than watching it based on it's on merit!! I think it's a 6.5 but kicked it to 9 for all the political morons who judged it on their views. The action scenes were excellent, the story was a 5 but the action and great cast kick up up a notch or 2. The lead actress is the next action star , And Josh Lucas is ALWAYS phenomenal!!",The Forever Purge
23,Pairic,"New, more extreme Purgers",7,14 July 2021,"The Forever Purge: A direct sequel to The Purge: Election Year, it's 2049, the NFFA have regained power on a rising tide of nativism and anti-immigrant feeling. They reintroduce The Purge and seemingly the usual violence ensues, street people murdered, anyone out a target. But this year it's different - an organisation calling itself the Purge Purification Force (PPF) targets anyone it regards as Non-American, torturing and killing them in trucks. The next day The Purge continues, a TV reporter is shot dead as he talks about it being over. Disparate groups carry on The Purge but those central to The Forever Purge are the PPF who initiate pogrom across the U. S.; the NFFA have lost control of the monster they summoned up. Canada and Mexico open their borders to U. S. refugees for six hours. The film follows a group as they make their way to the Mexican Border.Some savage scenes of violence and horror - even a humane killer is used as a deadly weapon. Bows, crossbows, firearms and axes coe into play as the blood flows freely and the body parts fly apart. Realistic urban and desert battle scenes, especially the hand to hand fighting. The buggies and motorbikes used by the Purgers add a Mad Max touch to the proceedings. Naturally satire and social commentary add a subtext to TP:EY but the film also works as an action thriller as the group attempt to reach the border before it is closed. Directed Everardo Valerio Gout from a screenplay by James DeMonaco. 7/10.",The Forever Purge
24,aidanratesmovies,Yet another missed opportunity- think Blumhouse's The Hunt- but somehow so much dumber,4,21 October 2021,"Although it does start off with some potential, The Forever Purge quickly ensues into typical repetitive madness this time with a more accurate political twist. I admire what this film is trying to do, or at the very least, what it thinks it's trying to do. The concept is very obviously a social commentary on our current environment right now in America, and how the purge would work in that respect. It's an interesting idea, but just like all the rest of these movies, it's not very well executed- this one especially. Although it doesn't compare to the disaster that was The First Purge, The Forever Purge is too slow to carry a rhythm and too plotless to let you care about the characters at hand. The film basically sets up all the right notes, but then gives up halfway in, just saying- screw it- this is good enough and continuing without any true feeling whatsoever. The film feels dreadfully thin at its core, and the actors are thankfully giving it their best, but the dialogue throughout can be quite repetitive- or incredibly corny- especially towards the end. This is also to mention that the films ending is in the trailer, which really dumbfounded me if i'm to be honest, as I did not expect the movie to be as condensed as it was in the trailer- but to be honest- that 3 min trailer did work a lot better than this film- and that's saying something. In the end, The Forever Purge is yet another dud in this poorly executed franchise- lets just hope its ambiguous cliffhanger leads us to more of what made Anarchy and Election Year a much closer step in the right direction.My Rating: 3.6/10.",The Forever Purge
25,masonsaul,Really good action thriller,7,20 July 2021,"Once again, it fails to be scary by being almost entirely reliant on cheap jump scares and is very clumsy with its relevant themes but The Forever Purge is still a really good action thriller and improvement over it's immediate predecessor. Ana de la Reguera, Josh Lucas and Tenoch Huerta are all great. Everado Gout's direction is really good, it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The music by Newton Brothers is also really good.",The Forever Purge
26,rgkarim,Will This Movie Have This Series Go On Forever?,6,3 July 2021,"The Purge, a movie that so long ago opened the doors of a political horror that was torturous, bloody, and ethically challenging. What seemed like a farfetched idea has started to become a lot more plausible though, and had the series gradually change from its roots, which depending on your preferences may or may not be up your alley. After so many changes, a tv series, and some gaps in production, does this movie still have the same bite and carnage that drew us in so long ago? Robbie K bringing his thoughts on the latest film:LIKESGood Pace:
The Purge is a movie whose pacing has been inconsistent depending on which installment you watch. For this movie, the pace was good for me, taking only about 15 minutes to really get back into the chaos this series hopes to provide. A little refresher, some character introductions, and you're all set to dive in as the night starts. But as the title implies, the Purge continues on and the new twist keeps the pace consistently fast and moving towards the goals established at the beginning. It works for more of an action point for those who like adrenaline rushes, or at least semi adrenaline rushesThe Realistic Horror:
Part of what made the scare factor for the Purge series was how realistic the concept was and how the antagonists were real life people, not super power spirits. That same theme is present in this film, with the threat level elevated to current events, which unfortunately is an uncomfortable edge to think about. Nevertheless, the movie thrives on the uncomfortable chaos that this event brings and the political frenzy it causes.The Characters:
The past Purge films have all been about strong characters at the forefront of the fight against the tradition, and this one is no different. Our cast of survivors come from all lots of life, a subtle hint at the theme they are going for, and many of them have some more noble qualities that are always inspiring to see. Hispanics known for hard work, strong women characters without being overpowered, and skeptical rich folk who aren't just snobby tools to be shot at. These cast of heroes are indeed heroes and rooting for them during this journey was more fun than most of the other bands from the previous installments. Thus, great job with adding a little more layering to simple roles.Acting:
Not the best, but certainly better than most horror movies, the Forever Purge has actors and actresses that have a little more vim and vigor to their skills. Legend Will Patton did just fine in his role, though more expansion of his character was needed to really make use of the talents I know he has in him. Josh Lucas was a decent addition as well, taking on the complex roles his character gets and trying to juggle them. He takes the action, drama, and political and roles decently well though some more emotions were needed to really shine. The winner for me of all the cast as Ana de la Reguera, whose long name matcher her long skills for the character she played. A strong female lead with skills, with the ability to have vulnerability, Reguera rocks all of the gestures she needs to make her character come to life and really have a heroine that again has deeper meaning than what we sometimes get. The other cast does well to hit their marks Tenoch Huerta as the hardworking cowboy, brave enough to stand up to the demands the situations bring and yet keep his cool. Alejandro Edda is a great supporting character, who needed more words and lines to really show off the personality that T. T. shows in the film. And Cassidy Freeman as Harper had some really good lines that she delivered and captured much of the stereotypical pregnancy symptoms quite well.The Fighting:
When it came to the fighting of the film franchises, the fifth installment is probably the middle of the pack when it comes to the action stints. The Forever Purge drops coordination and choreography, for a more realistic dive into handling the riots that ensue. We have trekking through towns, hiding, and a little more choose your battle moments that survivalists like to see in these movies. There is something to admire in the realistic portrayal, and the planning that goes into handling these emergencies. And if you don't care about that, there is enough carnage in the background to fill the appetites of those who love the carnage these movies bring.DISLIKES:Predictable:
The movie does a pretty solid job of foreshadowing what is to come, the dialogue alone being loaded with so many ""hints"" in the drawn out lines, it'd be impossible not to see what is coming. To be honest, this is one of the Purge movies where the surprises were at a minimum, and I was a bit disappointed to not see that spirit of sudden awe come into play.The Movie is Agenda Heavy:
No surprise here, the movie is about political topics being mixed into a night of horrifying rituals. However, the Forever Purge has really been redesigned to hit heavy on the current topics of today and make it the essence of the movie. Various scenes showing the target victims of the Purge, heavy alliteration of cruel qualities being seen prior to the chaos, and even the dialogue to pry more into our characters' issues feels like the various posts on social media. It lacks clever word play, focused mission dialogue, and a natural feel, and I would have loved to see some of that political jargon be smoothed out to make for a more joyful experience.The Character Use:
Unfortunately the movie really suffers from the use of most of its characters, leading to a rather disappointing integration of characters despite the promising opening. So much of the movie is on about three characters at most, and while the rest of the group is along for the ride, that's literally the most they do. Talking, character development, promising interactions, are only hints before being dropped and lost to some of the other limitations I felt this movie had. And though there are enough hasty finishes to give everyone a proper close... I can't say it's the best I've seen in a movie, let alone the series itself. So even if you find a favorite who survives, don't expect many to really rock your socks off you know? This is even true with the antagonists, which in most of the movies have always had some stooge to play the big bad wolf of the bunch. In this one though, the antagonists are so scattered, generic, and one-dimensional that it's more a metaphorical bad guy than a physical one.The Story Limitations:
Predictability aside, the story is rather rushed, which I believe has to do with the pace and agenda parts of the film. Again the Purge is always about integrating politics into the horror elements, but always kept the stories as the front and center focus. Not the case in this one, the stories are very diluted, with only droplets of backstory to flesh out our characters and not really giving them more than that. Why are they so good at what they do? What hidden event drove their current views of the world? Or even what their hopes are past survival... We've gotten those in the past films, but for this one... it's again rather bland, boring, and sometimes left vague depending on the moment.The Edge of the movie:Horror movies often rely on the edge to get the job done, and again the past installments have relied heavily on the suspense/thriller aspect to elevate going to watch them. Again, that was gone for me, once more lost to the new trend of politics over storytelling, lost to the background/overhead shots of the carnage and less on the streets. Sure there were a few moments of attempts at jump scares, and again the realistic probability of this happening in real life is still there. However, overall, the edge just felt diluted and lost to very forced, monotonous speeches that did little to progress the story and again show off the agenda. I missed the intense action moments, the barely dodging traps, and the sickening twists that came at the drop of a bullet shell that made the previous movies much more on the edge of your seatThe VERDICT:Overall, the Forever Purge is not the strongest suit of the Purge series deck. While the pace works, the realism stays strong, and the characters are better balanced, the movie lacks some of the essentials this series is known to thrive on. The edge, the plot that keeps our characters in suspenseful moments, and the twists that can often be deadly are much less intense in this installment. It seems that the political agenda work was the focus of this film, and though there are some important messages in the writing, it's a bit too much in my face for me to determine it was needed. Instead I wanted the action, good character usage, and that villain/group that bring the thrill of the hunt. Special effects wise is worth a shot in the theater, but otherwise I would hold off and have this one at home viewing if possible.My scores for the film are:Action/Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5.",The Forever Purge

But finally as of today, I finally got to see this film & it was ace!The film follows a family living in rural Mexico & dreading the annual Purge Night which is fast approaching! The night arrives & finishes like clockwork, but somethings up... the Purge doesn't seem to be over as thousands across the country start rioting & continuing the night that many Non-Purgers thought was over!I found the film to be pretty action packed as always! Like with the previous entries, it never fails to amuse! Yeah, the story-line isn't exactly different, but who cares!? It's action packed, fun, gruesome & insane on so many levels!While there's a couple of so-so moments in the film, for the most part, it isn't disappointing! At 95 minutes it's pretty fast paced & doesn't let up once the first gun shot is fired!Overall, it's a great action packed sequel with a different story-line, but don't expect anything new, as it does still follow the same formula that makes the Purge Films!9/10.",The Forever Purge
28,elliotjeory,Better than the last one,6,25 July 2021,"This is a decent entry into the purge series, mainly because of the main actress who gives an excellent performance. It was an interesting take on the franchise with decent action although the same tired stereotypes were pretty lame.",The Forever Purge
29,Abdulxoxo,Entertaining enough,7,8 August 2021,"The direction of this franchise swerved far too much towards the socio-political agenda, with no interest whatsoever in subtlety. Frankly, they've become more interested in pushing an already obvious message than trying to make good movies. 'The Forever Purge' continues down that mediocre path with a story that asks what would happen if after the purge ended, people just kept purging Yet again, this franchise is letting us know that Americans are racist in the most one-dimensional way possible. It starts off with generic nutjobs, before transitioning into neo-Nazi's and rednecks trying to eliminate what they call ""the brownies"". The writing was ok, with all those all-too- convenient-plot-saves and story elements that go nowhere, but The Forever Purge gets a pass since it has plenty of good content and does a suitable enough job attaching itself to the Purge universe. The two Mexican protagonists are actually worth the viewing time. The performances by Ana de la Reguera and Tenoch Huerta were good, who have some brief scenes that show off their chemistry. Plus they're both badass. But the supporting cast brought very little. Perhaps one of the only truly interesting things about this film was the fact that Mexico and Canada announced that they'd open their borders for 6 hours to allow people safe passage out of America. This gave our protagonists a race against time to escape. The final third of this movie turns into a Western too for some reason, although that actually led to the strongest action set piece. To be honest, apart from the generic villain they come up against, that final third was pretty well directed.Overall, I don't see why they needed to do a sequel, but I can't say I was disappointed by 'The Forever Purge' as I didn't have great expectations in the first place. Truth be told it was an ok movie - no more no less.",The Forever Purge
30,arungeorge13,"Pretty solid entry in the Purge franchise, but how many more of these do we need? [+56%]",6,25 July 2021,"While the film's surface-level political commentary isn't worth diving deep into, The Forever Purge probably boasts the slickest action and cinematography in the franchise thus far (haven't seen the TV series, so can't comment on that!). The franchise has evolved in terms of its scale of violence but also waned in terms of the stories it tries to tell. In a twist from the other Purge films, the 12-hour annual purging event gets over in the first act itself. It's on the following day that things get interesting. North America sees a white supremacist cult that wishes to continue the purge for as long as they wish, taking over cities one by one.On the protagonist front, we have a Texan family with Mexican employees on their ranch trying to work their way through the sudden rise of anarchy. There's some racial hostility between the two male leads, but as you'd expect, by the end, all's well that ends well. In fact, series creator/writer James DeMonaco even brings in an Indigenous American character as a saviour later on. It's a welcome change alright, to see a non-white guy lead from the front, though I missed the presence of Frank Grillo (and part 2 still remains my favourite!).The slightly enhanced budget adds to the overall chaos of the action sequences. But it also clearly shows that a higher budget may not necessarily see an improved plot or neater bits of social commentary. I'm sure Blumhouse cannot do away with that sweet sequel money, so they'll keep pushing DeMonaco to write new films, as evident by this one's ending (touted to be the last). I will still keep watching them because I love the overall aesthetics of this series: purger costumes get quirkier in each flick; so does the logistical plausibility of each fluidly shot set piece.There isn't a whole lot to write about when it comes to the ensemble's performances or the inanely predictable plot. But we don't watch these films for either. The Purge films are sheer guilty pleasures and they need to remain that way. Even the poorly staged jumpscares can be forgiven on that account.",The Forever Purge
31,cricket30,If you're searching for a film which captures the True Spirit of Texas . . .,8,14 July 2021,". . . you need look no further than THE FOREVER PURGE. In Real Life, just as during this current release, firearms are ubiquitous, rampant and pretty much everywhere you look throughout our Lone Star State. Whether you're strolling a college campus, visiting a military base, worshipping in church, dining in a restaurant or attending high school, gun fire is apt to break out likely as not here below Oklahoma. When we're not getting six feet of rain in one week, watching hurricanes wash orphanages out to sea, viewing deepwater oil well petrochemical slicks coming in with the tide or feeling exploding refineries rocking our homes, gun play is our favorite recreation. It's true that Texas is not for everyone. Thousands of Lone Star refugees already have resettled as transplants in Mexico, and millions more are on the way to do so, as THE FOREVER PURGE predicts. This just opens up the firing range for the rest of us.",The Forever Purge
32,NijazBaBs,good for gore lovers,8,25 September 2021,"As schizophrenic and gore lover I like this movie. The scariest to me actually look cold weapon attacks like stabbings and dog bites. It is just enjoyable to see something so extreme, new, different, unique, brutal, beyond our minds. Also this is different than older purge installments because this one is never ending. I think all weirdos, loners, creeps, and silly people will like this and will easily identify with this movie. I am amazed by the weapons, scary figures and action, and real life like mention of government, law, TV. But I expected something more like less ordinary end, and more emotions, depth, and most of all drones, chemical attacks, and more brutal violence in form of slow torture like skinning and eye gouging. Also good for halloween lovers. Anybody who likes brutality like me will like this. I expected something more to happen with two main bad characters, the Mama and that guy killed in end, maybe some slower revenge, fight, relationships, twist.

34,IonicBreezeMachine,"The Forever Purge rebounds from the misfire of The First Purge resulting in an entertaining series entry, even if it doesn't quite match the level of Anarchy and Election Year",6,2 October 2021,"Following their brief loss of power and suspension of the Purge, the New Founding Fathers have regained control of the United States reinstituting The Purge. Now stronger than ever, Racial Supremacy and Nativism have seen an increase in the years since the re-establishment of The Purge with so-called ""Purification Purgers"" seeking to eliminate ""non pure"" elements in America. Married couple, Juan and Adela (Ana de la Reguera), having crossed the border to escape cartel violence in Mexico now have established lives in Texas with Adela working at a meat packing plant and Juan working as a ranch hand for the Tucker family consisting of patriarch Caleb (Will Patton), Caleb's son and daughter Dylan (Josh Lucas) and Harper (Leven Rambin), and Dylan's expectant wife Cassie (Cassidy Freeman). On the night of the annual purge, the Tucker Family lock down their homestead while Juan and Adela shelter with a migrant community who've collectively hired private security forces. The two groups survive the Purge and resume their lives the following day, only for a far right group of ""Ever After Purgers"" including the Purification Purgers ignoring the end of the Purge and causing a massive uprising across the United States that the New Founding Fathers have lost control and containment of. Now Juan and Adela and the Tucker family must join together to try and escape the continuously escalating violence by heading into Mexico.The fifth entry in the ongoing Purge series (not counting the two season TV series on USA Network), James DeMonaco gives us another chapter that delivers on the intense violence and heavy satire to mostly successful effect. While the movie does feel like a bit of a cheat in how it undoes Election Year, it does do just enough to justify itself and is a massive upgrade on the middling The First Purge.Much like how The First Purge tried to dig into ""hood"" film influences to build its identity (albeit to mixed effect) The Forever Purge goes for a Neo-Western approach as seen in works like Longmire or Taylor Sheridan's writings that fits well within the Purge Universe and helps give the Texas setting a unique identity from the L. A. and D. C. settings of Purge 2 and 3. The movie shakes up the formula by making the series villains, the New Founding Fathers, victims of hubris with their method of controlling the populace ultimately blowing up in their face with the very beast they created now chomping at the bit to get to them. The movie shows, albeit heavy handedly, that anyone who rises to power based on hate and fear will ultimately lose control of control and be forced to face the hate and fear when its hunger remains unsatisfied. The Ever After Purgers are loathsome villains who you take great joy in seeing shot, bludgeoned, or stabbed it's extremely gratifying to with how impactful the action sequences are.Unlike The First Purge, The Forever Purge incorporates that sense of urgency that was missing from the previous entry, but subverts expectations by taking place outside of Purge night with no viable option of ""waiting it out"" as there's been in the previous films. Once the forever Purge starts for our characters they're in danger until they escape because the Purge is permanent. The movie's characters are much better defined than the last entry, but unfortunately The Forever Purge doesn't really have a strong ""standout"" performance like Frank Grillo's Leo Barnes. Josh Lucas as Dylan Tucker certainly looks like a leading man and carries himself like one, but his arc of being ""kind of"" a racist without any actual reason as to why he's a racist doesn't give his character all that much meat. Tenoch Huerta has a similar issue as the character Juan where although Huerta has history in major productions like Mexican TV series Blue Demon or Netflix crime drama Narcos: Mexico he's not really all that gravitating of a presence. The one actor who did legitimately draw me in was Longmire's Zahn McClarnon as Chiago, a Native American tribal leader who becomes an ally to our main characters and gets to showcase some impressive action prowess, including shooting sicks of dynamite from a bow and arrow. McClarnon is indisputably good, but he's such a late in the game appearance (save for some talking head segments on the news) that he feels a little underutilized. Maybe if we'd had cameos by Edwin Hodge's Dante Bishop or Frank Grillo's Leo Barnes maybe they could've helped give both a sense of continuation as well as some additional charisma but I digress.The Forever Purge is entertaining but not the best in the series. In terms of the lowest points being The First Purge and The Purge, with the Highest points being Anarchy and Election Year, The Forever Purge falls into the upper part of the middle closer to the latter two than the former two. If you're a fan of the franchise you'll find plenty to appreciate here from its Neo-Western aesthetics to its grand scale that makes it the biggest Purge yet and it leaves the door open for interesting opportunities should thy do a sixth one.",The Forever Purge

This was actually a good thing because this franchise should have been a slasher or gore fest. Instead, what we got was 4 movies with mostly bad acting, crazy people who were just cringe, and dumb political commentary that no one wanted.Although this movie maintained the political commentary tradition, it compensated for fast pacing and plenty of action. Similarly to Anarchy, Forever was pretty fun and entertaining most of the runtime. It's not the most well-shot or intense movie, but there were enough thrills watching America going to the dumpster.The political commentary was not the newest or creative, but it is for sure relevant. Seeing the characters of different races teaming up was good and delivered the message. The commentary could have been a lot more into-the-face, but there's enough level in this movie.The most annoying problem of the movie was the stupid false jump-scares.

37,jp_91,A great sequel!,7,2 July 2021,"In retrospect of the franchise: ""The Purge"" (2013) to be the first installment it was a very weak film. ""The Purge: Anarchy"" (2014) is the best film in the whole franchise, a deep script and a great production. ""The Purge: Election Year"" (2016) is the second best film in the franchise, a cool script and thrilling scenes. ""The First Purge"" (2018) is the weakest film in the franchise, not that bad but not good either. ""The Forever Purge"" (2021) is a good film, really enjoyable and with great suspense, this fifth part is inferior compared to the second and third parts but better than the first and fouth parts. ""The Forever Purge"" like the previous installments shows two kinds of people: good and bad. On the good side are the lead actress Ana de la Reguera, playing perfectly to Adela, a strong Mexican woman, Tenoch Huerta plays Juan (Adela's husband) a hard worker man, Josh Lucas plays Dylan Tucker a hard American cowboy with a good heart, Cassidy Freeman plays Cassidy Tucker (Dylan's wife) a pacifist pregnant woman, and Leven Rambin plays Harper Tucker (Dylan's sister) a sensitive and strong young woman. On the bad side are a gang of white supremacists, a bunch of actors wearing creepy masks, this film (like the fourth part) show the retrograde thinking of these individuals. The two nationalities: Mexicans and Americans fight together to survive in a violent rampage, showing that the latinos and the white people feel the same and seek the same things, there are differences but not too marked, empathy is present. Juan and Dylan represent the racial stereotypes of their respective nationalities, at first I thought it was an exaggeration of the script but at the end all made sense in a touching scene.

39,trinaboice,Boring and annoying,1,6 July 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Blumhouse Productions presents another sequel to the creepy franchise, this time with a western vibe. The setting and background are certainly timely as it takes a look at the flood of illegal immigrants crossing the U. S. border and the violence that has been prevalent during the pandemic. While the franchise has always felt like pure fiction, this one actually feels more realistic as we realize the unbridled anger and frustration at ""the system"" could actually look like this in the extreme. That's true horror.This is the fifth and supposed final installment in this uber-violent franchise. In this story, all the rules are broken as a sect of lawless marauders decides that the annual Purge does not stop at daybreak and, instead, should never end. This is Everardo Gout's feature film directorial debut. He also produced the movie along with Michael Bay.THINGS I LIKED:
Some people are saying this installment is the best in the entire franchise, but I actually got bored and annoyed at the same time.Our sweet nun from Nacho Libre, played by the lovely Ana de la Reguera, has two bloodbath movies out this year: ARMY OF THE DEAD and now this movie.The image of bullets as teeth on one of the masks is frightening and cool at the same time. The various masks are very creative and creepy.Fun fact: The actress Cassidy Freeman plays a pregnant woman in the movie. She wore a fake baby bump and often stashed snacks inside it during long hours of filming.The cast also includes Josh Lucas (I've always liked him), Tenoch Huerta, Leven Rambin, Will Patton, and Cassidy Freeman.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
You need to have watched one of the prior movies in the series to understand what The Purge is all about.Many of the scenes occur at night, so the scenes are dark, making it difficult to see what's happening on small streaming devices.Super fake-looking blood and makeup.Most of the CGI looks terrible.Some of the set designs look like they were made by a high school drama club.There are some cringeworthy acting moments and extremely shallow characters.A lot of the action sequences are almost yawn-worthy.I hate the shaky-cam technique.It almost felt like a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road
Soooo many movie posters. Too many.The dialogue is pretty dumb. For example, one of the characters tells us the names of which firearms are being used whenever he hears them being used.The plot is almost nonexistent with tons of plot holes.I'm getting really tired of woke Hollywood telling me that all white people are evil and terrible and everyone else is morally superior.It's extremely anti-American, a disturbing trend I've been seeing more and more lately. The most dangerous aspect of this movie is knowing that there will be people who watch this film and think it's really cool and that they're justified to use violence to purge America from any of the injustices they see.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

The Forever Purge is, well, a Purge movie. Not much to say other than that. This one didn't seem to get as much publicity as the others which seems to signify that the franchise is almost at a close. The concept for this is pretty dumb, but sets up for maybe an interesting installment for one more. What surprised me most about The Forever Purge is the topics it covers. Though not covered in detail or the best way, the main focus is about racism and white supremacist groups, which then goes into politics. It's evident this was inspired by events that have happened within the past few years. Good for them for taking the chance to talk about something bigger than just killing people. Anyway, it's a Purge movie. The dialogue isn't the best and same with the acting. The reliance on jump scares is exhausting. We're here to get the gore and violence if we're being honest, and it does provide enough of it. In regards to the others on the franchise, this is one of the better ones, but that's not saying much. For what it's worth, it wasn't quite as bad as I expected.",The Forever Purge
43,ethanbresnett,No thank you,2,19 July 2021,"Derivative, generic, formulaic, bland, dull... I can assign numerous adjectives to this film, none of them good.The biggest problem at this point is that The Purge franchise doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it still a horror franchise, or an action one? It seems to be stuck in limbo between the two and as a result functions as neither. Not a single second of the film was scary, and the action was all so familiar and uninspiring. The term going through the motions springs to mind when thinking back to the action set pieces.This is also one of those films with a cast list of bland and cliche characters. None of them drew me in and captivated my interest, which wasn't particularly the fault of the actors who were all fine for the most part, it was the god awful dialogue. It was so grating and hard to watch at times, with all the cliches in the book thrown in there.I have to say I do appreciate the social commentary they were trying to go for in the film, but they left no room for subtle or nuanced story telling, beating you over the head with their themes to the point of concussion. Unfortunately this resulted in the whole thing becoming a bit of a caricature which diluted their message.Going into this film I at least thought I could kick back with some popcorn and have a good time, but it was quite a grating and painful watch at times.",The Forever Purge

It was like Blum didn't help make this at all. In all of the other movies the suspense and thrill was there. This felt like a low budget, straight to DVD hot mess! I am embarrassed for anyone involved in making this movie, I feel like a 4 is extremely generous of me as a fan because everything was bad in this movie. It was like special effects didn't even try in this movie at all. The only good acting came from the Mexican chick who was unkillable. There were so many roll your eyes moments in this movie it was sad! I recommend any fan of the other four movies stay far away from this one. It is NOT worth the time or your money so just watch anything else.",The Forever Purge

The story wasn't new, the concept was copied from The Purge series: Season 2 but execution was in the way thay you will enjoy it.Was the movie perfect? No. It had its problems but it didn't deserved so much negativity. Only giving negative reviews because movie was almost same story and policies is wrong. This franchise is meant for fun and they did bring something new.Overall, I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially to those who love or have watched this franchise's other movies.",The Forever Purge
50,fciocca,"The Purge franchise was fun for a while, but now it is time to end it for good.",2,26 September 2021,"This fifth installment on ""The Purge"" is absolutely horrible and way too political. The background story is once again related to immigration and racism, exactly like the previous movie, but this time the main focus is on the Mexican community. Once again we have extremist groups that want to cleanse the country from foreigners. The Purge in this case never ends, as people keep committing crimes even after the 12 hours period is over. America got over the Purge and became mad. The country will collapse real soon, like this franchise. Screenwriters completely run out of ideas. We have once again nighttime urban guerrilla scenes, a group of people that need to accomplish an objective and several obstacles along the way. Moreover, all characters can use a weapon very efficiently, even if they do not have any prior experience with them. Probably the only positive thing is a couple of long and particularly creative takes.I was not expecting a deep and meaningful movie, but something at least a little bit different. There is one twist at the very beginning of this film, and the rest are recycled ideas from previous chapters. I think that five flicks and a TV show are more than enough, it is time to end this franchise.",The Forever Purge

54,Brooklynsmagicmike,"It had some flaws, but overall It was good.",7,18 August 2021,"I'm huge fan of the Purge series and but almost avoided this one due to the massively negative feedback. The premise also diddn't entice me at all either. However I went on date and she was begging to see it so decided to give it try.I was honestly surprised it wasn't terrible by any means, in fact I thought it was good. I will say though that it is definitely the weakest one in series however. The movie's pacing was decent. It does start of bit slow/draggy but once it gets going its a fun ride from there on in. I wouldn't qualify this as horror movie however though there was zero scares and it was mainly action packed shooter. Which I felt it did succeed as, great shootouts, hand to hand fights, and so on. But for the people looking for frights they won't be happy. The main characters while I did find myself rooting for them and thought the acting was fine, I wasn't super enthralled/in love with them by any means and thought they were very one dimensional. As far as the visuals go the movie did great job on that end.Overall I would recommed it. The movies good time killer that'll keep you entertained if you're into gory shoot em ups.",The Forever Purge
55,movieman6-413-929510,Hopefully the Purge movies don't go on forever.,2,4 July 2021,"The Forever Purge is the fifth film in the Purge film series. The movie is directed by Everardo Gout, this is only the first movie he has directed and before this he has only directed TV episodes of various TV series.In the film, the US government has restarted the annual Purge program. For example, there is another night in the year when all crimes including murder are allowed. When the Purge night is over, a cult decides to break the rules and go ahead with the Purge. Juan (Tenoch Huerta) must now protect his own family and the family he works for from the criminals who are now breaking all the rules.That this film was made by a novice director and the writer of all Purge films is reflected in the quality of the film. The Purge events seem a bit repetitive and exaggerated and are portrayed in a cheap way. For example, many deaths are filmed off-screen, so that you often do not get to see the end result.By now playing the Purge events in daylight, the film does lose the tension that slasher films have by letting the killer commit his murders in the shadows of the night. This way you can also see the cheapness of the film earlier. Slasher fans may be annoyed by the cheap and unrealistic horror effects. Dolls were used for the dead bodies and the fake blood is thicker and darker than real blood. Furthermore, they only try to create tension with jump scares, but most of them are predictable and don't work like that.Like the other Purge film, the film also has a political message. This time it's a lot about how hard it is for immigrants in a new homeland with a corrupt, racist society.The film cast also consists more of actors who have played more TV roles or only minor movie roles. Most also play characters that aren't really developed in the film, making the viewer quickly forget their names and what they do. When a name is mentioned of a character who has disappeared or has been killed, you often do not know exactly which character it is.",The Forever Purge
56,payasoingenioso,Solid,9,5 November 2021,"I appreciate how the movie focused on us all treating each other better.The reviews about race are inaccurate, considering there was little to no mention in the movie.There is ethnicity bias; however, The Purge series generally is equal opportunity with its character stories.I look forward to future films. The TV series should return, because it supplements the films well.",The Forever Purge
57,coombsstephen,You know what you are getting but it was well done,7,22 July 2021,I think you know going into a purge film what to expect but this film did it better than I expected it to.There was plenty of the usual action but with plenty twists and turns and a perfect pace.Well worth a watch if this is your sort of thing.,The Forever Purge
58,Darkjak007,Pointless & Mediocre,4,29 August 2021,"The forever Purge is more of the same pandering we've gotten for all of these films we fellow a group of people trying to avoid! A bunch of Murderers because that's all people want to do is kill. It human Nature Not Vandalism or Rob a depository Reserve just kill. It's also nice that this film makes election year entirely pointless with the new founding fathers regaining control and reinstating the purge. However when this conclusion of the purge comes to an end many group cease to do so and a national outbreak occurred all across the United States of people still purging. America has fallen the only safe havens are Canada & Mexico. While in the past where the movies were more theme towards human nature for blood and carnage. They slowly pushed more towards the eliminating of the poor class and ideas of minority prejudice. This film is just straight out racism and prejudices it really heavy fist the idea to the point it just lazy with a group of illegal immigrants and neo-Nazis. None of these characters leave a impact you won't remember anyone's name. This is also a Cheap movie really cheap this is clearly the one of the entire series with the smallest budget looking more a Sci-fi Channel Film. Terrible effects, shaking camera and bad lighting.",The Forever Purge
59,darkreignn,"A big step back when compared to the other ""Purge"" films",5,2 July 2021,"""God bless the New Founding Fathers."" - it's a phrase we've heard time and time again throughout the five films in ""The Purge"" franchise. And in the past, the statement has an iconic sense of American pride associated with it; God bless the New Founding Fathers for instating the Purge, an annual holiday where, for 12 hours, one is free to do as he or she pleases, freed from constraints of the law. To put it simply, the Purge was to be seen as the single greatest American holiday, and participating in it the pinnacle of American independence. ""The Forever Purge"" takes this sentiment and twists it on its head by portraying a group of overzealous ""patriots"" who have perverted the annual Purge by taking the opportunity to turn it into a macabre, violent effort of racial cleansing - there's just one catch: they want this new type of purge to last forever.""The Purge"" films have never shied away from political commentary. With ""The First Purge"" tackling the issue of racism, and the previous films showcasing how dirty, greedy politicians can turn people against each other while sitting pretty in their ivory towers, these movies have always been slightly political. And in my eyes, that was part of the fun. The concept of evil politicians creating a holiday where, for 12 hours, everyone can go outside and murder each other is genuinely interesting, and the movies usually do a good job of presenting the dichotomy between people who partake for fun, for feelings of patriotism, for revenge, and those who would simply wish to stay off the streets and stay safe. However, ""The Forever Purge"" takes this political undercurrent and practically beats viewers over the head with it, unfortunately at the cost of entertainment value.There's only so much political commentary a movie can make before it becomes ham-fisted instead of cleverly integrated - ""The Forever Purge"" has political commentary that is so on the nose even a blind and deaf person would be able to pick up on it. Characters have non-conversations about race; by non-conversations, I mean that no one would ever speak like this to each other in real life. For example, when a Mexican man asks a white man if he doesn't like him because he's Mexican, the white man says something along the lines of, ""I have no problem with Mexicans, I just think everyone should stay with their own."" I mean, really? You're trying to survive a night where everyone is out to brutally murder you without mercy, and you decide the most important thing to talk about is the issue of race? Give me a break. Most of the political conversations in this movie play out the same way - they are not meant for character building, but instead to lecture the audience. Another scene where a man is being threatened with a gun to his head has him explaining how America has always been a capitalistic wasteland ever since the original settlers have stolen the lands from the Native Americans. The dialogue is so in your face that you won't be able to help but cringe.But, if you're going to see this movie, you'll most likely be expecting this political river running through the film - what you're probably more interested in is the action. How is it? Let's just say, not good. While there are a few fun one-shot-takes and uniquely filmed kills, most of the violence feels weirdly sanitized. There's barely any blood or gore in this movie, and I don't know about you, but when I see a movie called ""The Forever Purge,"" I expect to leave the theatre drenched in blood. People will get shot, stabbed, bludgeoned, and more often than not the camera will pan away before the impact is shown, leaving viewers blue-balled without the satisfaction of a money shot. Was this, perhaps, a stylistic decision that is supposed to comment on the audience's expectation of violence, and the film's refusal to clearly depict it? Definitely not! I'd bet my entire life's savings that the film did this strictly to save money.So you walk into the theatre and buy a ticket - you're not getting good action, and you're not getting subtlety. So what are you getting? At the least, ""The Forever Purge"" is entertaining to watch purely because of its concept. The countdown to the Purge is exciting, and witnessing people continue the slaughter even after the 12 hour time limit is fun. That said, expect your enjoyment to be dampened by the heavy handed commentary, and the frightening lack of clear, coherent action. If this is truly the final ""Purge"" film, they certainly didn't save the best for last.",The Forever Purge

72,foxtografo,Unpopular heroes,7,26 August 2021,"It's funny, I actually think that the reason for which this movie is not so popular or better rated, is because the very core subject of the movie: racism.Maybe I'm wrong, but rarely a movie with a non ""American"" (Mexicans are American too, but lets please the common knowledge), I feel like this movie took a non commercial path that the average American public isn't interested in.In terms of story, it's quite simple but it takes an interesting turn as evolution of the franchise, I felt is one of the best in terms of characters and how they act in the situation given, which is basically, from my point of view, the reason to watch these kind of movies.The cinematography wasn't special or arty, but I think it aimed from the beginning to a realistic tone, more like the first one, than the flashy action from the 3 in the middle, from which 2 were abismal for me.The acting was ok, Huerta (Juan) is not a very expressive actor, but played well the character of the burned up foreigner. Reguera (Adela) isn't a great actress, but it's sympathetic enough and looks strong as the character and the rest of cast was solid in their parts.Overall it was a good movie, I think one of the best of the series, with a lot of flaws, sure, but they didn't affect me so much to the point of not enjoying the movie.",The Forever Purge

If the Purge is to last forever (Forever), it might beg the pernicious question of whether this is our final destination (Final Destination), or whether we could simply take a break from making movies for a year and explore the past and absorb at least some of the vast, historical content left behind by the lives of others.Even the characters, one of which is portrayed by a cheaper Kevin Costner, seem only slightly dismayed or partially resigned to the new normal, that the incessant bombardment of notifications, requests, and likes has at least psychologically violently grounded and pounded us into one of two camps: those who Purge, and those who don't. It is almost certainly true that There Are Things They Aren't Telling Us, but as the news is shown or heard throughout the Purges, will it ever dawn on anyone to question all of the Things They Are Telling Us?The poetic ironies forged related to racism, nationalism, protectionism, xenophobia, and acculturation could be predicted after the first few minutes, thus leading to the ultimate non-irony that The Forever Purge is telling us something or nothing at all.",The Forever Purge

Unfortunately Everardo Gout didn't come up with 'remarkable' killing scenes to please Purge fans (mind the choppy editing). Little developments on its characters made us hard to care.,The Forever Purge
87,Prophetik,Pretty stale movie,4,17 July 2021,"I watched the forever purge and it's about people that don't stop the purge and then they survive through it and this time the theme is just about politics and crazy people and tons of political problems that leads to racism to a race of people, but anyway its just a political view they're sharing I'm not sure anyways its not worth the watch.",The Forever Purge
88,HorrorOverEverything,"Politics Aside, This Is A Pretty Entertaining Action/Horror",6,30 July 2021,"Purge: Election Year in my opinion was one of the worst movies I have ever sat through in theaters, it was so bad that I completely gave up on the franchise after that and didn't bother seeing The First Purge. But after seeing the trailer for this film it looked more along the lines with Purge: Anarchy, which I thought was an entertaining Action movie, and really that's what this movie is.The plot line is fairly simple and doesn't really bring anything new to the table outside of The Purge lasting more than one day, but I felt like that one new element did make the film feel fresh and different from the others in the franchise. I also really liked our group of characters, no one is too overly cheesy (which has been a problem with these films in the past) and I found myself really rooting for them and not wanting anything to happen to them.Five years ago when I wrote a review for Purge: Election Year, my main focal point was that even with all the political messages aside it was just a really lousy movie. I felt the opposite with this film, while it does constantly try to push beliefs down your throat, it also offers a lot of exciting scenes, high gore level, and some fun characters.If you enjoyed Purge: Anarchy I think you will enjoy this one as well. Not the best, but was a pleasant surprise for me and a nice way to spend an hour and forty minutes.6.5/10.",The Forever Purge
89,catfanatic888,Worst Purge Movie By Far,3,27 July 2021,"Very weak and depressing. Script was terrible, the acting fell flat except for a few people. The racist storyline was tough to watch. It was just overall a poor movie. It's a shame because the others in the series are quite good.",The Forever Purge
90,BijeshNagesh,The Failure Purge,3,22 September 2021,"The very beginning of this film hinted at the sad possibility that its creators might have set it up to fail. Hate the idea of the Purge but enjoy the movies. At least, that's how my personal experience has been with the films in this franchise. I also liked select portions of the 2018 TV series.But with ""The Forever Purge"" it looked like the time had come to retire the whole thing and just usher in permanent normalcy. The bloody 'Orwellian' themes that have prevailed and entertained, even educated, viewers through this franchise turned from being a proud horse to a stubborn mule in ""Forever Purge"".This movie felt like it was trying too hard to impress and, when it wasn't, the plot dragged. Much like the mule reference I made earlier, the film attempted to carry a heavy load and climb uphill with it. I was so eager to watch this title, especially to see if they brought something new to it from what came before.There were more than a handful of subtle meanings and risqué topics in this 'yet another' Purge movie, but they seemed to stick to their old guns and serve up utter nonsense with no character- or plot-driven storyline worth appreciating. The jump-scares were quite lazy too.'Wild West' themes met 'Horse Whisperer' and 'Mad Max' moments only for all three to trip over each other and tumble down the cinematic stairs. More than a few character-centric scenes felt contrived. They were unartistic and wasteful.What was I to make of this moment involving this character? What are his/her motivations here? When does this movie actually begin? These are just some of the questions I kept asking myself as I watched.Plenty of racial bias... Intended to rile up certain viewers, I'm guessing. I think those scenes might have only ended up confusing and humiliating them instead - especially Mexicans and Native-Americans living in Texans, and those residing outside it. It was bad enough they used many a race-based cliché in this film, but it must have taken an entirely different kind of decision-maker to go about adding insult to injury.I must admit that out of curiosity to see just what the heck they wanted to convey in this film - and to write a proper review, of course - I had to force myself to sit through it. It was taking 'forever' to finish and had little to nothing to communicate or entertain throughout.It was like going to the movies, bringing back a bucket of popcorn, leaving it in the fridge, and eating it the following day. The film felt familiar, convenient, completely unoriginal, and atrociously edited. I send my condolences to the writers. I have a strange feeling that they were either guilty of crafting this madness or were made to do so by those with big hairy thumbs on large red buttons.For a movie with the word 'Forever' in its title, it truly looked like the end had come for this franchise, which otherwise showed potential. Even the low ratings on IMDB were a better foreshadowing of things to come than what some of the poorly crafted scenes in this film attempted to do by way of generating plot-tension.The movie - despite its botched-up CG work - was watchable...once...through gritted teeth and fraying nerves, and not in the edge-of-your-seat sense. 'Okay' costumes and makeup (for the purgers), 'good' musical scoring, and 'alright' violence were the only three elements I passably liked in ""The Forever Purge"".Caleb Tucker, played by Will Patton - whose talent they criminally under-used - gave the only real performance of note, short-lived as it was.It felt like watching an average crime unfold in a B-movie with no plot-form or story-structure. ""The Forever Purge"" was a forever stretch of delinquency, with a generous sprinkling of racial hate, anarchy, anti-rich sentiments, gun violence, and 'white supremacy' galore. In other words, the daily news (!).NONE of these themes were even properly framed in the classic 'Purge style' that made some of the previous movies/series in this franchise work. The film ran like an extended Reddit video-thread that the moderators forgot to ban. It's bad enough there was an ongoing border crisis in real-life Texas. This movie seemed to want to inadvertently throw distasteful fuel on an ill-timed fire.For a project that had an estimated $18,000,000 budget, I can't help but wonder what they did with all that moolah, and what they have to show for it. I just want to forever purge this movie from my mind, and purge bad filmmaking forever.I started watching this film (when it finally became available to stream) in the full-blooded hope that I would find it better than the ratings declared it to be. Alas, the people had spoken. All in favour of ending 'The Purge' franchise for good, rate nay. Motion passed, motion carried, the end.",The Forever Purge

92,garethvk,The Forever Purge Entertains In Places But Is Not One Of The Better Films In The Series,6,30 June 2021,"In what is being billed as the final Purge movie; ""The Forever Purge"" has arrived and like elements of the prior films; gains traction from current events which have only made elements of the film more chilling seeing how the film was originally planned for July of 2020.Following the abolition of the Purge at the end of the ""Purge Election Year""; the Holiday where all crime is legal for twelve hours is restored due to radical elements fueling fears of illegal immigration and the increase in crime immigrants will bring to the largely crime-free country.It is not made clear what happened with the new President who was a staunch critic of the Purge and only that it has been restored so citizens prepare for its return by arming up, barricading themselves, or paying for armed security in a fortified locale.It is against this backdrop that Adela (Ana de Reguera) has come to America fleeing the violence in her country as she enters illegally and finds work. Dylan Tucker (Josh Lucas) is a wealthy Rancher who along with his family hires friends and family of Adela though having some disdain for them and what they stand for.The Purge comes and goes with the main cast unaffected and as they prepare to resume their lives; roving bands of armed gangs have continued to Purge in violation of the law similar to those who took to the street in protest of the election and plans to eliminate the Purge years prior.This new group is well organized and has no issues taking on law enforcement and the military forcing Dylan, Adela, and their family and friends to flee for their lives. As the terror spreads, their only safety is to try to make it to Mexico who along with Canada has agreed to a six hour window to allow people to cross to escape the violence.As the danger mounts, the severity of the movement is known as the authorities seem powerless to control and stop what is called The Forever Purge.The film uses a slightly different formula than the prior films which focused mainly on a group of people trying to survive the night and the terrors that come with Purge Night. There is a greater emphasis on racism and Xenophobia this time around directed more towards foreigners than minorities and poverty-stricken individuals but the underlying message is the same.This time around we are given a longer timeframe of terror and more social commentary as there are elements from the film which seem eerily inspired by headlines past and present which makes the film even more chilling.While the story is rather bare and the characters do not get much development; the movie should give fans of the series what they look forward to although it lacks the dramatic tension of the previous films.In the end ""The Forever Purge"" is an interesting new chapter in the series but not one of the stronger entries and serves as an effective finale to the series should this turn out to be the final film.3 stars out of 5

100,alexscott-35299,Not as bad as expected!,6,18 July 2021,"After the last couple purge films started to decline in quality I really thought this was going to be another rehash of the last few, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. The first 30 mins were dreadful in all fairness, I was genuinely cringing at some of the acting and camera work. It slowly started to pick up as the movie got into the purge and got past all the character set up, although this is definitely not the most action packed purge film, it's definitely the most political and it really has it messages about race and class, like most of the films it really goes into detail and shows some people who are effected by these things. I like that this movie has a western vibe to it and it makes the purge setting feel more fresh and new. Some of the action scenes are beautifully shot with nice swooping shots of the carnage unfolding in the towns, and then there are some of the close up action shots, and they are just awful! Terrible shaky camera work which makes it almost impossible to see what is going on and it really ruins the feel of the film as the purge is normally really good with its action. The two female characters might be some of the worst actors I've seen in a while, both wooden and boring with no passion in their performances at all, compared to the rest of the cast they really stood out as the worst. I really did enjoy this movie, it really is just a rollercoaster of emotions all the way through and if it wasn't for a few of these issues I think this could be one of the best purge films. But please for the love of god, end this series now! We've seen enough of it and I genuinely don't know where they can even go with it now, I just hope it finishes up now because I'm just getting bored of seeing these films now.

That aspect in addition to the purge going on everyday gave it a different feel, yet the Purge gets repetitive when the same structures are used slightly differently.With that being said, Forever Purge provides a decent film revolving around elements others can relate to.

124,TharsheyN,The Forever Purge - A Great Effort!,8,19 July 2021,"First off, before I even get into my
review for this movie I want to say that I am not American and therefore the politics in this film while they draw some parallels to the current situation in my country doesn't affect me as much as it seems to have affected my fellow reviewers.The film itself, I will admit is the least visually pleasing from the series when it comes to the death, action and just general ""Purge Scenes"". This however is probably because of the inexperience if the man chosen to direct this film.The story for this movie I feel is exceptionally well done in terms of the series. We have the first purge which shows the origins and then we have 3 films of purging, thou the third purge does have the NFFA losing the vote. However in the forever purge rather then just at having another bunch of people surviving another purge the official purge actually ends rather quickly. However *SPOILERS AHEAD* a massive coup has occurred and people are still purging. All the bloodlust, hate and violence spills to the surface and this time it doesn't want to go away again. We follow the story of Adela and her husband Juan as they along with another ranch worker and the remaining members of the family they used to work for escape from the ranch as forever purgers continue purging even after the end of the official 12 hours of purging.The cast I feel was really well chosen, however the actors and actresses didn't have much to work with in terms of the development of their characters. My favorite character is Adela as we see her go from just a simple butcher worker to a ass kicking mexican bombshell that went up against the cartels and lived to tell the tale. The rest of the cast do an admirable job but don't get to really shine.All in all the movie was pretty great and I liked the casting choices, soundtrack, storyline etc...However with that being said the action sequences were a bit weaker compared to previous purge movies and the characters weren't utilized to their full potentials for the most part. This I blame completely on the director as the cast themselves did the best they could with what they had been given.Anyway 8/10 from me and I would recommend giving it a watch especially if you're able to ignore/not care about the politics that people keep crying about and just enjoy it as a movie.P.

After an introduction at the mexican border, the story takes place in Texas and starts on a ranch. After all the purging in a big city by former parts of the series, this installment shows the southern part of the U. S. I liked that.Because of Texas as the location for this movie it makes fully sense that the characters are mainly Mexicans, Americans and Native Americans.Compared to the former Purge movies, the story here has some changes concerning the motivations of the characters and the whole storyline. This aspect of this movie I liked too.The movie is tense. Sure, some plot points are rather classical, but the movie is still very gripping, has lots of action and heart.I liked the cinematography, good camera work, nice sound design and athmospheric soundtrack from the Newton Brothers. The sets are really good showing a world going insane.The actors are well casted and do the best out of their characters. It's not a character study, it's an action movie with thrills and some drama.Why does this movie get a rating of 8 points?The production values are great.The Forever Purge delivers.It's far better than ""The Fist Purge"".A gripping, tense well-done Action-Thriller for adults.Recommended.",The Forever Purge

135,adotson-98233,"One of the better Purge movies, but it's still meh.",5,4 August 2021,"""The Forever Purge"" is a okay attempt at another Purge movie but it still can't quite capture the potential these movies have.What I liked about the movie is that the scope is very good. There's some cool action going on and that movie helps deliver what the Purge can do. There's also some very good blood in the movie. It's nice and gory and I liked that. The acting too was good, and there is a very good idea here about wealth vs the poor, and even about immigration. The whole idea and scope of this movie is nice and refreshing.However this movie still failed to make me have hope in this series. This isn't a bad film, but it still doesn't do anything groundbreaking for the series. The issues I have is that the pacing is slow. The first 35 minutes are surprisingly dull. I got very bored in the first half of the movie, and I was waiting for the movie to finally get started, but it took too long. Also the characters aren't very well fleshed out. Even the two leads aside from them being Mexican, they just don't get any characterization. And finally the movie is filled with just cheap jump scares, and it got very annoying.Overall ""The Forever Purge"" fails to fully engage with its themes, but it does offer some good acting, and decent enough action for me to say it's one of the better films in the series.",The Forever Purge

The original Purge movie subtly dealt with issues of class and race, but by the last movie, the series had jumped the shark with these issues. For me, this reincarnation of the theme handled these social issues with more sophistication while not being too politically correct or sensitive - I felt like i was still watching a horror/thriller.

148,ryanwesthamfan,Forgettable,4,15 July 2021,"The Forever Purge is the fifth instalment in the Purge franchise and although it is being rumoured to be the final one of the franchise. It also ends up being the most forgettable of them all as well.The Good- Now this isn't a terrible movie. Some of the direction, cinematography and set designs here and action scenes were pretty well done. Our two main leads also give some pretty good performances as well.The Bad- This film is very heavy handed. The idea they had seemed like a good idea however it just came across as a bit too much and came across as more of a parody of a Purge film and didn't really feel like it was a Purge film. It just sort of lost the vibe that we have gotten from the latter instalments of this franchise. The killers weren't exactly that memorable they just felt very underwhelming apart from 1 or 2 moments throughout the film.Overall Thoughts- Like I said it is not a terrible movie some good cinematography and performances and some good action sequences. However when it comes down to the concept of the film, the characters and the story it doesn't reach the heights that the other Purge films were able to reach. By the end of the film I said to myself I will probably never watch that again because of how forgettable and there is nothing memorable going on here. If your not a fan of this franchise this one probably won't win you over, if you are a fan you might enjoy it however you probably won't remember it.

The concept is hard to criticize because it introduces a new twist to the saga, that maybe a part of the audience needed. It is properly introduced and contextualized in the first half of the movie, which is very enjoyable and entertaining.When it gets slightly past it, the movie loses personality and that ""purge flavor"" dissolves and it becomes a generic action/guerrilla one. Unlike the other movies from the series, the climax towards the end is chaotic and not engaging. Even the villains' looks and attitudes are progressively less edgy.I get it that maybe it's a choice they made, to get the picture closer to reality and further from the franchise aesthetic. The probably thought it'd make it more haunting, since it reflects actual racial tensions and a still unresolved issue of violence and discrimination. I think the political strenght of the franchise, though, lies exactly in the edgy mannerisms, situations, charachter design and dialogues (that were more present in the first half).

156,ashishagupta,Take a 2 hour break from watching FOX news and go watch this movie instead,9,23 July 2021,"The movies in the purge series have an undercurrent of socio-economic, racial, political, etc. Issues. It is rare to receive a narrative from the disenfranchised in the American south. This installment of the Purge series does justice by the original inhabitants of the United States, particularly in and around the state of Texas.In the 2004 movie, ""The day after tomorrow"", it is the advent of climate change that instigates are mass exodus of American citizens to Mexico. The political commentary there was that in an ever changing world, the once high and mighty, will be brought to their knees and need aid from the very people they always denigrated.This 2021 movie, has a similar political commentary with the exception that the cataclysm is not climate change but extreme political polarization. It is not freezing weather but fascism boiling over that compels American citizens to seek aid from the very people they relentlessly denigrate.The movie script is reasonably well written. It includes numerous references to recent socio-political issues and events surrounding native americans and latin americans.The movie does not pull any punches in its depiction of white american entitlement. Most white americans are brain washed from birth into thinking they are special and should always think of themselves as special and always expect to be treated as special. Ironically, most of the review comments here reinforce this point made in the movie. Most of the comments rant along the lines of, ""I expect to be entertained by any movie in which the implicit and explicit message should always reinforce my unqualified sense of entitlement and superiority. How dare a movie shed light on the destructive ramifications of my white supremacism and call itself entertainment."".It is completely besides the point that this movie might be entertaining, perhaps even provide catharsis, for the hundreds of millions of non-white people. However, the rationale in most comments is that non-white people are not really humans, so entertaining them is not really entertaining humans, therefore the movie is fundamentally not entertaining, QED!

176,jprice-38253,The BEST of the franchise! Non Stop Purging! More Expansion!,10,4 July 2021,"I've been a long time Purge fan ever since the first one came out in 2013. Seen them all. Same concept, takes place in a city, at night, have 12 hours, ends next morning. Well, surprisingly, I was extremely impressed and so so happy that this one in particular had a different concept, a different story and much more expansion that I was not even expecting at all from The Forever Purge.First off I gotta say actor Josh Lucas, who I know from Glory Road (2005), and Ana De La Reguera who I know from Nacho Libre (2006), both do an amazing job of carrying the movie. And the other actors do as well too! I was interested in everyone, no matter who it was, even if it was just someone on the screen for a couple minutes, I was still interested. All the purge murderer costume designs were very cool! Various outfits and masks.Since I can't really spoil anything, the only thing I can tell you what's so different and why I think it's the BEST, is because in this one, you not only have your regular 12 hour purge, but even after it's over, Non Stop Purging still continues and never ever stops. And it doesn't stay in one place either. Be prepared to go through a lot of traveling, alot of blood, alot of guns and alot of shooting Lol. This film also gave off some sort of message, that no matter what happens on this Earth, whether it's a war or the end of the world, all races of all kind must come together! Humanity must come together. So I thought that was neat!If you've been a hardcore Purge fan and still are, then you'll obviously really like this. If you're not a fan of the series at all whatsoever, then of course you probably won't like it and won't really understand it. Definitely recommend seeing this with your friends, your loved one or your family.

And to constant scenes of violence.Very briefly The Purge is an event that takes place annually in the United States for 12 hours and that any and all crime up to murder is free, that is, you can do whatever you want in these 12 hours that no law will restrict you, in this fifth and supposedly ""last ""The film of the saga takes place in Texas, covering issues such as immigration and borders between countries, the film is so much established in this political and social plot but it is something so poorly explored that it ends up being there only to consume screen time with lines, clearly the The film was thought to be released as a manifestation of acts of the current US government but because of the pandemic it launched in a period that I don't know if it still has as much impact as it would have if it was released months ago. But anyway the film is extremely shallow with no depth to the themes that ends up having no impact.About the plot itself it is not very confusing, years ago it was released 12 hours to survive and at the end of it we found out that the night of Purge would no longer exist, thus generating waves of demonstrations across the country and chaos reigning, in this film I thought that would explore exactly that, the new government trying to keep the peace in the country while trying to expose the population to the real reason the Purge night exists and thus have the NFFA fall, but the film just forgets that focusing on a story I can't even fit right on the timeline as no clues are given at what time the film takes place (Before or after the Revocation of the Purge).As stated above, I was disappointed with the film because the concept is good but the execution is sad because it was so poorly done, wanting to present to us the viewer only a graphic violence... I won't go too far as I have several points to point out about this film and the rest, if I were going to write everything, it would almost be a book. The movie itself isn't bad, I even had fun watching it, but it's pretty standard for the others, just changing what happens during the day and not at night. The Forever Purge closure with a note: 5.",The Forever Purge
186,billygoonerbays-74727,Entertaining,7,17 July 2021,By no means the strongest purge movie but it sure does hold up well and is a good addition to the franchise. The cast did really well and I like the idea of people going against the idea of the purge only being one night a year as it adds suspension and makes you wonder if their will be another purge movie .,The Forever Purge
187,keithparks42,Alternate Timeline,9,10 July 2021,"Another fantastic feat for the franchise, and a sweet loving one to conclude a franchise that feels like it almost could've happened in real life given the ex-president and insurrection.If you haven't seen the previous films, fret not for this could stand alone. It's the best and last, and hopefully it stays fiction.",The Forever Purge
188,ammaples17,It was good,10,2 July 2021,"If you are sensitive to racism and the border wall, then don't see it. Many people got up and left because it was a bunch of white folks going after Mexicans the entire time. Over all its good it needed some more action and more kills.",The Forever Purge
189,sauerkraut-96467,Worse premise for a movie EVER,1,21 July 2021,The whole basis of this movie is based upon a law that could never happen. It would be ruled unconstitutional before it was ever enacted. So the entire movie just made me laugh all the way through. I seriously cannot understand how they found anyone stupid enough to finance this movie!,The Forever Purge
190,zeuthuk,Glorious Violence,7,25 July 2021,"A non stop ride of killing and violence, a true journey into madness.The film is mostly a war between the far right attacking immigrants with brown and black saviours fighting back. The Purge is a Liberal masterpiece that managed to intertwine wokeism into a visual blood bath. The writers excelled themselves and captured the current political climate brilliantly.Females had strong leads and got their hands bloody pushing back against the protagonists. Female power.The Mexican saviour was so brave questioning his rich white boss on suspected racism. Hopefully this inspires more people to call out racism.We and others in the cinema gave the film a standing ovation for its bravery in addressing difficult political issues.Thank you Hollywood.",The Forever Purge
191,firatberkk,Waste of time and money!,2,24 July 2021,"I regret going this movie on theater. Previous series, however, lacking parts, were mesmerizing us by the idea of 'what if'? Delineating emotions were always lacking but it was trivial as long as made us think what would we do in such a situation. All the action and idea (of purging) have been left out in this one and turned it into a 100+ mins long cacophony.Everything could have been better either with reflecting emotions or having proper action scenes. I hope this will be the end of this series; since it goes nowhere.",The Forever Purge
192,zeljka-56697,This is not a good movie,6,17 July 2021,I watched it with little expectation but this was even worse than i expected. You will NOT love or like this movie at all. I can't believe they still do such bad movies even with large budget.,The Forever Purge

Yes, I wasn't wowed but it kept me more interested than I expected.I get the whole hate but I think people should learn to either reject or accept a movie strictly based on what it presents and not so much on it's implications or in comparison to another.For all we know, a movie is meant to entertain, now when it fails to do that, you can attack all you want. I would say they did a very nice job here. Yes it's not as endearing as the purge we are used to but it's interesting in its own right. I think if there is a sequel,I'll be here for all of it. Should be a 6, but for all the unfair 3s and 1s, I give it a 7.",The Forever Purge
195,looking_Work,7.5 but Better,8,3 July 2021,"After reading the reviews I went in with low expectations but was more than pleasantly surprised. There was a bit of suspense at the beginning but after that you clearly knew who would live or die. I enjoyed the Mexican/immigrant and White angle. If you remember The Day After Tomorrow, then you will see some similarities here when it comes to the story as a whole. There are some some on point current day political messages not so subtly thrown in but they do not distract from the movie. The final fight scene was a bit contrived but overall this is a nice fit into the franchise.",The Forever Purge
196,myny-jeffrey,"Not the best Purge movie, but certainly the most realistic",8,29 July 2021,"This is the most realistic Purge movie that just shows exactly how anarchy would be if it was forever and eternal. While this movie doesn't show you the small rulebreakers that were just purging to kill just 1 guy or to be exhibitionistic of some sort, nor does it show the excentric purgers and I guess that is why it's rating is just a little bit lower. But that absolutely doesn't mean you can skip this one.",The Forever Purge
197,jeanbal,Don't believe the MAGA reviewers!,9,27 September 2021,"The Forever Purge is one of the best film in the Purge series. No doubt about this. Well filmed, with excellent actors, it's litterally terrifying. Why? Because it reflects a lot what America is slowly becoming today. Hatred growing in a land guided by its love of firearms, what is shown in this work of fiction is bound to happen. This dystopian movie does not show the « real US », that's agreed, but what they may become if nothing change. It is time to re-learn how to live in peace with our fellows humans.

Tbf you are either going to agree with the message or enjoy watching psychos trying to kill people of different origins . The ones it will upset are white middle class that love to say they don't have a problems with POC but when watching something like this they can't help but feel offended . If that's you then oh I bet you haasaaateeeeee this film . Oh I'm white btw and I enjoyed the film for what it was and because I'm not a bigot nothing was offence just entertaining.

Disappointing,3,2 August 2021,"Although i like the first 3 purge films and hated the first purge my expectations were not very high for this one and man the movie was Disappointing....first half was bad the second half was way to predictable like we knew that they will kill the Mexican guy who fell in love with the American guy's sister. Not only that, in climax when they are left with 0 ammunitions they all are hiding behind the bus in an completely open field and still they all were able to escape like watt!!??..Overall the movie had nothing new to offer, won't recommend it.",The Forever Purge

These movies need to stop coming around, there's just no point anymore. Bland action, cheesy script, and one of the worst screenplays I've seen this year.

Land of the free and home of the brave.Those so called ""Patriots"" who look at all the work and effort that went into making this movie and dismiss it as garbage not even worth 3 stars out of 10 are angry because they see themselves being portrayed negatively as many of them feel exactly the way the antagonists are being shown in The Forever Purge.Surest way to offend a minority is to tell a truth they don't want to hear. A lot of the naysayers to this movie are among a minority, a large minority yes, but a minority nonetheless. They would have liked this movie a whole lot better if the Forever Purgers were the heros instead of the villains.Watch the movie for yourself and decide.

He has the looks + the talent!Josh lucas is giving his best (worst?) kevin costner imitation which is cringy at first but bearable as the story continues.The ending could have been darker and also shown a kind of in the future'-sequence to keep the viewers hooked for the next part - bc i really hope theres going to be another purge flick.",The Forever Purge

224,matt-87154,3rd best Purge movie...don't listen to the MAGA reviews...,7,18 July 2021,"Big fan of the Purge movies as they've always had a dystopian political message to them. I thought this one was 3rd best (after Purge 1 & 2). However, Purge 1 is best in the series by far.I did want to take a moment to address other reviews saying this was too political and 'woke'. First, every single Purge film has been political and this one is no different. Second, as for 'woke' what does that even mean?!? Because it doesn't have all white male leads and has a diverse cast that fits the storyline? I'm sick and tired of seeing MAGA fans review movies on here and literally bash any movie that has a female or minority lead in it.As for the film itself, the story was believable especially how the 'Ever After Purge' group closely resembles the MAGA / Insurrectionists crowd. So from a political standpoint, I think it hit too close to home for a certain subset of this country that doesn't like to see a mirror held up to their views,Acting was good and it was great to see Josh Lucas back in a starring role. Will Patton was also good albeit in a small role. Ana de la Reguera is very good in every role she has and this is no different.Directing and pacing was fine...and very suspenseful in the first 2 acts. The third act drags a bit though and is predictable.TL;DR - Ignore the comments on 'wokeness' and enjoy the film for what it is. The third best entry in the Purge series.",The Forever Purge

226,bb74,The Best Purge Film,10,4 July 2021,"The people reviewing this film as the worst in the series or as ""woke trash"" do not like hearing the truth about the political climate in America and where it could potentially be headed. Yes, this is a political horror film that is not subtle about it in the way Romero was, and it certainly, indirectly reflects the current political climate of America today. It is clear who The Forever Purgers reflect in today's political reality while it is clear who the rest of the characters reflect.The film is an improvement over the films in that it takes The Purge to the next level. Although the film is not as violent as Anarchy and Election Year, it does reflect how The Purge continues to divide a nation but explores aspects of racism and unity among people.As I saw this film, I asked myself, what will my country look like in the future? Aer my politics indicative of how I treat and feel about other people? What can I do to make my country a better place?

253,duckittclayton,Stop this nonsense,4,18 July 2021,"I'm at a point where if I watch a series (some successful, some not) I tend to lose interest as it becomes repetitive the longer it goes on. The Purge series started off interesting and the second one was argubly my favorite one, but as far as film series go in Hollywood; if the money is good, the series will continue.Add another two after that and you have The Forever Purge, which has a new twist in the series. I'm all for a good twist but this film lacked that and more. Maybe I was watching too much Walking Dead because it did feel like that at times.Either way, it will still appeal to Purge fans who can expect the odd jump scares and gore. There's surprisingly a good message as well but I just feel like this series is getting a bit tired.",The Forever Purge

256,simon_b-03265,Other commenters are way too hard on this movie.,7,7 August 2021,This movie had bad action sequences with poor camera work but saying it was unwatchable because of that reason is way too malladramatic.The acting is mediocre but they still managed to pull the performance off good enough for me to enjoy it and I'm picky when it comes to acting.The plot I think was great. Some things that may seem like patching of plot holes are actually meant to be there but you can't appreciate it if you don't imagine how it is to actually cross boarders or live with Mexican culture.The director clearly wanted to bring about a political message and I think he did great. Its a comment on America through caricature that takes the negatives to the extremes. This brings to light the issues USA is facing right now.Overall this was a 6-7/10 movie. Not a 5/10.,The Forever Purge
257,been_wondering,🛑 No white person was harmed in the making of this film 🛑,8,15 August 2021,"It was a political commentary on immigration and racism - apart from the nod at social hierarchy and wealth distribution from the franchise.I enjoyed most of it, it was refreshing to see Mexican characters as the main ones, did they lack complexity and dynamism? Sure! But if you're looking for that in this sort of films you're probably looking in the wrong place.The action was okay, there weren't any big twists apart from what the name implies, it was entertaining enough, the whole movie I was thinking ""How the turntables!"".If you truly think about it, the political portrayal wasn't that much blown out of proportions, which is pretty sad, but a great way to start conversations.",The Forever Purge

I might have caught a bit of the third movie on television but that was about all. Lately I've been watching undesirable movies in the theater in order to stay cool. After getting a unlimited pass, I decided to view this film. It wasn't as bad as I believed that it was going to be. It's not bad for what it is. I was able to stay interested in the action without regret. The movie has some unnecessary action sequences with predictable jump scenes. The movie overall is very unrealistic but it's all in good fun. The film also has a strong message behind the madness. Don't over think this silly plot and just enjoy.",The Forever Purge

So bad, it must be on purpose. Like, really.",The Forever Purge
265,jboormancross,A few mistakes off of brilliant,6,25 July 2021,"Before talking about the various issues with the film I should first start with praising the director and cinematographer for their exceptional work considering the pretty weak script they were given. The cinematography really stood out in this film, in particular the film's long one take that takes place after the group ditches their truck to walk on foot through the oncoming gunfire they face. It's clear that a lot of effort went into the actual shooting of the film which is supported by a fairly solid performance from the main cast (the same can't be said for any of the film's antagonists, in particular the insanely irritating characters we see in the police van early on.)Many reviews seem overly critical of the films political messaging which seems bizarre to me considering this has always been a factor to the franchise. However in this film it has to be said that they really hit the nail on the head with the social and political issues. As true and as well intended as these messages are they do come across incredibly preachy. It's frustrating that the writers don't consider showing us this conflict or expressing them through metaphors instead of dumbing it down and outright talking about the Issues in the least creative ways possible. It comes across incredibly lazy which is very disappointing considering how good of a job other members of the crew have done.I went into this film expecting absolutely nothing and came out incredibly surprised and enjoyed the film in it's entirety. I'd say that maybe I'd need a second viewing in order to finalise my opinion of it as the fact that I had just seem old and space Jam 2 right before watching this, may have caused me to enjoy this film far more than I should have but overall I'd say the film is a solid 6.5/10. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more of the director's work in the future. For anyone considering a trip to the cinema anytime soon I'd definitely recommend this film over the absolute mess of space jam 2 and old.",The Forever Purge

274,usfder-70853,Just aweful,1,19 July 2021,"I have recently rewatched all the Purge Movies and while they are certainly not cinematic masterpieces they always made you feel for your main characters and they had tension.This on the other hand...
I couldn't really feel for the main characters... maybe because the mexican main characters speak spanish 90% of the time and i didn't understand anything.... Yes sure there are subtitles and letting mexicans speak spanish surely is authentic but if 50% of a movie is spoken in another language you seriously have to consider if this is actually an english movie.....
That problem aside
While in the other Purge Movies you always felt some kind of terror from the Purgers because they were unpredictable and you never knew what could happen, here...
the Purgers are 1 Dimensional, for much of the time they are just background noise that the main characters just kill without anything to fear.The explanation why the NFFA is back in power is lacking at best and i feel this movie was just made to mirror some current problems into a Purge Movie just to send some kind of political message... just the wrong one for this movie...
The Purge movies had always a somewhat timeless political message Poor vs. Rich but noooo we couldn't continue with this, we just had to take another current day issue and force it onto a movie unfit for it.",The Forever Purge

This made for a super-corny script.The wardrobe was pretty cheesy as well.The actors couldn't do a whole lot with the awful script, but what they did do wasn't bad.

The violence and effects were as shocking as expected. The story line was just as crappy as all the Purge movies. This movie is a FICTIONAL version of America.... just like the rest of the Purge movies. Obviously there are a lot of people in the reviews who were very triggered by some of the concepts. Guess people don't like seeing a mirror held up to the absurdity of how half the country sees the other half. Was it cringey to see a Nazi yell the names of guns? Remember when we all agreed Nazi's were bad and stupid? Well if you think this movie was political because it pointed out that these are bad guys then maybe you need to think about how you align morally.

I think it is the plot being original and never been shown on screen is what made it 10 for me.I am a Republican...A real Republican...meaning who is conservative and is about the founding fathers as Christians of USA and treating all people regardless of their background with love. I am not far left/right and not democrat. Some people call themselves Republicans but are not real Republicans because they are really about hate and not love. This movie basically flipped things and puts Americans in other peoples shoes as to what is happening in real life. This franchise is not about purging. It is about how far one will go with hate and if it can be stronger than law itself...God Himself. Comes back to love, regardless if you believe in God or not.

But thinking of this movie belonging to the Purge franchise makes this one the worst of all. I don't know why, the story, the acting, the over all concept didn't gave me anything I expected!

You'll probably get something pretty close to what we have here.Terriblo plot apart, the characters are tasteless, the action is less than interesting to watch, and while the first movie could give you some scary moment, this one made me yawn.This movie is here to serve a woke agenda. It discribes an impossible society where the bad right-winger and white people have fun killing everyone. In the previous movies the blood thirsty white people would kill other only until the end of the purge, but in this one, the bad bad bad white people never stop killing, because the concept was not extreme and ridiculous enough in the first place.Dont loose your time, and certainly not your money on this one people.",The Forever Purge

New masks. New ideas.Parts of it reminded me of the last episode of black summer season 1.I didn't find the race elements too heavy handed. Something unsaid. The people purging the Hispanics we're basically killing all the workers in the local meat plant leaving no one to process meat. Same could be said for agriculture.

You ask why? Here are my reasons: First, the message of the film is clear. America has been the victim of its annual Night of Purge. It also shows us the causes of racism and how empty the message that America is only for white Americans is. It can be a real America with diversity within America.

People who wrote 1 star reviews are way off base, it's a horror/slasher popcorn movie, Josh Lucas and Will Patten are o.k. In it.

I think the acting was okay, not the greatest but I've seen worse. The plot talks about real world problems and this installment of purge hits closer to home then any of the others in the purge series. Because of that it's going to get hate.

376,cddesign-84968,A Great Job with the Franchise.,9,24 July 2021,"The Forever Purge MovieUnlike DC Comics. The secrete with Marvel Comics is that it's characters and story lines are mirrored hybrids of the social ills and heroes of 20th century American History. The The Falcon and the Winter Soldier : Finding Zemo was not a pandering to today's #blacklivesmatter movement. That is who Marvel is. A discussion on actual American history and culture through the lens of it's class and fasism. See the X-Men.With that being said, ""The Purge"" movies may be the only thing that can save this country from itself. #mirror I really appreciate the way they used the horror genre to provide a criticism on the true ills of this country that has been ignored for the last 70/500 years.Director and screen writer, James DeMonaco baited the target market in with violent sugar in the first movie.In movies 2-3, the Purge franchise Introduced you to the unsung heros of this nation. A Fred Hampton/Decons of Defense type of character who calls out and defends the people against a Fascist-wreckless government.But the 4th movie is a ginormous mirror for this country and what this extreme conservatism really would look like if they get their way. And DeMonaco and Co. Went out their way to create a film that can be watched by most teens. I guess that the discussion must be had. I respect the creators of the ""Purge franchise"" for this.Either an intervention trap for the Right and the Trumper/Oath Keeper (and their ilk)

I went to theaters to watch it and never even bothered to look at the trailer. Upon watching the movie you get to watch as rich white ranchers in Texas are ""enslaving"" Mexican workers, despite them actually working on the ranch. They try and push that whites are oppressing the workers. Put aside the political aspect of the movie and you can see that the acting was subpar. The animations of the blood, killing, and explosions look like they were done by a high school student. The plot itself could have been so much better, there wasn't a real story line to this movie.

I speak Spanish so I understood the movie very well and was thinking maybe the people who don't speak or understand it must have been very confused at parts.

I wish I could Purge it from my memory. Gave it a two because the last hour or so is non-stop action, but that can't redeem an otherwise senseless film.",The Forever Purge

It was a solid thriller but, as I expected (it being like the 5th in the series) it was pretty predictable. The politics involved didn't bother me at all, I just took it as is, just there to enjoy the film and not delve too deeply into the logistics of the political meaning.

420,tcrydjy,"Heavy on the Left, but overall decent if you can ignore the trash",4,30 October 2021,"I would've ranked this higher if they hadn't begun with imagery and comment that everyone's a white supremacist. There was a minimal attempt to counter that when Caleb Tucker (Will Patton) rants against Kirk (Will Brittain) while explaining to him how the government is using him as a puppet and enforcer (sound familiar anyone?). Of course the picture proceeds to essentially mark all white people as right-wing gun-toting anarchist psychopaths intent on destroying the world. Dot dot dot. If CNN were to document this, they'd call it a mostly peacful protest, not an outrageous slaughter, uprising, treason, insurrection - yet clearly this film portrays just such a thing, sanctioned by the government. So what are we to take from this? The implication is clearly an anti-trump-like response, but the implementation is also clearly a left-wing progressive 'burn it down' message. Nice job, Everardo - you managed a movie you, yourself, said was politically motivated, but still produced something that's fairly decent.",The Forever Purge
421,jenniferle-2,Good Movie True to Purge Franchise,8,8 July 2021,"First of all, I like a good moralizing horror movie. Purge movies are about race and class. Love it!In this film I liked all the main cast. It had a few humorous moments, a few emotional moments, lots of deaths. It made on-the-nose references to real-life ridiculous people and current events, I enjoy that too-no need for subtlety in a horror movie such as this.My 2 main knocks against this movie:
1st- It wasn't as scary in a straight up horror way as it could have been. There were not as many jump-scares, not as much time in the streets facing outrageous purgers, and too many scenes happened in daylight which made them less scary. The main villain was not the most scary of purgers.2nd- Costuming also wasn't as stylized as in some other Purge movies, which I missed. The purger's costumes it Election Year, for example had been really great. I get that the forever purgers were just white supremacists, but they were also not as visually exciting.Overall, a great way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes. I enjoyed it and will definitely watch it again sometime. Many who are hating on this movie seem like people who might not give you the best advice. If you like Purge movies go ahead and see this one!",The Forever Purge
422,domizi,Ridiculous,4,3 July 2021,"We all know that the purge series is a goofy movie because of the main plot, but this one it's ridiculous at times, for instance, 4 motorbikes could almost stop a trailer?

Seems like a lot of troll reviews on here. I'm guessing the movie hurt their sensibilities. Someone complained about there being killing through the movie? I don't know what they thought they would be watching. People also whining about politics? Get a grip. This is exactly why I don't read reviews before watching a movie I'm interested in.

434,jcbbullock,They've Always Been Political,8,5 July 2021,"I'm giving this film an 8/10 for this series alone. Many people are leaving reviews quoting ""liberal Hollywood"" and ""wokeness""-basically saying this film is too concerned with ""white supremacy"" being an issue in America.Here's a take from a white man. I assume these people leaving these reviews have failed to realize that they've always been political. But now that we've brought a topical issue into the franchise, it's just ""too far left."" Are you upset that you are watching a movie where your actions and beliefs aren't hailed as heroism?Sure, the writing is very cheesy and cliché in SEVERAL scenes. Many moments are obviously coming from the get-go. That's the way these movies are and always have been. So if you're going to the *cinema* to watch another mediocre action movie from a mediocre franchise, that's on you. If you don't care for the subject matter or direction because it hits a little too close to home-again, that's on you. Set aside your white-savior complex for 2 hours. I promise you it'll do a world of good.",The Forever Purge

then I write a review based on how the sound is mixed combined with picture quality and overall story of the film itself.I have watched this movie in 4k Ultra HD/hdr10 in 7.1 Dolby TrueHDThis movie, I've had high expectations before it came out. The story from the previous films were attractive to me in a way to say.. What if..
Also the picture quality and the sound were outstanding in the previous ones. Well in this one it has not changed, at all!! It is improved. The overal sharpness is better and takes an 7/10 the color is very vivid, especially compared to a good Dolby-vision movie that normally has more information on it's HDR track. The color gets a 9/10. The sound is more left-center-right based, and not very present in the surrounds. However mixing is professionally done, dialogue is very clear and not blend up by other surroundings. So sound I give a solid 6/10. The story however Is very milked and predictable. It didn't even get me through the whole movie.

446,vibormrva,Great movie-if not the best Purge movie ever!,8,23 October 2021,"When I've rented the movie, I wasn't thinking I'll be watching it again the next day too.The movie itself focuses more on the sociological aspects of the immigration and the dividing of the people in the USA on the basis of their homeland and ethnicity more than on just pure violence like the previous movies of the franchise were made, and therefore, touching the essence of the ""Purge"" concept and revealing the basic drive for hatred to the extent to take someone's life without remorse-or consequences.But, while the ""regular Purgers"" were ""purging"" for 12 consecutive hours like always, there was a bigger plan made within the certain people which had to be made very surgically so to speak, and the ""patriotic side"" of the USA took the ""Purge day"" to themselves to rearrange, ignoring the rules which are pretty basic-commencement at exact time and finishing at the exact time, firearm's level 4 and below are allowed and certain people (government officials etc.) are excluded from the ""freedom to kill"".When everyone was thinking that the siren for stopping the Purge day means that they're either free to exit the shelters and roam freely around their cities or to stop doing criminal activities, including murder, the situation was quite the opposite-organized gangs were still ""purging"", everyone who wasn't with them was considered enemy of them and their ideology to ""clean the America"" from migrants, therefore ignoring the NFFA and any laws of the government, ultimately leading to the clashes of them with the NFFA Army, and making it impossible for anyone to exile the USA towards the borders of Mexico and Canada which were accepting people without any arms for six hours. Desperate non-purgers were trying to get out of the country while they're still alive but, as the clashes were getting worse and the Army was actually defeated by ""patriots"" attacking them with firearms definitely above level 4, Mexico and Canada has decided to close the borders immediately, leaving the hordes of innocent people at the borders.Protagonists of the movie were successful at their escape but sustained the losses too after clashes with the ""patriots"" doing the purge on their own.When looking at the movie as the whole, it's greatly made, from good actors to the good masks, and effects are very realistic, so, that side of the movie is covered well too.I would recommend the movie to the lovers of the Purge franchise and if the next movie is on its way, I'm hopeful to see the similar thing, going deeper into the sociological essence of the ""purging"" concept rather than just plain blood and gore which doesn't explains much but shows effects.I'm very glad that I've watched this movie, I've almost skipped it!",The Forever Purge
