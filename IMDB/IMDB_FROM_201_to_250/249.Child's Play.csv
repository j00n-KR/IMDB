0,TheLittleSongbird,"In the mood to kill, not to play",8,2 December 2018,"Have an appreciation for horror, and that was one of two main reasons why 'Child's Play' was viewed in the first place. The other was, having been on a roll reviewing whole horror franchises recently, to see all of the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films featuring one of horror's most iconic villains Chucky the killer doll, wanting to see whether the character did deserve his horror icon status.Chucky definitely does deserve this distinction and a case of the character being better than the films. The 'Child's Play'/Chucky films are very variable, with this first film being by far the best if not perhaps the most well known of the series. This is not nostalgia talking, all the films were seen recently although there had been the intent of seeing them for a long time, and they would have been seen earlier than this if music commitments and a long watch and review list allowed me to. Don't be fooled by the premise, sure the premise is intriguing but it did sound cheesy, goofy and reminiscent of a formula slasher film.Actually what could and should have been a cheesy, goofy and formula slasher as the premise indicated turned out to be a hugely entertaining, surprisingly creative and genuinely scary film, important in introducing one to as said one of horror's most famous and iconic characters.Not an awful lot wrong here surprisingly. Perhaps Alex Vincent tries a little too hard in places, though mostly he does a decent job considering his age.But the only major fault is for me some of the pacing, with the first part of the film being on the sluggish side and one wishes that the point was gotten to earlier.However, 'Child's Play' looks slick and suitably ominous, with terrific special effects that blend very well, look eerily life-like and move easily, while the music looms eerily. Tom Holland's panache-filled direction is one of 'Child's Play's' biggest strengths and one of the main reasons why the film avoids falling into all of the traps that it could have done and what instead elevated it into a greater level. The script is darkly witty and clever with one-liners that are smart, frighteningly sarcastic and entertainingly twisted. The reveal is not one to forget and likewise with the nightmarish climax.Once 'Child's Play' gets going, it is non-stop entertainment value and atmospheric creepiness, with the attack scenes/kills and set pieces being creative and genuinely unsettling. Chucky is an unforgettable creation and one that the writers and effects team had a ball with (as well as Brad Dourif of course). The other characters were ones worth caring for and the acting is good from Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon. The biggest acting plus though is Dourif, the personification of malevolence.In summary, lots of fun and scary. Definitely recommended. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Child's Play
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not perfect, but an acceptable example of '80s horror",6,29 December 2015,"So here we have it, the first film that spawned a long-running and controversial film franchise about a possessed killer doll. Back in the late '80s and early '90s, a whole shed load of 'killer toy' movies hit the video shelves – I'm thinking the likes of PUPPET MASTER, DOLLY DEAREST, et al – and this is the one that spawned that briefly popular surfeit of miniature killers. However, CHILD'S PLAY is nothing new and indeed what it most recalled to me was the Karen Black segment of the '70s TV horror movie TRILOGY OF TERROR, in which a woman is menaced in her apartment by a voodoo fetish doll. The last twenty minutes of this movie are particularly reminiscent of that one.Anyway, CHILD'S PLAY isn't a bad film, pretty much par for the course for an '80s horror. It's not as cheesy as you might imagine and it showcases an excellent turn from Brad Dourif as both a killer and a killer doll. He's really having a ball here and his enthusiasm is infectious. The rest of the cast don't match him – heroine Catherine Hicks is adequate but sometimes bland, FRIGHT NIGHT's Chris Sarandon is wooden and child actor Alex Vincent is far too cute – but it could be worse.My biggest complaint is that the first half of this flick is far too slow. It's a kind of guessing game, leaving us in suspense as to the identity of the killer, wondering whether the kid is responsible after all. The problem is that EVERYBODY – even people who haven't seen any of these films – knows that the Chucky doll is indeed the bad guy; it's on the advertising after all! The whole of this mystery guessing-game could have been done away with in favour of more scares. Still, once the film gets going it's not bad, and the string of murders are fairly inventive (the electrocution death is particularly gruesome). I did really enjoy the climax, which reduces things to the classic situation of 'characters trapped and hunted by killer' and manages to be pretty exciting. Props too for the great special effects work, Chucky is indeed a demonic looking toy and quite frightening if you're of a nervous disposition.",Child's Play
2,SnoopyStyle,Good original thrilling horror,7,4 October 2013,"Serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) gets shot by detective Norris (Chris Sarandon). As he struggles with his last breath, he transfers his soul into a Good Guys doll. Meanwhile Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is a cash strapped single mom. Her kid is desperate for the doll, and she could only afford one from a shady homeless guy. It turns out that the doll has Charles Lee Ray's soul in it, and he wants to transfer to the kid.This is a well made horror. The general idea of a killer doll may be an old one. But this is done with some fun freshness. Director Tom Holland is definitely a good study of horror. He's able to inject a lot of good old fashion scares into this film. He hides Chucky in the act of killing until late in the movie. This allows the tension to build. And the reveal is great. The whole thing works. The only thing holding it back is a little bit of unintentionally camp. The F/X needs improvements. These are all forgivable. Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon are both good character actors. At its core, this is a good film.",Child's Play
3,Horst_In_Translation,The moment dolls are seen as creepy,6,8 November 2017,"""Child's Play"" is an American horror movie from 1988, so this one will have its 30th anniversary next year. The director is Tim Holland and he is also one of the three writers working on the script here. His movie launched the Chucky franchise that is still going on until today and actually very recently there was a new movie, directed by Don Mancini and he was the original writer of the story and in his mid-20s when this first and maybe best Chucky film came out. Interestingly enough they are not referencing the doll's name in the title yet here. The third writer was John Lafia and he also got his share of fame as he was the one directing the first sequel and the Chucky franchise made sure he launched his career. But back to this first film now. It is the story of a boy who badly wants a particular doll for his birthday. Unlucky for him this doll is possessed with the spirit of a serial killer and while he keeps looking for a human body to get into again, he happily pursues his hobby of killing people. The good ones and bad ones. The mother's friend is shown to us as a loyal caring person, but she gets killed just the same as the doctor who wants to sedate the boy with an injection. That murder scene is probably the toughest to watch as we see his head being roasted pretty much.I also enjoyed the watch from the comedy perspective. There are a few hilarious moments in here like the elevator scene with the old lady calling Chucky ugly and his reaction to it. You will recognize these moments when you see them. Another would be the constant comedy through disbelief by people reacting to other people saying the doll is alive. Aside from the very ""fantastic"" core plot and the shoddily executed black sorcery references, this isn't even an unrealistic film so much. For example somebody had to get the doll and a pretty normal boy/family did. I was wondering on some occasions if the cop would live eventually, but well it was obvious the mother and boy would in the end, but the story may not be the most daring really in terms of unexpected plot twists. It's all good though. It is a generic horror movie that is by the books and succeeds nicely with that formula. The best moment of it all is really when Chucky reveals himself to the mother the first time and we hear his real voice. The ending makes obvious that they weren't really expecting the success and to make a sequel as the story closes nicely pretty much, let alone that almost three decades later, there would still be new installments. At under 90 minutes, it isn't a long film at all, but it is a pretty entertaining one and maybe a bit on the underseen side still. I can see why it is considered cult by so many these days. It's also one for the masses, a bit on the mainstream side and definitely not just for horror film fanatics. These have seen it anyway already. Go check it out if you haven't yet. It truly is high time. You keep hearing more and more often these days that people find dolls creepy and this film is one of the defining reasons why. Way ahead of its time. Well done Mr. Mancini and everybody involved with this project. You deserve the fame.",Child's Play
4,lee_eisenberg,You're such a doll,10,1 February 2009,"One of the many horror movies - spawning series - that arose in the 1980s, ""Child's Play"" is a true pleasure to watch. Obviously, it's not the most polished horror flick, but who watches these movies for that? The point is to see the killer do his stuff, and Chucky does just that. The cast includes Catherine Hicks (the whale scientist in ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home""), Chris Sarandon (Prince Humperdinck in ""The Princess Bride"") and Brad Dourif (one of the patients in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"").All in all, this is definitely an enjoyable movie. In my opinion, the Academy Awards needs to have a special category to honor classic horror flicks that they ignored in earlier years, just so that they can give this one an Oscar. Really great! So yes, do give me the power...",Child's Play
5,jboothmillard,Child's Play,5,31 January 2007,"I first saw the infamous antagonist of the series in the fourth film, Bride of Chucky, I was keen to see the three original films before it, and see how he became popular in horror culture, from director Tom Holland (Fright Night). Basically detective Mike Norris (Fright Night's Chris Sarandon) is chasing the notorious murderer, ""The Lakeshore Strangler"", Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif, also voicing) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald, and James Earl Ray). Ray is mortally wounded by a gunshot, but before he dies he does a voodoo incantation to transport his soul into the body of a Play Pals Inc. Good Guy Doll. Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is celebrating his sixth birthday, after seeing the commercial, he is desperate to get a Good Guy Doll. Andy's widowed mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) manages to buy one from a street peddler, her son is overjoyed to receive his doll, named Chucky. Later that night, Karen's best friend Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff) babysits Andy, she is hit on the head by someone, before crashing through the window, and falling to her death, landing on a car. Mike is investigating the death, small footprints are found, suggesting maybe Andy did it. The next day, the little boy takes his doll to the house of Ray's former accomplice Edward 'Eddie' Caputo (Neil Giuntoli), he is killed by a gas explosion. Andy is questioned about these recent events, he blames it all on his doll Chucky. With this apparent disassociation with reality, Andy is placed in a psychiatric ward, while his doll is left behind. Karen is throwing away the box that the Good Guy Doll came in, when the batteries that are meant to be inside the doll drop out. She confirms there are no batteries inside the doll, and he comes to life in her hands, attacks her, and runs away. Mike refuses to believe her story that the doll is alive, and possessed with the soul of Charles Lee Ray, until he is attacked himself. Meanwhile, Chucky goes to visit his former voodoo mentor, John ""Dr. Death"" Bishop (Raymond Oliver). Chucky got shot and is bleeding, meaning that the longer he stays in the doll body, the more human he is becoming, and he may be trapped. Chucky tortures John with a voodoo doll until he reveals the solution, he must transfer his soul into the first person he revealed his true identity to, that is Andy. Before dying from his hideous injuries, John is found by Karen and Mike, he tells them kill Chucky before he can get to Andy, they have to aim for his heart. Chucky has tracked Andy to the psychiatric unit, but he has already escaped to head home. Andy returns home, he is knocked unconscious by Chucky with a baseball bat, he starts his incantation to transport his soul, but Karen and Mike arrive to stop him. After a struggle Chucky is trapped in the fireplace, he is set on fire with the gas stove until apparently dead. But Chucky gets up and tries to attack again, Mike shoots his arms and legs shot off, he is finally killed with a bullet through the heart. Also starring Tommy Swerdlow as Jack Santos, Jack Colvin as Dr. Ardmore, and Home Alone's Alan Wilder as Mr. Criswell. Vincent is adorable as the child victim, and Sarandon and Hicks do their parts fine, but the star of the film is of course Chucky, brought to life with reasonable puppetry techniques, and the great fiendish and wisecracking voice of Dourif. At the time this cult scary movie did cause a big stir, it was a box-office hit, but also protestors wanted it banned, claiming it may incite violence in children, now it is just seen as a standard slasher scary movie, it does have some genuinely tense moments, it may be slightly cheesy and novelty at times, but for the origins of Chucky the killer doll, this is a fun horror. Worth watching!",Child's Play
6,Woodyanders,A fun late 80's killer doll horror winner,8,14 December 2008,"The evil spirit of vicious serial killer Charles Lee Ray (the ever creepy Brad Dourif) gets transferred into the body of a popular doll. Plucky single mother Karen Barclay (superbly played by Catherine Hicks) purchases the doll as a birthday present for her son Andy (an endearingly sweet performance by Alex Vincent). Chucky the doll comes back to murderous life and embarks on a killing spree. Director Tom Holland, working from a clever and witty script that he co-wrote with Don Mancini and John Lafia, treats the frankly silly story with admirable seriousness, keeps the pace brisk and unflagging throughout, and builds a good deal of tension which culminates in a lively and exciting conclusion. Moreover, although the tone is basically straight, Holland still injects the proceedings with a wickedly nasty sense of dark humor. Additional kudos are in order for the uniformly excellent acting by a bang-up cast: Hicks makes for a sympathetic lead, Vincent is adorable as Andy, Dourif does the voice of Chucky with his customary rip-roaring crazed aplomb, plus there are sound contributions from Chris Sarandon as cynical, skeptical detective Mike Norris, Dinah Manoff as Karen's spunky best gal pal Maggie Peterson, Neil Giuntoli as Lee Ray's cowardly partner Eddie Caputo, Raymond Oliver as voodoo priest Dr. Death, and Alan Wilder as Karen's jerky boss Mr. Criswell. This film even manages to astutely address such timely 80's topics as single parenthood, mass media commercialization, and urban squalor and decay (Karen buys Chucky from a street peddler). The tight 87 minute running time ensures that the movie never drags or gets bogged down in needless tedious filler. Kevin Yagher's animatronic doll puppet f/x are nifty and impressive. Bill Butler's polished cinematography makes effectively fluid use of a prowling Steadicam. Joe Renzetti's shivery score does the shuddery trick. All in all, this surprise 80's horror hit holds up quite well and remains a neat little romp.",Child's Play
7,ccthemovieman-1,The Original ''Chucky'' Still The Best,9,26 June 2006,"This is a truly interesting horror flick that was so popular that sequels have been coming out ever since, none of course matching this one: the original.The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off once ""Chucky"" comes to life. It almost takes half the movie for that to happen. It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention. The only change I would have made was to the end the movie five minutes earlier, but they tacked on something that wasn't needed.The doll's owner ""Andy,"" (Alex Vincent) is a cute little kid and Alex does a decent job of acting while Catherine Hicks is fine as his mom. A familiar face in the '80s, Chris Sarandon, adds his talents as a detective.Instead of all the stupid sequels, I would have preferred to see a remake done, now that special-effects have made such great advances. For instance, at least with the VHS I have, Chuckie's lips aren't even in sync with the dialog! He walks a little too wooden-like but the other special-effects were just fine. Nothing is to be taken seriously, anyway. It's just a silly voodoo-type story (you should hear the explanation of who ""Chuckie"" is) and just played for a scary horror film. On that level, it works because it IS scary.",Child's Play
8,BA_Harrison,"Got myself a swearing, walking, sleeping, stalking living doll.",8,5 March 2012,"Pale face, blank eyes, fixed grin: let's face it, even the most basic of dolls is inherently creepy; whoever thought of making the things talk and move, thereby making them even more sinister, is one seriously warped individual.Little Andy's mother in Child's Play should have taken one look at the fugly interactive Good Guy doll offered to her by a manky-toothed peddler and realised it could only mean trouble; instead, she happily hands over her dosh and takes the flipping thing home, as if positively encouraging her son to grow up psychologically disturbed. Sure enough, Andy (Alex Vincent) soon starts to show signs of mental issues, but in this case, it's not just the fact that the thing is seriously freaky to look at that is messing with his mind: this particular doll is inhabited by the spirit of mass murderer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) and it's been telling him all sorts of weird stuff. Of course, no-one believes the lad, not even when people start to die...The idea of a scary 'living doll' was nothing new to the horror genre, even back in 1988, but although Child's Play's basic premise was already fairly well-worn, director Tom Holland proved there was still much more mileage to be had (five film's worth in total so far!). Don Mancini's script injects just the right amount of fun into proceedings, Holland's direction is slick and classy, successfully wringing tension and scares from material that might easily have ended up as laughable, Dourif gives a brilliant vocal performance as the doll, Chucky, and the special effects are all top notch; it all adds up to one hell of an entertaining movie.",Child's Play
9,moonspinner55,The slasher flick comes a cropper...,4,22 June 2008,"Troubled youngster bonds with his talking doll, unaware that the plastic companion is alive with the spirit of a deceased murderer. Tom Holland co-wrote and directed this somewhat-comedic thriller which hardly has anything new up its sleeve. Stealing quite a bit from both ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Bad Seed"", Holland proves he's not even equipped to mimic the Masters! This is hack film-making all the way, with topical wisecracks and vulgarities designed to give viewers some raucous relief, but merely stamping the film as dated and uninspired. The Chucky doll creation is initially quite marvelous but, like Freddy Krueger before him, a little of Chucky proves to go a long way. Followed by an onslaught of unimportant sequels. *1/2 from ****",Child's Play
10,Quinoa1984,Possibly the best film of the 80's,7,13 April 2000,"Don Mancini's Child's Play is a terrific horror film.  It combines suspense, scares and some humor here and there.  It's not just what happens when the toy doll (played by Brad Dourif to Pythagorean precision) is alive and killing, it's also when the doll is playing a straight face and that can be as scary as hell.  I found it a jolting roller coaster with the jolts coming thick and fast.  Kudos to everyone who worked on this film, because it's the best of the series.  A+",Child's Play
11,Coventry,Fun & scary 80's favorite!,8,22 May 2006,"Many horror fans include ""Child's Play"" in their list of favorite 80's movies. That actually might look like a weird and surprising thing to do UNTIL you see the film yourself. Initial skepticism and disbelief is allowed, because this basically is a movie revolving on a murderous doll and hinting at other far-fetched topics, like voodoo and spiritual possession, and such a story is almost impossible to deliver shivers among hardcore horror fanatics. Yet Tom Holland proves that, with the right director's attitude, even the stupidest premise can result in a scary and atmospheric little movie! The elaboration of the script is fully focused on suspense and Holland's solid supervision almost doesn't give you any opportunity to linger over implausible and/or ridiculous elements in the story. This is exactly what distinguishes ""Child's Play"" from the majority of lame 80's horror movies Many of them feature thin and silly story lines, but at least this film doesn't downgrade itself to cheap comedy-standards and actually manages to come across as real horror. Single and constantly struggling mother Karen is absolutely delighted when she manages to buy her 6-year-old son Andy a popular ""Good Guy""-doll at a much cheaper price, but little does she know it's possessed with the malicious spirit of a criminal that got gunned down by Detroit police officer Mike Norris. Even as a cute-looking kid's toy, Charles Lee Ray remains the embodiment of pure evil as he commits gruesome murders and even attempts to transfer his soul into young Andy's body. Naturally, nobody initially believes the child and he's even sent to mental institutions because the authorities think he's a young psychopath who killed the babysitter himself. The freckle-faced doll Chucky is quite an engaging horror villain, made legendary by Brad Dourif's raw voice, and thanks to some really impressive visual effects it looks even more menacing than most fully-grown and anatomically correct serial killers from other 80's horror movies. The highlight-sequences in ""Child's Play"" are genuinely creepy, for example when Karen drastically experiences that her son was telling the truth or when Chucky avenges himself on the police detective who shot him. The acting performances are superb (even young Alex Vincent is a revelation) and the amount of ""witty"" one-liners is thankfully kept to minimum, unlike in the sequels where they became the franchise's main objective. Highly recommended!",Child's Play

13,Hey_Sweden,"This IS the end, friend.",8,15 January 2017,"In terms of the entire ""killer doll / toy / dummy"" sub genre, ""Child's Play"" has ensured its iconic status. This is thanks to a solid cast, a genuine feel for suspense thanks to director / co-writer Tom Holland, some excellent wintry atmosphere and location shooting in Chicago, an extremely memorable villain, and truly impressive special effects work. Until the sequel ""Curse of Chucky"" came along a few years ago, and took the series back to its roots, this was the only entry that could legitimately claim to be creepy - if not outright scary.An ultra-psychotic serial killer / thief named Charles Lee Ray (character actor extraordinaire Brad Dourif) is gunned down by a detective named Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon, one of the stars of Hollands' previous horror favorite, ""Fright Night"") inside a toy store. However, ""Chucky"" is NOT ready to die, and succeeds at transferring his soul inside a ""Good Guy"" doll. In this form, he continues to terrorize people, including Karen Barclay (lovely Catherine Hicks), the single mother who happens to buy that same doll for her son Andy's (adorable Alex Vincent) birthday.Although Hicks and Sarandon are very good, the true stars of ""Child's Play"" have to be Dourif and Chucky effects creator Kevin Yagher. (Buffs will already be aware that Hicks and Yagher became a couple after working together here.) Dourif, who's always been a master at playing guys who range from being eccentric to being out and out looney, is a real force of nature, even when it's just his voice you hear. Chucky has become one of the defining roles of his career, and he's voiced the character ever since. Co-starring are Dinah Manoff ('Empty Nest', ""Grease"") as the unfortunate friend / babysitter, Tommy Swerdlow (""Howard the Duck"") as Mikes' colleague, Jack Colvin ('The Incredible Hulk') as a psychiatrist, Raymond Oliver (""Forbidden World"") as a voodoo master, and Neil Giuntoli (""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer Part II"") as a criminal lowlife.To the credit of the writers (including original Chucky creator Don Mancini) and Holland, they keep things as ambiguous as they can for a while, casting some doubt as to whether the doll is actually running around or if it's Andy. But things kick into a much higher gear once we get to see Chucky in action, and he's damn entertaining to watch.This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the theme that plays during the closing credits. That's straight up one of the creepiest, most haunting things that this viewer has ever heard.Followed by six sequels (the latest, ""Cult of Chucky"", is currently in production).Eight out of 10.",Child's Play
14,Doylenf,Silly premise but a scary film...,6,29 October 2006,"Very clever, highly suspenseful chiller with a boy's doll inhabited by the spirit of a dead man. You have to suspend all disbelief because it's told in a way that hooks you from the beginning.CHRIS SARANDON is the detective who shoots BRAD DOURIF, who vows to take vengeance on the world while clutching onto a Chucky Doll in the toy store he invaded. CATHERINE HICKS is the mother of a small boy, ALEX VINCENT, who wakes her up early in the morning to celebrate his birthday. Disappointed, she buys him a Good Guy doll he's been asking for. Enter Chucky. ""He's something, isn't he?"" his mother says delightedly when the boy gets Chucky to say a phrase. As it turns out, Chucky can do much more than utter his standard phrase.He's something, all right. From then on, the boy begins to discover things about his favorite doll that has him warning his parents and anyone who will listen that the doll is possessed. Of course, no one believes him until it is too late and a couple of murders have occurred. The mother is a bit slow to catch on but there's a chilling moment when she realizes the doll has no batteries inside it.Really frightening stuff, directed with great skill by Tom Holland and played to the hilt by a good cast. All the special effects for the doll's menace are extremely well done.Summing up: Creepy tale provides a good dose of thrills and chills.",Child's Play
15,preppy-3,Never really worked for me,4,27 February 2007,"Killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is shot and killed by policeman Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. Before he dies he transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll named Chucky. Mom Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) buys the doll for her son Andy (Alex Vincent) and Chucky sets out to settle the score with a few people. Andy knows Chucky is alive and dangerous...but nobody believes him.OK--this movie does have its fans. Its led to four sequels (so far) and does have two great sequences--when Hicks slowly realizes the doll is alive and when Sarandon is attacked in his car. But this movie never really worked for me. I personally never found the doll scary and had a hard time taking some of the attack sequences seriously. It DOES look pretty stupid when the doll ""attacks"" Hicks. The special effects making the doll talk and move are impressive (no CGI used here) but I found the movie slow--even at 88 minutes. Also Vincent was a TERRIBLE actor--but he was only 7 when he did this. Surprisingly even Sarandon (a VERY good actor) sleepwalks through this.On the plus side it has the few neat killings, Hicks is actually very good, Dourifs lines are pretty cool coming out of the doll and (again) the lifelike movements of the doll are impressive. But I was basically pretty bored--and I'm a big horror movie fan. Director Tom Holland did much better a few years earlier with ""Fright Night"". Rent that instead.I should mention I find one of the sequels ""Bride of Chucky"" a lot of fun but the rest are pretty terrible. Personally I can only give this a 4.",Child's Play
16,poolandrews,Pretty decent killer doll film.,7,5 February 2007,"Child's Play starts as homicide cop Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) pursues notorious serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) through the streets of Chicago & into a toy store where Ray realises that having been shot by Norris he is dying so he performs a Voodoo ceremony that transfers his soul into the plastic carcass of a 'Good Guy' doll... Andy (Alex Vincent) the young son of Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is disappointed when he doesn't get a Good Guy doll for his birthday, sensing his obvious disappointment Karen jumps at the opportunity to buy one cheap from a derelict no questions asked. At first Andy is delighted by his Good Guy who responds to the name Chucky, however Andy stats to treat Chucky a lot like a real person & when Karen's best friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) dies in a mysterious accident the police become involved. The evil spirit of Ray stuck in the body of Chucky the killer Good Guy doll wants revenge...Directed by Tom Holland Child's Play is a pretty decent horror film, it's not the best I've ever seen but it's far from the worst. The script by Don Mancini obviously tackles the horror sub-genre of the killer toy based film but Child's Play was a rather more serious take on the them than the likes of Puppet Master (1989) & the Demonic Toys (1992) films, in fact the Child's Play series would become more & more light hearted as it went for outrageous gore coupled with black humour & lots of one-liners. Anyway, for the first half it tries to be more of a psychological horror as not much is given away & I guess the audience is not supposed to know whether there is a killer doll running around or whether it's all a figment of Andy's imagination & as such the foul-mouthed Chucky as we now know & love him doesn't make an appearance until about half way through the film. I also think the way it takes itself so seriously (maybe a reason why the recent instalment's are better because they don't?) hurt it overall with some very silly scenes, the sequence when Karen drops Chucky & he runs out of the apartment in a matter of seconds for instance, I'm sorry but there's no way on Earth he could have reached the lock & opened the door let alone reach the elevator buttons so quickly without anything to stand on at least. I wasn't keen on the end either as the torso of Chucky with just one arm & one leg manages to crawl through an air vent, burst out & nearly strangle a guy, it just doesn't work as a scene & comes across as ridiculous. Having said that there is still much here to entertain, it moves along at a nice, there are some nice kills, there are a couple of decent mini action scenes including a shoot-out, a speeding runaway car & some cool explosion's, Chucky was a great horror character with bags of personality even back then & as a whole it's passes 90 odd minutes painlessly enough.Director Holland does a good job here & the film has a nice look to it. I'm not sure the film is particularly scary but it has a decent horror atmosphere to it. I was a little disappointed by the kills in Child's Play as well as the lack of them, for some bizarre reason until the recent British DVD Child's Play had always been cut over here in the UK including it's original theatrical run & as usual the extra footage is of no real significance or particularly strong & as a whole the violence & gore quota isn't that high. There are some stabbings & a few splashes of blood here & there but very little else to get excited about. I mean there's nothing here to rival or as memorable as the slit throat from Part 3 or the nails in the face & guy run over by a huge semi-truck & gorily splattered all over the road scenes from Bride of Chucky (1998).With a very healthy sounding budget of about $9,000,000 Child's Play is very well made with good production values. The acting is good & I didn't even find the kid that annoying which is something I suppose...Child's Play is a good horror film I will openly agree with that no problem but I don't see it as any stonewall classic, there are too many silly moments which let the rest of the film down & it could have done with better kills. I don't think I'd watch it again anytime soon. Followed by Child's Play 2 (1990) which I haven't seen, then came Child's Play 3 (1991) which I like & thought was on a par with the original, after a 7 year hiatus came the brilliant Bride of Chucky which breathed new life into the series & following that was the more recent Seed of Chucky (2004) which I haven't got round to watching yet but I do have it in a big pile of DVD's I've brought that one day I get round to seeing...",Child's Play

Wanna play?",6,10 October 2007,"I see a new movie called Black Devil Doll will be released next year, and i wondered how the original devil doll - Chucky (not the coach of the Bucaneers) looked.I have to admit that I was mesmerized by this evil thing that would not die. Don Mancini, John Lafia, and Tom Holland managed to write a captivating story.Catherine Hicks, from my favorite Star Trek movie, did a great job as mom trying to figure out what was wrong with her son, played by Alex Vincent, who did a super job in a child's role.Brad Dourif (Halloween 2007, LOTR - Two Towers, Return of the King) was Chucky.",Child's Play
18,Boba_Fett1138,Original premise makes decent genre movie.,7,24 October 2011,"Out of all the 'classic' horror series, Child's Play is the only one I still need to watch completely. It took me years but finally I started with it. What took me so long? Well, because Chucky used to freak me out as a little kid when I saw ads for it on TV! But no, of course it's far from a true scary movie really. The one thing that this movie has going for it is its originality but in all truth and honesty, that's more than enough for a movie of this sort.Having a child-sized doll as your killer is obviously a quite unique and original premise. And it actually works well. Having a doll as the killer prevents this movie from falling into the usual genre clichés and makes the movie more original than not with all of its horror/slasher moments. Besides, the effects for Chucky are all convincing looking, so it actually looks like it's a real doll going berserk and goes on a killing spree, after a serial killer transfered his soul into the doll, right before he died. Not hard to see why he has become an horror icon over the years.And of course who better to play a maniac killer than Brad Dourif. Granted that he only is in the movie for a couple of minutes but he also provided the voice for the Chucky doll, or good boy doll, like he's officially called. The Child's Play series actually gave him lots of fame, even though he's only providing the voice of Chucky in the rest of the series.I would had probably still preferred it if the movie went along with its original idea of letting you in doubt whether or not the Chucky actually truly came to life or if perhaps it was the little kid who committed all of the murders. It would had given the movie an extra dimension, horror-wise but the went for the more straight-forward and perhaps also more safe road instead. Yes, it makes the movie quite simplistic but luckily it still of course has its originality going for it, which really makes this movie an above average genre attempt.I think that the movie works better as entertainment than horror really but I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing. It means that you can have fun watching this movie but you're better off watching a different one if you're in the mood for a good scary- or gory slasher.It still remains one of the more original movies within its genre.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Child's Play
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Wanna play?""",7,21 March 2005,"I finally pulled myself together and sat down to watch this film, after putting it off for a long time. I thought(well, used to think): ""It's a horror film about a murderous *doll* and it's an 80's flick with a bunch of actors in it that I've never heard of."" This film proves quite well how wrong you can judge a book by its cover. Yes, it is a doll doing all the killing, but it's pretty damn creepy. It's also far more creative and smart than your average doll, uh, killer. See the trailer to get an idea of how unusual and creative the death scenes are. The plot is surprisingly good, though there are weak points. The whole voodoo/magic thing concerning Chucky's ""birth"" is kind of... lame and far-fetched, honestly. It is, however, also quite original. And it's the only truly low point for me about the film. Then there's the whole ""80's film complex"" that most, if not all, 80's films have been cursed with. The curse includes, but is not limited to: hammy acting, bad dialog, soundtrack consisting of dreaded 80's music and predictability. Fortunately, this film suffers very little under this. The dialog is very obviously 80's at some points, and the acting could definitely improve, particularly with some of the minor characters, but the film manages to create a good deal of unpredictable scenes and the music is so neutral that you couldn't possibly tell from the soundtrack that it's an 80's film. The pacing is pretty good, there's really no point during the film where it's boring. The acting ranges, but the leads are mostly good. I thought the child actor who portrayed Andy did a pretty good job, considering he was 6-7 years old when he did the film. The special effects are so-so, but considering that this was the late 80's, they're sufficiently good, and they are used to great effect. There are plenty of genuine scares in the film. I enjoyed the cinematography, particularly the very good use of long takes and tracking shots. The ending was overdone, and came off as annoying rather than particularly scary. All in all, the film is definitely worth watching if you're into the genre. In the end, it's better than most other 80's flicks, and if you do see it available for rent, it'll probably be cheap, and hey, it's less than 90 minutes long, so it's easy enough to get through. I recommend this to fans of horror films and 80's flicks. If you belong to one of those groups, you'll most likely enjoy it, at least to some extent. 7/10",Child's Play
20,view_and_review,Put Chucky in the Hall of Fame,7,2 July 2019,"When I was younger, my friend and I would obsess over Chucky. We would dream up all the ways we could torture that evil doll. That was the only real monster/psycho we could handle. We couldn't deal with Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, and later Candyman so Chucky became the one abomination we would dream of harming to get even.I just saw Child's Play 2019 and it prompted me to rewatch the original.The original is so much better. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky/The Good Guy doll was perfect. He was so sinister sounding and crude he just sounded evil. He even made it into a rap song-Child's Play by Bushwick Bill (great song by the way).This movie resonated with me as a kid so much because it was patterned after the My Buddy doll that was so huge. There was My Buddy and Kid Sister but dolls in general back then were big. Before iPhones and videogames took over there were dolls for boys and girls. Of course there was Barbie, then there were Cabbage Patch Kids, Glow Worms, My Buddy and some other lesser known dolls. So, the Good Guy Doll made so much sense.Child's Play is a movie from a bygone era. It was the last of the popular 80's scary movies to spawn sequels. Chucky belongs in the scary movie bad guy hall of fame.",Child's Play

One of the film's best features here is the fact that there's just so much done here to make it questionable whether or not he's really possessed or whether the whole thing is in his imagination, a fine product here that carries itself for the whole first half. By focusing so nicely on the these elements, the scenes of the two blatantly disobeying parental instructions in order to follow his directions instead, the constant appearing around the scenes of many of the accidents all innocently and never believing anything he tells them sets this up rather nicely here into her investigation of the whole affair which is where this one really picks up here by letting this here carry the main part of the film. While the revelation sequence is truly legendary here as the earlier investigations give it some intriguing possibilities about what's going on, the battery discovery of all kinds of chilling, the initial reaction is priceless and then the ensuing attack after being threatened makes for a superb, stand-out sequence. Even along these other scenes, there's plenty of other fun to be had here in the film's fun action which are highly enjoyable and make for quite a thrilling time here, from the opening stalking scenes in the toy-store before finally getting to the transfer ceremony as the lightning bolt destroys the store in a giant fireball, a alter stalking scene at the friends' house where he sets the explosive trap that blows up the building and the absolutely fun car chase as another trap inside the car provides some thrills while making a fine set-up for the stalking within the flipped car at the end getting some fine suspense in. As well, there' an absolutely ton of positives to like here with the final stalking in the apartment being the true highlight that features a ton of high-energy action as he charges after them continuously despite being set on fire and having his limbs blown off, the different brawls and overpowering attempts make for quite a nice time and the whole thing comes off flawlessly. Lastly, the film gets an absolute ton of positives from the stellar special effects work for the doll, as this is an absolutely amazing part of the film. Given that this one spends as much time as it does here showcasing him on-screen, it needed to come off flawlessly and he manages to come across as a realistic doll, and the puppets achieving this throughout here are marvelous due to these perfectly conceived creations. These here manage to hold this up incredibly well here as there's not too many flaws here. About the only thing really wrong here is the fact that her investigations take up a lot of time here and somewhat stalls the killing done by keeping the doll off-screen here, though none of this is really boring even detrimental. This one is quite fun regardless.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, an Attempted Rape and children-in- jeopardy.",Child's Play

This film standalone is entertaining, scary, and importantly sadistically funny. The rest of the movies (bar the second one) are notorious for more than one reason.Dourif excels as the voice of chucky, and provides some much needed wit into the film, because to be fair, it wouldn't work without the wit.

23,Aaron1375,More funny than actually scary.,7,14 July 2009,"Granted it was entertaining, but more in the funny way than the suspenseful horror way. That is probably why the fourth and fifth movies of the series were basically all comedy rather than horror. This one tries to be horror and in some ways it works, but I think the main problem is the voice of Chucky done by Brad Douriff, he is kind of likable, you almost begin pulling for Chucky because by golly he is a very funny guy who has plenty of one liners. The story has a guy who is running from the police, as a last ditch effort he uses a technique he learned to transplant his soul into a toy doll. Well a mother buys her son this rather ugly doll and now Chucky is telling the boy what to do. There is a cop who begins to suspect something and then there is the climax that seems to center on really torturing Chucky. Which the sequels to this film seem to do a lot of especially two, a lot of Chucky crying in agony. It has its moments of being somewhat creepy, but then it has its rather humorous scenes such as the old couple and the elevator scene. The doll is done rather well as it looks like one of those stupid my buddy dolls, while being creepier in appearance. It also moves very well too as it is puppets rather than any computer stuff which is always a good thing. Still, Chucky just has a way of making me laugh.",Child's Play

Which explains why I didn't get around to the original movie til my mid-30s. And it turns out I completely missed the boat on ""Child's Play"" because this movie is far more silly than it is scary. It never gets beyond creepy and that's mainly because of the doll's animatronic face (and Brad Dourif's voice behind it). The character's strength is as a mischief-maker, but that doesn't make up for those stale scenes when he's inert. I felt sad for the little kid more than anything. This is one of those movies where, having finally seen it, I can close the book on this one.

An annoyance that goes deeper than the fact I wanna slap the stupid looking doll. IDK maybe it's because I've never liked playing with baby dolls as a kid I found them to be annoying too (and I'm a female). Gimme a Zuni fetish doll any day over any baby doll.Now as far as the story of ""Child's Play (1988)"" it's not too bad - it is entertaining and the best of the Chucky series.

28,KineticSeoul,The beginning of the most iconic killer doll ever,8,5 June 2014,"This movie starts out pretty slow with a killer named Charles Lee Ray doing voodoo magic to put his soul into a kid's doll. After that it starts to get slow and generic even with the killer doll with things not making much sense (and I am not talking about the Chucky doll thing either). But when Chucky starts his sinister cacklying and cursing that he is known for the movie does pick up. The build up to that point isn't that bad though and I can understand why they had to go in that direction at first. It does add a sense of mystery even if the audiences does know what is going on from the start. The trademark Chucky voice really does add flavor to this slasher. As a matter of fact I wouldn't be shocked if Heath Ledger was inspired by Chucky for his role in ""The Dark Knight"" now that I think about it. It's cool to see Chucky not going on that unstoppable killer slasher direction, he uses stealth and pulls tricks to kill someone. Plus whenever found, he could just act like a regular doll. Which actually does adds to making him quite a dangerous and sinister killer. This does not have a lot of blood and gore, nor does it have a lot of body count but it does have entertainment value for a horror slasher movie. Overall this is a slasher movie that had a lot of cool and new elements to work with when it came to the direction at the time. And it's understandable how Chucky became one of the most memorable killer villain from the 80's. Thanks to Brad Dourif signature voice as Chucky.8/10",Child's Play

It goes on a rampage, trying to bring down his enemies, with Karen and her son caught in his wrath.The plot's pacing, script, and music score work fine in this movie, with good direction by Tom Holland, sending the dark mood and freaky atmosphere where appropriate - especially during scenes where Chucky creeps up on people. Joe Renzetti's music score blends in well with the movie and the cinematography was good, especially letting the dreary Chicago streets match the dark mood of the film.The acting was pretty good for the most part. Brad Dourif gave a sinister, dark, yet sometimes sarcastic portrayal of Chucky; Catherine Hicks gave a fine performance as the mom; and Chris Sarandon was a little emotionless and mundane at times as the cop, Mike Norris.

Never. It just all seemed too outlandish to be bothered with. The spirit of a vicious killer somehow transferred into a child's doll. Uh ... Yeah ... Right. Frankly, it sounded dumb. So I ignored its existence. But, every now and then you just have nothing to do, and a movie you really aren't interested in pops up. And there was ""Child's Play."" So, I watched it. And I liked it! I really liked it!Sure it's a dumb premise, but it actually works. I liked the performances. Young Alex Vincent did well as Andy, the boy who unfortunately comes into possession of Chucky the doll.

Not too gory, a whole bunch of scenes that made me jump and enough action/explosions you wouldn't expect in a low-grade horror movie about a killer doll. Strangely, this is a movie that gets creepier the more times you watch it, or experience any of the sequels. Reason: the way the mother, friend or anyone handles what a demonic doll this ""Chucky"" will become. It's like not knowing who Jason Voorhees will be and smacking him around as a kid. The movie revolves around a dying, fleeing criminal who transports his soul into a ""Good Guy"" doll, seeks revenge while as a 2-foot demon-doll and terrorizes a family. The voice of Chucky (whether good or bad) was pitch-perfect, most scenes of shock were hilarious, either intentionally or not, and the suspense was tight, despite the grand number of plot holes, inconsistencies and normal horror clichés. I will tell you the scene that turned the movie around for me and made me jump as teenager, was the batteries. When they fell out, I jumped a mile. (Okay, I did back then.) Also, I was a huge TV 'Hulk' fan and it was great to see ""McGee"" (Colvin) again, albeit a few minutes. And finally, I always loved the ""toys-coming-to-life"" and terrorizing stories growing up. I think they did a splendid job with acting (the kid really wasn't that bad) and mother (Hicks) was believable and fun to watch. They also didn't spend barely an ounce on background or how this magic of soul-hopping happens. They didn't need to. They needed to get to another future horror-icon fast, and they did.

32,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ultra cheesy but still quite a cult favourite in the horror genre,9,4 May 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A serial killer (Brad Dourif) is cornered by seasoned detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store (of all places!) and all seems over- until he uses voodoo powers to transfer his soul into a doll...which ends up in the hands of innocent child Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) so he may continue his legacy of evil from beyond the grave. Nasty things start happening around Andy that no one around him can explain...and no one will believe him when he tells them it's the doll.Horror films that turn into franchises , if you think about it, always tend to revolve around goofy, far fetched ideas. Truly terrifying, psychological ideas tend to be one offs or less cheap follow ups (i.e. Red Dragon to The Silence of the Lambs.) And here we have an idea that's as goofy and silly as they come...a doll coming to life whilst being possessed by the soul of a serial killer. Yet Child's Play spawned two sequels and even a spin off film. And created a legendary horror creation in Chucky the doll. All you need is an iconic character with a certain air of menace and one or two neat catch phrases and you've created horror gold.And yet as a film, Child's Play's as weak as they come. The acting's poor, the writing's iffy and, as I said, the premise is just ridiculously silly. Despite this, there is a genuine air of tension and atmosphere created from it (like Catherine Hicks's character realizing Chucky has no batteries in him!) and it's created a lot from such a short film, leaving it's mark on the horror genre which Tom Holland's film has undeniably done. ****",Child's Play
33,bowmanblue,Batteries not included,8,13 August 2014,"Then again, you don't need batteries to interject yet more life into 'Child's Play,' aka 'the first Chucky film.' Like most horror films, the first one will always be considered the best. It's currently spawned five sequels and they're all an acquired taste, either too horrific, too similar, or too comedic to appeal to everyone. However - like the Three Bears' porridge - was just right.It's mainly horror - about a serial killer who, on his death bed, puts his soul into a child's doll, only for it to be bought by an innocent family. However, there's a decent amount of black comedy thrown into the mix. You can't really have a three foot high, plastic baddie without making it just a little bit humorous (and the humour comes from the devilishly brilliant delivery from (voice artist) Brad Dourif. However, he's just a voice - the real actors all play their parts, too. You could say that the main star is a six year old boy and, child actors can be hit and miss at the best of times. If he was incorrectly cast then you may end up rooting for the evil doll. Plus there's his mum - strong, but never over the top so, but the real bonus points go to the long-suffering cop, charged with investigating this family's crack-pot tale about killer dolls with souls of serial killers inside them.If you like horror then you should have already seen this. If you haven't been introduced to the Child's Play/Chucky franchise then this is the best place to start. Just bear in mind that it was released in 1988, so it's a bit dated, but still able to hold its own when compared to today's horror offerings.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Child's Play
34,bowmanblue,Classic horror,8,23 August 2018,"Child's Play' is a great little horror film from the eighties, that - I'm guessing - even took the film-makers by surprise in its popularity. I would imagine they never realised it was the beginning of a major franchise that's still going strong thirty years later (reboot and TV series apparently on its way?). As with many horror films, the sequels slowly take a dip in quality with each instalment, or even if you don't agree with that, the 'Child's Play' franchise weaves in and out of various genres, going from 'horror' to 'horror-comedy.' However, what the original does best is stick to its horror roots (although you may smile here and there!).The film kicks off as a police officer chases down and shoots dead a wanted man who's taken refuge in a toy shop. However, this is no ordinary criminal, but Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), a killer who knows a thing or two about voodoo practices. And he transfers his soul into a nearby 'Good Guy' (how ironic, eh?) doll. And this doll ends up in possession of a young boy called Andy who, along with his mother, are the first to discover the toy's true - murderous - identity.Naturally, this start going downhill pretty fast as the doll decides to take lethal revenge on anyone he feels did him wrong while he was human and quickly turns on his new 'owners.' A few things elevate this from the bucket-loads of similar movies. It was certainly original for its time and, although hardly stylishly directed, is competent enough to create a realistic atmosphere. The characters are all likable enough and never stray (too much) into horror clichés where they do idiotic things in the face of danger.Andy and his mother are clearly the (main) stars, but the cops provide actually quite decent supporting characters - naturally they don't believe that a killer doll is stalking the family and provide some believable disbelief here and there (along with the odd comic moment). However, no matter how good any of the humans are, it's the doll 'Chucky' who steals every scene. For a start it's worth noting that he was created before CGI and is therefore either a puppet, or a dwarf in a suit filmed from clever angles. And, the only thing better than the doll itself, is the voice of Brad Dourif who flits from evil to darkly entertaining in the blink of an eye - and has naturally been kept on as the continued voice of Chucky throughout every genre change, reboot and sequel.I know that no eighties B-movie horror film can ever truly be a classic in terms of film-making. If you really want to you can pick apart many things wrong with it. However, if you're looking for a horror film that is creepier than most, more original than most, more entertaining than most and has Brad Dourif on top form, then you should definitely check this one out.",Child's Play

He was probably the first slasher movie villain I was really familiar with. It's funny because I remember ""Toy Story"" as a movie that had a big impact on me as a kid. I used to think toys could come alive too. While I never saw the whole film or any of the sequels, it was still really scary. As an adult, I can just shrug this off and appreciate this movie for what it is. I, like most people, think slasher movies are mostly crap, but I will give credit for the better ones.This really is one, especially when compared to its never ending series of sequels (like all slasher movies). The best part is easily how it slowly builds up to Chucky being alive. It does get goofy at times, especially with how hard it is to kill this thing. I actually do like the main kid character here, Andy. Wait, a kid named Andy with a toy that comes to life? That IS the same as ""Toy Story""!

36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Was to become much better,6,2 April 1999,"The original Child's Play was just a one-off shocker that put a new-ish spin on the slasher genre by having the killer be a kids doll possessed with the soul of a dead serial-strangler (though Don Mancini's original script ""Blood Buddies"" was more of a satire on kid's marketing and did not feature Charles Lee Ray). It became clear afterwards that the outrageousness of the idea could lend itself to more humor-orientated sequels and that Chucky himself had potential that stretched beyond just one movie.As a result, this first Child's Play movie seems to be a bit different from the rest. Don't get me wrong, the franchise is pretty good with it's continuity which is unusual for horror films, but first time around the makers played it for straight, which gives it different edge from the rest. Obviously they didn't want to play their ace right away so for the most part, Chucky is rather quiet in this one. Later on, his star would shine brighter.Chicago cop Mike Norris guns down killer Charles Lee Ray in the street, but before Ray dies he breaks into a toy store and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll. Knowledge of Voodoo is pretty much the first thing that you're taught in serial killer class. That very same doll is given to lonely little boy Andy Barclay for his birthday, but he's not aware of the evil lurking within.Judging the film on its own merits it's not exactly the best shocker out there. There are only a couple of scare moments and a couple of those are badly timed and obviously telegraphed. The story isn't as tight as it should be and there's simply not enough kills. The sequels had bigger body counts and more interesting deaths.",Child's Play

39,ironhorse_iv,"I'm Chucky, do you want to play my movie? OK, but just for a little while, your movie isn't that good. Evil does comes in Small Packages",6,16 October 2013,"No, really. Child's Play is a bit over the top, corny, and silly, but it's one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I wouldn't say the same for the sequels that came after this Tom Holland's movie. The movie met moderate success, when it came out to the point, it became to have a cult following with horror fans. The story is about a boy name Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who gets a doll possession by a serial killer/ voodoo practitioner Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). Charles AKA 'Chucky', was killed in a pursued at local toy store by Chicago police man Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). Before dying, Charles swears revenge on him by transferring his soul by voodoo into a ""Good-Guy"" doll. Chucky find himself limited with his new body, and searches for a new body to take over. The catch is that, he has to take the body of the first person he revealed that he was alive to, which happens to be Andy. It's a race against time, as both Andy Barclay's mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks) and Mike Norris try to save Andy, before Chucky get a hold with him. The movie does have some over the top stuff in it. I find the lightning storm hitting the store, in the beginning of the film is be a bit unrealistic. How on earth, did Mike survive that? The deaths scenes were pretty bad like the over dramatic clumsy fall from a woman to the electric shock death of the doctor. How did he get burns on his face? I would had thought they would had test these products before sending it out to be work on patients. The movie has a lot of jump scares that are hit or miss for me. I do think the movie has some really cool scenes that I love. I can't help re-watching the fireplace scene with the iconic words badass phrase 'this is the end, friend'. Probably the best part of the movie. Without spoiling too much about it, it was a pretty good movie at the time. More laughable, than scary. It's a bit laughable now when you think about how outdated the effects are. The movie does a great use of puppets, and little people to make Chucky look like he is coming alive. In one scene, Chucky is play a child with Chucky make up on. How bizarre is that! I just have to complain about how meaningless the plot goes on. The concept of Chucky turning more human, the longer he spent in the doll is meaningless. Even without a head in one scene and badly burn, Chucky is still trying to kill Andy. I don't know any headless human, badly burn people still running around. Plus, it seems like Chucky doesn't understand, pain. Some bullet shots hurt him, while other doesn't. It doesn't make any sense. This concept would had made more sense if they kept the original idea of having Good Guys Dolls have blood and latex skin. The idea of the latex skin, is that if the Dolls get a cut, the kid's parent could go out and buy an Official 'Good Guy"" band-aid. There was going to be a scene, where Andy makes a Blood-brothers pact with Chucky. Thus, when Andy mixed his blood with Chucky, it cause Chucky to come alive. Last, its takes Chucky forever to capture Andy. This plot device becomes really drawn out in the sequels to the point, it seems like Chucky has no sense of time. The movie has this cohesive story, but its Chucky personality that keeps us interested in the film. A lot of dumb silly puns, and comedy jokes that come out of left field to keep you watching. I can't see, John Lithgrow voicing Chucky as he was the producers original wanted actor to play Chucky. I have to say, Brad Dourif does a great job. Child's Play was pretty original idea at the time. It's rare to see a 'killer doll' movie at the time. The movie could had toyed with the audience a bit more longer making them wonder if Andy was indeed the killer rather than Chucky. Sadly, this was executed badly on the film, by not only the first few minutes of the film, but 2/4 in the film where Chucky in doll form comes alive. By then, the badly needed suspense was gone, and we all are left with a predictive ending. I think a lot of people hate the film to the point that they wanted it banned due to the subject matter of it incite violence to children. First off, yes it does, but to defend the film. Any movies in genre, can incite violence in anybody, if they are truly wanted to. A lot of kid's movies at the time had violent acts on their shows, but you don't see people protesting about them. This movie wasn't made for children with its harsh R rating. Plus, it's clearly shown that bullying is more like to result in violent outburst than watching violence movies. Still, it's pretty dumb for any parent to allow a child to watch a horror movie without first thinking of how it will affect the kid. I think it was pretty dumb for MGM/United Artist to dis owned the film rights due to the subject matter when other United Artist's movies are a bit more violent than this. They lost a lot of money for themselves, as Universal would be pick the film franchise and make millions off of it with its license. Overall, it's a bit dumb, the concept had promise and could had been more believable. Watch it, if you into cheesy 1980's over the top horror flicks. At less, Chucky isn't a killer Cabbage Patch kid's movie. Now that's laughable.",Child's Play

He p.r.a.c.t.i.s voodoo. Just before he dies he puts his soul in to a doll. This is a very scary movie. I can think of scarier movies. Child's play 2 is scarier. Child's play 3 is also scarier.

41,paulclaassen,One of the greatest horrors of all time.,7,11 June 2020,"We've certainly seen a fare share of killer doll movies, but none as compelling and memorable as 'Child's Play'.'Child's Play' doesn't waste time setting up the scene in a display of stunning visuals. The film never loses momentum, and becomes more intense with every scene. The very idea of a doll being possessed by a ruthless killer, Charles Lee Ray, is disturbing in itself. The suspense is elevated when Charles - now Chucky, the doll's name - realizes he can only transfer his soul to the first person he revealed himself to, before his soul remains trapped inside the doll. Off course, that person is none other than an innocent little boy, Alex - excellently portrayed by Alex Vincent.The film then becomes a roller coaster ride of suspense, action and horror as Chucky won't allow anyone to deter him from his mission. In the process he also avenges those responsible for his fate. Chucky is one of the creepiest dolls you'll ever see, accompanied by Brad Douriff's equally creepy and vindictive voice. With time running out, Chucky becomes increasingly determined and violent.Screen legend Chris Sarandon plays Detective Mike Norris, and Catherine Hicks portrays Andy's' mother. Solid performances, a great script, great visuals, incredibly realistic doll effects, and a nail-biting finale propelled 'Child's Play' to cult status, and ensured box office success.",Child's Play

After that she discovers that this doll possessed by a doll of a bad man who is also a serial killer.I liked this movie because of the plot and because of the storyline. I believe that the direction of Tom Holland was really nice and I think that he did a great job. I liked the interpretations of Catherine Hicks who played as Karen Barclay the mother of Andy Barclay played by the little one Alex Vincent. I also liked the voice of Brad Dourif as Charles Lee Ray and Chucky.Finally I believe that this movie starts a new series of thriller which will keep us in tense since now days.",Child's Play
44,zkonedog,Go Watch The Twilight Zone Instead For A Better Interpretation,3,21 October 2018,"When ""Child's Play"" was first released, 1988, I was three years old and thus obviously too young to see it. The first time I've now seen it all the way through is as a 32-year old. After the viewing, I can definitively state that it's one of those films where the enjoyment (or terror) you get from the experience will be in direct correlation to what age you were when you first saw it.For a basic plot summary, ""Child's Play"" sees serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), finally caught for his crimes, use some voodoo to transfer his spirit in a Good Guys brand doll named Chucky. The doll is then bought by Karen (Catherine Hicks) and given to her son Andy (Alex Vincent) as a birthday present that produces predictably disastrous results.If you watched this film at an impressionable age, I can see where it would leave a mark. No doubt, there is something creepy about the ""doll comes to life"" concept, and no punches are pulled here. Chucky screams profanities and murders people in cold blood. If you were young and not expecting that sort of visceral imagery, you'll always be a bit creeped out by Chucky.However, as someone who did not have that experience, watching this film now (without those ""burned-in"" moments) was a big let-down. Considering that this franchise is considered just outside the ""Big Three"" horror icons Michael, Freddy, & Jason, I thought it might have more to offer. It didn't...at all.Personally, for those who want a much better ""creepy doll alive"" experience, I'd skip this and go watch the Twilight Zone episode ""Living Doll"", where the material is handled much better and just as creepy (without all the ridiculous voodoo/serial killer nonsense).Bottom line: ""Child's Play"" is very much a product of its times, and perhaps more importantly the times (ages) at which it was/is watched.",Child's Play
45,johnnyboyz,Any film that can bring an inanimate object to life and make it come across as somewhat scary is at least a mild success.,6,2 August 2008,"After it's prologue, Child's Play begins with a sweeping of sorts shot that covers a living room in a Reagan era, late 1980s, working class American home that houses a single mother and her young child. It is a shot that incorporates objects complete with brand names, consumer driven toys and dolls and one that culminates in a television playing to nobody in the room (but perhaps to us?) displaying an inane cartoon specifically for kids. A young boy named Andy (Vincent) walks in; his face drops when he sees the screen and exclaims that 'he has seen this one'. I feel this is an attack on consumerism of some sort set in a contemporary time where the latest in modernity somehow finds its way into the working class home. The tracking shot of extensive produce twinned with the boy's quote of already having seen the episode could be read as a reminder that perhaps, it's all going too far.But this is the perfect introduction to the film's primary, and sadly only, theme. Child's Play does not need a realistic narrative of sorts; partly because it's an American horror film that ventures into the realms of fantasy, but also because its premise is one that maintains a voice and message throughout  this is a statement on many, many things. The film revolves around the incoming of a toy doll into a household that is already housing a boy missing a fatherly figure. If the tracking shot is displaying consumerism, then the incoming doll of Chucky acts as a statement that the latest in gadgets and gimmicks can enter the household so very easily. But it also carries an eerie message that firstly asks us, 'Do we really know what we're buying?' and 'Is what we're buying ultimately safe?' Obviously, this is not some paranoid rant warning people that toys might come alive and attack you. What I think Child's Play does is highlight the dangers of giving into Consumerism so easily and buckling under the pressure of both a child's want for something and the ill knowledge you may carry regarding said object. This ignorance is best highlighted by Maggie (Manoff), a friend of Andy's mother who is fast paced, outlandish and just too confident when it comes to looking for the next gimmick and best way to purchase it  it comes as no surprise that her encounter with the doll results, in the sense it gets the better of her and, quite literally as well as ironically, 'sneaks' up on her.But the film refrains from being anything brilliant due to its repetition of scenes and generally daft nature. The statement and ideas of Capitalist modernity in a post-modern world work well and these sorts of themes are said under a guise of, let's face it, a pretty mediocre slasher film riding on the success of Halloween and its sequels. Characters do this, characters do that, characters say things and get themselves into situations and scenarios that demand they ignore logic for the sake of the odd shock or thrill as suspense builds to a certain crescendo. But for what it is, Child's Play is kind of entertaining with some good scenes albethem illogical. The point of attack and opening exchanges involving Andy, Karen (Hicks) and the doll over whether or not it's really killing people is effective because we're given the position of power that we know the kid's telling the truth.Child's Play is relentless in its pacing and uses its unique selling point sparsely and wisely. I don't think the idea of a talking, killing doll had been done before Child's Play and I think it's largely down to the constant referencing and spoofing of the idea in other texts such as the Krusty doll in The Simpsons that has made Child's Play the 'cult' film that it is. The film takes on ideas of reincarnation when a robber is gunned down in the opening but instead of going out in a hail of bullets or dying with dignity, he possesses a child's doll which is an interesting if not accidentally comical idea when you say it out loud. But the ideas of reincarnation are limited to bizarre incidences that go by very quickly and consist of brief interactions with voodoo driven, black priests in grotty apartments which merely act as nasty locations for Chucky the doll himself to maim said poor fellow.There is more in Child's Play than I thought there would be and certainly, the opening forty minutes or so is interesting because 'less' of the doll very much feels like 'more' of the doll as he goes on a personal vendetta. Plus, the suspense and a few of the deaths are either surprising or just work in a low-rent horror inspired sort of way. Kathy's interaction and gradual, I feel, affection for detective Mike Norris (Sarandon) whose best scene involves him being in an upturned car with the doll running around outside is also good fun to watch. But once asylums complete with rooms that look like operating theatres begin to crop up and certain characters have their brains fried purely because the filmmakers are able to include that effect occur, it feels as if it is dragging  a bizarre thing to have to say about a film that's under 90 minutes long.",Child's Play

47,TheMovieDiorama,Child's Play turns an innocent doll into a menacing foul-mouthed serial killer.,6,25 June 2019,"Ahhh, Chucky. How I've never seen your debut film until now baffles me. A legendary face in the slasher genre, Chucky had always found itself in the mainstream despite the cult following for the franchise. You see an ominous looking doll at a toy store and automatically point whilst screaming ""Chucky!"". The media frenzy that spawned for this character was ludicrous, so I wanted to view the conception of this idolised fictional serial killer with Holland's Child's Play. Suffice to say, holds up pretty darn well. A mother gifts her son with a Good Guys doll for his birthday, unbeknown to her that the doll is possessed by a serial killer who transferred his soul into the toy.My biggest concern was with the balance of horror and comedy. Subconsciously I've been susceptible to various scenes from the franchise throughout the years that made me question the legitimate nature of its slashing descent. Evidently, these moments must've been from sequels as I found the balance in Holland's original to be fairly even. The first half brilliantly emanating dread with Holland's signature slow panning and tempered camera movement. The POV perspectives of both the human characters and Chucky, although excessive to the point that its effect wore off completely, surprisingly maintained the inspired tension in the first half. Exquisite puppetry and animatronic manipulation meant that each head turn or eye roll from Chucky made the hairs on my arms stand up. Very effective work. Again, all in the first half.Hicks gave an endearing and determined performance as the mother, whilst Dourif's killer voice acting gave Chucky a memorable personality. Not exactly a guy I would go for a pint with (I'm more of a cocktail person). Quickly changing from ""I'm you friend to the end. Hidey-ho!"" to ""You stupid b*tch! You filthy sl*t!"" ensued hilarity upon the first line delivery from Chucky. Like I said, going swimmingly well for the first half.Then, unfortunately, we get to the inevitable slashing second half. The tension dissipates, Chucky won't shut up, animatronics are substituted for ""little actors"" or child actors and the plot becomes a little bit more stupid by the minute. I mean, don't get me wrong, it already started off non-sensical with the whole soul transfer scenario (although how else would they do it...). But to then incorporate the voodoo gibberish and the doll slowly becoming human. Eh. Failed to work for me.The escapades that followed after Chucky realised what he needed to do in order to survive, were mediocre at best. Clichés from the slasher genre, let's be honest. Stupid character decisions are embedded throughout, such as the mother venturing out by herself to find Chucky or failing to shoot a heart at point blank range. I shan't begin to discuss the stupidly paper-thin windows that are installed in her apartment. She may want to get double glazing or something...! Chucky, for the sake of personality, excessively spits out expletives and loses that sinister edge from the first half. Vincent's acting teetered between annoying and semi-decent. Oh, and the connotations of inciting child violence were fairly explicit.Still, even though the second half diminished the technical prowess and tension from the first half, it remained entertaining throughout. Holland does an impressive job at directing the silly antics shown on screen, and props to the actors for maintaining a serious approach to the ludicrous story. Just a shame that the latter half prevents this slasher from being my friend til the end...",Child's Play

One night while the mother is at work, the doll kills the babysitter n the cops suspect Andy.
This film inspite of having a doll as a villain, is creepy, brutal n a bit darkly funny. The pacing is good n tension is maintained throughout.
The best part is the face of the doll whenever it gets angry.
The building in which Andy resides looks more like a castle.
The wierd part is this highrise building's windows doesnt have any iron grills. This thing gave me more tension than the kid being chased by a doll.",Child's Play
51,insomniac_rod,"Don't judge it by it's premise, it's a good horror movie.",8,25 August 2004,"""Child's Play"" is a clear example of how some horror movie clichés negatively influence at the moment of picking up or not a movie.Before watching ""Child's Play"" you can say by it's box cover that it's about a demonic doll that starts a killing spree. That's it. With a premise like that created by your horror movie instinct, you watch the movie with low expectations, or in the worst case, you don't even watch it. That has happened to MANY horror movies from the 80's thanks to clichés started by the slasher genre.""Child's Play"" has the advantage of being a good horror movie and overpasses expectations. If you think ""Child's Play"" is a cheesy, silly, slasher flick you will be pleasantly wronged. Sit down, relax, and watch it with NO expectations and you will have a good time.*SPOILERS*Charles Lee Ray a dangerous strangler from the area is killed in a Toys 'r Us store by Detective Mike Norris after a long chase. Moments before dying, Lee Ray speaks a demonic spell and passes his soul to a ""Good Guy"" doll and swears revenge against the Detective and his accomplice in crimes Eddie Caputo. Mrs. Barclay buys the doll for her 6 (?) year old son Andy but little does she knows that the doll is possessed. The doll answers to the name of Chucky (name created by Lee Ray)...and you know the rest.""Child's Play"" has a near to brilliance script if you watch it objectively. I praise Mancini's and Holland's intention to hint the audience about Andy being a possible suspect of the murders. The suspense in this movie is very effective and Holland's direction is top notch. The script is very complete as it deals with a possessed doll doing the killings, black magic, voodoo, police in the hunt of a strangler, and the disbelief of everyone towards the possessed doll.There are many elements that make ""Child's Play"" a GOOD horror movie. First, the story is very well crafted and the characters well written. Second, there's not that much cheesiness (a killer doll is cheesiness) and the movie is always interesting. Third, the good acting is a key element. Chris Sarandon (Mike Norris) is a great actor and his performance in this movie credits him. Tom Holland cast Sarandon mainly because of his great performance in ""Fright Night"". Sarandon has can act in horror movies. Catherine Hicks is good as the worried mother that would do anything to protect her young son. Very good performance. Alex Vincent (Andy Barclay) steals the movie with his tender and believable performance. He looks shocked whenever Chucky does the bad things or threatens him. His probably the most liked child actor in the 80's horror movies. Great performance.Brad Dourif gave the voice to Chucky and he totally shined. He gave a wicked performance and you can't think of Chucky without thinking about Dourif. It helps a lot that Dourif has portrayed weird characters like Chucky.""Child's Play"" has a great cast, good direction, good f/x and make-up (very good for it's time), a decent score, and a high fun factor.This is by no means a GREAT, or BRILLIANT horror movie but it's sure a good one. It's entertaining and wicked on it's own way. One of the best horror movies from the 80's and that's something to say.8/10. Worths a watch.",Child's Play

53,Anonymous_Maxine,This is what a bad movie looks like when it's well made.,8,1 December 2004,"Child's Play is built upon a pretty laughable premise  some hardened criminal finds himself wounded and cornered by the police, so he chants some mystical words, lightning clouds form in the sky, and he transports his soul into the body of a kid's doll of the My Buddy variety. But the movie is so well made that it is able to remain effective despite its questionable premise, kind of like Darkman, another movie with something of a goofy plot but that still manages to come off as a great action horror film.Some of the best moments in the film come early on, before anyone but Andy realizes that Chucky is alive. Kind of like what Steven Spielberg did in Jaws, director Tom Holland leaves Chucky as a lifeless doll for a good portion of the beginning of the film. As is to be expected, it's much more difficult to show a living, running, stabbing, screaming doll than it is to show a regular doll, which itself manages to stare blankly in such a way that you know there's something going on in its head.There's nothing worse than hearing someone criticize the acting skills of a little kid, but I have to admit that I found Alex Vincent's performance as Andy a little trying at times. Granted, the kid deserves a lot of credit for performing reasonably well in a horror film at the age of 7, which is certainly more than I could have done at that age, but for every time that he effectively portrayed a scared little kid, which happened often, there were at least as many times when he spoke with the wooden monotone generally associated with reading a cue card.That being said, the effects in the movie are very impressive. There are a few goofs in there, but you have to look pretty hard to find them, and the doll itself was very well done. Brad Dourif makes one of his earlier appearances, showing up in Child's Play just long enough to get shot and then transfer his body into the doll, and then spend the rest of what is now a total of five movies trying to get out of it, which may have something to do with the fact that his voice is more famous than his face. He was mostly known as the timid Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before he did Child's Play, and the success of this movie clearly had a significant impact on the rest of his career, since so many of his later performances were in decidedly dark roles.Note: watch for the only funny scene in the movie, which my itself is so funny that any other comic relief isn't even necessary. As Chucky ascends in an elevator, and elderly woman notices him, but her husband tells her to just leave it, whoever forgot it is bound to come back for it. When she exits the elevator, she looks back with a grimace and says, 'Ugly doll' Chucky's response is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a horror film.",Child's Play

There are some good, tense moments; a decent execution of the voodoo angle; believable performances by all involved; a campy but fun story line; and a satisfying, if somewhat smarmy, ending.The transformation sequence, if not original, did have a creative spin and a unique execution. This was a classic ""B"" horror, directed by Tom Holland, which was so bad, it was good. I never figured out how Chucky could reach doorknobs, light switches, and elevator buttons, though. Just a bit of creative licensing, I suppose, but it contributed a heavy feeling of camp throughout this fun little cheese-fest. Honestly, I like this movie for its cast.In spite of its shortcomings, I highly enjoy watching this movie, and the subsequent sequels. I guess this is one of My ""guilty pleasures."" *LOL* On a more serious note, I must comment on the detriment of our society, in that a child must rely on a doll for his/her only companionship, rather than the company of his/her mother or other human contact. I would say that if she had found him a good play group to begin with, he never would have been obsessed with this doll.6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Child's Play
57,strong-122-478885,"And To Think That This All Happened In Hackensack, N.J.",6,15 November 2017,"Favourite Movie Quote: ""Hidey-Ho!"" Could Child's Play really be a dire message, warning parents about caving into their child's demands, while (at the same time) trying to save themselves a few lousy bucks on the price of a toy?.... I don't know. Maybe it's so.When it comes to the movies (and, yes, the genre of horror, in particular), it sure seems to me that there's definitely nothing new under the sun.A doll (or dummy) taking on a life of its own and then committing unspeakable acts of mayhem and murder goes all the way back to 1945 with Dead Of Night. In this first-rate, supernatural Thriller, Hugo, a ventriloquist's dummy, starts giving its owner/operator some pretty tall orders, which inevitably leads to some mighty deadly business before the show is over.Anyway - As horror movies, in general, go, Child's Play's two assets (the things that kept it from sinking down into the ""fright flick"" dregs) were its devilishly clever manipulations of the ""Chucky"" doll, and its overall snarky and, often times, wicked sense of humour.All-in-all (in spite of its obvious flaws) - Child's Play was a fairly fun horror flick that actually managed to pack a considerable-sized wallop and even score itself some genuine points (in my books) for, at least, trying to be original.",Child's Play
58,dee.reid,"""Child's Play"" - It's not make-believe anymore!",7,29 July 2007,"I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but ""Child's Play"" scared the living daylights out of me when I was a kid, one of many horror movies to do so while I was growing up. Now, as an adult at 21, I'm glad to say that it doesn't scare me at all, but nonetheless this movie marked the beginnings of another classic screen slasher, soon to be followed by the inevitable countless sequels.The 1980s were dominated by the likes of Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Fred Krueger, so why is the slasher in ""Child's Play"" so scary? Because the slasher is, you guessed it from looking at the posters, a doll. Perhaps ""Child's Play"" was an attempt by the filmmakers to cash in on the doll craze of the '80s, you know, from My Buddy to the Cabbage Patch Kids, the dolls your kids just *had* to have.With that said after having viewed this film in its entirety for the first time, I'm glad to say that I never owned such a play-thing growing up. He might have tried to hurt me, or even worse, possess me, which is exactly what happens here in this neatly packaged and entertaining, albeit clichéd little horror film from ""Fright Night"" director Tom Holland.In the opening moments, Chicago detective Mike Norris (Holland's ""Fright Night"" alumni Chris Sarandon) has managed to mortally wound serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) as he runs into a toy store. In the haste of the chase, Ray dies, but not before having transferred his soul (using Voodoo magic) into a conveniently placed Good Guy doll. One special effects explosion later, the Good Guy doll winds up in the loving arms of six-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) as a birthday present from his widowed mom Karen (Catherine Hicks) after the struggling mother buys it off the street from a peddler.After the babysitter takes a swan dive out the kitchen window, Norris is brought in to investigate the possibility that sweet little Andy may have a homicidal dark side. But Andy insists that his new Good Guy doll, who he has given the name ""Chucky,"" killed the babysitter and that his real name is Charles Lee Ray, the recently deceased serial killer. No one believes Andy's claims that Chucky is possessed by the soul of a dead serial killer, but Chucky's homicidal rampage continues with Andy looking more and more like a child in desperate need of attention.It is not without some degree of irony that ""Child's Play,"" despite its familiar slasher flick trappings, seems to represent every parent's worst nightmare: that make-believe can become flesh & blood reality sometimes - and it's also hard to believe that something so innocent could be so dangerous. Perhaps if the slasher route had not been taken, ""Child's Play"" could have enjoyed endless possibilities as a psychological thriller. But this is not to say that the film is a total failure. In fact, in Holland's hands, he keeps the tension mounting from the get-go up until Chucky claims his first victim nearly 30 minutes into the picture. Even by strictly abiding by typical horror film conventions, Holland makes sure his film is tight and creepy with some above-average performances from the leads and a truly dark sense of humor.Chucky, voiced by Dourif, is one creepy-looking doll with an attitude and very foul mouth. Dourif's voiced Chucky in all of the sequels and despite a very limited role, he was really able to do a lot with his voice and darkly humored one-liners. This does somewhat allow him to stand out against his counterparts who are all bigger than he is and could easily get the drop on him. As fate would have it, though, Chucky would spend the next two sequels trying to transfer his soul into poor Andy and failing miserably every time. And he even received another playmate in the form of the equally-murderous Tiffany in ""Bride of Chucky"" (1998).Make-believe - it's not Child's Play anymore.7/10",Child's Play
59,atinder,Not a classic but still really good movie,7,24 August 2009,"Before I Start This was thdLast Child's Play I saw, as it was not in shop for over years, I think I Waited 7 Year for this DVD to come back into shops, when came back in shops, I had to get it, as I have the got rest on DVD.This movie starts of really well, as we see Charles Lee Ray is being chased by Mike Norris and then end up getting shot and mortally wounded by Norris. Before dying, Charles then goes into a toy-store finding boxes of Good Guy dolls, and uses a voodoo ritual that will transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning, and it burns to the ground.Then we see Andy while making breakfast in bed for his mum, he notice an advert on TV for a Good guy doll, and tells his mum he want good guy doll. Later The mum buy him the doll for Andy which happens to be the one that Charles lee Ray transfers his soul into. Then later that night Maggie is babysitting Andy and while Babysitter she is killed, We don't see who kills the Babysitter but the cops believe that Andy the one killed her,then more people start dying and that putting Andy in the frame.When we finally See Chucky talking, Swearing and moving, this is where the movie shines, with a good car crash scenes, which wad really good and The Voodoo Doll Death was favourite part of movie, as it was really hard to watch.I wss little disappointed with this as it start of really slow, we never saw Chucky talk until 45 minutes in to movie, after that scene the movie action packed until the end, I wouldn't called this movie a classic but It's a very good movie, I would recommend it, to any horror fan.",Child's Play
60,kevin_robbins,I could watch this 100 more times.,8,3 May 2021,"Child's Play (1987) is a movie I watched for the first time in a long time off the Showtime App. The storyline focuses on a possessed doll that discovers that his opportunity to become real is to kill the first person he came in contact with as a doll. That happens to be the little boy he was given to. This movie was directed by Tom Holland (Fright Night) and stars Chris Sarandon (Fright Night), Catherine Hicks (Peggy Sue Got Married), Brad Dourif (Over Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Alan Wilder (Home Alone) and Alex Vincent (Child's Play 2). This is an oldie but goody. Every line, kill sequence and characters is fun and well done across the board. The little boys clothing in this movie is crazy, right out of a 1980s tonka trucks or play school commercial. The one thing that always annoyed me about this movie is how soft the killer was compared to how assertive and slick he was as a doll. I never bought Chucky the doll being the same personality as Charles Lee ""Chucky"" Ray. Maybe it was just the actor choice as Mr. Ray (Dourif). I had also forgot about the kid getting locked up scene so that fun to watch again. The police were pathetically incompetent in this. One of those movies you think to yourself, ""a police officer would never do that"" . Officer Norris probably was milking the possessed doll story so he could score with Ms. Barclay, but I digress. Overall this isn't perfect but is an all time classic that gets an 8/10 for entertainment value. I could watch this 100 more times.",Child's Play

64,drownnnsoda,One Of The Most Original Horror Films Of The Late '80s.,8,6 January 2007,"""Child's Play"" has become somewhat of a horror classic over the years, and has gained more and more popularity (probably due to the large number of sequels). The movie is about a single mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks, most popular for her long-running role on the television series ""7th Heaven""), who has a young son named Andy (Alex Vincent). Andy's birthday is coming up, and he wants a ""Good Guy"" doll - an interactive, talking doll that is really popular at the time. Karen is short on money and is working at a department store, but manages to get one of the dolls from a peddler on the streets. Little does she know, the doll has been possessed by the spirit of a recently-killed serial killer, Charles Lee Ray (voiced by Brad Dourif). Soon after Andy has the doll, people who come near it begin to die mysteriously, and Andy says he sees his doll, whom he's named Chucky, come to life. His mother doesn't believe him, but soon enough she will...Probably one of the most original horror movies of the late '80s, ""Child's Play"" is a unique and well-done horror/thriller that is very fun to view. Unlike most slasher films, the villain in this movie is in the form of a possessed doll - and a creepy looking little doll at that. A wise choice by director Tom Holland, the audience never really gets to see Chucky completely in motion for the majority of the film. We mainly see things from the doll's point of view, which is a lot more effective and much creepier than seeing an animatronic doll running around killing people. As the film progresses though, we do see more of Chucky in motion (talking, moving, etc.), but for a good amount of time leading up to that, we see him in his lifeless form, as everyone else seems to see him. And I think his presence is much better because of that.I liked the cast in the film. Nobody performed badly, and Catherine Hicks is a really likable actress. I haven't seen her in much, but she's a good actress and her characters are always very likable (from what I've seen, anyway). Alex Vincent, the young performer playing Andy isn't bad either, and Brad Dourif provides an appropriate voice for the murdering doll. As I've said before, I don't like dolls and I never have. They've always kind of weirded me out. In fact, when I was a young kid (maybe six or seven years old), my mom worked at a video store and the owners of the store received a little promotional Chucky doll when they got ""Child's Play"" in, and they displayed it behind a glass window in the office with suction cups. And boy, I remember being literally terrified of that thing! It wasn't until later on when I was older that I finally saw this movie, but that little doll was one of my distinct childhood fears.Bottom line - ""Child's Play"" is a really good horror movie with an original plot and some good camera-work (plus a few very creepy moments). Horror fans will definitely want to check this movie out - even though the premise can be looked at as laughable, it's still a very good little scary movie. If you like this film, you may also want to check out ""Dolls"", which was made a few years before this, and is also a very spooky killer-doll movie. 8/10.",Child's Play

I still remember the old video case we had at our house & remember watching this alot when i was way too young but i really enjoyed it & yes it scared me as a kid.Now i really like Child's Play 2 & consider it a great fun & underrated movie but part 3 was terrible & everything else was terrible until the really surprisingly good Reboot that is more a techno-Thriller but none came close to the greatness of the 1988 original.
Tom Holland directed to hell outta Child's Play & made it a very gritty looking Cops & Criminals flick (The fantastic opening sequence) & a Stylish, suspenseful Mystery, Supernatural, Voodoo-Horror flick about a Doll possessed by the spirit of a serial killer, how Awesome is that for a Horror movie Idea!!!I love the cold, gritty & wintery setting of the urban Chicago & i have always loved the main adult characters of Karen, a truly brilliant & iconic performance by Katherine Hicks & an excellent iconic Cop performance from Chris Sarandon as Detective Mike Norris!!! Both actors are superb in this movie & both are life-lasting & iconic especially within the Horror Genre!!! Chris Sarandon was also great in Tom Holland's earlier Horror Classic FRIGHT NIGHT (1985) & Holland made the best casting choice ever by putting his Fright Night star in his Killer Doll Slasher & having him this time play the hero, a no-nonsense tough Chicago Cop & he's fantastic on this film & is the best I've ever seen him ever!!! Same can be said for the brilliance of Katherine Hicks as the equally tough & disturbed mother of Andy, she's fantastic & I've never seen her give a better or more commanding performance since, to be honest I've not seen her in hardly anything else which is a shame.Child's Play is a Nostalgic all time Horror Classic",Child's Play

The special effects in child's play are pretty cool looking and too and don't look cheap or fake.

Chucky the killer doll has so infected popular culture that I'd have had to have been living in a nuclear bunker not to know of the doll's character. I'd seen clips here and there, but I never honestly felt the need to go out of the way to watch it, until, of course, the 2019 remake (""Child's Play"") came out starring Mark Hamill as Chucky. Figuring that I probably shouldn't review the remake before watching the original, I decided I'd finally give the original a go. While I certainly laughed my fair share, I can't say this is a good movie. Alternatively, just because a movie is subpar, doesn't mean I didn't enjoy myself.""Child's Play"" falls in that narrow strip between good and bad where I can somewhat ironically enjoy this film just because the plot is so farfetched, and the violence is so gleefully bonkers that the film starts to be self-deprecating to its own seriousness. The movie is kind of a mess, but the concept is so ridiculous that I actually don't mind. I'm actually looking forward to at least watching the first five movies in the series, because I guess John Waters (director of ""Female Trouble"" and ""Multiple Maniacs"") and Billy Boyd (Pippin from ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"") have appearances in ""Seed of Chucky"".

71,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"A Good, Dark Super Natural Slasher",9,26 November 2019,"This film has historic significance in starting the franchise of Child's Play, but also for creating the character of Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif). The synopsis for this original film is a single mother gives her a son a much sought-after doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer.As I was watching this film, I realized that I had never seen this film all the way through, growing up. I watched it on DVD and then got to see it again in the theater on 35mm. I would normally pop in at different times and knew pretty much everything that happened though. Something that I had heard from others as well as I noticed myself as watch this film, this one is much darker than any of the rest and the fear is much higher. Chucky has some funny lines in this film, but I think that might be just what I find to be funny as well as I know what the role becomes. Part of me is also interested in more in a concept that wasn't explored for this film that would have changed the course of the series forever.In the beginning of this film after Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) gets his Good Guy Doll, we don't see it move and it only talks by saying the lines that were recorded for it. The first half of the film portrays that maybe the crimes are being done by Andy while he blames it on Chucky. This would have killed the franchise or changed the course, but I almost think this could have made for a better movie. That is just my personal feelings on some trivia I discovered, but back to my thoughts on this film.I still find this to be a strong horror film. The story is really good, because Chucky strategically reveals his secret to a child. No one is going to believe the child that his doll is alive and we see this from his mother, Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks), and the police officer who is investigating all of the murders, Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). There is an issue I have though is that when Chucky's associate is murdered and Andy is the suspect, there would be zero connection between Andy and this man. Clearly Chucky would, but I will say that it would be difficult to believe, but how would the child know who that person was. That was just an issue I had with the thought process behind the film.This film is edited well and it does build tension to the climax. I thought the climax was satisfying. I have heard some people not buying that this doll would be that menacing due to his height. There is something with fear of seeing something that is not normal and not being able to process it. I feel the editing for the film works with the story. I also like that despite how I kind of wanted it play out, we do get hints early on that Chucky is actually doing this. It also has a good running time and never lags at any point.To bring this to life, there needs to be good acting which I think we also get. Hicks I thought is strong and believable in her processing of what is happening. I thought the angle of a struggling single mother was good. I believe that she is doing the best she can and it felt real. When her best friend dies, she is in shock and hearing what Andy says upsets her. It isn't until she makes a discovery that she believes him. Sarandon is good as the police officer. I do think that he is a little too dense on believing, but it works. Vincent kills his role which was quite surprising for his age. I thought it was good and he actually makes me tear up at one point. I also want to say that Dourif is phenomenal as Chucky and Charles Lee Ray. The rest of the cast rounds out the film well.Along with the acting, the effects are important to a film like this, which I also thought were also good. The biggest thing is bringing the doll to life and I thought it looks solid. There are a few times that I notice things that don't really hold up, but for 1988, it was state of the art. They blend well with using smaller actors and robots to bring it to film, which together make a solid product. I also thought that the kills were good and the realism of them was there. I like the look of the blood as well. The only thing left to touch on would be the score of the film.The sound design was good. None of the song selections really stand out, but they help to heighten the mood of the scene. It doesn't have the best soundtrack and I wouldn't be seeking it out, but it does what it needs to. I do feel this is a positive overall.Now with all of that said, this film is actually really good. The concept does seem to be a little bit hokie, but I think it works. This is a good supernatural slasher in my opinion. The story is good. I know writer and creator Don Macini didn't like the voodoo angle that was brought in, but I think that it works. Even the voodoo death I give a pass by it explaining how Chucky's soul gets into the doll. The editing of this story builds the tension to the satisfying conclusion. The acting along with the soundtrack help to heighten and allow it to play out as it should as well. The effects of the film were good as the deaths look real and the doll comes to life. I definitely recommend seeing this film. This one isn't as fun as the sequels and it is the darkest of all of them. For that reason, I do think this one is really good.",Child's Play
72,Samiam3,Let playtime begin!,7,21 June 2009,"Original, scary, and with competent special effects, what more could you expect from low budget horror, Child's Play delivers the goods. Even with the short running time, the film paces itself perfectly. It gives a nice introduction to the characters which keeps them out of the cardboard dimension level, and then it offers a worthy hour of sheer creepiness which does not disappoint for a moment.One night in Chicago, serial killer Charles Lee Ray is shot down by the police during a robbery, but before he dies he uses some black magic to transfer his soul into the body of a doll product in a toy store. A few days later this doll is given as a present to little Andy from his mother. Then a bunch of strange deaths start to occur in the neighborhood, and neither his mother nor the police believe Andy when he tells them that not only does his doll 'Chucky' speak to him but he is responsible for the mischief.

73,RainDogJr,"""Ugly Doll"" ""F*** You""",9,3 November 2008,"A very popular film yet just last weekend I watched it complete finally. Of course I knew Chucky and I had seen this film in parts just like some of its sequels, recently I watched part of ""Child's Play 2"" on TV by the way, and as a fact not long time ago I realized that the film's title was not ""Chucky"" and honestly I was surprised. In Mexico its title is ""Chucky, el muñeco diabolico"" (something like: Chucky, the diabolic doll"") and it is always referred as ""Chucky"" so and honestly I always thought that its original title was that.Anyway, I decided to finally get its DVD (I love this days since most of the horror films on DVD are on sale!) and I'm glad, certainly ""Child's Play"" was a pleasant movie for the Halloween weekend. This film is amazingly entertaining, maybe it is one of the most entertaining films I have seen and Chucky is truly a memorable character, extremely famous, a unique doll that can be more than just a headache, a doll that simply can kill you if he wants. He's a Good Guy, he's the doll of a quite popular TV show for kids and certainly Andy (Alex Vincent) is a fan of it. He seems to have seen already most of the episodes, he has the cereal of the show and for his birthday he wants one of the new and expensive dolls however his mother (Catherine Hicks) gave to him other stuff, we understand why since the Good Guy doll cost like $100 but we can't understand why she gave him clothes as present, you just can't give that to a kid! Anyway, thanks to her best friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) Andy's mother finds a Good Guy doll that is selling a tramp and she could get it for $30, she knew that Andy really wanted a Good Guy.The idea is effective, I loved it since the danger comes from the last thing the characters could have imagine, you know you buy a doll for your son and it results to be a killer doll and we know why but who will believe Andy when he says that his Good Guy doll Chucky is alive? And this is great, having a kid saying that stuff about his doll then the kid is the main suspect of the murders, for sure a kid talking about stuff like that will end away of his parents, in this case only of his mother. To watch Chucky on fire is quite fun and I loved that and eventually more persons will see that Chucky is alive, certainly Andy's mother will be one of those persons but obviously nobody will believe her either, after all she's a desperate mother trying to save her son. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) is an important character, he's one of the targets of Chucky since he is the cop who killed the strangler Charles Lee Ray. The very first sequence of the film has In Charles Lee Ray and Mike Norris its protagonists and we can watch that Charles Lee Ray knew certain stuff so when we see why he knew that stuff Andy becomes a target of Chucky. We enjoy a nice ending, Mike, Andy and his mother will fight but Chucky will survive to any kind of thing, he will be burned out, they will shot him, he will end in pieces but still he will be alive. So by then not only Andy, his mother and Mike knew that Chucky was alive but also Mike's partner who will also experience the anger of Chucky and he says something like this, after Mike said that if now he believes him: ""yeah I believe you now, BUT WHO'S GONNA BELIEVE ME?""",Child's Play
74,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The Doll From Hell,8,29 December 2011,"Watching this film was like watching the original Dead Silence (2007). I say this because for the beginning of this movie, Chucky is silent and creates the fear and has us wonder what really lurks inside the ""good guy"" doll. Even for its time it can scare the living crap out of anyone. So what if it's dated, Chucky is a terrifying creation and no matter what, it will give the desired scares.So how does this ""good guy"" doll become such a horrific killer? Well it is almost like possession except it's not with a real body. Catherine Hicks plays the mother of her son Andy played by Alex Vincent. Andy is the sweetest kid you could find; innocent and although he acts just like a normal kid, he has respect for his mother and what she does for him and that's what gives him his cuteness. I feel that Alex Vincent is the best actor in this film. For the most part Andy keeps his cool but even when he started to cry, I felt like crying, he was that good.Although the effects in this film are dated, I feel that they work really well. Everything from the way Chucky walks, his facial expressions, his eye movement, they all make him look very life-like. What's even more interesting is that as Chucky is more and more on screen, the more human he becomes; and not just because he is told that, but by his looks. Look at him closely as the film progresses to its finale. You'll understand what I mean. I'll say this as a clue, if you were to compare the differences between the ""good guy"" version and Chucky's end result, they are nothing alike.What I like most about this movie is the whole atmosphere. The way the story is set up is just too good to set aside. The dialog is memorable and so is the musical score by Joe Renzetti. Almost each moment carries the emotions of fear and dread. Those kinds of soundtracks can really freak people out. I feel that if this were to be left out, this movie would not as scary. Adding to the effect is how no one believes Andy that Chucky is alive. This creates even more fear because how is this little kid going to convince everyone he's not crazy? They will soon find out.This film has a lot really great moments that makes it hard to comprehend that this was made in the 1980s. With director Tom Holland at the wheel, Child's Play is considered a classic horror film.",Child's Play
75,PredragReviews,"Meet Chucky, the killer doll.",8,7 March 2016,"Chucky has become a horror icon over the years. Directed by horror contributor Tom Holland who also directed Fright Night. Another horror regular Brad Dourif and that voice, he makes Chucky a doll version of Samuel L. Jackson's, Jules, from Pulp Fiction. Most notably his response to being thrown in the fire. Dourif along with the Fx team helped create one of the best doll horror movies. Other good one's that come to mind are the Zuni fetish doll from Trilogy of Terror and Stuart Gordon's Dolls. Okay, it's a cheesy premise. The fact that Chucky is a killer doll might intrigue some, might make most laugh. But, really, if you watch it, you'll see that it's a very stylish horror film. I always believe that its strong point was how it obscured Chucky for a good enough portion of the film, revealing him in full motion at the height of intensity. Now that is what I call masterful directing on behalf of a horror film.Overall i will recommend this movies to all horror fans out there!My Ratings: 8 out of 10.",Child's Play
76,gangstahippie,The second best and most serious child's play movie,8,9 March 2008,"Rated R for Violence and Language.Child's Play is the first in the ""Chucky"" series of horror films.There are 5 films in total.The film had a pretty laughable concept of a killer doll and the series slowly turned into a horror/comedy series but this first film is much more serious.There is no humor whatsoever in this film.It is meant to be taken seriously and it does a decent job of making a killer doll seem scary.The film is about a man who'se soul ends up inside a good guy doll named Chucky.Now with the doll's body, he must take over the soul of the first human he sees which is the four year old Andy.He also gets revenge on the people who wronged him.Child's Play is a fairly good horror film even though the concept is funny.This film is very serious though.The second one I remember had one funny scene, Child's Play 3 had a few more funny scenes and Bride Of Chucky and Seed Of Chucky were real horror/comedies.",Child's Play
77,vengeance20,Pretty Good!,7,1 August 2018,"Only got into the franchise 7 odd years before & even then didn't start watching till about 1 year after. Child's Play is about a 6 year boy named Andy Barclay who wants a Good Guy Doll on the day of his 6th Birthday, only for it to be possessed by the soul of the notorious serial killer, Charles Lee Ray! Who begins to pick off anyone he comes into contact with while his main goal is to transfer his soul into Andy's body so he can live again after being confronted by police who chase him into a toy store where the dolls are selling like hot cakes!I found the film to be pretty good! Not amazing, I mean the kills were ok but too simple & ""easy"" if you know what I mean. But the story & the film as a whole for being the original is what gives it the high points for me! The film has a typical late 80's feel to it & the characters were all great, including Brad Dourif who plays the serial killer of Charles Lee Ray & Chucky Doll! I also liked the straight forward story-line to the film, which unlike the further installments after Curse of Chucky, become complex & utterly stupid!But overall this film is pretty decent & great! I recommend it to any horror fan! 7/10",Child's Play
78,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Moments of genuine fear, instances of quirky humor and a very solid foundation make ""Child's Play"" stand as a good example of 80's horror done right.",8,13 September 2014,"Ahh. Good ole' Chucky. Our friend till the end.I was born the year ""Child's Play"" crept into theaters and began of legacy of horror for audiences around the world. And I grew up in the heyday of Chucky- the end of the 80's and early-to-mid 90's. I remember seeing that doll everywhere for the first 15 years of my life. And it terrified me, as someone with an older sister that owned a number of Cabbage Patch dolls that fairly closely resembled him. When I was a young child, I was even convinced her dolls were actually Chucky in disguise, coming to get me. It also didn't help that she used to prank me with them as well, further solidifying the FACT that Chucky was going to get me in my mind.I have a lot of wonderful memories of the fear that Chucky used to instill into me. (It's funny how memories of childhood fear can eventually turn into nostalgia.) But oddly enough, I didn't see the films themselves until I was quite a bit older. And by that time, I was over my childhood fear, and ready to see the films for what they really were.And I was surprised to discover how very decent, solid and well- structured the original ""Child's Play"" is. And how truly creepy it actually was at times.The film opens with the death of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), who is gunned down in a toy-store by officer Mike Norris. (Chris Sarandon) With his dying breath, Ray is able to choke out a slew of magical words, and transfer his soul into the last thing he touched- a ""Good Guy""- the most popular, trendy of children's dolls. Eventually, the doll finds itself in the hand of young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), and soon after, mysterious events begin to plague the life of he and his mother Karen. (Catherine Hicks) What could it be? It surely can't be the doll, ""Chucky"", despite Andy's insistence that it is... could it? (Well, obviously it is, and this fact was spoiled for audiences through all the advertising.)Directed by Tom Holland, the film is based on a story by first-time screenwriter Don Mancini. There's a lot of lore about Mancini's original script (a darker satire about how advertising and consumerism can negatively affect children), and how Holland and the other writers radically altered it. And I do think it's a shame. Even though the final film is quite solid, hearing the stories of just what was in the original script has left me wishing we could have seen the intended original vision. ...but I digress.Holland gives some fairly expert direction to the story. While I'm not really a fan of Holland (his other work being mainly comprised of projects I feel were misses), he guides the narrative with competence and style, building a rather good sense of dread and wonder through key camera-work and composition. His work is slick and lends itself well to the material, and I also enjoyed his ability to nail a few really good gags in addition to delivering the thrills.The performances are uniformly quite good, and do much to ground the otherwise sort-of silly storyline, making it hit home and giving a sense of believability. Hicks and Sarandon in particular knock it out of the park. You really buy Hicks as a mother desperate to figure out what is happening, and doing her best to protect her child. Brad Dourif is also a revelation as not only serial killer Charles Lee Ray, but also the voice of the possessed doll Chucky. This truly is Dourif's franchise when it comes to on screen presence. He's menacing. He's amusing. And while others may have phoned in their performance, Dourif approaches the material seriously, as though he's getting ready to get up on stage and deliver Shakespeare. It helps a lot that he treats the script with respect.Frankly, there isn't much I can say against the film, as it seems to fundamentally succeed (if not completely excel at) what it sets out to accomplish. Though I will comment that I feel I cannot give the film a higher score, due to what I feel is a concept made shallow through rewrites. And I feel that Holland tips his hat too much when it comes to the scare sequences. The film almost seems to be going for an angle that tries to suggest Andy may be responsible for what is happening (which was evidently a large element of Mancini's original script), but Holland's construction contradicts this, by making Chucky the only possible cause. (And I'm not spoiling anything by saying that.)Still, I feel this is quite a good little horror film of yester-year. It's one of those rare slashers that feels like it has some thought and heart put into its production. And it emerges as one of the finer examples of ""80's Horror"" done right.""Child's Play"" easily earns a quite good 8 out of 10 from me. And it's a ""classic"" that is definitely worth checking out for fans of horror and suspense. (Or people who, like me, grew up afraid of that darned doll!)",Child's Play
79,Abdulxoxo,The best of the bunch,8,25 July 2021,"The last classic horror character of a decade that gave us quite a few of them, ""Child's Play"" introduces us to Chucky. The Good Guy doll imbued with the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray through a voodoo spell. It's an ingenious concept from Don Mancini, who slowly torments us with Chucky's arrival at the home of Andy, a sweet, impressionable little kid who Chucky makes look like a total psycho. The only problem with the first half is that we already know otherwise. Nonetheless, the big
reveal on Chucky (around the 40 minute mark) Is worth the wait; both an unnerving and funny experience and the facial expressions on the doll, the fact it can bleed and feel pain, and it comes with Dourif's all-out lunacy for a vocal bring the character to stunning life. That he spends the second half going head to head with Catherine Hick's mother of Andy and Chris Sarandon's cop offer some jaw-dropping confrontations until we get to the finale, which has fun with that familiar horror trope of never really knowing when the monster is truly dead.

That used to have the perfect amount of horror and comedy. And a compelling storyline, when Chucky wasn't as cartoonish. And soon became completely ridiculed, as sequels were green lit without reading the script. Just like Jason and Freddy, « he » turned into a comic book vilain, and lost all its edge from where he was introduced. The movie in itself, is not the best of the genre there is. But it was original enough to keep you hooked. Rewatching it, made me wish things weren't so cut and dry. And that the ambiguity of who or what the killer was, remained a little longer. It's entertaining and enjoyable for what it is, and a nice surprise from when you only know, or saw this character, in « his » other movies.

81,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,I'm not sure why it has a rating higher than 5...,5,7 September 2014,"My Bloody Valentine (1981), is my favorite movie, despite it's low budget and such. It has a 6.1/10 rating, and when I saw Child's Play, I honestly couldn't believe it had a rating any higher.A maniac serial killer, just before he dies, possesses a creepy-looking doll within a toy store. A single mom strapped for cash buys it from a hobo to give to her annoying little brat-of-a-son for his birthday, and it tells him its name is Chucky. As bizarre and horrible events begin to happen, such as her son being around when his babysitter falls to her death and a house blows up in a derelict part of town, his mom begins to suspect that Chucky is behind it all.Sure, Chucky has its moments. In and of itself, it's a rather freaky looking doll. What annoyed me was the bad acting, unoriginal and highly cheesy plot and boring soundtrack. The little boy was sweet, but in that too-fake, very annoying way so that each time he talked I wanted to rip his head off a little more. It was easy to predict the next move of the doll, and I think I would have found it more enjoyable when I was twelve years old and I was still into Goosebumps.Overall, Child's Play is not a bad movie. But I won't be checking out the sequels any time soon, and I don't think I'll ever watch it again.",Child's Play
82,Howlin Wolf,Holland takes an absurd premise and cranks up the scare factor! A horror icon is born... (CONTAINS SPOILERS),8,2 March 2001,"Director Tom Holland (who also gave us the cult classic, ""Fright Night"") takes an absurd premise and transforms it into one of the defining horror flicks of the 80's.  Cue catchphrase: ""Hi, I'm Chucky, wanna play...?""   One thing that the makers of the later ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels could learn by watching this is why the comedy element of this film works. Asking us to take a killer doll completely seriously was always going to be a stretch, so they threw in a little (dark) comedy.  Freddy Krueger is a character we should be able to take seriously, because of the child abuse that forms part of the mythology of his character.  What works for one film is a huge misfire in the other (see my ANOES 4 review for more details)   Holland is helped in his mission to transform a silly plot into a genuinely disturbing horror thriller by a nice cast (why has Chris Sarandon sunk into obscurity?)  Particularly good are Sarandon as the cop, Dinah Manoff as the single mum's best friend, and of course, Dourif as Charles Lee Ray/The Voice of ""Chucky"".(SPOILERS)   An atmospheric opening sequence helps set the tone, and the first viewing is especially good because you're never quite sure how ""Chucky"" will choose to present himself.  The scene where he makes himself known to Andy's mum must surely enter the ranks of the horror classics...   STANDOUT SCENE: Where ""Chucky"" goes to visit his old voodoo-practising pal:  ""I gotta go, John, I got a date with a six year-old kid, and YOU have a date with death...""   What could have ended up as a laughable B-movie became one of the best known horror films of the decade, thanks largely to Holland's intelligent direction.

A lot of dialogues and actions are rather simplistic and none too convincing, but somehow 'Child's play' had its charm. Yesternight, I watched it again, and I wasn't in awe as much, but it's still a fun cult thing.The cast do their jobs quite adequately, with Catherine Hicks, Dinah Manoff and Alex Vincent deserving a special mention.

The boy wants a good guy doll for his birthday and since it's too expensive Karen bought it from a paddler with a stroller in the street. Aunt Maggie was attacked by chucky when she was babysitting the boy and fall from the window kitchen. Then the boy and chucky left school secretly to an abandoned house in a neighborhood of the homeless to find and kill the guy who ran away when the detective shot chucky the man who possessed the doll. Chucky turned on the gas of the oven in the abandoned house and the house blew up and killed his partner. Then the police took the boy to a clinic thinking he has psychiatric problems. Karen got back home alone and noticed that chucky was walking and talking without batteries and chucky attacked her when she threatened him to burn in the fireplace. She got away to find the guy who sold it and the detective saved her before the homeless rape her. The detective in the police car got attacked by chucky and had an accident and got convinced eventually. The voodoo guy taught chucky how to possess another thing and he came to his house to find out how to leave this doll. He killed him using his own voodoo doll and learnt that he has to kill the first person he told who he really is: the boy. He then got to the clinic where the boy is staying and killed the doctor with electroshock while the boy was trying to escape. He got back home by himself and hid in the closet and chucky entered the flat from the fireplace. The two arrived and he attacked all of them until Karen confined him in th fireplace and set him on fire. But he wasn't dead. The other detective arrived and didn't believe their story and chucky attacked him too with his headless charred torso and the other injured detective shot him in the heart just like the voodoo guy told them to do so. He was finally dead and left for the hospital for the detective. It was really good to watch the birth of such a classic set in a snowy Chicago winter in the '80s.,Child's Play
88,IonicBreezeMachine,A mixture of high camp and high tension anchored by a creepy and darkly comedic turn by Brad Dourif results in a bloody good time.,7,17 October 2021,"Struggling single mother, Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks), wants to buy her son Andy (Alex Vincent) a Good Guy doll for his birthday, but is prevented from dong so by the high cost. When Karen's friend, Maggie (Dinah Manoff), manages to find a street peddler with a Good Guy doll for $30 Karen jumps at the opportunity. Andy is warmly receptive of the new doll, named ""Chucky"", but Andy begins having strange conversations with Chucky and eventually suspicious occurrences happen with the doll including the seemingly accidental death of Maggie. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) is initially suspicious that Andy is the culprit despite Andy's claims that the doll is alive. Karen and Mike eventually discover the doll may have a connection to deceased serial killer, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), brought back through unnatural means.Written by Don Mancini with influence taken from everything from the Cabbage Patch Kids fad to Richard Attenborough's psychological thriller Magic, Child's Play was initially written as a much more psychological ""whodunit"" type film before incorporating a more streamlined setup inspired by trends such as Nightmare on Elm Street. Produced by United Artists with eyes set on a potential series, the movie's production was not seamless with negative test audience reactions to the initial two hour rough cut, and clashes between director Tom Holland and producer David Kirschner over the amount of screen time that should be given to the doll, and even redubbing original Chucky voice actor Jessica Walter with Brad Dourif. The movie was released to not only positive reviews (including from Roger Ebert who's noted for his distaste for the genre) but also healthy box office generating $33 million dollars in the united states alone and establishing Chucky as a new Horror icon.Much like Tom Holland's other beloved 80s horror classic, Fright Night, Child's Play balances both horror and humor making a film with genuine tension but also moments of dark comedy. Brad Dourif owns the role of Chuck/Charles Lee Ray and much like Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Kruger is cheerfully sadistic with a foul mouth and sick sense of humor but still makes the role distinguished enough not to invite unfavorably comparisons. Alex Vincent is really good as the 6 year old boy Vincent who carries himself quite well in the movie (despite occasional hiccups as expected with child actors) and sells a sympathetic and likable protagonist who also has moments of ingenuity and competence such as misdirecting the doll or keeping his back to the wall when Chucky is in the same room as him. Chris Sarandon is also quite good as the skeptical homicide detective Mike Norris and Catherine Hicks does quite well as the struggling single mother trying to save her son. The movie never takes itself ""that"" seriously with it playing the concept of a killer doll with a level of self-awareness without going into full on parody and it manages not only to get moments of creepiness and tension despite the intermix with scenes of complete ridiculousness.Child's Play is a strong introduction to the enduring horror icon Charles Lee Ray a.k.a. Chucky, with a brisk running time, strong supporting cast, a solid turn from child actor Alex Vincent, and an entertainingly evil turn by Brad Dourif as Chucky, Child's Play strikes that balance of frightening and fun.",Child's Play
89,hnt_dnl,Rough start to the franchise,6,4 November 2021,"CHILD'S PLAY (1988) is one of those 80s movies that never piqued my interest in the slightest. Even as I've become a huge fan of horror in the last decade, this type of horror, a killer doll, just didn't seem appealing. I randomly saw scenes from some of the earlier sequels a long time ago and also have watched both Curse and Cult of Chucky in their entirety. Personally, I think Curse of Chucky is the best movie of the franchise, which is probably not a popular take. Cult of Chucky wasn't that good to me and the 2019 Child's Play reboot was terrible. It's really recent Chucky TV series, which is exceptionally well done, that's made me take notice of this universe and go back and really WATCH the entire franchise. And the best place to start is the beginning.Frankly, the original '88 film is a rough start to the now popular franchise. Interestingly, I loved the opening chase scene and the way it set up the plot of the film. No wasting time with exposition. But after that, with the exception of the Chucky attack scenes, which were few and far between, the movie itself is a hard watch. Child's Play strangely feels like a TV movie more than a big screen film. Even some of the cheapest movies still feel like big screen endeavors, but Child's play has the cinematography and editing of a typical TV movie. But the worst offense is the acting! It is absolutely atrocious. Catherine Hicks was plain terrible in this movie, yelling all her dialogue in annoying monotone and always hyper and jumpy and telegraphing the plot. And I know he was just a kid, but Alex Vincent is atrocious as Andy. The worst child actors in the TV series run circles around this kid from the original film. Dinah Manoff was OK basically being Dinah Manoff. Chris Sarandon was actually decent as the cop, but even he was going in and out of some hybrid New York-Chicago accent.The best stuff was anything involving Chucky, with the iconic Brad Dourif doubling up as the criminal Charles Lee Ray in the opening scene and also voicing the Chucky doll whose body Ray transferred his soul into. The first Chucky kill scene (of the entire franchise), the scene of the Mom discovering the batteries, and the car scene with the cop with both being attacked by Chucky were all very suspenseful and iconic, thus why I give the movie slightly above 5 stars. But the movie overall is a at times a really hard watch with a lot of simple dialogue, poor acting, and clunky editing. The 6/10 is mostly due to the now iconic status and the fact that if it weren't for Child's Play, we wouldn't have such ACTUAL good output as Curse of Chucky and the Chucky TV series. But the original film is really nothing to write home about.",Child's Play

Director Tom Holland (who made the excellent ""Fright Night"") wisely puts the accent on atmosphere and suspense, saving the Chucky revelation until fairly late into the proceedings.The special effects are very good (considering this was 1988) and Chucky sporting a knife entered my dreams on more than one occasion back in the day.The performances are also way above average, with the terribly underused Chris Sarandon and Catherine Hicks solid as the adult leads.

Much killing goes on. I must admit I wasn't all that much of a fan when this came out, I remember people thinking it was scary and very suspenseful but I was laughing in the theater through out especially since the doll was just so unscary. However on re-watch I saw that in this modest horror movie is a sly notion about commercialism and the overall marketing kids go nuts for. I was too young to understand this edge because well you never pick up on these type of things when you are fifteen but living through not only the Cabbage Patch kids craze, the ninja turtle phase and Pokemon stage one assumes that this all amounts to black comedy. The whole boy cries wolf angle never works and it is partially due to Vincent's irritating whining through out but whenever Chucky attacks an adult or scampers across the room (Which is obviously a midget) Chucky's attacks amount to hilarious antics. The hysterical antics continue through out as doll keeps coming no matter how many bullets, how burned and how much harm is inflicted upon it.

However, when Chucky came to life almost 20 years ago, he was a real thrill that redefined the horror genre of the late 80s and spawned a series of imitators (some better than others).Director Tom Holland crafts this very original tale written by Don Mancini, where a dying sociopath (Brad Douriff) uses voodoo to transplant his soul to an inanimate toy. Catherine Hicks plays Karen Barclay, a single mother who gets the possessed toy for her little son Andy (Alex Vincent), not knowing what is hidden deep inside the doll.Despite its apparent cheesiness, Holland truly creates a haunting atmosphere filled with suspense by following the trick Steven Spielberg used in ""Jaws"". While we know from the very beginning that the toy is haunted, we never get a glimpse of what he can do and neither does the characters; only the young Andy knows the truth, but nobody believes him.Unlike its current MTV-inspired incarnations, ""Child's Play"" starts a bit slow, but suddenly it turns into a suspense-filled roller-coaster with enough thrills to keep you at the edge of the seat. Holland directions truly makes the difference between a cheap B-movie and the classy film this one has become.Brad Dourif makes a superb job and this movie started his now-legendary career in the genre. Catherine Hicks is a very good lead character, surprisingly realistic, thanks in part to the very well-written dialog. Chris Sarandon completes the cast as the detective investigating the mysterious murders surrounding Chucky and Andy.The movie moves at a very good pace, despite its slow start; it has that 80s feeling and it is surprisingly violent for its time (it was released when rules were turning a bit stricter). It has great special effects and a very creepy atmosphere inside it's urban landscape.While many reviewers consider a flaw the fact that Chucky's possession is not a mystery, I believe that a lot of the suspense is in the fact that we know that, but the characters don't. It is a very well constructed film in the end, and definitely better than its current sequels. 8/10",Child's Play
98,stamper,What an ugly doll!!!,7,25 July 2000,"What a good movie!!!! Far better than part 2 better than 3 and even with 4. This one however is not as funny as part 4, as this one focuses much more on the horror and less on the comic stuff Chucky says like in this one, when he is sitting in the elevator and gives quite a normal response to something that was said, but does it in such a way you have to laugh. The voice of Chucky and the whole character are great + the effects are pretty good. The cast is good too as is direction and script. A Famous horror movie, but not quite a classic. Go see it if you are a film freak and if you are a horror freak, well, I guess you've already seen this one.

99,ivo-cobra8,a classic horror film dark and scary the original the one that started all,8,18 August 2017,"This movie is a classic horror film directed and written by Tom Holland who also wrote and directed Fright Night my favorite vampire horror film. This is his without doubt alongside with Fright Night his best film. This is the original and the first Chucky film in the franchise that started all. This movie is a classic 80's movie and it is a favorite of mine. I am not a favorite fan of all Chucky films I haven't seen this movie in over 20 years since I was a kid so these days I re watched Child's Play trilogy and I loved it. The reason why I wasn't a fan of Chucky was because of the movie Bride of Chucky the fourth installment that really hurt the franchise and was a let down, I hated that film. After that I didn't want to see any other Chucky films anymore. I never saw before the last two films but I will soon I will re watch Bride of Chucky again and then I will watch the last two films I haven't seen them before. Since in September I am getting all Jason films Friday the 13th on Blu-ray discs all 11 films except Freddy Vs. Jason I have that film already in my collection and I will start reviewing them after I will watch all 11 films. So now I decide to give a chance horror franchise and I revisit The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Children of the Corn franchise and both of these two franchise suck a dick in my opinion and I don't like them! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre sequels are f***** horrible the only good one after the original is part III. Children of the Corn all sequels except 2 sucks a dick they are all horrible. That's why I gave this franchise a chance and those three films are great and I will purchase them on Blu-ray in October. ""No, Andy, NO! We're friends 'til the end! Remember? This is the end, friend!"" I love this film I am big fan of it, but my favorite is part 2 of Child's Play I will explain in the sequel why I love it more than the original. Catherine Hicks was absolutely fabulous in this movie a single mother who fights for her child you easily root for her. Alex Vincent is awesome as Andy the kid he steals the film. What the movie surprised me was actor Chris Sarandon I could not believe it guys it was the guy from Fright Night Jerry Dandrige he was in this film and he played the good guy this time, he surprised me. Chris Sarandon is Detective Mike Norris and he kicks ass he was fantastic. Brad Dourif acted in this film and he recorded the voice for the Chucky puppet. The designer and puppeteer was Kevin Yagher who made a perfect Chucky doll and scary.This movie is disturbed, dark and really scary and also unrealistic I was really afraid when a kid went alone on the train and when he was alone in the city and the house blow's up and I was really afraid for the kid Alex Vincent that's something terrible will happen to him I am glad the crew watch on him. I am glad this film is unrealistic but a good really good horror film everyone in this film did great job in my opinion. We have two explosions in this we have action good gun shootouts and a great killer doll on the lose I love it. The plot is about a single mother who gives her son a much sought after doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer. This film is about revenge from serial killer Charles Lee Ray who hides his soul in Chucky doll to get revenge on his partner who betrayed him and the cop who shot him. After his revenge isn't complete and he miss to kill the cop that killed him, he want's to get back in flesh and become a human again only he needs a human body the one he told a secret but he has to hurry before it is too late otherwise he will be a plastic doll forever. B+ 8/10 great horror film I would give it a 10 if the movie wouldn't be so disturbed and I wouldn't be so scared for this kid Andy alone in the city I was really scared for him. The rest of the films was fantastic the kill's were good in this film I loved it and the acting from everyone was brilliant.

100,natashabowiepinky,"""Wanna Play?""",7,31 January 2014,"Before sampling the delights of the latest Chucky The Possessed Doll extravaganza, which I've just bought on DVD, I decided to relive the original. Subsequent entries got jokier and gorier, but this one was crafted with a little more suspense, and saved all the REALLY nasty stuff for the final reel.Chucky is a truly malevolent creation, and it's easy to see the appeal of a homicidal midget running around killing people... just ask Donald Sutherland in Don't Look Now. Your initial scepticism over the premise will soon wear off once you witness the skilled puppetry and model work, while Brad Dourif's guttural voice-over is the epitome of evil.So, a bit of a classic then... Quickly followed by two undistinguished sequels... aside from the third one being implicated in the furore over the death of a certain little British boy. The next two follow ups that were released later on (Bride Of Chucky and Seed Of Chucky) took the series in a far more humorous direction, and it remains to be seen what course number 6 Curse Of Chucky will sail.There's only one way to find out... 7/10",Child's Play
101,cchase,"""Hi, I'm Chucky! WANNA PLAY?""",8,5 December 2008,"If you know anything about actors, you know that every single one of them worth his or her weight in 'iambic pentameter' wants to do good, meaningful work, usually meaning stage work with the classics. Ibsen, Mamet, Odets, Shepard, those kind of guys. But you also know that stage work usually pays bupkis, union or not, and doin' ""the Bard"" don't pay da billz! So when something comes along that offers guaranteed paychecks, and may not be ""classic"", but does give you something to sink your teeth into, then risk of typecasting be damned! It's like hitting the actor's version of Powerball. Robert Englund got his ticket when he met with a guy in a messed-up red-and-green sweater and a Ginsu manicure. Brad Dourif, famous for his role in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, hit the jackpot himself by landing a date with a crazed serial killer, who unfortunately, knows his way around some ""gris-gris"" spells.To true horror fans everywhere, that story is now legendary. Abandoned by the cronies who were supposed to be helping him escape, Charles Lee Ray, on the lam and being pursued by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), is mortally wounded in a shootout that takes place in - would you believe it? - a toy store. Having learned a thing or two about voodoo while in stir from his cellie, a shaman nicknamed ""Dr. Death"" (Raymond Oliver), the dying Ray uses a dark incantation to transport his soul into the body of a ""Good Guy"" doll, coincidentally named ""Chucky"". Norris, like everyone else, assumes that Ray died in the ""mysterious explosion"" that took place at the toy store. Meanwhile, the now-possessed doll finds its way into the hands of a homeless grifter who ""salvages"" it from the crime scene and sells it to hard-working mom Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks). Knowing that it's a Good Guy doll, 'THE hot toy' of the moment and all that her seven-year-old boy, Andy (Alex Vincent) has wanted, she can't turn down this steal of a deal to get it for him as a birthday surprise. Actually, though, the surprise is on...everybody. Suddenly, Andy finds himself racking up quite a record as a pre-teen juvenile delinquent, as Charles/""Chucky"" starts going after nosy babysitters, his voodoo teacher and all of his turncoat associates and pinning the blame on the kid. Only when Norris nearly becomes another notch on ""Chucky's"" overalls, does the cop begin to believe the story that Andy's been telling him, Karen and everyone else all along...the doll is alive and kicking and stabbing and strangling, and it has to be stopped! And the worst part? Not the murders, which are bad enough, but unless Charles Lee Ray can move his soul back into a human body, he will have to live as ""Chucky The Good Guy Doll"" forever. And the transfer has to be made into the body of the first human being he revealed himself to...ANDY.Up to this point, the only really scary 'doll' story that had been done was the Zuni fetish doll tale ""Prey"" in Dan Curtis's TV shocker TRILOGY OF TERROR. (Stuart Gordon's cult hit DOLLS, released a year earlier, didn't yet have the rep it does today.) Writer/Producer Don Mancini and director Tom (FRIGHT NIGHT) Holland knew they had a winner on their hands, but how could they have possibly imagined a franchise that has continued for at least SIX films? And Brad Dourif, though he only ever appeared in the very first movie, would continue to give Chucky the same kind of nasty, wise-ass attitude consistently through the entire series?It's hard to believe that there are still people who have never seen this, but if you haven't, be warned...you will want to drag your kids/siblings kicking and screaming past the ""Dolls"" aisle at Toys-'R'-Us, because after seeing CHILD'S PLAY, you won't want these little buggers within thirty MILES of your house ever again!!!",Child's Play
102,swilliky,Introducing an iconic character with some gore but not much scare,6,30 October 2017,"The classic horror film birthed the iconic character Chucky that haunted children and told a pretty decent spooky story. When the escaped convict Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is shot in a toy store, he performs a ritual that transfers his soul into the creepy looking Good Guy doll. Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is a young boy obsessed with the Good Guy show and he really wants a doll for his birthday. His mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) manages to buy one in the back alley and brings it home to her excited son. Karen's friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) notices strange noises that night when she watches Andy and is hit in the head with a hammer sending her flying out the window. Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), the same detective who shot Charles Lee Ray, treats Andy like a suspect and hits on Karen.Karen notices that her son is acting strange and talking to the doll. Listening to the odd instructions whispered by the doll, Andy takes Chucky to an abandoned house. Chucky turns the gas on and blows up his partner in crime in an explosion. The cops find Andy nearby the explosion and take him referring him to the psychiatrist Dr. Ardmore (Jack Colvin). Karen takes the doll home and is about to throw it out when she finds the batteries still in the box even though it has been talking all this time. Karen threatens to burn Chucky and it comes alive biting her on the arm and escaping. Karen tries to convince Detective Norris that the Chucky doll is alive but the cop does not believe her.

105,manitobaman81,Good,7,30 August 2014,"It's pretty damn creepy. The film builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off. Brad Dourif was the best choice for the voice of Chucky. Child's Play is done very well, all in all. Director Tom Holland does a good job scaring the audience. The atmosphere is definitely big on suspense. Without Dourif, I am terrified of contemplating what this film would look like. In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements. In other ways, this movie was a thrill ride. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. This might all sound corny, like a bad B-movie, but that is not the case!",Child's Play
106,DarthVoorhees,Forget the sequels because the first entry actually works,8,1 April 2006,"If a movie had to be selected for a specific decade based on cult following or continuing to grow,Child's Play would claim the 80's. Is it Chucky who scares us? No not in the least bit. What made Child's Play succeed was the idea that something as innocent as a doll could be evil. Character actor Brad Dourif stars as Charles Lee Ray a notorious serial killer who is chased down by Detective Mike Norris into a toy store and gunned down. Under his dying breaths he transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll.We are now introduced to Andy Barclay,a kid who loves the Good Guys.The only thing he wants for his birthday is a Good Guy doll.His mother Karen who is short on money buys the Chucky doll from a hobo on the street.Chucky murders Karen's friend Maggie. Norris is assigned to the case and discovers the footprints of a Good Guy doll at the crime scene.Norris suspects Andy. Andy tells his mother that Charles Lee Ray is Chucky's real name.Chucky forces Andy to bring him to the run down home of his partner in crime Eddie Caputo. Chucky murders him. Norris finds Andy and his doll at the crime. Andy now thought to be insane is brought to a mental house. Karen brings the doll home and discovers it has no batteries. Chucky attacks her and runs to murder Norris.Norris escapes the attempt and helps Karen track Chucky down. Chucky goes to his voodoo mentor who tells him he can only put his soul into the first person he told his true identity to. Chucky murders the old man goes to find Andy. Andy escapes his from the hospital and returns home. Karen comes and sets the possessed doll on fire,but he keeps coming back until Norris shoots his heart.This movie is unfairly not taken seriously. Tom Holland has directed a suspenseful horror film. The actors all excel in their roles,particularly Chris Sarandon as Norris. Unlike the other Child's Play films the cast and crew take the story seriously. The movie is dark and has an evil sense to it. The other Child's Play films are pathetic jokes,if you must see Chucky rent this one.By the way,I think this is one of the best portrayals of the city of Chicago on film.",Child's Play
107,acidburn-10,Good Guy Doll Serial Killer,8,30 May 2007,"Only the 1980's can dream up movies like this, pity they don't make them this fun anymore. Child's Play sets up the premise with an interesting opening and takes it's time setting up the tension and building up the characters and when it's finally revealed that the doll is actually the killer well it just goes on and on from there, very cool. The film itself is very strong with a mix of horror/action and comedy.Although the movies does have on or two flaws, well it's not perfect well what movie does, like some of the effects like in some parts it looks as if it's not a doll running round but a little midget in a mask, other than that the movie is a barrel of laughs and really fun and even spawned some great sequels like ""Bride Of Chucky"" and ""Seed Of Chucky"", ""Child's Play 2"" was OK but the third one wasn't very good.The acting was spot on Catherine Hicks (Karen) gave a great performance very believable despite the ridiculous goings on, Chris Sarandon (Mike) delivers here too. Alex Vincent (Andy) is the perfect child actor, and can really act, Brad Dourif (Charles/Chucky) was the star of the show with witty one liners and great voice acting really made this movie.All in all some people may think a film about a killer doll may be stupid but that's just small minded people, just give this movie a chance it's a movie that really stands the test of time and you won't forget in a hurry.",Child's Play
108,Darkside-Reviewer,"""He wants you for a best friend""",7,20 October 2019,Child's Play was the first horror movie I ever caught a glimpse of as a child and after seeing a crazed ginger doll come to life and try to steal a childs soul I made sure I tidied away all my toys after playing with them and locked them away in my closet with a key I was terrified of the idea that my army guys and Thundercats might try and take my soul at night and my parents still find it funny to this day.So many people have a phobia of dolls because of this movie series and it's not hard to see why the movie centres around a young child named Andy Barkley (Alex Vincent) who for his birthday gets the newest toy on the market from his favourite cartoon show (Which we can all relate to from when were children.) but after getting his new best friend Chucky a good guy doll strange things start happening and people start dieing Andy tells everyone who the culprit is his new best friend Chucky but of course no one believes him until Chucky attacks them and they find out Chucky isn't just a doll and inside this seemingly innocent toy is the soul of a recently deceased serial killer who now is looking for a human host for his soul and it has to be Andy the first person he shared his secret with that he's alive and he'll kill anyone who gets in his way.Alex Vincent who plays (Andy Barkley) in the movie was only about 5 years old when he stared in Child's Play in which he is chased by a killer doll so if you saw this movie growing up it was terrifying to watch a doll almost as big as you chase a child with knife to take your soul.If you haven't already seen this classic horror movie I highly recommend you watch it and see for yourself why so many people are scared of dolls and how the simple idea of a ginger haired doll wearing overalls running around can be terrifying.,Child's Play

110,movieguy1021,Child's Play: 7/10,7,22 April 2003,"Child's Play is usually categorized with other definitive horror films of the 70's and 80's, such as Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, while it's a lot different, in ways I'll get into later.Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is a serial killer who is finally killed by Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). However, he performs a chant right before he dies. Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is a single mother who works in a jewelry department in a department store. She lives in an apartment with her six-year-old son Andy (Alex Vincent), who is like any normal six-year-old. He loves the television show `Good Guys', and they have lots of toys and dolls that you can buy. When his birthday comes around, he doesn't get a $100 Good Guy, but Karen buys one from a peddler off the street for $30. However, that doll, whose name is Chucky, is actually filled with the spirit of Ray, who tries to kill everyone.At times this can be pretty effective, even scary, even when they add to it with predictable, cheap scares. When Maggie (Dinah Manoff, who overacts throughout the entire movie) is slowly walking through the kitchen with no music, with the phone in plain sight, do you think it's going to ring? Thankfully, there aren't too many of them. The entire plot is pretty clever, not just a `Craven' or `De Palma' theme. Also, the puppetry of Chucky was pretty good, for it being 15 years ago. The cinematography was good, with many first person shots, which were effective.Dourif, who played a gentle man in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was very good, especially in the beginning, when we actually saw him. Why he isn't a big name now is beyond me. Hicks was good for what she was required to be: panicky and caring to Andy. Sarandon didn't do anything for me, as the obligatory police officer. Vincent talked like stereotypical movie children did, enunciating every syllable.The music really helped, with it booming to prove its point of being a horror movie. It could have had some humor, like other horror movies do, to help it out some. Since it's less than 90 minutes and a horror films, they didn't worry about anything like plot holes or continuity errors. A few I noticed: how DID he go into Chucky, besides the chant, why would the Chucky doll be burned up, the dates continuously change. That scene with voodoo was very cool. That's about all I can say, so I won't say any more.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language and violent situations.",Child's Play

The doll, Chuckie, was very scary, but the standout performer in this movie was that adorable, little child called Andy. He was terrific in this movie, and almost carried the entire movie on his own. I don't think anyone else could've portrayed his role, and that too successfully, which is why this movie is a success. I don't know why, but this movie reflects more about him than that creepy doll. The other characters introduced in this film were good, especially the police detective and Andy's mother.

He was chased and gunned down by a cop named Detective Mike Norris (Chris Surandon), the next day a 6 year old boy named Andy Barclay (Alex Vincient) had a birthday and his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks) buys him a ""Good Guy"" doll named Chucky for it was a great gift that the boy has gotten. Andy has gotten more then he has received for horrific accidents and occurrences has happened, it turns out the doll is possessed by the spirit of Charles Lee Ray as it terrorizes the child's mother and other people for it wants to transfer his soul into the boy.Exciting and stylish supernatural horror thriller that gave birth to one of horror cinema's most infamous villains Chucky. The film started as an idea by Don Mancini and David Kerscheiner as a metaphor on the huge Cabbage Patch Kids craze of the 80's with voodoo themes to it, Tom Holland (Fresh off ""Fright Night"") agreed to direct the project. Manci and Kerschner were influenced by films like Richard Attenbourgh's ""Magic"" and ""Trilogy of Terror"" even a bit from the TV show ""The Twilight Zone"" on episodes like ""The Dummy"", ""Talking Tina"" and ""Caesar and Me"". The performances are surprisingly good even by Jack Colvin whom you all know as Mcgee on the classic ""Incredible Hulk"" TV show and Hicks is quite sexy as the MILF heroine, Kevin Yagher's special effects and animatronics are fantastic for they have hold up well in this age of CGI. The film has stood the test of time for 20 years and it's still popular as it still spooks kids, it became a solid hit in 1988 since then as it became a classic of jolting terror and originality for it spawned four sequels and a new generation in evil doll movies.Also recommended: The other ""Child's Play"" movies, ""Magic"", ""Puppet Master"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Series"", ""Halloween series including 2007 Rob Zombie version"", ""Silent Hill"", ""Devil Doll (1964)"", ""Trilogy of Terror"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

Ha Ha Ha.""I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this movie. I had just moved out on my own for the first time, had my own apartment, a hot girlfriend, and my whole life ahead of me. Life was good. When I saw the TV commerical for ""Child's Play"", I knew I had to see it - and see it, I did.It is Andy Barclay's sixth birthday and more than anything, he wants a Good Guy doll. When his mother is able to get him the doll he is longing for, his immediate happiness is soon turned into fear and horror. Because, unknown to Andy and his Mom, his doll, Chucky, has been possessed by the serial killer known as Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). As the bodies around Chucky start to pile up, Andy finds out the truth - but nobody will believe him. Charles Lee Ray wants to get out of the doll, but the only way to do that is to transfer his soul into Andy - leading to the film's memorable climactic conclusion.Okay, so if you are the type to be critical of a film's ability to portray realistic situations, then don't even bother with this one. You definitely have to suspend disbelief to fully immerse yourself into the movie and truly enjoy it. There is a lot of dark humor and plenty of tense moments to make this a very fun movie - a guilty pleasure for sure. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky was a stroke of genius here. The acting from Alex Vincent as Andy was weak in parts, but hey ... he's a kid. Overall, this is a solid horror project from director, Tom Holland.I highly recommend this one. It is twisted, funny, and even scary in parts. It is a perfect blend for the horror/comedy fan. And it is a sentimental favorite as it takes me back to a very good time in my life.

118,elicopperman,Cult Classic for All the Right & Wrong Reasons,6,30 September 2021,"Ever since this little horror flick came out in late 1988, Chucky the killer doll has remained a staple of modern franchises, with countless of sequels and spinoffs. Looking back on his debut though, perhaps his status isn't as fondly remembered for all the right reasons.I can see why people would be terrified of this film, and even I'll admit that there are plenty of freights to be found within the story of a murderer turning himself into a killer doll. However, this film comes off as more campy and silly than actually scary, mainly due to the over the top performance by Brad Dourif, the cheesy one liners, and the incomprehensible logic behind Chuckie's mortality.Seriously, running him over doesn't kill him? Burning him alive doesn't kill him? A shot to the heart kills him though?! Maybe it'd be better if they'd gone in the route of Toy Story where he's a toy from the start, because then the weird logic would work well enough on its own. I'm not saying voodoo doesn't make sense, but either kill the bastard in the furnace or don't kill him at all.Regardless, this film may still frighten some, mainly thosr who grew up with the psycho doll, so it clearly did its job well enough. May those who cherished this initial installment in the serial killer's life keep on.",Child's Play
119,departed07,A clever game of deception,7,25 February 2008,"""Child's Play"" is not only the name of the movie, but a term meaning when a child is kidding himself. But there's no way that the villain in this supernatural movie is kidding at all, nor does he stand tall at all, just about a foot.Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) gets wounded where there's no way in hell he wants to go back to jail just after his partner Eddie ditched him. He chants a spell where after his body lies still, he soul disappears and enters a Good Guy doll with red hair and a cute smile to make any kid want to buy the toy.Andy Barkely is just shy from his fifth birthday where his mother (Catherine Hicks of 7th Heaven) wants to buy him a good guy doll where after getting his son his present and naming it Chucky, things are getting weird where after a friend of Andy's mother is killed, the blame is on Andy though he didn't do anything.Charles' soul is on the rampage seeking vengeance on those who turned on him and wanted him dead from cops to criminals leaving poor Andy for people not to believe him.This 1988 film remains as one of the best thrillers where it's saddened that many sequels followed.",Child's Play
120,jhaggardjr,Scary little thriller,8,20 July 2001,"""Child's Play"" is a scary little horror movie that is very well made. Here for once is a slasher film that doesn't go over-the-top to be gross and disgusting (the sequels however took that route). That makes it all the more better. ""Child's Play"" relies on scares and shocks instead of gore galore and on that basis, it works. I remember jumping from out of my seat on a couple of occasions when I saw this in a movie theater when it first came out. Catherine Hicks stars as Karen Barclay, a divorced mother living in Chicago with her cute 6-year-old son Andy. The upside: on Andy's birthday she buys him a Good Guy doll (one of those talking dolls). The downside: this is no ordinary doll. This is a doll that's possessed with the mind of a madman who transferred his soul into the doll before dying from gunshot wounds. Before you know it, the doll (named Chucky) starts killing people off, and it's up to Karen and police detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) to stop the terror from continuing. ""Child's Play"" is a bit preposterous in some scenes, but it's so entertaining that I was involved with what was going on. It's scary, and thrilling. It has good special effects on when the doll comes to life. And it has terrific acting. Hicks and Sarandon are well cast, as is young Alex Vincent as Andy. This kid is not only cute, but is a pretty good actor. I would only see this youngster in one more movie (""Child's Play 2""), and that was it. I haven't seen him in another movie since. Brad Dourif (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") appears briefly as the killer who works up some voodoo magic to get the movie moving in motion, and Dinah Manoff (""Empty Nest"") provides a little comic relief as Hicks' best friend. Good directing job by Tom Holland (""Fright Night""), who keeps the movie moving at a fast pace. I was never bored while watching it. Plus, it has one of the eeriest music scores that I've ever heard for a horror movie. ""Child's Play"" is ridiculous to be sure, but so what. It's a well-acted, scary movie. *** (out of four)",Child's Play
121,baileycrawly,A Horror Classic,8,26 October 2019,"Sure, it's campy. Sure, it's dated. Sure, it's not as scary as it was when it was first released.
But that's part of what makes Chucky so appealing. No matter how much time has passed, children still buy and play with dolls and, as we have for many years, we often spare a thought or two to the possibility of those dolls one day coming to life.
Brad Dourif gives an absolutely stellar performance in this film, where he introduces us to the menacing little villain named Chucky. Alex Vincent blows the other actors off the screen as a scared, innocent, troubled young boy named Andy Barclay. The mother/son dynamic between Alex's Andy and Catherine Hicks' Karen is phenomenal.
This movie is an absolute classic slasher. No matter how old I get or how many horror movies I see, there's something special about coming back to this movie and seeing Chucky's reign of terror from the very beginning.",Child's Play
122,DavidSim240183,Here's Chucky!,8,23 September 2006,"For such a laughable premise, Child's Play emerges far better than one expects. Everyone knows the story. A serial killer, the Lake Shore Strangler (Brad Dourif) is mortally wounded by a Chicago cop Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). He manages to break into a toyshop, and with his dying breath, says a voodoo chant that transfers his soul into the body of a doll.I wouldn't be too surprised if after reading that paragraph, you might think Child's Play was an idiotic film. But thanks to Tom Holland's confident direction and the taut editing, what we have instead is a very effective horror film, not to mention satisfying because the sheer amount of enjoyment to be had is so unexpected.Chucky has become quite an infamous figure since his origin in 1988. As the sequels progressed, he has skirted the waters of controversy with the Jamie Bulger murder, and eventually evolved into black comedy when Bride of Chucky was created in 1998. But with the original film, no-one had ever heard of him, and didn't know what to expect.Child's Play is a horror film through and through. But it also has traces of light humour, elements that would be further expanded upon in the future. Holland shows a style of horror-film directing similar to Wes Craven. The scene where Maggie is babysitting Andy (Alex Vincent), the lad who ends up with Chucky, she is being stalked by Chucky. In the background, the TV is showing a horror film, almost acting as an internal commentary of the events.Holland's direction is truly excellent, allowing Child's Play to transcend it's admittedly slender plot, into a gripping, suspenseful horror show. This is a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of it's audience. It toys with our expectations, giving us enough subtle hints to tip us off of what's going on, but not too much that it doesn't give the game away.For the first forty minutes, we don't even see Chucky moving around. Except for the occasional blinking, head turning, and mumbling the dialogue the doll has been programmed with. These are all things the doll can do anyway, and they're incorporated into the plot whenever it demands it.But as Chucky plots revenge on those who betrayed him, we realise there will come a time when we will see him in all his glory. And that time comes when Karen Barclay (fiestily played by Catherine Hicks), Andy's mum, threatens to torch Chucky, and he comes to life right in her hands. This is when the puppetry comes into play. And for 1988, they're not half bad.Some of the facial expressions they get on Chucky are alarmingly sinister. And some of the movements Chucky makes took me by surprise. In one single continuous shot Chucky walks from one end of a room to another, and we actually see him climb up onto a bed. Or another one where he is in a fireplace, and kicks the grate away. This goes to show what puppetry can be capable of when given the chance.Brad Dourif lends his voice to the character, making Chucky into a frightening presence, complete with put-downs, puns and maniacal cackle. There are times when his voice isn't always synchronised with his mouth like it should be, but the effects are well above average for the time.Some of the plot elements concerning Chucky possessing Andy's body before he becomes trapped in the doll permanently are a bit hard to swallow, just because he was the first person he told his secret to. I don't see why that should be true, but the events are kept moving at a fast enough pace that you really won't care.Child's Play is a very entertaining horror film, with a bit more originality than you might expect. It all builds to a suspenseful climax with Chucky being slowly destroyed before he can possess Andy. It does occasionally lapse into unintentional amusement at the events, but I still believe this is a reasonably diverting motion picture.I love the ironic gag Holland adds at the end, with the final shot of an open door. Symbolising that the door has been left open for many sequels to follow.",Child's Play
123,nitzanhavoc,Not a film to watch for the first time when you're 30. I missed out.,4,25 March 2016,"I was 4 years old when Child's Play was released, and I remember seeing a trailer for the VHS release in a videotape we rented (which was obviously more children friendly). Since I became a Horror fan during my late teens, I simply missed out on the authentic experience of Chucky's mischief.Today, with terrifying puppets as seen in films like The Conjuring, Annabel and Dead Silence, the fear of puppets and dolls has been taken to extreme levels. However, one must consider the fact that in 1988 the entire concept had been fairly new, and people around the world had been terrified with the concept of a kids' doll possessed by psychopath serial killer and targeting their them or their children.Watching this in 2016 after a couple hundred other Horror features, I must say I felt like I was watching Comedy Horror (which is one of my least favorite genres). Chucky is not scary, he's ridiculous. The acting might have been considered superb during the late 80's, but is unauthentic and unconvincing in today's standards. Much respect to Alex Vincent (playing Andy) for starring in a film at the age of 7, but his performance makes suspension of disbelief impossible.All I can say is that Child's Play is an excellent film for children who are not young and timid enough to become paranoid and prevent the house from sleeping at night 2 months after watching. Anyone else would find it amusingly ridiculous at best.",Child's Play
124,Rautus,Classic killer doll movie,10,1 September 2007,"Child's Play is a great killer doll movie and is one of my favourite killer toy movies, my other favourite is Puppet Master movies. The music is creepy and the Chucky effects are great, Tom Holland did a good job with the suspense and they way it toys with you at first. The film sees psychopathic killer Charles Lee Ray being chased by Detective Mike who shoot him, his friend leaves him behind so he quickly goes into a closed toy store and finds one of the toys called a good guy doll so he transfers his soul into it. In a apartment young Andy wants one of the popular good guy dolls for his birthday but his mom hasn't got enough to pay for it but her friend tells her a man is selling on for cheep so she quickly buys it for her son, at first it seems like a normal doll but Andy starts to speak to him likes he's alive, her friend looks after Andy while she's at work and while Andy's in bed someone small creeps around and puts a chair in front of the door the picks up a hammer and hits her in the face causing her to fall out the window.They think it's an accident but Mike believes that someone killed her, possibly Andy since they're small footprints on the table. Andy tells his Mom that Chucky's alive but she doesn't believe him, when his Mom drops him off for school Andy doesn't go and instead goes to where Chuck's ex-friend Eddie lives and while Andy isn't looking Chucky sneaks in and turns on the gas, Eddie searches the house and hears a noise in the kitchen so he fires the gun casing the house to explode. In the police station Andy's mom arrives and meets with Andy, he tells them that Chucky's alive but they don't believe him so a psychologist wants him to stay at a mental hospital for a while, when he's mom returns home with Chucky she discovers that the battery's wasn't in him so she threatens to burn him so he attacks her and escapes. She tells Mike but he doesn't believe her, she goes to find the man who sold it to her but he tries to rape her but Mike stops him. He takes her home but she still trying to tell him about Chucky but he still doesn't believe her so after getting her out the car he looks at Charles Lee Ray's file and when in his car Chucky attacks him and after crashing his car Chucky runs around the car taunting him until he shoots him then escapes. Mike finds her in Chucky's apartment and tells her that she was right about him and that they to find a man named John who taught him who to transfer his soul. Chucky meets with John and asks him who to get of this body at first he doesn't want to tell him but after breaking his arms and legs with his doll he tells him he needs to transfer his soul into the first person he told that he was alive, Chucky then stabs the doll and leaves to find Andy, they then find him and he tells them they need to destroy his heart. They then need to find Andy and stop Chucky before he can transfer his soul into him.Child's Play is a classic movie that should be seen for some scares and laughs. 10/10",Child's Play
125,emperor_bender,"Original, scary",8,7 March 2008,"Child's Play is one of those movies where once you see it you will most likely never forget it. The movie is very well written. Usually in slashers, the killer is a psycho, or someone from the dead. In this case, its both and also something new. Here, we have a dead psycho possessing a doll from the toy store, using a little boy as his bait. Andy Barclay receives a new doll on Christmas and becomes best friends with it. His mother, Karen sees no foul play until one night when tragedy strikes (I won't say what to avoid putting spoilers). Soon its a race to save her son from this mysterious new threat. In the mean time, Detective Mike Norris is working to save Karen. Now to the different elements that make this movie great: we have a perfect storyline here, however unlikely it seems. We have great acting from Brad Dourif, who plays Chuckie perfectly. Even Andy was very well played for a 5 year old. The mood in this movie is very dark at times. A lot of scenes are poorly lit on purpose to add to the eeriness. Also, the music used makes the movie very tense and dark. This movie is truly a classic, and deserves much more respect than what it gets. 8/10 seems like a good rating for Child's Play. Horror fans should not miss this one.",Child's Play

Only in a couple of instances does it go beyond:The technical aspects of the doll are well executed. Animatronics and costumes blended well into an realistic doll that still holds up.The kid. While, like most child actors, the acting itself is nothing too much - the kid seemed to have had to work pretty hard. Many scenes with lots of action in them. I was actually the most afraid in the one scene where the kid is walking backwards and falling while holding a knife. Scary stuff! Other than that, the movie is a run of the mill 80s horror movie, but one that holds up enough that I think teens today will still enjoy it. I wish someone who have slipped a copy of this in my hands when I was technically not old enough to watch it. I would have loved it!",Child's Play
127,mwilson1976,A genuinely creepy little monster movie that stands out on the shelf thanks to some deft direction by Tom Holland,6,1 May 2020,"A single mom buys her son Andy a toy doll for his birthday unaware that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer, in this hit horror movie co-written and directed by Tom Holland. Brad Dourif provides the voice of Chucky, the malevolent Good Guy Doll, and appears as fugitive killer Charles Lee Ray in the opening sequence, performing a voodoo ritual in a toy store to transfer his soul into a doll to evade capture. The character of Chucky was inspired by The Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, the movie Trilogy of Terror, and The Twilight Zone episode 'Living Doll,' and was brought to life on film using a mixture of animatronics and child actors. Various directors including William Friedkin, Irvin Kershner, and Robert Wise were approached to direct before Holland was hired on Steven Spielberg's recommendation. Charles Band also expressed an interest in making the movie, and later went on to produce the Puppet Master franchise. Despite bombing during test screenings, Child's Play was massively popular when released theatrically, grossing over $44 million and spawning six sequels and a reboot.",Child's Play
128,bob_meg,And I call myself a horror fan? Finally saw this 23 yrs. after...,9,21 February 2011,"It is with great shame that I admit that 23 years after it's original release, I FINALLY see ""Child's Play."" The basic premise of the movie sounded so stupid and absurd I always automatically avoided it. Then, when the umpteenth sequels came pouring out, I thought that belief was confirmed. Boy, was I wrong.It takes a director with a very deft touch and steel-like confidence to pull something like this off, but Tom Holland does it, and he manages to make it creepy and scary and funny and wildly entertaining all at once. I now understand the large fan base, and my hat is off.See, Holland KNOWS how potentially ridiculous this story is, and he effectively puts you in the seat of the non-believer (personified by Catherine Hicks, who turns in an impressive rendition of slightly-befuddled, but earnest mom Karen Barclay). Holland plays it smart by keeping the Chucky-antics almost ""off camera"" for about 30-45 minutes of the film. It's kind of the same effect Spielberg got by hiding the shark in the first half of ""Jaws."" And when he DOES give you a glimpse, it's freakishly mind-blowing. The scene where you see Chucky dart from a hallway opening behind unsuspecting Dinah Manoff is jaw-dropping in both it's fright-factor and it's outlandishness. Because it DOES look REAL.The special effects, especially for this time period in horror films, are impressive to say the least. The acting is solid and well-done, with just a hint of irony by all involved.And as for Alex Vincent, who played little Andy, I'm sure hard-core fans know the answer to this, but how he got through this one without suffering severe trauma and permanent nightmares is beyond me. It's a little beyond the role of Danny in ""The Shining""!",Child's Play
129,Enrique-Sanchez-56,The Concept is not EVEN Original - but it is bad because....,1,28 December 2000,"It is bad because I found it so hard to believe this thing was coming to life.  Sorry, folks.  As a comedy it's wonderful...even though Scary Movie was better.  But call me jaded.  Nothing scares me anymore.  After a few films, the genre was done for me way back when.  The concept of having a doll come to life for evil purposes was used a few times by Rod Serling in the old Twilight Zone series.  What does this movie contribute to the genre of REALLY being afraid? Folks, have we run completely out of NEW ideas? (The only thing that would frighten me is if cheesy movies like this were the only kinds we could see.  Now THAT'S a horror). I wonder if one day they will ever get accomplished writers to contribute to horror flicks..that is, instead of nerdy, overgrown horror-fan wannabes. Maybe there is hope and a real plot will emerge from the hot air.  And maybe, just maybe, we can get these villians to have really interesting MOTIVES that are not hackneyed.

First, the movie wasn't nearly long enough to sustain an enjoyable horror flick. Second, Chris Sarandon, as a detective/reluctant believer, gives a worse performance than he did in the much more rinky-dink thriller ""Fright Night"" (which was still better).

131,DigitalRevenantX7,A parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids,5,2 May 2012,"Film Synopsis: Fatally wounded after a shootout with police, serial killer Charles Lee Ray breaks into a toy store & conducts a voodoo ceremony where he transfers his soul into a ""Good Guy"" children's doll. That particular doll winds up in the hands of a street pedlar who then sells it cheaply to Karen Barclay, a department store clerk who has been searching for a Good Guy doll as a birthday gift for her son Andy. Andy is excited to get the doll, calling it Chucky. But the doll comes alive & starts exacting his revenge on the people who got him killed. Chucky then attempts to transfer his soul again, this time to Andy. Can Karen & the detective on the case stop him?Film Review: Ever since the 1929 effort THE GREAT GABBO, the possessed doll has had a number of appearances in the horror genre. The idea had its best airing in the portmanteau film DEAD OF NIGHT back in 1945, which is still regarded as the final word on the subject. In the 1980s, director Tom Holland, who had made the vampire classic FRIGHT NIGHT, decided to contemporise the story using the visual effects technology of the day.With a story that hangs its plot on the concept of a serial killer transferring his soul into a child's doll & then using the doll's body to commit further crimes, I wasn't expecting Child's Play to be scientifically plausible – one of the things about the horror genre is the required suspension of disbelief – but this film really drags the idea through the intellectual gutter that most of the Friday THE 13TH films inhabit (what is quite ironic about Child's Play is that with its wisecracking killer doll, it is similar to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET which came out only four years earlier).That said, the film works better as a parody, mainly setting its sights on the late 1980s trend of Cabbage Patch Dolls that drove both children & their parents crazy – the dolls didn't do anything, only they looked quite cute & had their own birth certificates! What better way to scare the public at the time then to exploit their worst ideas about those ridiculous dolls. Quite cynical really.However, with the commentary & all, Child's Play is really quite stupid. Besides the whole soul-transferring-into-doll business, the film throws in some absurd plot devices where Chucky's body slowly turns more human the longer the killer's soul inhabits it, as well as the most obvious idea of forcing Chucky to transfer his soul into the body of the first person he revealed his secret to (in this case, young Andy Barclay). Let's not get into the whole business that is the scene where Chucky confronts his mentor, a voodoo priest, & kills him using a voodoo doll.The shocks are well-staged, particularly the scene where Catherine Hicks discovers Chucky's secret (he's been walking, talking & killing without any batteries!) & the first two kills are suspenseful. But the film loses momentum with its action set-pieces, most notably the part where Chucky tries to kill his police nemesis while he's in his car, which is one of the most unintentionally funny scenes in the whole film. The climax is an amusing scaled-down parody of THE TERMINATOR but ruins itself with the climax going into overtime with Chucky proving to be quite hard to kill – he's a doll, it shouldn't be that hard to kill him!On the acting front, Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon are quite competent, but the film really belongs to Brad Dourif, who makes the role of the killer doll his own, a role he would polish in the sequels.",Child's Play

I'd seen my share of killer toys in Goosebumps (Slappy), Batman (Scarface), to name a few. It wasn't until I was 25 I watched this movie on TV one Halloween. It came off as more ridiculous than scary. I didn't flinch or avert my eyes and it kind of made me laugh a little. I mean, I tell myself now that there is really nothing to be afraid of (like FDR told us in his inauguration). I'm not sure I'd rent the others but I'll see. Maybe I can watch the clips on YouTube.

At work, Andy's mom and her friend discover a shop selling one for a low price, and she buys it.

135,kylehaines96,"Hi I'm Chucky, Wanna Play? (**** Out Of ****).",10,10 December 2012,"I am deciding to rewrite my reviews on the Chucky movies because my opinion has changed of them but only a little bit, and since that it is the holiday season I could review something revolving around the Holiday. Yes this movie does count because of a couple of scenes featuring snow. Anyway this film remains to be one of my favorite films of all time and I know it sounds weird but I can explain.The films story follows little Andy Barclay played by Alex Vincent who is celebrating his 6th birthday with his mom Karen Barclay played by Catherine Hicks. However, Andy is disappointed because he did not get the gift he wanted; a Good Guy doll which is the new craze for Andy. Karen feels bad that she could not get the doll because it costs a whopping $100(which is the most expensive doll I have ever seen) and, during work, buys one off a bum in an alley for $35. Later that Night Andy is being babysat by his Aunt Maggie played by Dinah Mannoff who starts hearing strange noises after Andy goes to bed and soon enough Aunt Maggie is killed by falling out of a window. The police possibly target Andy but claims it his Chucky Doll. They think it mighty have something to do with serial killer Charles Lee Ray played by Brad Dourif who was killed by Detective Mike Norris played by Chris Sarandon. The mother realizes that the doll is alive and contains soul of Charles Lee Ray. Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif has to transfer his soul into the first person he revealed his secret to, or else he will be stuck in the doll body forever. The first person he revealed his secret to was Andy.The first thing that I want to praise the story which is original and is very reminiscent of The ""Talking Tina"" episode of The Twilight Zone. Also the film wants to make you think ""Is this all real or just inside little Andys head?"" Although sequels came along and demolished this thought. Introducing black magic in a horror film was something not done in horror films back then and not very much today so it is interesting to see it here.The next thing are the special effects which are some of the best, if not the best I have ever seen. The doll effects are creepy and when Charles Lee Ray gets transferred into the doll, as the film progresses the doll goes form a squeaky clean look to a dirty, gritty look and I thought that that was very clever. Also (Spoiler) but the effects at the end where Chucky Gets burned alive are great.The next are the performances which are fantastic. Alex Vincent is convincing as the plucky yet frightened Andy, Catherine Hicks is great as the disbelieving mom and of course Chucky would not be what he is today without the terrific voice work of Brad Dourif who takes the little boy cute and safe voice of the good guy doll and turns it into a menacing and dark beast.The final topic is the music and suspense factor. The theme that they use at the end of the film is a bunch of bells and angellic tones. This makes the music very spooky, but what is even creepier is the angellic choir. This makes it haunting and gives me chills every time I listen to it. They were going to use a Chucky theme song but cut it out due to it not being scary enough, and after listening to it I can see why. Thats like putting Eye Of The Tiger in the middle of Saving Private Ryan. The suspense of the film is phenomenal especially the fact that this movie is 87 minutes long and you don't see Chucky come alive until 45 minutes in to the movie. the sequels brought him n quicker but this one wants to toy (no pun intended) with its audience whether it is Chucky committimg these crimes or if it is all inside of little Andys head. The Final Verdict for the 1988 film Child's Play is a 4 Out Of 4 Stars and earns my Seal Of Approval meaning I say go out and not only see but buy this movie. This movie not only has a great and original story but also fantastic special effects, terrific acting and awesome voice work by Brad Dourif, this is a must see.I also like the suspense how you do not see the doll come alive until 45 minutes into the film.

139,zac-04879,"Memorable Killer, Cheap Execution",6,18 October 2021,"Although the filmmakers executed the carelessly average 'creepy-killer-doll' horror film, it's generally pretty fun for just a sloppy horror-viewing. If you're searching for something solid that'll truly grip your care towards the characters or the issues, there's plenty of classics and original masterpieces of the horror genre, but Child's Play is not one of them.Alike most seriously-themed horror movies, there's the creatively thought out killer whose out committing murders and beginning a mystery. However, the killer in this tale is the innocent-appearing doll named Chucky, who was possessed by a serial killer. Considering it's basically just the child-who-was-telling-the-truth-all-along sort of story with the rest of the adult characters slowly coming to realise he's right, this idea is very average, stereotypical and predictable.The film is also briefly lazy when it comes to being clever. For example, each of the characters sort of have to dumbly speak out loud to themselves to have the audience understanding what's exactly happening. And with all the silly components to the plan, the majority of this film is just very difficult to perceive seriously.Thankfully, it just slightly manages to pace well and appeal to horror audiences. It's more dumb than clever and more chucklesome than scary, but a fair amount of people will enjoy that. What's lest is the very satisfactory acting and the fact that it's mostly forgettable.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Child's Play
140,happyendingrocks,Every horror fan should play with Chucky at least once,9,29 October 2012,"If you can get past the charmingly silly proposition of a serial killer transferring his soul into a doll to perpetuate his murderous ways, Tom Holland's Child's Play offers up a tremendously entertaining mix of humor and horror and puts a novel twist on the relatively uncrowded ""toys gone bad"" sub-genre.The events in the film revolve around six year-old Andy Barclay, whose mom gives him a coveted animatronic Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unfortunately for him, his new prize is possessed by the spirit of infamous mass strangler Charles Lee Ray, and when the repackaged slayer gets up to his old tricks again, no one believes Andy's insistent claims that ""Chucky did it."" The most effective aspect of Holland's execution of the material is how he's able to wring some genuine scares out of a premise that automatically lends itself to unintentional comedy. Though the film wisely acknowledges its own goofiness by peppering the slasher elements with some keenly rendered zingers, the story itself is played fairly straight and the overtly sadistic nature of Chucky's homicidal rampage ensures that the tone remains as dark as the circumstances will allow. We pretty much know going in what this flick will have in store, but the excellently crafted pace generates an admirable amount of tension, and the way each propulsive layer of the plot unfolds makes for an engrossingly taut experience which belies the basic fact that our villain here is a four foot tall plastic plaything.Holland certainly deserves credit for much of the film's impact, but his accomplishments are handily eclipsed by FX whiz Kevin Yagher, who created the chillingly cherubic Chucky doll and brought him to life. Yagher's orchestration of the mechanical effects that allow Chucky to switch from beaming best friend to snarling psychopath remain captivating even in the modern CGI era, and the level of realism presented with this decidedly unreal character is startling and magical. Though later installments of the Child's Play franchise would replace Yagher's puppetry with whatever technological trickery was available at the time, the Chucky icon would never again be this frightening and primally savage, or look nearly as impressive.The limited capabilities of the the era actually augment the illusion rather than hindering it, and since the focus of the film is a plastic creation with limited jointing instead of a human being with full articulation, the doll's somewhat stiff and mechanical movements are more fitting than the sort of fluid animated motions you'll see in, say, Seed Of Chucky. The scenes of our blade-wielding antagonist methodically stalking down the hallway of the apartment where much of the action takes place are fearsome and indelible, and the sudden expletive-laden shift which occurs the first time Chucky reveals himself to the disbelieving mother of his ""friend till the end"" still packs a whopper of a jolt no matter how many times I've seen it. Despite Holland's sure-handed direction, this flick simply wouldn't work as well as it does without the efficiency of Chucky's menacing mien, and even if the notion of a killer doll strikes you as silly, there's no denying how powerfully that device is brought to fruition here.Our non-robotic cast does an excellent job as well, particularly the always welcome Chris Sarandon, who portrays skeptical homicide detective-turned-intervening hero Mike Norris. Young Alex Vincent is a bit over his head tackling the wide range of emotions his role as Andy requires, but he does a great job considering his age, and the final bitter punchline he delivers to Chucky is a true gem. Brad Dourif seems to relish the excesses he's allowed to indulge as the voice of Chucky, and his witty, mirthfully malicious banter adds as much nuance and actual character to the doll he inhabits as Kevin Yagher's machinery does.There isn't a ton of gore to be had here, but that dearth is actually pretty crucial to the plot since the initial killings are staged to look like accidents. Things get slightly more gruesome as the film proceeds, but the emphasis here is decidedly on suspense rather than splatter, so bloodthirsty viewers should probably be aware of that before they start imagining what nasty uses Chucky will concoct for the butcher knife he's grasping in most of Child's Play's promotional art.Some slippery mythology hampers the storyline a bit, and while the introduction of an inner city voodoo shaman responsible for teaching Chucky his Dambala trick is essential to our understanding of the film's rules, the wisdom he dispenses ends up being the lone befuddling portion of this caper. You see, the impetus for Chucky's climactic pursuit of Andy is the necessity of shifting his essence into the body of the first person he revealed himself to, otherwise he'll be trapped forever in the doll vessel he occupies throughout the film. I get that, and I suppose it makes some sort of sense in the realm of Child's Play, but the fact that Chucky's black magic mentor even knows this does not. I'm not intimately familiar with sorcery, but it strikes me as odd that the transference of human souls into talking toys apparently happens with enough frequency for there to be an established course of conduct when that occurs.This is ultimately a minor complaint, and taken as a whole Child's Play is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Though the rest of the extended franchise, with the lone exception of the surprisingly sharp Bride Of Chucky, is essentially useless, this inaugural outing has enough strong moments to make it readily apparent why subsequent film-makers were eager to get more mileage out of the concept (sadly, the foreboding finale suggested by the exit frame here was never explored). Even if the sequels have left a sour taste in your mouth, do the original the justice of giving it another look. Hi-de-ho, ha ha ha.",Child's Play

This movie was great, especially the great imagination of using a man trapped as doll killer. This movie was very funny, yet not scary. It was, nevertheless very interesting. I had no moments during the movie, where I felt like nodding off. This is a must see film for everyone. Goods: Introduction, General storyline, the acting, characters and also most of the special effects. Bads: Maybe a bit scarier, but nothing bad. Might have been better if it was a bit longer.

143,ryan-10075,"""Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?""",8,10 May 2020,"A great little horror flick from the underrated Tom Holland that spawned endless sequels and a remake. The Lakeshore Strangler better known as Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) may have met his match. Chicago cop Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) is chasing him down until they reach a toy store. Before he is killed the serial killer uses some crazy voodoo to transfer his soul into a Good Guy doll. We then see the Barclay's with mom Karen (Catherine Hicks) and son Andy (Alex Vincent). The little tyke's birthday is coming up and there is nothing more he would like than a Good Guy doll. His mother is able to get him his wish and gives him a nice new doll called Chucky.Written by Holland, John Lafia and Don Mancini we are shown a great horror flick with great pacing. Holland is able to keep this story grounded quite well when by most directors it wouldn't have been and most of the sequels were quite silly. There is also an underrated pretty good score by Joe Renzetti.Brad Dourif is just great voicing the smart-mouthed Chucky, who in later sequels tends to get even mouthier. Kind of like Freddy Krueger in a sense. Sarandon is very good as the no-nonsense cop and sadly he was not in any of the sequels. He had previously worked with Holland on the excellent FRIGHT NIGHT. Alex Vincent is okay as Andy, but one word of warning; his character does at times get annoying and kind of whiny.In the end though it is the effects that make this film work so well. Back in the late 80s they were quite something and ground-breaking. In the sequels the effects get even better. Some of the effects still hold up extremely well 30 years later. The Chucky doll was designed by Kevin Yagher.I end up watching this classic at least once a year. So, if you are in the mood for a horror flick with a strange little idea that really works and a nice funny bone give this puppy a shot.",Child's Play
144,Toronto85,Child's Play,8,23 February 2011,"Child's Play is a great horror/thriller made in 1986. It starts off with a serial killer (Brad Dourif) being hunted by a cop. After being fatally wounded, he becomes a ""good guy"" doll using a voodoo chant. As the doll, he goes on a killing spree seeking revenge against his enemies which include the officer who killed him and his crime partner that ditched him during a heist. The doll ends up being purchased by a woman played by Catherine Hicks, who gives it to her young son as a birthday present not knowing the doll is possessed by a murderer.Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon did a remarkable job in this, Alex Vincent who played young Andy Barclay was convincing and Brad Dourif originates the legendary ""Chucky"" voice. The movie didn't really scare me all that much, except for the first kill where the babysitter gets hit with the hammer and falls out the apartment window. Good creepy atmosphere in those scenes. It's a great roller coaster ride of a film as we learn about how Chucky must capture the boy and take over his body before he is trapped in the doll forever.Many sequels were made, but this was definitely the best one. I've read a remake is in the works. I hope that if/when it's remade, Catherine Hicks comes back to play the mom. She could still pull it off.8/10",Child's Play
145,Gresh854,An Essential Slasher Flick,6,27 January 2019,"Child's Play is a rambunctious horror flick that's saturated to the brim with bizzaro coatings of sadistical and dexterously flavorful gallows humor. Similar to how The Evil Dead nearly redefined the horror genre through its utilizations of subtle dark comedy, Child's Play annexes onto that train of sinisterness with its iconically blood-curdling yet, comical, plastic and porcelain antagonist, Chucky, voiced sensationally by the underrated Brad Dourif. Sure, a good loaf of the movie is outdated and the writing can be preposterous at times but, I don't know what more you could've hoped for in an 80s slasher semi-parody that's word for word about a killer, toy doll.Child's Play spotlights astonishingly stellar performances from both the child actor, Alex Vincent, and the mother, Catherine Hicks, each careening in on a scenario of blame and delusion when people begin suspecting the insanity of them when something questionably unimaginable begins to emerge.Quicknote but, the puppeteering and animatronics are suprememly impressive and for the most part, methodical. Also, the score-while elementary-dabbles with its duck-soup-like beats in a blisteringly fruitful manner, chiefly within the film's opening shootout.Child's Play is a horror genre freak-out that could've been a lot lamer than its story-lines may had inclined you to anticipate. You can genuinely tell here that the filmmakers sympathetically wanted to forge something unusually intoxicating. (Verdict: B)",Child's Play
146,Mr_Censored,"""Child's Play"" is Anything But.",9,25 January 2010,"All Andy wants for his birthday is a Good Guy doll. A doll that can interact with you, the Good Guy is all the rage but unfortunately Andy's working single mother can't afford one, that is, until a street peddler is willing to sell her one on the cheap. Quickly making friends with his doll, named Chucky, Andy gets more than he bargained for when heinous murders resembling that of the recently deceased Lakeshore Strangler start springing up and he gets the blame. Is Andy crazy? Has Chucky sprung back to life? And just what the heck is up with the street peddler's teeth? ""Child's Play,"" directed by Tom Holland (""Fright Night"") and written by Don Mancini (who has written every installment in the franchise to date) dances around these issues, brilliantly keeping you in suspense for the bulk of the film. While the popularity of the following sequels and its iconic killer spills the beans, the film still manages to retain a fair amount of creepiness. If you managed to catch this film as a child, it no doubt scared the bejesus out of you, and even as a grown up, it will hook you in with its sinister mood, chilling music and sympathetic performances by Alex Vicnent as Andy and Catherine Hicks as his mother. Key performances by genre hero Chris Sarandon as the skeptical cop on the trail of the murders and the great Brad Dourif as Chucky only further rope you in.Even though it is over 20 years old and some aspects of the film have become understandably dated, the film still retains the kind of magic that only the best horror films have. Its sequels may have made a joke out of the initial premise, but as a stand-alone film, ""Child's Play"" is as effective as they come. A remake is currently in the works (with Mancini and Dourif returning) that plans to return the franchise to its darker roots, but the sequels themselves were fun, just on a completely different level. Try to forget everything you know when viewing this movie, and it will reward you each and every time.",Child's Play
147,RockPortReview,"The Original, Chucky is still King!",10,27 January 2011,"Child's Play The Child's Play franchise with the lovably insane Chucky doll has become a pop culture icon. With five films and more to come, it hasn't quite reached the legendary status of Jason, Freddy, and Michael Myers, but Chucky continues to slash his way to the top.Tom Holland directed the original 1988 film as well as the Stephen King adaptations of ""The Langoliers"" and ""Thinner"". Set in Chicago this is the story of a widowed mother (Catherine Hicks) and her son Andy (Alex Vincent). Andy is having a birthday and wants a ""Good Guy"" doll. It's kind of like the boys version of a Cabbage Patch Kid. His mother buys one from a street peddler and Andy couldn't be happier. Little do they know that the doll is inhabited by the soul of a serial killer the lakeside strangler Charles Lee Ray. Chucky talks to Andy, but when things start to happen and he blames the doll. Obviously nobody believes him, even his mother.Chucky is pure satanic evil with a dirty mouth to match. Like Freddy Krueger he has a string funny one-liner that go to embarrassingly bad lengths in the later sequels. Chris Sarandon plays a detective investigating the mysterious murders and is finally convinced that Chucky is to blame. But who will believe him? This movie also has several of the now more familiar horror clichés. The fake scare followed by the real one, Chucky comes back to life about three times, nobody believes the little kid. The doll effects are pretty good, and Chucky seems to be acting circles around Sarandon's character. All in all the acting is quite good as well as the production values. This is another classic essential 80's horror movie. What a decade!",Child's Play
148,kingofdanerds,"Before he got married and had a kid, he was terrorizing a six year old boy",7,13 May 2021,"If you ask a random stranger on the street what their favorite horror icon is, chances are a vast majority will say Chucky. Chucky was one of the first horror icons that I ever watched (Bride of Chucky was the first horror film that I ever recall watching) and so I have a soft spot for Chucky despite him venturing into absolute silliness. But his first film was not silly whatsoever. Child's Play was created by Don Mancini who was heavily inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone that revolved around a doll. The film was released in 1988 and was a critical and financial success and would go on to spawn a whole franchise that is still going to this day. The film was directed by Tom Holland (The Langoliers) and stars Catherine Hicks (Star Trek IV), Chris Sarandon (The Princess Bride), and Alex Vincent (who would go on to play his character Andy Barclay in a total of three more Chucky films). Of course, I have to mention Brad Dourif as Charles ""Chucky"" Lee Ray.The Lakeshore Strangler, Charles Lee Ray is being chased by police and eventually is cornered by a cop in a toy store. He is shot and before he dies, he transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll by means of voodoo. The doll manages to get in the hands of a six year old boy named Andy Barclay who recieves it as a birthday present from his mom. Then people start dying around Andy and people start suspecting that it is Andy, but Andy knows exactly who it is.What really surprises me about this film is when it comes to looking it up online. When doing so, it gives you the movie and all of it's ratings and what not. Considerably good reviews for the most part until one looks at it's Google User rating. As of this review, the film sits at a 77 percent which is below the average if you know what I mean. Anyways.....just thought that I should mention that. Child's Play is just like all of the other major first outings of all the slasher films. Something that is not fully realized and in a sense, can be seen as tame when compared to the other films in a franchise. With that being said, I do think Child's Play is a good film just not a perfect one. The idea is fairly unique and has even inspired a bunch of other killer doll films. The acting is fairly good with a surprisingly effective performance from six year old Alex Vincent who does his role just fine. His character Andy, is a kid that one can easily to as we were all six years old at one point in our lives. Catherine Hicks does fine along with Chris Sarandon as well. Nothing too special. Obviously, the star of the show is Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky. There are some great one liners and Dourif adds the right amount of rage that should be in a role like this. The practical effects are fairly good when it comes to the doll. The animatronics really hold up and it all feels real. What doesn't is when there is obvious actors in costume which happens a few instances throughout the film. It is understandable why something like this would be needed but I figure it could look a little better. The kills are quite tame in comparison to the other films save one of the kills which is unique and has some problems surrounding it in terms of story and what not, but hey, a good kill is a good kill. The soundtrack is fairly solid but funny enough, I think the music is better in Child's Play 2 and 3. But still, a pretty good piece of music. Now a problem I have with this film is whether or not the identity of the doll should be revealed or not. Right off the bat, it is revealed that the Lakeshore Strangler transfered his soul into a Good Guy doll. But the film proceeds as if it is Andy who is behind everything. Until it does not that is. If I ever got a chance to change this film, it would be to make it more mysterious and not reveal that it is the doll. So the film is confused on what it wants to do. But this is were I start having a dilemma. Sure, once you watch this film once, it seems pointless to watch a film like this because it is so obvious. But then again, Child's Play does have suspense in it's scenes where needed and it is effective. It is all downright creepy which is something the sequels tend to lack is just outright creepiness. I guess a good point is that we know that the doll is possessed but the characters don't. Which suspense like that is fine in horror movies but I think the setup would have benefitted more from the complete mystery in my opinion. Throughout this film I find lots of nitpicks that mostly revolve around plot holes surrounding Chucky. Nothing too big thankfully.Child's Play is rather effective in being a creepy doll flick. It may not be the film that see's Chucky at his prime but is still a fun film to watch.",Child's Play

I had seen it many times before but it had been a good 5 or 6 years since the last time I saw it.  I laughed through the whole thing.  It was hilarious to me to watch this doll run around cursing and trying to kill people.  I kept thinking why they didn't just kill the thing with fire or rip it apart like any other doll.  Oh well it was a horror film and nothing simple makes since in horror films.  I do have to say that Chuckie has become an icon and is a very entertaining character to watch.  The big screen does make it much better.  I will have to go out and buy all four of these and make a collection now.,Child's Play

There are some places where you do jump out of your seat, but the premise is so silly that a serious horror it does not become. Alex Vincent is good as Andy, but the adult cast seem to be going through the motions- they were probably wondering what they were doing in a movie involving a killer doll. Still its pretty entertaining, goes fairly quickly and at least its not boring. Tom Holland has proven in the past that he is an effective director of horror and suspense, and he doesnt let the audience down in this film either.

The basic premise is that a con-man dabbling in devil magic ends up transferring his soul to that of a child's doll before he dies by chanting a magic spell. The doll gets into the hands of a little kid, and...well, it isn't pretty.I hadn't seen this thing in years, and as it turns out, I was right: this is some good stuff. Filled with kitschy cheese and some surprisingly well-done suspenseful moments, Child's Play is a thrill ride all the way through - just check out the kickass car scene toward the middle, or the part where she ""figures out the truth"" about Chucky for some of my favorite moments.It does raise the question, though: What would have happened if the killer would have stumbled into a kitchen-ware store instead of a toy store before he died?",Child's Play
152,mgruebel,Laughable 80s fare,5,21 December 2015,"The 80s produced some good horror flicks, like ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" but the epos of Chucky the doll possessed by a killer, is not one of them. The film suffers from the usual shortcomings of most horror fare, for example the fallacy of location: Why do they keep throwing the doll down and then get down on all fours so it can attack them easily? Why do they slouch around inside cars while the doll is after them with a knife? Really good horror films solve the fallacy of location: in ""Alien,"" they're stuck on a spaceship in a vacuum. In Elm Street, the ghoul comes into your dreams; in ""The Shining,"" a hotel is snowed in 20 feet deep in the winter; in ""The Thing,"" we are stuck on a desolate Antarctic base. In ""Final Destination,"" the horror is in everyday things that malfunction around you. It's not child's play to do it right, and Chucky fails miserably where all these horror movies succeed.As the killer in Chucky tries to kill the detective who nailed him, and then tries to transfer his spirit to the doll's child-owner so as not to become a doll forever, we move from one laughably inane situation to the next. What makes it even weirder is that the special effects are OK. The level of unintentional humor in this movie needed cheesier special effects to work!This movie might get a chuckle from those who saw it as pre-teens in the 80s and feel a bit nostalgic. It might also get a chuckle if you watch it in a ""Mystery Theater 3000"" mood with some friends and brewskis in hand. But I'm afraid it won't do much more. If you want to see some good 80s horror, see ""The Thing"" or ""Nightmare"" instead. Or ""Reanimator"" if you need some cheesy fun. Or ""The Shining."" Or Cronenberg's ""The Fly."" I could think of many more that would be a step up from ""Child's Play."" Only ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" comes to my mind immediately as definitely more mediocre.",Child's Play

Don't get me wrong I did enjoy Nightmare but I just felt it was a tad bit boring in places.The whole concept of a killer doll is genius, part of the fear comes from the fact that a seemingly innocent doll can be so evil.

156,tequila101,"Best Slasher, Great Atmosphere, Solid Acting & Excellent Effects",10,4 August 2010,"This is me re-writing a review for the film because I thought it was too rushed. It is edited by the way.Child's Play as well as being my favorite horror film is also my 2# favorite film of all time, along side with ""The Dark Crystal"". It has everything a film can possibly have. As my summary goes it tells the story of how great I find this film.The story is quite simple but also very different from other Horror films that have come before and after it.It is about a serial killer/lake shore strangler called Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) who is trying to escape a detective named Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) a long with a couple of cops who are also trying to get Ray's friend Eddie Caputo. The Serial Killer isn't ready to die and he breaks into a toy store, transferring his soul into an innocent good guy doll named Chucky. The next morning a hard working mother named Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) skips off of work and buys the doll from some peddler who grabbed the possed doll from the toy store. She gives it to her son Andy (Alex Vincent) for his 6th birthday and Andy is loving his new toy. When Karen is asked to do overtime, her friend Maggie baby sits Andy. She puts him to bed and is then killed by Chucky cause she turned off the news. After that Chucky goes on a killing spree to posses Andy's soul so he can live again. If he doesn't, he's stuck in the sinister doll forever.After summarizing such an amazing plot, I have really grown to love the characters, the locations, the effects, everything. I'm going to go through more of the film and make my pointers a little bit deeper for why it's my favorite Horror Film.Plot/Story, 10/10: The Story is planned well and the characters as well as the scenes keep the story alive throughout. The story is at a slow pace and if you hate slow paced stories, then this isn't for you. But like other slow paced horror stories such as Black Christmas, this one does it perfectly. I found nothing wrong with the story.Acting, 9/10: The actors acting out were all done well. Alex Vincet for being only 6 or 7 years old at the time just did so well, it's like he had to have the responsibility for keeping everything alive. Brad Dourif was a perfect voice for the serial killing Chucky. He did great as Charles Lee Ray as he had to be a mad man running all over the place. Catherine Hicks & Chris Sarandon also do well. These 4 actors keep the film stable and the other actors no doubt were excellent.Effects, 9/10: There isn't much to say about the excellent effects that haven't been said already. For the late 80's, they do a top notch job at the sinister Chucky. The way they made him move, walk, sprint, kill and even jump were all done well.Scenes, 10/10: A lot of people think that some of the scenes were silly, silly maybe but the silly scene with the voodoo joint was done well. Every scene that came around was always very memorable whether Chucky was on-screen, off-screen or his perspective, it didn't matter. The scenes were always pulled off well and some of them actually scared me the first time round.I also wanted to point my point out a little bit deeper for why this is the best Horror film. Besides it having many memorable moments, this Slasher as well as Horror had a whole new tone and level which made it much better for a change. Now don't get me wrong I love Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc but I think it's better when we see something else. i'm not talking about a Killer in a mask etc going after teens. I'm talking about a Doll stopping at nothing to get what he wants. And that why I found Child's Play a bit better then Halloween etc, because It was something different.I want to conclude that if you haven't seen this Slasher/Horror film yet, you must at once. It's also the first Horror film i own and I'm really glad that it's the first one cause it's just the best.One of the most memorable films. 10/10",Child's Play
157,shaun98,Good fun,7,7 October 2002,"*minor spoilers*""Child's Play"" sports an admittedly silly premise: a serial killer's soul takes control of a lovable doll, baffling the police with several mysterious deaths. Only the doll's young owner knows what's going on, but no one believes him. You have to give director Tom Holland credit for taking on such a wacky storyline; there are so many ways it could have failed. Has he succeeded, despite the odds? The answer is yes, for the most part ""Child's Play"" works. It's a slick, fast-paced horror/dark fantasy that builds up excitement until the relentless finale. It's a tour-de-force sequence that just doesn't let up. The horror convention of the killer who won't die has been used so often it's become a cliché, but it's effectively utilized here. I am remind of James Cameron's ""Terminator,"" which featured similar scenes, although that film did so in a much more serious manner.Note the extensive use of point-of-view shots in the early scenes. There is no doubt that part of their existence is due to the inherent technical challenges of creating a convincing ""killer doll"" effect in the pre-CGI era. However, they also serve to create a degree of ambiguity regarding the true identity of the killer. Is that little boy responsible, and making up stories about ""Chucky?"" At this point everyone knows the doll is solely to blame for any deaths that occur in this film, but it's still fun to watch everything unfold, to observe the little bits where characters slowly come to suspect the truth. When we finally do get to see the doll in action, the special effects work is nearly flawless, thanks to the tireless efforts of makeup guru Kevin Yagher. Sometimes his work in this film is so convincing it's downright eerie.Alex Vincent is one of the few child actors who is not whiny or overwrought; he takes on the role believably and helps to make everything more credible. Likewise, Catherine Hicks is effective as his frightened mother, and Chris Sarandon takes a no-nonsense approach to his role as a disbelieving cop. Of course, the real star is Brad Dourif, that reliable player of weird characters in genre films. His odd voice is perfectly suited for what must be his strangest role yet. In fact, this movie might not have worked without the benefit of the right performers to give the material some grounding in reality. In the end, the only element of the film that doesn't quite work is the subplot about Chucky's use of voodoo rituals. Granted, this aspect of ""Child's Play"" is not treated as stereotypically as many other films have done; there is a degree of ambiguity surrounding the nature of that particular religion. Nonetheless, whenever it's dealt with, it seems somewhat strained. However, it's not dwelled upon for too long. This is a much better film than you'd normally have the right to expect.*** (out of ****)Released by United Artists",Child's Play
158,boyinflares,A scary horror that seems to be more defined by it's sequels,8,22 April 2006,"The original Child's Play film, is a classic for the genre, however, while the film is excellent, it seems that the ""Chucky Franchise"" is more defined for the sequels, as they are more violent, gory, and Chucky's foul-mouth becomes a lot more present! That said, the original Child's Play is a terrific film from which the sequels take their basis - a doll possessed by the spirit of a serial killer trying to get back to life by transferring his soul into a new body, and in this case, the body of a young boy, Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent). The troubles begin after Andy has been given the doll, and his babysitter, Maggie seemingly falls to her doom from the high-level apartment window. Of course, no one believes Andy when he tells them that it was Chucky, and it is only when it is mentioned Chucky is really Charles Lee Ray, that Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) begins to believe what is going on. Of course Andy's mother, Karen Barclay (played by the fabulous Catherine Hicks) doesn't believe her son at first, until she discovers that Chucky is moving without batteries.However, while the film is very fun, it is also lacking. While the interaction between Sarandon and Hicks is terrific, it would have been nice to see more of a romantic twist to their relationship. There is also a serious lack of supporting characters - the only one of real note is Maggie, but she is killed off in the first half hour, which is a shame, because she is played by Dinah Manoff - a.k.a. Marty from ""Grease"". Dinah was spectacular, it is a shame her film career never really went anywhere. Of course, Brad Douriff appears as Charles Lee Ray, and then does the voice of Chucky.While a great film overall, it is easy to see why the franchise has gained so much popularity from the sequels.",Child's Play

Not in THAT way). Now this is SCAAARY!  If you didn't see any of the Child's Play movies start with this one and go up the series to the forth movie: Bride of Chucky.

160,piratecannon,A Doll's House,7,26 December 2012,"In 1985, Hasbro introduced the world to the ""My Buddy"" doll. It had reddish-brown hair, blue overalls, and a cheery, striped shirt. It also looked exactly like Chucky, the serial killer plaything featured in Tom Holland's 1988 film Child's Play.As one of the little tykes who was ever-so-proud of his ""My Buddy,"" the release of this movie was devastating. I didn't watch it until I was much older, but simply seeing the trailer on TV was enough to make me petrified of the notion that an otherwise innocent amalgam of plastic and synthetic fiber lurked on the other side of my bedroom closet door while I slept.Fast forward to 2010. I'm nearing age 30 (yikes), and I've just given the tale about a murdering psychopath who transfers his soul into the body of a toy via some sort of intangible voodoo another chance. Even though the exposition for this one is amazingly idiotic, it's clear that screenwriter Don Mancini was onto something. In the most superficial sense, there is something eerie about dolls. Their fixed expressions, when viewed in the right context, can make our blood run cold. As irrational as this notion is, it nevertheless has some merit, and this is what makes Child's Play the unlikely success that it is.What's even more disturbing about the movie is that it has our six year- old protagonist—Andy—exploring the seedy underbelly of Chicago in an effort to aid his newly acquired companion. Despite his initial naivety, the kid eventually wises up and realizes the danger he's in. What follows is a comically grotesque battle that sees Chucky take on a police officer, a psychiatrist, a witchdoctor, and a babysitter (among others).What's especially great about Child's Play is the final act, where our indestructible villain is shot, torched, and dismembered. He's basically the ""terminator"" of dolls; as soon as he seems to be vanquished, he reappears, oozing pus and stuffing, ready to slice and dice anyone who interrupts his perpetual mission of spiritual transferal.As one would hope, no one involved with Child's Play takes things too seriously (it would have been an utter disaster had this not been the case). Because of the lighthearted nature of the movie and how downright silly it is, there's no reason not to call it a box-full of harebrained fun.It's also the quintessential killer doll movie. That's got to be worth something.",Child's Play

However, what sets it apart from other films of this nature is that the killer is a talking doll.SPOILERS: The story is simple. Little Andy wants a ""Good Guy"" doll. The latest fad for kids. The doll is expensive, so his mother gets a deal on a ""Good Guy"" doll at about half price from a street vendor. Unknown to her, this doll has inherited the soul of a killer who gets fatally shot by a cop on his trail at a toy store in a poor neighborhood. In a bizarre twist, the killer falls next to a box of ""Good Guy"" dolls and is struck by lightning. Each ""Good Guy"" doll has a distinct name and personality all his own.""Chucky"" the bad doll, has now ""inherited"" the soul of a killer! When Andy's mother buys him the doll, strange accidents begin to happen, with no material witnesses except Andy around when they occur. Naturally, the authorities are slow to believe that ""Chucky"" is alive and evil. After ""Chucky"" attacks ""Mom,"" she realizes that she must not only convince the authorities of who ""Chucky"" really is, but try to protect her son before ""Chucky"" kills him.The pacing of Child's Play for the most part is suspenseful and direct. Running at just under 90 minutes. sustains interest throughout most of the movie. There are some scenes that are overdone, such as taking forever for ""Chucky"" to die by having his body break off individually into small pieces after being shot multiple times. This seemed to be a time killer. A lot of these types of movies have the almost invincible killer element to them, which can make them look stupid in these types of scenes.

Some of the seems still look cool, especially Chucky's death in the end. Of course being an adult now, Chucky does not seem as scary as he used to be when I was a child but considering the glut of gory movies, and torture porn out there nowadays, Child's Play still holds up well. Of course, movies in the 80s are more slow paced than movies nowadays, but there are many recently made movies that are terrible compared to Child's Play. This movie features the things that make 80s horror great: explosions, reciting spells under lightning, scary images, and clean language. Brad Dourif is perfect as Chucky. I can't imagine anyone else playing Chucky. He is good behind the mask, almost like Andy Serkis.",Child's Play

Doesn't really work as a horror, but appears interesting mainly due to its fame. The convenience, continuity errors and teleporting characters are not really that annoying once you get over the lack of mystery - and view the movie as a linearly told story. After this, the biggest problem lies in the acting. I understand our main actor was only 6-7 years old when filming this, but he doesn't deliver anything but dullness. Or maybe the problem is -in fact- Chucky, who just isn't even a bit scary. Just maybe our actor shares the same shock factor with the viewer, myself. ""To kill him, you must pierce its heart."" So of course we first burn it, shoot it in the head. And hand. And leg. And then finally we kill it, but only 15 minutes later to add to running time and make it dragging. Weirdly, the last 15 minutes and the part that dragged, was the memorable bit of this movie. It was the essence of 'Child's Play' and made it worth the while.

The two main adult characters are played quite badly in a very b-movie way and are never convincing.Chucky does have a feel of being a child size Terminator and that gives a little humour as well as the creepiness, I was expecting more humour given the subject matter, think Gremlins, and was disappointed not to find it.The lack of humour and poor acting stop this from being anything more than a watchable b-movie.",Child's Play

171,Snake-666,"Fun, but often dull, horror movie.",5,20 July 2003,"A mother (Catherine Hicks) gives her young son Andy (Alex Vincent) a Good Guy' doll that he desperately wanted for his birthday. Unknown to, this doll contains the spirit of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), the notorious Lakeshore strangler, who after being mortally wounded in a shoot out with police office Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) passed his soul into the doll so that he could continue living. However Charles (nicknamed Chucky) does not want to be a doll forever which is very bad news for Andy.The movie is a little slow but, considering the rather daft subject and plotline, manages to be rather tense in places and delivers a couple of shocks. Created by Tom Holland, who previously brought us Fright Night' and wrote Psycho II', Child's Play' is the film that started the rather brief influx of killer toy movies (Puppet Master' being the only other that was really any good) and through it's rather poor sequels helped to end the same fad. This original isn't all bad but becomes rather tedious after numerous watches. There are only so many times you can watch the same movie about the same killer doll without the absurdity of the situation beginning to bother you. However, for horror fans that have not already seen this movie, it is worth checking out. The acting is quite accomplished for an Eighties horror movie, and the story itself is not actually that bad. Questions are left, but the idea is simple though tries to be too complex in parts and that subtracts from the enjoyment of the movie. It's astonishing that Chucky has become such a cult icon since the making of this film and it is worth watching this movie just to see if you can guess why? The foul-mouthed little murderer is in some ways kind of loveable and his occasional one-line jokes in this film do offer an enjoyable source of comic relief. Unlike it's sequels, especially Bride of Chucky' (1998), Child's Play' is generally a more `serious' horror film, lacking much gore despite a few grisly scenes, the movie tries to rely more on suspense and tension but it's attempts often lead to rather dull and uneventful moments. Tom Holland did direct this movie well, a number of scenes stay in the mind after viewing including the final moments which are some of the more exciting scenes in horror for films of the late Eighties, but occasionally Holland's judgement seemed to slip and the viewer is left with overly repetitive and eventually dull moments.Not to everyone's liking but probably for fans of 1980's horror cheese, even if the movie does try to be too serious in places, I enjoy this movie though it does not stand up to repeated viewing. If not for the dull moments I probably would hold the movie in higher regard. My rating for Child's Play'  6.5/10",Child's Play

Its all entertaining stuff though, Andy is back with a good performance and the foster home theme works well even if the Chucky reconstruction is another stupid and rushed idea.

She winds up buying one that is possessed by an evil guy name Charles Ray as we can see in the very beginning of the movie. You don't really see the doll kill much in the beginning but it's still good since you can tell that people are being murdered and it's the doll that is doing it by the footprints in the flour.

The latest craze, they even have spin-off cartoons and cereal commercials. But lo and behold, Toys R Us charges a bl**dy fortune, so his mum (Catherine Hicks) gets a deal from a homeless guy who has one in his cart. Unbeknowst to mum, this doll has inherited the soul of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), a psycho who was shot by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. Charles Lee Ray landed next to a stand of ""Good Guy"" dolls, and thru voodoo magic, he impregnated Chucky with his SOUL!!!! Needless to say, Andy and his mum are pretty pleased. But no sooner has Chucky been welcomed into the family, the babysitter turns up dead! And what's more...Det Norris thinks little Andy is to blame! Soon enough though, the mayhem breaks loose (heck, it's only 87 minutes long) and we are treated to a ""slasher"" movie with a difference. No more plot spoilers...the rest of the story is pretty easy to figure out.Catherine Hicks plays the stressin' mum really well here, we can tell she's very fond of her kid and doesn't want ol Chucky to make mincemeat of him (even though he is darn good at it), so she begins the ""track down the origin of the evil so we can destroy it"" part of the plot. Meanwhile little Andy begins to realise Chucky is Bad with a capital B, and in his attempt to escape Chucky we find some of the great little moments of tension this movie flicks at you from time to time. The scalpel scene made my hair stand on end...mostly coz Alex Vincent looked so damn clumsy and I was afraid he'd fall on the damn thing...but director Tom Holland got some really fine moments out of this little actor, like the ""Chucky's coming and he's going to kill me!"" bit. I was on the edge of my seat when Andy's lookin out the barred window to see Chucky methodically making his way towards the cell...eerie stuff!

180,jason_13,Chucky is another slasher icon,7,15 January 2007,"Child's Play is one of those horror movies where you expect a hilarious villain and bad actors dealing with him. It's a comedy-horror, but it cannot be defined as B-Horror since you could smell the movie's ambitions from a hundred miles. It could hardly be considered typical 80s horror movie. The whole atmosphere is some kind of a experimental transfer into the early 90s.The story centers on a child called Andy who wants a doll that is pretty popular in the society, the character live in. The only problem is that Andy is not familiar with the fact that the doll is alive and something much worse - it's evil.Before viewing Child's Play, I had seen bits of pieces from Bride of Chucky. That was my only connection with the series. As for my expectations - I wouldn't call them high. After all, this is a movie about a little doll that stalks and kills naive, badly developed characters incapable of dealing with any kind of danger. Child's Play turned out to be a positive surprise and the weirdest thing is that all characters are indeed brainless and uninteresting. The acting is average at best and the dialog is more than ridiculous. But who cares about dialog when a funny, small toy curses and uses knives with the mission of killing an annoying child. The movie's best plus is its simplicity. The only thing you are supposed to enjoy is Chucky and his ability to kill. You don't see a living doll every day. Since the movie is full of clichés, average horror fan should be prepared for usual stuff like bad ending or as I mentioned above - characters with low I.Q.Child's Play doesn't include gore. Something that is out of big importance since those who have not seen it, might suggest the movie follows the typical formula. Not at all. Really disappointing, but it makes sense. After all, the main character is a kid and I can't imagine tones of blood covering up the screen. I've noticed one thing about comedy-horror movies. They are either funnier or gorier. Child's Play deducts to the first group. Analyzing the quality of humor is a very stupid thing to do. Chucky's franchise has been famous for 20 years, mainly because of Chucky's humorous lines rather than impressive storytelling. Other than that, nothing about Child's Play could be considered hilarious. If you read a description like the following: ""Child's Play is a hilarious horror movie"", stay away from the person who has written it.Tom Holland's directing is beyond average, but it can't be compared to his achievement in Fright Night.Overall - memorable flick that started a successful series. Every self-respecting horror fan should watch it and appreciate it for what it has brought to the genre. Of course it's not perfect, but very few horror movies date as good as Child's Play does.",Child's Play

Chucky was straight brutal in this movie without all the comedy, this was a who did it type of movie because you dont really know if the boy is doing the killing or the doll but it starts to be obvious the boy isn't doing it.

I'd have loved to be in the room when the producers/director pitched this film!!The story? A serial killer is on the loose, and the cops are very close to catching him. Charles Lee Ray is badly injured, and performs a voodoo ritual on a 'good guy doll' so that he may 'live' inside it! All this transpires just before he gets struck by a bolt of lightning. The cops think him dead, but Charles Lee Ray will still exact his murdering potential on anyone he feels gets in his way.The story then deals with a young boy's birthday present - which just happens to be - OH NO!!! - Charles' Good Guy doll!!! His name for the doll is 'Chucky'. Watch the Rugrats cartoon series, and there's a FRIGHTENING similarity between the two!!!The film rolls along at a good pace, building up the suspense well. People are murdered and the one connection to all the murders? Little Andy. Surely he isn't the killer? But as an audience we know who it is!Chucky is both cute/funny and terrifying. I hate dolls and in this film I never ever wanted to see a large toy. They have this kind of 'weirdness' about them.This was the first in a (so far!) series of 4! And you can see why. We as adults, or early teenagers - I was 9 when I first saw this! - like to be scared by kids' toys. The films 'Dolls'. 'Dolly Dearest'. also tried to recreate this, but none of these come close to what Child's Play does.Good plot, some dated 80's acting, and some damn fine SFX/puppetry make this an enjoyable horror film.

Before he dies however he mutters a magical chant with his final breaths of life and transfers his soul into a 'good guys' doll so he can come back and seek his revenge.There are some moments of violence on how Chucky kills some on his victims but it's pretty placid by todays modern standards. The filmography of low slick camera movements is very similar to the latter Puppet Master franchise.The good thing about watching older horror films such as Child's play is you get to see the unique time in which they are set. The streets, style and clothing that people wear and also the minimal amount of CGI that is used.And watching films from back then makes them feel more real because you sometimes question how the filmmakers could possibly manage to capture certain graphic moments. And while some scenes are quite comical others are very raw and certainly stay with you long after the film ends.Andy Barclay who plays the young son Alex Vincent is such a great child actor and in this movie was absolutely brilliant. I thought he played an innocent victim so well that it was hard not to truly rally behind him right to the end. Both Cathrine Hicks as his Mother Karen Vincent and Brad Dourif as the killer doll Chucky play equally impressive roles.Child's Play achieves it's purpose of being a terrifying horror/thriller/slasher with some comedic elements depending how old you are. The film has a classic horror appeal to it like many films done in the 1980s. It is filmed both gritty and realistic and has some creepy jolter moments.

It gives us a nice little story and ties it up well, even though you know there's plenty of sequels.The acting feels hammy, and almost every character was kind of annoying, but a big part of that is just from age and it still maintained the fun.

They just made the criminal a uneducated street thug that somehow knows advanced voodoo/magic techniques so he turned himself into a doll. There is no depth to this movie and considering movies like Hellraiser, The Ring, Saw, Donnie Darko or even some of the American Horror Story plot lines it's not truly dark by any means. Child's Play seems more of an apt description than title, considering the slight tweak to an overused plot line and 2 dimensional characters.",Child's Play
186,xiaoli7377,"Surprisingly Well Made and Suspenseful, Given the Subject Matter",6,30 August 2020,"Deceased serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) performs a voodoo ritual in his dying moments that transmits his soul onto a child's doll. The very next day, Karen (Catherine Hicks), a single mother hard-strapped for cash, purchases the doll from a shady street vendor as a last-minute birthday gift for her six-year-old son, Andy (Alex Vincent). The doll springs to life and starts going on a killing spree throughout the streets of Chicago, leaving the police to determine that this is all the imagination of a small child. They take Andy away from his mother and place him in a children's home. But Chucky is still out there, and he's eager to meet with Andy once again...You might think from the premise of this movie and contemporary films of the era that this will just be a really stupid and gimmicky slasher flick. And in a lot of respects, you would be right to think that way. Some of the actors really ham it up, and there's the expectedly awful dialogue. But when you peel away that layer (and look past the dated animatronic special effects), this movie is really atmospheric at times. Never to a point where genre clichés and other issues distracted me from being truly anxious, but you can tell that this movie knows what it's trying to accomplish in the way that it presents itself, and that deserves to be commended.The whole doll thing isn't actually revealed fully to us until about thirty minutes into the movie, and even then it's very subtle. They don't overuse the doll in order to mask the limited effects of the time, and that honestly adds to the movie in a lot of ways. We are rarely given a full shot of Chucky by himself, and the movie uses a nice blend of puppetry, animatronics, and stop motion to bring him to life.It's not as good as ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or some other fantasy horror films from the era. It's good to watch for curiosity's sake and if you want to understand some of the cultural impact surrounding this film. If you want to see something that will genuinely frighten, interest, or entertain you, look elsewhere.",Child's Play

If you thought Curse of Chucky was good wait until you see the first film(just so you know Curse of Chucky streams on Netflix so it's more likely people have seen that film more than the first film). To be honest this movie was slow like the Candyman but grew faster starting on the first death. I believe this movie can be a 14+ movie with some just some offensive language used like W###e, B###h, and F##k throughout the film. The film isn't actually as gory as I thought it would be and the deaths were fairly spread apart throughout the film. Probably about a handful of people die and the film had a happy ending, somewhat.",Child's Play

This doll gets stolen by a homeless man and sold to a woman who gives it to her son who was wanting that kind of doll. Chucky, while inside the doll, tries to kill the cop who mortally shot his human form and is shot by him causing pain and bleeding. After that, he goes to the man who taught him how to move his soul into other things and tells him he was shot and it hurt and bled to his surprise and asked him why. He tells him it's because he's turning human and the more time he spends in the doll the more human he will become which Chucky interprets as meaning after long enough he'll be trapped in the doll for the rest of his life. So he asks him how to get out of the doll. The man tells him he won't tell him because he is evil, so Chucky forces him to by torture of a voodoo doll of him and a threat to kill him. The man tells him he can only leave the doll by getting into the first person he tells that he's alive and that is the boy so he tries to get into him. He's stopped by the boy's mom, the cop who shot his human form, and the boy. He's burned, shot to pieces, and shot through the heart which kills him for good. Or does it? This is a very scary and good movie. Chucky is an icon of horror. Child's Play 2, Child's Play 3, and Bride of Chucky are all great too. Seed of Chucky is so so. It has one great scene.

After serial killer Charles Lee Ray(Brad Dourif)is shot down by police officer Mick Norris(Chris Sarandon),before he dies he transfered his soul into a famous Good Guy Doll using his knowledge of the occult.

This is a great horror flick and as I said before it had an effect on me.Now I don't even look at my little sister's doll's funny anymore.

190,Hellrazr360,"Serial Killer Turns Into Mad-Doll. Silly Idea, Mediocre Horror Fashion",5,4 March 2006,"Child's Play is one of those horror movies that has an original idea, but that same idea is silly and results in, you guessed it, a mediocre movie overall. When serial-killer Charles Lee Ray is turned into a Good Guy doll (by some ritual that's hinted at but not thoroughly explained later) he begins to put a young boy and his mother through their paces. Young Andy gets what he's been begging to get for his B-day with Chucky, only he gets a little more than what he and his mother bargained for.This idea does help give Child's Play credit for at least trying to be original, I'll give it that, but the movie itself is lackluster. The movie doesn't bore you to death, it almost bores you to the point of snoring within the first scenes. But what really kills the movie is that it's completely devoid of anything scary and lacks virtually any thrills. With that, the movie seems to lack what would make a horror movie in any way good. At least you're not given the usual drunk teen at parties atmosphere that almost every horror movie has. Yet, the acting in the movie isn't anything great, Andy surprisingly being the most fake character in the movie. The only real acting talent in Child's Play is the ever-lovable personality that Chucky has, which I love to quote from this and the other Child's Play movies.However, despite a doll with a nasty personality and being original, Child's Play doesn't do anything that is in any shape or form worthy of being ""thrilling"" or ""scary"". You just get a serving of cheap horror deaths and swearing. If you really need to see this movie, don't bother renting, wait for it to come on TV until you decide if you truly think it's worth watching again for entertainment.",Child's Play

There were parts of the movie where I was frightened and other parts where I couldn't stop laughing!This film is about a murderer, Charles Lee Ray, who is dying after being chased and shot by a cop and possesses a ""Good Guy"" doll. Andy really wants a ""Good Guy"" doll for his birthday so his mom buys him one. What she doesn't know is that she bought the one that was possessed by Charles Lee Ray. The possessed doll, Chucky, starts killing numerous people including a friend of Andy's mom who was babysitting him. Andy knows that it was Chucky but know one else believes him. And to make it worse, Chucky is trying to get out of the doll and into Andy's body! I've seen Child's Play, Child's Play 2 and Child's Play 3 and they are all great but the original Child's Play is certainly the best. I recommend anyone who, like me, loves a great horror film to watch this. This is a well made, scary and surprisingly funny movie. 10/10!",Child's Play

194,Chris-332,"Good the first time, boring the second.",7,24 August 1999,"When I watched Child's Play for the first time on Easter night, I expected it to be a laughable and cheesy movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It was not as cheesy as I thought it would be, although the first action scene in the movie, involving Charles Lee Ray being chased into a toy store and then creating a storm as he transferred his dying body into a Good Guys doll, was terrible. It was more suspenseful than I thought. There were some scenes which were very pleasantly surprising. The boy did a very decent job as an actor, and the three leads, Catharine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, and Brad Douriff were good. The story and dialogue was good, and the animatronics for Chucky were very, very impressive. The first time you see the movie it's great. But after you see it once, it gets VERY boring. The second time you see it, all you want is Chucky, yet he is not in the movie until a full hour, and the movie is only 88 minutes long. Chucky's absence from the screen is for such a long time that the movie really drags. The first time you see it, the fact that you don't see him walk and talk 'till the final reel is very sophisticated, but a movie like this one, a HORROR movie, can't really do that because people want to watch that kind of movie because of the excitement and the chills and thrills. The three sequels I thought were much less sophisticated and much more silly, but at least they are fun to watch more than once. As for the first one, rent it at Blockbuster and see a good movie, but don't buy it.",Child's Play

In this first Child's Play film which later spawned 6 sequels and an upcoming remake, a single mother, Karen Barclay, buys her six year old son, Andy, a good guy doll from a homeless pedlar for his birthday. Andy who at first is very pleased and excited with his new good guy doll ""Chucky"", Andy soon realizes that the doll is actually inhabited by the soul of vicious serial killer, Charles Lee Ray. Trying to convince his disbelieving mom and detective Mike Norris that the doll really is alive and trying to kill him , Andy tries saving his own ass and the ones he loves from the demented doll. This scenario alone is terrifying, it's so typical for adults to not believe their kids when it comes to the boogeyman or ghosts or demons or even killer dolls! And this tactic for horror movies works everytime for me! It's so thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Only in this first Child's Play movie you dont see Chucky actually move and talk and kill people until around 30 minutes into the movie. That's what made this particular film of the franchise the scariest is because the makers of the film take their time working the audience up to Chucky coming to life. A great horror slasher film with a lot of mystery, horror, and suspense and even comedic moments. If you're a horror fan and STILL haven't seen Childs Play because you've been living under a rock your whole life, do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie! And if you dont like it...I dont know what's wrong with you. 10 out of 10 for me.",Child's Play
197,dragonslayer-87950,From A Fan Of The I.P..........,6,10 October 2021,"First off Yes I am a Fan of the I. P. I even enjoyed the Remake to a Certain Extent I think I might have even made a Review for it on IMDB? And it might even be the Reason why I'm giving it a 6/10? Anyways as for original film. I kind of like the Opening it has that right Vibe. And I even find the Introduction of Andy the kid was kind of Cute, and kind of Typical. And there are a few scenes I enjoy that where scattered through out the film. The Last Ten or so Minutes where the mother along with the detective go and Confront Chucky for the Final Time in the film where Chucky Pretty much turns in to the Terminator was awesome.And now for the Negatives. First I just found that one friend of the mothers just comes off as unlikable to me. Then there is the not only the conveniency of finding a hobo who happens to have a Doll that her son wanted earlier that day for 'Sale' but also later on in the film when the mother went to that bad part of town in search of him and she happens to stay safe up until she conveniently find him, and that is when things started going sour for her, with her being almost Sexually Assaulted only to have her be saved the deactivate who by the way was pretty much useless up until he himself was attack, some time after the said scene take place and he forcing the mother out all because of his Dark Past with Chucky and didn't want to reveal at all. And what made Andy go skip school and go to the dangerous place where Chucky's Friend is staying with out being harassed by the way, unless I'm missing something that just lazy writing to me. And Speaking of I feel it's kind of Excessive putting a kid his age in a Mental Hospital, and not only that that Mental Hospital also feels empty. I know I get the reason why Andy is in the Mental Hospital, but still excessive. The amount of Horror was lacking for me. And unless I'm missing anything else that should be it.Final Thoughts, wow this feels so Deferent watching it now verses watching it when I was just a kid, not necessarily in a Bad Way and necessary in a Good Way either just Deferent.

201,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,We Can't All Look Like Brad,7,31 January 2021,"Many think the name Brad first became associated with rugged good looks after a famous scene in Thelma & Louise (1991), but the origin actually goes back decades earlier to the handsomest West Virginian the world has ever known.Child's Play begins with a shootout on a Chicago street, but not a dangerous street because it features a well-stocked toy store with no bars on the windows and secured by a lock so weak that the door flies open when you shoot in its direction. The target of most of the shots is Charles Lee Ray, an ancient wizard who has the power to transfer his soul and voice to any body or object he wants. Of course once he discovered the body and face of Brad Dourif there was really no other choice.The fireworks start when jealous cop Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) can no longer stand the fact that he himself does not look like Brad Dourif, and apparently if Norris can't then no one can. Ray is forced to transfer to a blue-eyed ginger Good Guy doll, Chucky, in order to survive the brutal detective's excessive force (cut to a messy kitchen).Andy Barclay is the worst kid anyone has ever met. After rousing his sleepy mother in order to give her a sloppy breakfast in bed featuring enough Country Crock spread to kill 17 lumberjacks, Andy whines about not getting the right birthday toy when he is lucky not to be crying from getting a right hook (disclaimer: child abuse is wrong even if the little Damien spills a trail of milk all over the rug). Later that night whether Andy celebrates his birthday by killing his babysitter or whether it is Chucky, who can say. The next day whether Andy ditches school to ride the El train to kill Ray's partner who left Ray to die, or whether it is Chucky's idea, again hard to tell.Charles Lee Ray really has one main score to settle though, with Mike Norris, the man who ruined the perfect vessel that was Brad Dourif. In the end both Ray and Norris learn that no matter what either of them does, neither will ever look that damn good again. The VHS copy of this joint wasn't on Jerry Seinfeld's apartment movie shelf for nothing, folks.7/10",Child's Play

I have seen all of these films and I am a major fan of this evil doll, he thinks of just about every impossible thing to get to Andy in the first few films. But always in the end he dies just like we do each day but to him, he can always come back someday. If something like this did happen it would be a miracle in horror history. Like you wouldn't suspect a doll you have sitting in a room with your child to come alive and start acting like a real person trying to get attention by police or news media. But to him, it was only the beginning of a scary feeling that was surrounding you and your family.I had a nightmare about this movie once that haunted me until the point that I had a seizure and my mother had to get rid of all the big dolls in my house(seriously, it is true, when I was a child!)and then my nightmare had come to a reality motion picture that wasn't as scary as my nightmare when I was a child, now I am 18 and I am not afraid of any dolls anymore but this film does bring back some scary memories from my past.

The ""shock therapy"" scene is pretty painful to watch. But all in all, i found it better when i first saw it, then do now.

205,Horror_Metal,An original and scary horror classic!,10,6 October 2013,"The notorious serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is fatally shot by a cop named Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. Ray uses his last dying words to recite a voodoo chant that supposedly grants life after death. Using this chant, the sadistic murderer transfers his soul into a nearby ""Good Guys"" doll before all life ebbs from his body. A few days later, six year old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is given the same doll as a birthday present from his mother Karen (Catherine Hicks). Andy loves his new Good Guy doll, which is able to talk and move its head around. Calling itself Chucky, the doll begins to tell Andy strange things and takes him to odd places where murders are committed. It seems that Chucky, animated by the soul of Charles Lee Ray, seeks revenge against Mike Norris for killing him. The evil living doll also finds out that in order to become human again, he must transfer his soul into Andy's body. When Karen Barclay finally realizes that Chucky is alive, she enlists Mike's help to stop the murderous doll and save Andy's soul.This fantastic modern day horror classic has one of the greatest premises ever conceived. Kudos go to director Tom Holland and writer Don Mancini for giving us this highly original and timeless film. Chucky is one of the greatest horror villains ever and in this movie, he is actually very scary. Brad Dourif was the perfect actor to give Chucky his voice, as well as playing the human Charles Lee Ray before he becomes a living doll. I'm so glad he returned for every installment in the series that followed this movie. Brad IS Chucky, and always will be. All the other actors here are very convincing and believable in their parts, Chris Sarandon from Fright Night being a favorite of mine. It's a shame he hasn't done more films in recent times. Catherine Hicks does very well as the concerned and protective mother, I genuinely felt bad for her in certain scenes. Usually I can't stand kids in horror movies, but Alex Vincent didn't annoy me at all and actually did very well here. Great job Alex! I also love the Chicago setting, which made for some beautiful big city scenery. The fact that it's also wintertime with snow on the ground enhanced that. The best thing about this movie, besides its great villain, is the suspense. Chucky is kept in the shadows for the first half of the movie and most of the kills are suggested. This was a great way to build scares and toy with the audience at the same time!

207,ShadySovereign,"Nice try, Chucky",5,4 February 2006,"""Child's Play"" is the kind of horror movie that would scare people whom are afraid of dolls. I have to say that the idea of a doll being scary is pathetic, especially since dolls can be easily ripped apart and thrown away. My point is: Chucky is not scary at all.The movie starts out as some kind of action movie. We see this criminal named Charles Lee Ray running away from a police officer. He gets shot a few times, and then hides out in a toy store. When he's about to die, he says some kind of voo-doo chant, and then his soul gets transported into the body of a doll. Later on, when a mother of a child buys the doll for her son, Charles (nicknamed Chucky) starts terrorizing the son and the mother and others that are in the way.The movie has some good thriller elements in it, but they only last for a short while. The movie is more of a thriller than a horror film. There are just not enough scares.The acting in the movie is very goofy and annoying at times. The kid was extremely over-acting in his role, and the mother seemed like a clichéd character. The hero cop in the film didn't seem tough enough to be a cop! Finally, the character of Chucky seemed more like a criminal than a horror villain. Well, he was actually BOTH criminal & horror villain. But he's one of the weakest horror villains ever, along with Jigsaw from the ""Saw"" movies. If you were to put Chucky against horror villains such as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, or the Candyman, Chucky would get ripped to shreds. Chucky isn't a true horror villain; he's just a typical criminal that doesn't do enough to scare others.To sum up, this is a very weak horror movie. It has a few good scenes, but the horror element is missing. The film is more of a kind of crime/thriller than a horror, which at least makes the movie watchable. Watch it if you haven't seen it before, or if you are afraid of dolls.I give this movie a 5/10",Child's Play
208,Mileskolehmainen,A great horror classic.,8,11 October 2014,"Though it may sound sorta goofy, Child's Play is a very good film. It's smart, creepy, and plays the killer doll strait enough to be taken seriously as a smart slasher film. There are some goofy moments, but just try to get over these, you'll be surprised by how subtlety creepy this movie is. The characters are decent, and more sympathetic than in most slasher flicks, especially Andy and his mother. On the FX, Chucky's face movements look great, but some of his larger movements (Arm movements, mostly) look wooden. His design is very creepy. The plot of the film moves very well, with new twists and new locations at every turn, doing a great job of hooking you in. I also thought the cinematography was very effective, with long, panning, cuts from a lower to the ground than usual. These camera angles provide a very creepy feel to the film.

214,crukeg,A terrible premise is turned into a really good movie,8,16 October 2007,"The set up to this flick is pretty stupid. A criminal who's dying happens to know voodoo. He uses it to transfer his soul into the body of the doll. A boy wants the type of doll, and his mother buys it for him. Oh what do you know? the same doll. You know the rest people.This film is very predictable, and the ideas sound laughable. But, a big but. This film is brilliantly crafted. Child's play is tense (the creature comes alive later on in the picture), frightening (the doll is one mean S.o.b) and very well acted (Sarandon, hicks and Vincent are on top form). The picture also uses some of the stupid stuff for some dark humour (and it didn't fail to make me laugh) e.g A man talks to the doll (chucky is his name, but you knew that anyway) like a normal human being. Priceless.In summary, this is a violent and frightening film which is effective, funny and well made. Bravo.",Child's Play

216,ajohns1,3rd best of the chucky series....,9,24 October 2002,I've never been one too like this movie and i'm a big fan of chucky. This movie is considered a classic to most people because of it's originality and stylish chucky performance by Brad dourif. Although there's alot of junk in this movie that I dont like probably all that stuff that brings you too the death someone particularly of Aunt Maggie It takes like 10 mins for her too finally die I know most people liked it but those parts are just so boring The best one of those is when the mom brings chucky home and chucky comes too life then he insults and bites her that part is freaky and funny. I still recommend the movie maybe it's just me who's bothered by that. 6/10,Child's Play
217,Crazyfarts,The best damn movie ever!,10,30 April 2002,If you haven't seen this movie there must be something seriously wrong with you.  Child's Play is a breakthrough in the horror genre.  Brad Dourif puts in an excellent performance as Chucky and just makes his character so much more interesting than any other to date.,Child's Play
218,TransAtlantyk,The Child's Play series is terrible. Not even genre fans will find much to like here.,5,13 January 2012,"I'm a hardened horror film fan. I've been watching all kinds of genre films since I was a child and would like to think that I could stand my own in a conversation with most any horror film fan. That said, the Child's Play movies are absolutely awful and I really don't see what even a genre fan has to enjoy from these films. I suppose the character of Chucky has become very recognizable but he is anything but interesting. Quite annoying actually.The premise is ridiculous even for a horror film. The ending of the movie makes absolutely no sense and I have yet to find out why a group of adults can't figure out a way to stop a tiny doll from slaughtering them. It's not exactly intimidating. The one-liners are not funny and the movie is not entertaining. Watch if you must but it is perfectly acceptable to pass by this and all of its sequels.",Child's Play
219,KillerRomance,"LOVE my Supernatural Serial Killers. This ""Good Guy"" is my Favourite",10,13 May 2017,"I submitted a review on this movie over a decade ago under the username Cadillac_ghost titled ""Chucky is made of extra cool nightmares on wax"" A lot has happened since then and here is a fresh one. I wrote many reviews on this movie because it never fails to be the ultimate classic that will go down in history as the clever unforgettable supernatural suspense chiller. It is ideal if you are not into gore but more into the creepiness. The parents at the time secretly love this flick so their child would calm their greed for toys.I saw the commercials of the very first Child's play Movie and I remember them completely - the stunning special effects of the doll creeping with the mechanical head turning right around and the isolated kid, was later called Andy hollering for his Mother. I was nine years old at that time. I saw that movie on tape at 13 many years ago (under aged- naughty me!!) but could not wait to see it. Chucky was now the first Boogyman I ever watched. Brad Dourif whom I known from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, Blue Velvet, Fatal Beauty, Dune and many countless films as I got older- he is one of the most finest performers I have ever seen, with his magnetic charisma and those huge wildly intense blue eyes to match, he is crazy handsome in this movie, and his outburst rage that even real life Serial Murderers exhibit is brilliant. Dourif hits the big time as Charles 'chucky' Lee Ray, the Voodoo practising Serial killer of Chicago who was gunned down in a toy store by bewildered Detective Norris (Sarandon)and betrayed by his partner-in-crime Eddie Caputo. Charles made a promise that he will get revenge on the ones that 'done him in' and found a Good Guy doll to exchange his soul whispered a Voodoo incantation in the name of 'Damballah Wedo' (a west African, and Haitian Snake God), lighting struck the toy shop and the police found Ray dead - bet they thought it was over and celebrated by munching on Bear claws and donuts collections- RIGHT? Nope Wrong. In comes along little Andy Barclay - sweet Darling' angel, but he whines about wanting the latest craze - em yes! you guessed it - and you know that he is gonna get what he wants alright! unfortunately Karen Barclay (Hicks) buys the 'special' doll at cheapo bargain from a Homeless Guy. At least she does not have to worry about batteries because the doll is 'more alive' than expected, with a diminutive height and Brad Dourif's inimitable Booming voice. And ratty Auntie Maggie (Peterson) gets it, and takes a dive from the forty storey building. and then it is Eddie's turn to be shish kabab in a exploding House! The body counts are rising, and the truth about Charles Lee Ray is mounting but more unbelievers are added to the equation. Until they see Chucky 'is alive' and eat their words (or die so to speak). It is a Scary movie, with great scenes of Chicago, and Chucky has a vehement vengeance and will not stop at nothing with its perished body ashed from flames and blue eyes peering out creeping towards Andy makes you feel like a kid wanting to cry out to your Ma. what a Nightmarish Film - unmissable, this cool movie deserves praise. I don't care what people say. Kids are still talking about Chucky even until this day and are thrilled with enthusiasm about this movie. I gave the movie 8/10 because I wanted to see 7 minutes more of Brad Dourif and voodooism but all this came in curse of Chucky and I am satisfied.I love Chucky and I can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming sequel Cult of Chucky",Child's Play
220,DaBears54,A definite Cult classic,10,30 June 2003,"Child's play was one of my favorite horror movies. It seemed a little unrealistic. As the band member of Twisted sister said on the VH1 special I love the 80s 1988 ""Its a doll step on it"".  Thats what made this movie very unique and different from the other horror monsters like Freddy, Jason, or Michael Myers. This was a toy that had an evil spirit in it. I think they should of stopped making Chucky movies after the 2nd one. The 3rd and the Bride of Chucky were a disgrace. It will be interesting to see if they do come out with a new movie because they didn't kill him as bad as in his other movies, you know being burnt, being shot apart and his heart shot. Or like in the 2nd one where he had his head explode and in the 3rd one being chopped up in a fan. The bride of chucky he got shot multiple times which is nowhere near as bad as the other movies. Alex Vincent played the perfect role as Andy Barcley. I'm surprised they didn't use someone like Maculey Culkin or Elijah Wood but Alex worked out very well. It would be cool to bring Alex back in the new movie if they make it.",Child's Play
221,NightOfTheLivingDon,I'm with Dee Snider on this one...,4,19 September 2007,"...when he said, ""It's a doll. Just friggin' step on it!"" Being a horror movie maven, I am often criticized by my dislike of this particular film and the sequels it generated (all of them laughably bad). Chucky is often regarded as one of the big slashers, though hits the proverbial glass ceiling while trying to obtain the status of Freddy, Jason, and Michael. Yeah, there is a reason for that. Albeit the story is quite original, and the concept itself pretty scary, the payoff would have been a whole lot more effective had he transported himself into something a bit more fierce. Yes yes, that is part of the whole duality of the situation. That doesn't stop it from not being good. The direction was good, the acting was par (Chris Saradon is always great), but it just wasn't tense or scary past the age of 12 max.He'll have his fans, but I'm just going to leave Chucky in the box.",Child's Play

223,wewatchedamovie1,Fun and creepy when it works....corny when it doesn't,7,22 April 2012,"A classic cult horror film that is as well known as the heavyweights of horror like the Michael Myers films or the Freddy films. But is it as revered or loved as the other horror classics? Well, no. It is, however the quintessential toys coming to life to kill people movie. Also, For what it's worth it's a pretty good horror movie considering the subject matter. If any story about a doll killing people is going to have a chance to be believable or scary, it's the story of Child's Play, the first installment in the Chucky series. The reason for this is the surprisingly well written back story and origin of Chucky. I won't give spoilers but I was actually interested in how Chucky came to be an evil doll that murdered people. I mean, they at-least attempted to give a valid reason of how this could possibly exist which was fun. Chucky does a decent job being menacing and almost believable until he begins to really speak. There are some freaky scenes of short dialog that really get you going, but when he speaks too much, it becomes kind of hokey and laughable (as you would imagine, it's a doll). I enjoyed Brad Dourif in the beginning of the film but as Chucky's voice, I would rather have everything said in that creepy doll voice than the voice that actually comes from the doll. The less human the doll was the creepier it was. I felt they kind of lost that as the film moved along. Also, there are a few ""death"" scenes that were shot poorly and completely un-believable. That being said, to pull of ANY believable and creepy scenes at all using a doll as the murdering villain, is impressive, and they made a handful of scenes really well. Ultimately, it's a pretty creepy and fun movie when it works.Mike Holtz, We Watched a Movie Check out some funny video reviews and movie news at our youtube channel here: http://www.youtube.com/wewatchedamovie",Child's Play

I really didn't know what this Chucky was all about. When I finally watched it,it really was enjoying to watch, I was surprised on the special effects, and knowing this movie was out in 1988. The reason I rated this (7/10) was because when Chucky was attacking Mike Norris, and Norris was in the car(Upside Down), it seemed to me that, Mike wasn't really scared of the Doll (Chucky). He to me seems to be the kind of person, that isn't really into the role of the character. Yes he did good job in other parts, but he needs to do more. I know this was a Horror movie, and that everything isn't like reality.

227,colebt33-780-179547,"A goofy, but well made horror",6,21 August 2010,"At first I found the movie to be a bit weird for my liking. Some serial killer is being chased into a toy store, get's corned and shot by the police, then chants some mystical voodoo spell to transport his soul into a Good Guy Doll, doesn't sound very invigorating. However despite the questionable premise I found 'Chucky' to be an effectively intimidating and scary horror flick, and I think that it's mainly due to Tom Holland's clever direction.What he does is, he takes his time putting us behind dark room corners and point-of-view camera shots before actually letting us see the doll move freely about, kind of like what Steven Spielberg did with Jaws. This allows Tom to build up plenty of suspense just before he encapsulates us with the impressive visual effects. In that scene where the mother threatens to throw Chucky into the fire, Charles Lee Ray comes to life right before your eyes and it's so much fun to watch. Even before the doll expressed his true self he was still very intimidating, every time you looked at him you could tell that there was something going on in that little plastic head. Brad Dourif was casted perfectly for this role, he has such a creepy voice that it's not surprising why the producers wanted him to stick around for next five sequels. And that kid who played the little boy Andy was a very good actor, especially for only being seven years old.Child's Play does not have the best story, nor the best screenplay, but it does have a great main monster, great visual effects, and a great director that all together prevents the movie from being a complete waste of time.",Child's Play

It may seem that the special effects are horrible, but these special effects were awesome for 1988. Chucky doesn't even come alive until half the damn is over, but this just adds more suspense. The acting in this movie is pretty good, but Alex Vincent is not very good in the role. Plus, there are a couple of parts in the movie that are boring.

I suggest for you to see this movie and if you have some spare time on your hands watch the second and third but don't be surprised if you dont like them but now you will be able to understand ""Bride of Chucky"" which isn't a bad movie at all.

I was glad to find out that the movie was not really about the gore and death but about the mystery and fast-paced story. Catherine Hicks as well as the other actors nicely give the characters layers and dimension. Brad Dourif is a true talent as a killer trapped in a doll. A clever, edgy and hip script gives the movie a unique feel and for a movie about a killer doll, this is nowhere near being a dumb, childish horror flick.

236,DwightLynn,Charming,7,14 January 2020,"I'm sure my title may sound like a strange way to describe a horror film, but Child's Play is just that; it is full of charm from start to finish, and manages to make the laughable premise of an evil doll work extremely well.I think the best thing about the film is its characters. I was especially impressed with the 6 yr old character, Andy. Normally, child actors are the worst part of any movie they are in. But actor Alex Vincent, despite being so young, is actually really convincing in this role. There is a scene in this movie where Andy is emotionally distressed, and it is extremely convincing, so much so that I was genuinely shocked by how good the child actor was. In a movie like this, a bad kid actor could have ruined everything, but luckily Alex Vincent was really well-directed.The main character, Andy's mother, was really likeable in this film. The fact that she is a struggling single mother with money issues is a really effective way to garner the audiences' sympathies. You cheer for her to figure out the truth and help out her son, and it makes the ending of the film really satisfying. It would've been really easy for the screenwriter to turn the mother into someone unlikable who doesn't trust or like her son, but her character was likeable to the end, and it made me care about what would happen to her.The best thing about the film is Brad Dourif without a doubt. Dourif is a stellar actor, and despite only appearing in person in the opening scene, Dourif's voice adds so much to the character of Chucky; he is as instrumental in this franchise's success as Robert Englund was in A Nightmare on Elm Street's success. His lines aren't Shakespeare, but Dourif delivers everything with such energy and conviction, you can't help but like Chucky, at least a little, as he slashes and quips about.Everything else about the film I liked a lot. The pacing was fantastic and every scene served a purpose, the kills were fun and entertaining, and the animatronics that brought Chucky to life were very convincing. For me, practical effects are more convincing than CGI anyday, and I'm grateful this film was made in the '80's when practical effects were at their peak.If I have any complaints it might be in the structure of the film. I'm torn on whether or not it is a smart idea to open on the explanation for Chucky being alive. This film could have had an interesting psychological twist, where we weren't sure if Chucky was killing people or if it's Andy. But instead, we know Chucky is evil right away, which kind of leaves the film without any interesting complexity. Still, one could argue that Chucky being revealed as the evil force right away adds to the creepiness as this serial killer is being left alone with this little kid. And while that's true, I feel this movie ditched what could have been an interesting, more psychological approach in favor of something more typical. I suppose keeping the film more simple may have contributed to the movie's success, so what do I know?Overall, this is just a really fun horror movie. A few cheesy moments aside, this is a solid movie to watch. Not as good as some of the other horror classics like John Carpenter's Halloween, or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street, but it is still well made and it certainly deserves to be remembered.",Child's Play
237,galaxychoco,I liked it,6,22 September 2013,I actually enjoyed this movie. what happens is a mother gives her son a doll for his birthday only to find out that the doll has been possessed by Charles lee ray a murderer. I know a lot of people don't like this movie i think that's because they were maybe expecting a little too much out of it. I think they definitely got the right voice actor for chucky and all the other actors they got for the characters were good choices too. I have to say though that i didn't find this movie scary i found it more funny i think it had more comedy than horror in it. I have watched this movie a couple of times but i cant really watch it anymore than that because its kind of boring when you know whats going to happen in every scene.

When Chucky kills Andy's baby sitter, the boy realizes the doll is alive and tries to warn people, but he's institutionalized.

239,tangoorange_298,hilarious,7,17 September 2007,i loved this as a comedy not as a horror. the props changed so often you could do nothing but laugh at their expense. i especially liked the bit where chucky threw a plastic hammer at the woman and she fell out of the window and died. i suppose you could think this was a realistic film seeing as how nowadays you can get freaky toys that move and talk. if you want a good laugh watch the bride of chucky and pay attention to what they say when having sex it's great. this is the prime example of a horror-comedy. try it you will laugh. in my opinion one of the best failed horror movies that reinvented itself as a comedy. true comedy with lots of violence,Child's Play
240,PapaT_86,Capitalism's a Bitch!,10,21 August 2008,"What I love about this movie is the way it slyly pokes fun at, and subverts, the 80s Toy Industry. Witness the scene where the single mother couldn't buy her son the ""Good Guy"" doll he so dearly wanted for his birthday, and has to face his disappointment and reassure him that she'll get one soon. How many parents had to face this scene in real life throughout the 80s? The film also manages to incorporate a sense of the multi pronged, multi-media merchandising attack of many toy lines of the decades. The ""Good Guy"" dolls are generally considered to be inspired by the ""My Buddy"" range, but note how they have their own cartoon show, which brings to mind thoughts of He-Man, Transformers, The Care Bears and so on. This kind of detail brings a level of wit to ""Child's Play"" that is ironically lacking in its increasingly comedic sequels.""Child's Play"" is one of the cleverest and most entertaining horror movies of the 80s. OK, so Chucky isn't scary, but how many of us are really scared by Freddy, Jason, Jigsaw etc.? It is simply great fun, brilliantly executed.",Child's Play
241,Slvrcinema,Make no mistake! Chucky rules! :D,8,12 March 2003,"I have been a fan of Chucky's since I was very little and I know that will never change!  I will always feel that the first movie in the series was the best, but will always like all of them.  Brad Dourif did and absolutely awsome job as the voice of Chucky!  You have to consider the year this movie was released before you comment on the special effects.  For 1988, you have to admit this movie was pretty awsome.  Even as a person spoiled by today's ""out of this world"" special effects, I can still watch Child's Play and be happy.  The special effects do get better as the series continues.  The cast did a wonderful job as well.  They gave great delivery of lines and stayed very dedicated to their characters.  That's one of the many things that kept this movie from being thrown into the ""forgotten"" pile of horror movies!  If you haven't seen this one yet, you need to!  Once you get yourself into the right frame of mind, you'll see how awsome Chucky really is! :D",Child's Play
242,antonioeku2,Friends til the end,8,9 October 2007,"The original ""Child's Play"" came out in 1988. Right at the end of 80's horror. People actually thought the film was scary. What worse a thought than your child's toy coming to life and attempting to possess his body while knocking off people all the way!? Add to this that ever single child in America had one of those ""My Buddy"" dolls at the time and there ya go. The Look as well as the wardrobe worn by Chucky was eerily familiar with the ""My Buddy Doll"" so much in fact that the dolls started scaring children and children being scared may have led to the demise and decline in sales of ""My Buddy"". But that's just my opinion.So basically we get the story of Charles LeRay (Brad Douriff) - The Boston Strangler. During a night of chases and shootouts with the cops, Charles takes a bullet and is about done for. While finding his way into a toy store, the voodoo educated serial killer puts his voodoo to use and puts his soul in the ""Good Guy"" doll which just so happens to be the current Toy craze in this film. We then go to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who wants one so bad for his birthday. His mother is having a difficult time finding one but manages to pull it off from a creepy old street vendor who rescued the doll from the toy store fire. Which dolls survived? The possessed one of course. So we get Andy trying to convince people that Chucky is alive all the while Chucky is killing. The movie is great for it's time. While I don't see much scary about it, it is definitely fun. The FX are top notch for a 1988 flick. Best scene bar none is the elevator scene for the sheer comedy of it.",Child's Play
243,luiszlamarque-25096,Great movie,10,18 July 2019,"Child's play is one of the most iconic horror movies, and chucky is one of the best slashers ever, i never going to understand the reason why a lot of people don't like this movies, because are so good movies, this one is the beggining, starts slow but this made the story amazing, have some creepy scenes, good plot, and the deaths are not great but are good, all at his time, Andy is so cute, is great, i just loved him and chucky is a amazing killer, he is creepy and is a little fun sometimes. The mom and the officer are so good too but Andy and chucky are the bestAs I said before, the plot is developing slowly but this makes it develop pretty well, after the first 30 minutes it starts to be great and it will not disappoint you if you like the slashers movies. I recommend you see this movie for sure",Child's Play

The Child's Play series is great, I like them all. I also like them because my nick-name is Chucky . I would recommend you watch all of the child's play movies, but if you only have time for one, this is the one to watch!",Child's Play
245,popopcms,Classical and the scariest,9,16 July 2006,"child's play 1 scared the crap out of me. Yes the second and third were kind of scary but this one is genius. And I think Bride and Seed were good, but if only they kept it scary, it would be my dream if Tim Burton ( directed Edward sciccorhands,Beetlejuice, corpse bride).. would direct it. It would be great with that Gothic feel.The child actor in this who's plays Andy was very good.Also was Catherine Hicks who has just now rapped up 10 years of 7th heaven.I think it's the best of the series, a 9 out of a possible 10 and I also like chucky plained faced and not all cut up, to me it a more scarier and creepier feel.

I'll never be more scared by another Chucky movie than this one!!!",Child's Play
247,BlueHeMan,Original Horror Classic,6,10 December 2002,"'Child's Play' is a fairly original horror story. A kid's doll gets possessed by a serial killer and the doll terrorizes his family and others while trying to get into the boy's body through voo-doo magic.I remember an old Twilight Zone episode with the Talking Tina doll that was fairly similar. It was good because we never actually saw the doll DO anything except talk and threaten. 'Child's Play' does the same for a good chunk of the movie. The suspense is excellent, and Chucky is terrifying even when not active! We start to see Chucky move and talk, and curse and chase people but it does not ruin the movie. The effects are pretty good, and as a child, this movie is traumatizing. Of course now at 21, I laugh at this movie as do most critics, but I remember renting it when it first came out on video years ago and it changed my sleeping habits. Chucky gave me nightmares well into high school (i'll admit!). I could barely look at my sister's dolls alone in the dark. The sequels are silly and unnessecary, but the original Chuck is worth a friday night alone when you have nothing else to do. As a horror film fan, this ranks in my top 5, as a movie fan in general is won't even crack my top 50. But like I said, keep it away from off-beat dreamy children.

249,sir_striker886,A Classic!,10,30 October 2014,"I was first introduced to this movie as a kid sometime in the 90s. Out of all the horror films this one is amongst the best. The 80s were notorious for having some of the best and most renown horror characters of all time. Chucky is amongst them. In my opinion it's not corny like most modern horror flicks. ""We should split up"" is not a phrase here. If anyone did split up they had a solid reason. Now yeah there are some downfalls to the movie. For instance like many horror films. Because I'm trying to avoid a spoiler it has a typical horror film ending. If you don't know what I mean you will once you watch it. So it may feel a little drawn out by the end. Anyways if you haven't seen it I highly recommend you give it a try. There are psychological elements and plot which makes it so good. It's not all about slash slash I'm a psycho killer blah blah. Their are clear and strong motives.In conclusion... If you did not see the movie give it a go. If you have Netflix you can watch it their. I saw it 2 days ago on Netflix hence the reason I write about it now. Enjoy!",Child's Play
250,Halloween1247,""" No, Andy, No ! We're Friends Til The End, Remember!?"" "" This Is The End, Friend!""",7,7 November 2015,"Child's Play directed by Tom Holland, the film that created the killer doll concept. One night, A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif ) is shot to death in a toy store by Officer Mike Norris ( Chris Sarandon ). Before he dies, Charles transfers his soul into a doll using voodoo magic. He is soon bought by Karen Barclay, (Catherine Hicks) a single mother who gives it to her son, Andy (Alex Vincent) who has just turned six. Most people would probably remember Chucky as that wise-cracking, ridiculous slasher villain, but that is not the case in this movie. For the first half of the movie Chucky is not seen walking or talking, but there are killings that are happening. This is quite suspenseful for the first half while Chucky just sits there and only kills by sneak attacks. These killings are blamed on Andy as he happens to be at all the crime scenes.Andy is an alright character. He is likable enough and never becomes too annoying, but he just does not have any personality traits that are interesting. Andy does have this one liner near the end of the film that is just hilarious.Andy's mother (Karen) and the cop Mike Norris are also just okay. They are also not annoying or badly acted, but they also lack any real personality. They play the role of the adults not believing the kid and that's all for the first half. Chucky is the most notable character in the film. The doll special effects are done pretty good, not as good as they were in later films, but not bad. Brad Dourif's Chucky voice is really memorable and really makes the character of Chucky come to life. Now that Chucky is a doll he believes that he is invincible, and so he plans get revenge on the people who have wronged him. With Andy's help getting him there; he goes into his partner's house to kill him because his partner left him for dead. After doing this and Andy is sent to a mental hospital, Chucky goes to see his old voodoo master so that he can find out how to get out of the dolls body. After Chucky voodoo's his teacher into submission, Chucky learns that he will have to transfer himself into Andy's body. That is his goal for the last half of the movie. Although Chucky is a slasher villain, the movie does not follow the slasher formula that was established by Halloween. It is not about a man in a mask stalking people or the body count, but about Chucky's journey as a man, then as a doll, then revenge and finally becoming human again. The body count is not very high, but the kills that they do have are spread out throughout the movie, so it never feels like the film goes to long without a murder or attempted murder. Unfortunately, most of the kills are a little too ridiculous, even for the 80's. A babysitter is killed (familiar?) early on by getting hit by a plastic hammer and she comically reels backwards and JUMPS out a window. Just Silly. These stupid kills are made up for with the scene where Chucky is in the backseat trying to strangle Mike Norris while stabbing though the seat. Mike keeps stepping on the gas and the whole scene just gets intense. The music is a haunting score, especially the opening music. The theme fits the film and makes the still doll seem more sinister then he is. While the score sounds great, it's just not as an iconic or recognizable as the Halloween or Friday The 13th theme. The movie ends with Chucky being set on fire and getting some of his limbs shot off, Chucky is shot in the heart killing him. But what's this? Andy looks back at the served parts of Chucky and sees. That he is still there. Ambiguous ending that is not that ambiguous Whoa. This might be one of the few slasher films I have seen that did not beg of a sequel. Did not stop them, though. Child's play does have a nice feeling of suspense and the killer is really entertaining to watch. The kills could have been improved, but it does not stop the movie from being enjoyable and at times scary. A Must See For Horror Fans 7.2 / 10",Child's Play

252,magicpandaboom,"A great film, and a true horror classic",8,24 November 2020,"Okay, I know, the plot is a bit cliché. A killer possessing a doll might not seem extremely well thought out to most people. But, they really made it work with this one. A lot of intensity ensues, as Chucky claims the lives of more victims, each time framing Andy. And the intense climax, the final showdown is very suspenseful, as is the rest of the film. To any horror fans who haven't seen Child's Play, I highly recommend it.",Child's Play
253,prehensel,This Movie Just Makes me Sad,4,24 June 2007,"This movie is, as one user previously commented, a bad movie done well. For example, when the batteries fall out of the box, we can see the wheels start turning in Karen's head and everything starting to fall into place. It's not a bad little scene, but it could have been better. Apparently, the original script called for a period of time in which the audience would be unsure whether Andy or Chuckie were committing the murders, and the battery scene would have been the first real evidence that Chuckie was actually alive and a killer. That would have been a wiser move and made for a better movie. Another example of *Child's Play* as bad-movie-done-well is the car scene in which Chuckie tries to kill Mike; this thing goes from patently ridiculous (he had a chance to stop the car in the time between getting out of Chuckie's choke-hold and when Chuckie pushes the accelerator) to genuinely scary when Chuckie is scrambling around outside the car while Mike is trapped inside. That's good stuff.But it's just sad that all of the human actors--including Chris Sarandon--get upstaged by a foul-mouthed doll. The sardonic and sharp-tongued best friend Maggie is a tired stereotype (even in 1988). By the time the 9 o'clock news rolls around, I didn't really care if she survived or not, which is not a good thing. And Alex Vincent, the kid who plays Andy, is not good at all. His lines are often delivered with what I can only call bewilderment--as if he has no idea what's going on in the scene or in the story. That's not surprising since he was about six years old at the time, so he can't be faulted for it. The movie, however, can (and should be). In the end, there are a lot of horror movies I'd rather watch than this one, but I'd rather watch this than *Jaws 3-D* or *Hellraiser: Bloodlines*.",Child's Play
254,axlroseisgod,"Not very scary, but entertaining nonetheless",10,29 July 2003,"Child's Play was billed as a horror movie, but it's hard to categorize it as such. Especially by 1980s standards. There's no brainless teenage cattle, no gratuitous nudity, and no ridiculously high body count. If anything, Child's Play runs like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. It's creepy, but ultimately not shocking. This is no coincidence. An episode of The Twilight Zone called Living Doll used a similar premise.
Child's Play is done very well, considering it's about a serial killer who uses voodoo magic to transfer his soul into a doll. The acting is way above average for a horror movie and the momentum builds nicely. The viewer is forced to wait quite awhile before they actually see Chucky kill anyone. If anyone has seen VH1's ""I Love the 80s"" then you've probably seen Dee Snider mock the movie: ""It's a doll! Step on it! It's over!"". If Chucky tried to go on a killing rampage, this would work. But he doesn't. He uses stealth and cunning to make up for the failings of his diminutive body. He reveals his true self only to young Andy, the boy who gets him as a birthday present. He kills all his hapless victims without much trouble. After all, who would suspect an innocent little doll could kill you when you're not looking?
Perhaps the biggest problem with Child's Play is that it was billed as an evil doll movie. Chucky was on all the posters and commercials, knife in hand. It would have worked much better as a suspense thriller, where you suspect that little Andy Barclay is the murderer.
Despite it's failings as a horror movie, Child's Play is still a great movie because it paints a dismal and accurate picture of the 80s: the frustration of single parenthood, the dark dangerous inner cities, and trying to get your kid that overpriced toy that they just *have* to have. Child's Play also came at a time when dolls were really popular: Teddy Ruxpin, Cabbage Patch Kids, My Buddy, and Kid Sister were all hot items. Little kids loved these things, but there's something inherently sinister about dolls. Those glassy eyes and perma-smiles seem insincere.
Overall, Child's Play is a movie that probably succeeded because it was in the right place at the right time. Nonetheless, it's worth at least a few viewings. Chucky is easily one of the top 3 horror movie villains of the 1980s along with Freddie Krueger and the Gremlins.

255,Cryptfan2,Friends Till The End,10,21 September 2008,"Now, the premise of a killer doll has been done before but not like how Child's Play pulled off the idea.How? Well, the film is about a serial killer who on the verge of dying had no choice but to transfer his soul to a Good Guy which seems to be a sort of parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids and the My Buddy dolls. The same doll lands in the hands of a ten year boy named Andy Barclay and you know that sort of thing won't end well.I didn't write in the full summary mainly because I didn't want to mention any spoilers about the film. Maybe I did but oh well.But yeah, the premise of a killer doll took a new spin, instead of a doll coming to life on its own, the doll has the soul of a person. In this case, the soul is a serial killer.The acting is really well done. Actors such as Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon really put in a lot of effort into their roles and the script really helped. Alex Vincent who plays Andy Barclay who unlike a lot of kid actors made the character believable. But hands down, Brad Dourif is the best of the actors, Chucky is without a doubt one of my all time favorite villains and the character himself is a badass.Don Mancini, Tom Holland and John Lafia wrote a very clever script.Tom Holland who directed the film was clearly the perfect guy for a film like Child's Play.Any nitpicks?

Out of all the horror movies i've ever seen, child's play ( the first one , to ME, is the scariest movie i've seen. A CREEPY looking doll, a CREEPY voice, eerie music because it's not even music its like chimes and a combination of creepy sounds, suspense and of course barely any comedy, just pure horror. Out of all the horror movies I've seen, the scariest movies would have to be the following: Child's Play, Pet Semetary, The Exorcist 3, Evil Dead is pretty creepy at times, The Others, Saw ( not a quite scary just a damn good movie, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original), April Fool's Day is kinda creepy, Sleepaway camp ( music and that ENDING ) there are a few more but i cant quite think, however, the tops are Child's Play and Pet Semetary. Oh, and High Tension is a VERY good horror/suspense. So if u wanna wanna be creeped out, go home, turn off the light, put the TV on loud or surround sound if u have it, and watch by yourself. It's a scary movie, well at least to me it is.

263,jokerman1456,Child's play is kinda underrated,9,3 April 2010,"I can't believe this film has a 6.2 on the ratings, it should be at least 7.2. This is bye far the best of series, it's actually serious even though i do actually enjoy ""Bride of Chucky"". A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray(brad Dourif) has been shot by detective Mike Noris(Chris Sarandon). Charles uses voodoo to transfer his soul into a good guy doll, which is from there on out The Lake Shore Strangler is now Chucky the killer doll. If your a horror fan that gets bored with horror films that barley has gore then you might not like this film, It does how ever surpasses John Carpenter's Halloween in gore though, but much like Halloween, this film doesn't need gore to be entertaining or scary. When someone says Chucky, you might think of a goofy evil doll that's real jokey but this one Chucky is real bad ass, scary and serious. Even Child's Play 2, Chucky was a real joker. Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay does a pretty good job for his age. You'll be surprised that Andy is far from annoying unlike Tyler from Child's Play 3. I thought Chucky looked a lot more realistic in this one then in the sequels, He looks like a demonic toddler!! Just look at him, when he's trying to transfer his soul into Andy. The Characters that were being killed off could have been in there longer, to make it seem more like a slasher, Maggie was in there for a pretty good time but the rest of the people that Chucky kills need to be in there a little bit longer, Leprechaun 1 also suffers from this But at least this one did it a little bit better. Brad's voice is perfect for Chucky's voice, It was actually a girl who did Chucky's voice but they watched the scenes where Chucky talks and they thought Chucky sounded like he was gay. Brad was supposed to only play Charles Lee Ray but fortunately they also casted him to do Chucky's actual voice. Any Ways this is the best out of the series, check it out.",Child's Play

I love how stealth and quick Chucky is and how creepy they made him. this movie was also leaning towards being a comedy also.

His mother gets him a doll for his birthday named Chucky but the doll is possessed by a serial killer who try's to possess Andy. That's the actual plot that's it.

268,ImmortallyInsane,Great suspense/horror film,9,3 February 2006,"Child's Play is of course the first film to feature the infamous and legendary Chucky, the doll possessed by a killer's spirit. This movie has great special and visual effects. The Chucky doll is frighteningly real thanks to some great puppeteer work.The story is that Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler has finally been caught. Detective Mike Norris chases him into a toy store in the wee hours of the morning. Norris shoots Ray a few times and he is dying. He lumbers around the toy store and knocks over a bunch of dolls. He takes one out of the box and uses a voodoo spell to transfer his soul into the doll. Norris thinks he killed him and everything is now a OK, right? WRONG! Young Andy Barcely wants a Good Guy doll, and his mother buys one from a peddler behind her work place. Everything now goes to hell because of course, the doll she buys is Chucky. Aunt Maggie is killed, and soon after Eddie Caputo, Chucky's partner in crime, is killed too.You don't see Chucky come alive until about 45 minutes into the movie. This doesn't take anything away from it though, as the suspense builds nicely throughout. At first, it seems as if Andy is the killer. Chucky later finds out that he must transfer his soul into the first human being he revealed himself too. Chucky now tries to get into Andy, using the voodoo incantation.Well as you can guess, Chucky's plan is foiled, thanks to Detective Norris, Andy's mom, and Andy himself. Chucky is burned, then has his head shot off, then is shot in the heart, finally killing him. Or so we think...All in all, Child's Play came out at the right time. Any earlier and it would have been ignored. Any later and it would have been called cheesy and too 80's. It's a great film if you like horror movies, but don't go expecting a huge body count and tons of nudity. There are neither present here, just a fun, stylish horror/thriller about the problems a family faces in Chicago and then some.Hell, even Rogert Ebert gave this 3 stars. It must be worth something.

But this exceptional production value and Brad Dourif's extraordinary minimal work is compensated with a functional but not a bit original and inspired direction; A weak supporting cast.

270,fastfastfastradio,Scary Fun,6,1 July 2020,"To be fair to this film, when I was a child, seeing this movie at an age I definitely should not have seen it at, the idea of Chucky absolutely terrified me. So regardless of the critiques I have of this film, it's clear it did something right.The main problem with this movie is that it tries to be two different kinds of films at once. With a movie like this, the best way to go is to have it unclear if the doll is really alive or if it's all in the kid's head. And, honestly the first half of the movie plays that incredibly well. You never actually see Chucky move or talk until about half way thru the film's. The suspense and tension behind it would be incredibly effective if it weren't for one little thing: the opening scene of the movie shows Charles Lee Ray transferring his soul into the Good Guy doll. This removes any sense of suspense the movie had going for it, so I really don't understand why it spends so long playing off that idea that maybe the kid is just making it up. It really just comes off as tedious because we all know the doll is actually alive.Another huge flaw in this movie is that, once Chucky learns that to get out of the doll he has to transfer his soul into the first person he revealed himself to (which in and of itself is just a convenient way to get the little kid back into the movie), he has literally so many chances to go thru with the spell or voodoo ritual or whatever you want to call it; multiple times he is halfway thru the chant to transfer his soul into Andy's body, but someone else comes in the room so he stops and pretends like he's just a doll again. Why on earth would he do that? Why wouldn't he just finish the chant, get out of the doll, and get rid of the witness later? Like what?Another huge flaw in this movie and most of its sequels is that, apparently, the longer he stays in the doll the more human he becomes. That's a fine plot thread, sure, but the thing is even though he's apparently becoming more human it seems like in actuality the longer he stays in the doll the less human he becomes, because as the movie goes on he begins to survive things no human would. He gets shot multiple times, survives a car crash, and gets set on fire and still manages to stay alive. This again falls into the biggest problem in this movie: it says or uses one thing as a plot device, but when it's executed it totally ignores said plot device.Once again, I have to say, this movie and it's villain are absolutely iconic. There's a reason Chucky is up there with other horror villains like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, And Freddie Kruger: Because the idea of a killer doll is inherently terrifying. It clearly has some timeless quality to it which scares children to this day. So for all the complaints I have about this movie, it needs to be said, it clearly struck a chord with people and has been an important staple of the horror genre for decades. Maybe it's not high art, maybe it's not objectively a good film, but if you watch it only expecting a fun little horror movie and don't take it too seriously, it's rather enjoyable.",Child's Play

In both those movies, we have no real idea how the object(s) got possessed(if you've read the book Christine you know). But in Child's Play, they give us an inventive explanation. It's a little annoying that you don't see Chucky actually talking to Andy before he shows his real self to Andy's mom. Chucky doesn't actually start talking until the middle of the film.

This is one of the best horrors out there still to this day. Chucky's movements look believable and again still hold up even though this film was released in 1988, the actors are very believable and do a superb job at portraying their characters and it is still a fun watch.

280,johnbartusandtheasskicke,Awesome 1988 Classic,10,12 March 2011,"i liked this one it's a good way to start a trilogy. a serial killer uses voodoo to transfer his soul into one cute ""Good Guys'' Doll and a little kid named Andy Barclay who is a big fan of ""Good Guys'' wants to get one doll for his Birthday today and that doll he wanted is actually the same serial killer from earlier in the movie and as things were getting cute later on as Karen Barclay's friend Maggie Peterson is Babysitting little Andy she dies from falling out a window by an unsuspecting killer. later on Karen Barclay returns home to see if her son Andy was okay but she sees cops outside the hotel building and she goes to the apartment room to see if Andy's okay but he is and a Detective is there too investigating the case he wonders who the killer was but he thinks it might be Andy but it's not as Andy keeps saying Chucky his doll ""Did it'' but nobody believes it and the next morning as his mom drops him off to school right as she leaves Andy sneaks out of school and heads to a guy's house named ""Eddie Caputo'' an ex-partner of Charles Lee Ray who ditched him the night he was killed as Andy leaves Chucky on the chair to take a tinkle Chucky is off the chair unknown where he is at but we see a person inside Eddie's house turning up the stove and as Eddie wakes up from his nap and heads to see where the noise was he heads in the room where the stove's at fires his gun at it and BOOM! goes his house barley only half of it. at the Chicago police department Andy and Chucky are there and the Detective and his Partner are wondering why was the kid near the crime scene and Andy is going to be taken away to the hospital unless the doll answers Andy tries to make him talk but the doll only says his good guy doll line and Andy is taken away for a while. later that night as Karen is throwing away the good guys doll box, batteries were in the box the whole time and Chucky has been talking the whole time with no batteries Karen goes and checks the battery spot on the back of the doll when she opens SURPRISE! NO BATTERIES! and Chucky turns his head backwards to Karen and says ""Hi, i'm Chucky wanna play!'' and Karen drops him and falls under the couch she then takes him out from under and forces him to talk she lites up the fireplace for a last result and Chucky comes to life and attacks her and runs and the rest you'll have to see for yourself.",Child's Play
281,burninblazes,"If you like hilarious bad horror movies, this is a winner",4,10 November 2004,"Child's Play has become one of my favorite bad movies. But I don't find the idea of a foul mouthed, deranged Cabbage Patch Kid as a villain to be very effective. Especially when he used to be a regular guy (well, OK, a strangler), and now he's stuck in child's doll and more p.o.'d than ever.Andy Barclay is an adorable, lisping little boy insanely obsessed with his favorite TV characters, the ""Good Guys"". When he finds out that Good Guys are actually on the market as talking dolls, he wants nothing more than for his mother, Karen, to get him one. Unfortunately for Andy, mom is poor and can't afford the hundred bucks for the doll. But before long, she's buying one for a lower price from a peddler in an alley. Unfortunately for both she and Andy, the doll was possessed by Charles Lee Ray, or ""Chucky"" as his friends call him, a serial killer.Andy is ecstatic with his new best buddy. Chucky begins spouting off to him right away, revealing himself to be alive (though we don't actually hear from him at this point), but of course no one buys Andy's comments that the doll has a mind of its own. Then, the killing begins. Actually, Chucky only manages to take out two people before Andy is blamed for the deaths and locked up in a weird mental home. Soon after, Karen finally finds out the truth about Chucky, as Chucky flies into a rage and attacks her for messing with him. Karen goes off trying to get a cop to believe her, and Chucky goes off to talk with his voodoo guru, some guy who looks like Bill Cosby and who taught Chucky ""how to beat death"". Voodoo guy is outraged at the ""abomination"" before him, but Chucky finally gets it out of him that to become human again, Chucky must transfer his soul into Andy. A little while later, it's the final showdown. This movie is loopy as hell from the start, but the final showdown is hilarious. At least, it is if you don't buy killer Cabbage Patch Kids as frightening foes. If you do buy it, then the humor of seeing one of them fly backwards through the air in slow mo after getting shot, or suddenly scrunching up his face in a fit of fury and charging forward to attack someone might be lost on you. But how anyone could miss the plain campy, cheesy *badness* of this goofball horror movie is beyond me (Count how many seconds Chucky screams ""Ayiyiyiyiyiyiyi!!"" for no reason at one point). The creators surely didn't miss it. No one can convince me that this movie isn't tongue in cheek. If you watch it as a comedy, like I do, you may find yourself quite entertained.",Child's Play

285,scandinavianairlinestw,An interesting title,8,28 September 2019,"Here's my review on Child's Play (1988), nearly 31 years later. I believe that if you go for something original, especially in a horror movie title, you deserve some credit. A movie with a premise as delightfully cheesy as a killer doll might not sit with some people, but for me, it allowed me to stay glued to my seat for a solid 90 minutes.Even though the movie's true killer doesn't arise until 45 minutes into the film, when Chucky arrives, all hell breaks lose, and every single one - liner delivered by Brad Dourif is memorable and funny. Sure, the ending may be trying a little too hard to make Chucky seem scary enough, but it proves just how hard the writers and producers worked to make this movie a successful classic and give it an interesting plot. For me, it works.The movie is also boosted with delightful performances from Catherine Hicks, Alex Vincent, and Brad Dourif. This, along with just the right amount of scares and gore, allows this movie to be a must - watch for horror fans.",Child's Play

287,RawkeyCarmine,Loved it.,8,5 April 2003,"I do believe I am the only person I know who actually liked this movie. I find the idea of a killer doll so intriguing that i don't think I couldn't like it. I don't know if this movie was supposed to be scary, and as I watch it today--it isn't in the least. However, I do remember, when i was younger. oh-so-many-nights i kept my mom up screaming about how Chucky was going to kill me in my sleep,  So it did its job in that department, i suppose.I gave this film 8 stars.  The acting was par, the suspense was there, and the plot was great (a rare thing in most horror movies today).  I suggest if you haven't seen it, you rent it sometime soon.",Child's Play
288,jamesbamesy,Creative idea for a horror movie and gave us one of the best slasher villains ever!,9,1 July 2017,"Child's Play was one of, if not the first horror franchise I got connected to. Even though that this wasn't the first one I saw, I still was able to admire it as a good start for the series. The whole premise is about a living doll named Chucky going around killing people, and the sequels do get quite silly after about 4 of them (cough cough Seed of Chucky). So, if that's the case, how good is the original Child's Play to be considered a classic? Let's see...Infamous serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is gunned down by Det. Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) - but does a chant with a Good Guy doll just before his death - in the toy store. A day later, it's the birthday of a 6- year-old boy, Andy Barclay (Alec Vincent), and gets the same Good Guy doll named Chucky from his mother, Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks). One night, however, when Karen's friend Maggie (Dinah Manoff) babysits Andy, she is mysteriously murdered and this raises awareness for everyone, including Det. Morris. This goes as far as claiming the murder on little Andy. Thus, he is taken away from his mother for a while. Suddenly, when Karen is at the fireplace with the doll, she discovers that it's alive, scaring her, which leaves Chucky to run off and do his own bidding. Turns out that Andy was right about him being alive, earlier in the film.This is a horror classic, and for good reason. First of all, I love the concept of your own toy causing all of this trouble, even if it may have been done before, but not to this extent. The effects on Chucky are very well done, and Brad Dourif gives a greatly scary performance as the killer doll, without being too comical in the role.Speaking of great performances, the acting is all great and believable in the situations they're in. Catherine Hicks, for example, does great as the fearful mom who's truly worried about her son and dislikes it whenever she's being fooled with or when people don't believe her about the doll being animate. The only character I think could have been handled a bit better would actually be Andy, as he does get slightly annoying due to the acting by Alex Vincent. But I can't exactly fault him since he was little at the time. Besides, I think he's one of the better kid characters in horror films.Now, despite this being in the horror genre and that there wouldn't be many messages, if one at most, this one does have an interesting, hidden moral. It could be about parents stressing about their children about getting what they want. This could potentially lead to bad locations to get said thing their child wants and ending up badly depending on the change put in the product. But hey, this is just a guess of what the meaning could be and may not be true.Overall, though, Child's Play is a very well-made horror movie of the 1980's and one of my favourites of all time. With an intriguing plot and premise, acting that would be suitable for more than just horror, solid suspense, and an excellent villain, this is for horror fans and movie fans alike who like to see something different. That being said, however, it may be technically the best, but it isn't my favourite (see my list of the Child's Play/Chucky movies from best to worst for further information), but it is very, very close. Therefore, I would give this fun horror flick a solid 9 out of 10.",Child's Play

294,mbmcmil,A solid beginning to one of the most iconic horror movie series,6,27 April 2021,"Childs play was a great start and iteration to the Chucky franchise. While it definitely has its flaws and has elements of a campy 80's horror movie. It still holds up in its own way and is a great introduction to the Chucky character.Plot: Childs play has a very basic plot of most of the classic horror films. There was not too many surprises and I feel like it would have done better if they revealed that it was a murder inside of him at the end to try and get some shock value out of the movie. Otherwise it checked every box; I just wished it checked some out of the box.Acting: The acting in it was what is was. Nothing to write home about but at the end of the day its really not supposed to have anything to write home about as that is not its primary goal. Best acting performance goes to Alex Vincent as Andy Barclay as he did quite a good job for such a young actor.Storytelling: Without any major big plotlines, it is pretty easy to progress the story along and that was done quite well in this very situation. It also was smart in setting up for the future movies by letting the watcher know that it takes a lot for Chucky to die and he could come back for future films.Creativity: There is not much to write home about on creativity. Every character does its job but I would not say the movie overall as a whole puts you on this rollercoaster and edge of your seat experience. I will say just the simple idea of haunting a toy was very creative for the time and this simple trope turned into a very successful franchise.Other Factors: the other factors that were in this movie were Music, Film Editing, and Cinematography. I thought the music created a suspense that was very necessary especially in some scenes and the Editing and Cinematography allowed for suspense to be drawn out especially in scenes when Chuckey's moving. These are some of the films biggest bright spots.Overall, Child's Play checks the boxes it was supposed and did its job in the best way it could. You hope to see improvement as the series progresses but for a starting movie; it does all that it can and sometimes more.",Child's Play
295,akhhhicks,Impressive,7,29 July 2012,"I have to say, I was never into the whole killer doll concept. Based on the front cover, I assumed that it was just another cheap slasher film about a doll that is possessed goes on a murder spree. But I watched it. And I have to say, It is my favorite film ever! Usually the doll comes alive by saying some sort of magic spell. But not with Chucky! Instead, it's a serial killer who gets gunned in a toy store and uses voodoo to possess a doll so he doesn't's have to die. He is also my favorite notorious slasher.

The performances all around are brilliant, especially little Alex Vincent (who plays Andy). Chucky is sure a horror icon, and has been scarifying for audiences around the world, but now I think its safe to say that Chucky is a bit of a comic icon now.

298,sharkbitefilms,The original film that spawned one of the most popular horror franchises ever!,8,19 July 2014,"First off, let just start by saying that this is one of the best films I've ever seen. Chuck is a classic horror icon! The 80's and 90's were some of the best decades for horror movies, Child's Play/Chucky included. This movie has a slow build up, but most 80's horror movies did, but it's worth it because it builds up to an epic climax which ends with Chucky being caught on fire, then shot to pieces only to finally die by being shot in in the heart of his body (his head and body were torn apart). I must say, the ending was very creepy, it ended with Andy slowly walking out the door and looking back at Chucky's remains. As Andy walks out the door, it does a freeze frame and then fades to black. It is easily one the best Chucky film, although I haven't seen Curse of Chucky and I've heard that's pretty good. But anyways guys, that's my review. See ya later!",Child's Play
299,billymari,"Great slasher, pretty underrated.....",8,20 August 2007,"When I was little, I grew up with the first two sequels but never got around to watching the original. It wasn't too long ago that I finally got to see it and now I believe the first Child's play is the best in the series. This film is special in the fact that the series wasn't a parody of itself yet, that the character of Chucky wasn't on center stage (Though he definitely plays a big role in this movie of course.) I'll try to keep details on the plot as short as possible, but basically its about a boy named Andy who gets a Good Guy doll for his birthday. The one doll he receives happens to be alive thanks to a voodoo ritual that transfers the soul of a serial killer (Named Charles Lee Ray) The doll named Chucky sneaks around and murders innocent people but fingers are pointed at Andy, since after all who would believe that a toy is alive and killing people. Chucky throughout the film is attempting to become human again by possessing Andy's body, since he can only use Andy because he was the first person who knows who he is in doll form (Though at first Andy doesn't know Chucky is evil.) I'll leave the rest of the plot for you to see.A lot of people complain that the plot of the movie is stupid and lame. They comment how if in real life Chucky attacked they could overpower the doll so easily, and that it wouldn't be a problem at all. Personally I think using a doll as a villain makes the movie so much more better. A lot of people have a irrational fear of dolls (The way they look, their frozen faces and postures, how they seem to stare at you wherever you are in a room.) and that really enhances that in this film. Secondly, Chucky isn't a generic monstrous brute who kills victims with pure brawn. He waits for the right moments, hides in the right places, and strikes when your guard is down. And even if he didn't, would YOU really know what to do if all of a sudden a doll came to life with a knife in his hand and lunged at you? I think you'd be too scared to even react (They even explain in the movie that Chucky has superhuman strength, which makes him hard to overpower despite his size.) I also wanted to comment that I liked the fact that although Chucky is the villain in this, he does not talk all that much in the film nor is he seen as much as the sequels, which gives him this sneaky, mysterious persona. I enjoyed him in the sequels but there were times I found him to be a little over the top and overly amusing. Its also interesting to see that Chucky himself looks more primitive and less realistic than in the sequels which I found gave a gritty and dark feeling.Another strong point in the film is the good acting, especially Alex Vincent who plays Andy. One scene I like in particular is when he's in the hospital and realizes Chucky is searching for him. He starts to despair and cries hysterically, which I thought was brilliant acting for such a young boy. He really makes you want to jump in the screen and protect him.Child's play may not be a classic in the horror genre, but its a fun movie that shows what the franchise was like before Chucky was more of a comedian than a killer. It's not for everyone, but if you want a good scare, or if you want a good popcorn flick, rent this one sometime.",Child's Play

Must see film for fans of the slasher genre.The best killer toy film out there by a long way so forget about Puppet Master, Dolls and Dolly Dearest and have a night in with the chuckster. trebor dnalob rating 4/5",Child's Play
306,dillonmarshall,"Long before the shitfest that was Seed, we had Child's Play.",9,12 September 2013,"I remember when I was about seven and I was in a charity shop, I was looking at the Pokemon video cassettes and where one video was missing, a completely different type of film took its place. When I took that film down from the shelf I saw on the front cover a pair of blue eyes looking down on a large building with the title ""Child's play""written across the top, I certainly was intrigued so I turned to look at the back. There, in the top right corner, just above the description was a picture of a ginger doll wearing dungarees and a stripey, colorful top. He was standing in the rain waving at me. I have to say, as a child I was pretty shaken, well, I was rather petrified if I'm honest, however this made me want to buy it right there and then. But of course, no parent, never mind grandparent, is going to buy a seven year old a horror film all about a killer doll that becomes conscious, especially when my grandmother herself had a collection of dolls all around her house. So finally, about five years later I caught it on the TV and watched it, and it certainly did live up to my expectations, so much so that I was overjoyed to find out that each of the sequels would be played each week at the same time. I think there are so many factors that contribute to my overgrown love for this franchise and this very film, but I think the biggest factor is Brad Dourif himself. Acting as Charles Lee Ray at the start of the film and voicing the supernaturally possessed doll throughout, Brad Dourif gives an intense, unforgettable performance. His eerie voice delivers the full character, he can go from a playful Chucky that's toying around with a cop to a rather enraged one that's effing and blinding his heart out, no matter what the line is, Brad Dourif can deliver it. Who would I say is the second best cast member? If I'm honest, Alex Vincent, hands down. Despite him being under ten years old when this was being filmed he's still to me the best child actor to star in a horror film to merely be chased by the antagonist. Why do I think this? Because he was a child, who could get into the shoes of another child, and not ruin it along the way. He was believable and you instantly feel some sort of sympathy for him, and no, it isn't because he's being chased by a doll that's been possessed by a murderer, it's because he genuinely gives an emotional performance. About thirty five minutes into the film I found myself frustrated for him when no one believes him that Chucky is real, this is because you can see it in his eyes. You can see that deep down he doesn't want to be in trouble and that he's being tricked, for a child actor to do this is simply astonishing. I've discussed how Chucky as a character is thanks to the voice talents of Brad Dourif, but what about the other 40% of the film before you actually hear Chucky speak and can confirm he is actually alive? How do they keep you on the edge of your seat? Very simple, with two things; simple yet exceptional camera work and top notch animatronics that's very surprising to have been around in 1988. Firstly, I'll discuss just what it is that the camera itself does for you as a viewer. There's a scene around twenty minutes into the film where 'Aunt Maggie' becomes the first character on Chucky's kill list, however, the audience hasn't seen Chucky in full attack mode yet and Don Mancini certainly wanted to keep them waiting. So with a little bit of back and forth from Chucky's eyesight and the eyesight of Aunt Maggie, you see it all without seeing anything at all. The audience is placed into first person view of the doll itself, running around the corners of the room taunting Maggie, however when you think you're safe and inside the monster's mind itself, you switch back to Maggie's viewpoint on it all. With a few jump-scares here and there and the eerie background score completely stopped, you see a Good Guy hammer hit Maggie's head, sending her tripping out of the window to her expected death. This all done with beautifully handled close up angles and first person views. I think this film could have been quite the disaster if a few decisions were to be pointed in a different direction at the time, what I mean by this is imagine if Chucky was created by CGI? We all know judging by films such as Jaws 3 that CGI wasn't exactly the smoothest thing around during the eighties and early nineties, so imagine how disastrous it could have been? But luckily for us, they decided to go fully animatronic (well, excluding a few scenes where you can clearly see a little person was put in a costume). The idea for an animatronic Chucky came from Don Mancini's total shock of how successful it turned out in Gremlins which came out a few years before. To me, the animatronic Chucky was the best way to go, I feel as if I appreciate it more that they put so much time and effort into making it work. In the end I suppose it all comes down to opinion and your taste in movies, some may say this is a total cheese-fest, others may say it's an 80's horror masterpiece, but I suppose I can just say, I'm certainly glad that Pokemon video was missing and this was there in its place, if it wasn't then I probably wouldn't be writing this now.",Child's Play
307,ovnlightx9,Good movie. (light spoilers),6,2 April 2015,"Child's Play is the only Chucky movie I'd consider ""good"", but even just good is an impressive accomplishment for most movies in the horror genre. In this movie we get a full, fresh, coherent story because like with many horror movies, the debut could have very well been a stand alone. Andy is a boy who is unlucky enough to get a doll which is possessed by a voodoo serial killer, and Andy is key for the serial killer Charles to transfer his soul out of a lousy doll's body and into a human's again (this actually sums up the Child's Play series). The four main characters we have are Chucky, Andy, Andy's mom, and a detective, and this much is enough to drive the story. Through the film we see the three protagonist characters slowly come to realizations around Chucky, Andy gradually understands that the doll's evil and that he should be combating him rather than complying with him, and the two adults each realize that Andy isn't crazy or imaginative and that his doll is in fact possessed. What's also good about this film is that the audience has reason to believe that Chucky, despite being a doll, is a powerful and capable entity more threatening than even a human. This is a point which will probably become lost on you through the course of the series as his voodoo skills only serve as a method of attempting to transfer his soul in future films.Despite my 6/10 rating (I aim to be objective with my ratings), this movie is a personal favorite of mine (we can attribute that to my teenage fanboy years) and I have watched it multiple times. If a horror movie about a killer doll with a wicked sense of humor sounds appealing to you, then you'll like this movie.",Child's Play
308,bliek_21,Not Scary,1,22 May 2005,"This movie was so so so retarded....it was hardly considered scary... a doll kills people, please how much more stupid can it get...? I don't think that the sequels were that scary either...maybe if they didn't have him come back to life every time he was killed it might actually make some money and actually be somewhat scary. The Seed of Chuckie was the least scary...Britney Spears? Well whoever wrote this movie has some serious problems...at first I used to be so scared of it but then it kinda hit me that it was retarded because it's not realistic at all. Maybe they should make a reproduction of this movie...a scary one... until then I guess I'll just have to live...",Child's Play
309,bman19971,Friends till the end,6,14 October 2017,"Seeing as it's October I decided to go back and watch some of my favourite horror villains back in their heyday . I have loved the character of Chucky for a long time but having watched the latest in the child's play/ Chucky saga (cult of Chucky ) I realised that I have seen 6 of the 7 films ( I always believed I had seen child's play before ) so I decided to watch it today and I am still a fan especially of brad douriff's portrayal of Chucky and the way he carries himself through the animatronic doll . But having lived in a mostly hd era I couldn't help but get carried away with picking out when you can clearly see an actor dressed as the titular doll through many of the scenes . I am Not saying it ruins the movie, as I am no way a critic or an expert I am merely a fan . So I decided to let that all slide and enjoy the movie which i did a lot! . For a genre that was full at the time with masked killers , ghosts and zombies child's play shows that with the right aesthetic and pacing a killer doll can actually be a fun and intriguing concept . As I said earlier brad douriff was excellent as always . Alex Vincent was a convincing foil for the titular doll as he was trying tell and show his mother and the detective that it was in fact Chucky who killed the babysitter and Eddie . While they were convinced that Andy was just using the doll as a scapegoat. But boy when Andes mother finally realises she has been wrong this whole time and when Chucky reveals himself to her I actually jumped . All in all this was a good 80's horror movie but it could of been helped by better casting of the adults and more convincing line readings . But all that was just a sign of the times as this moves deserves and rightfully takes its place in horror history .",Child's Play

311,zacheberhard,A True Horror Classic,6,15 September 2019,"Childs Play follows a young boy named Andy who recieves a doll named Chucky for his birthday. Little does he or his mother know the doll is possessed by a criminal named Charles Lee Ray. You can probably guess where the movie goes from thereChilds Play is not a movie that is meant to be taken seriously. Its definitely a love or hate film. You will probabaly love the movie if you enjoy horror or slasher films, Chucky can definitely make you laugh a few times throughout the film. On the other hand, if you dont enjoy horror or slasher films, Childs Play probably is not for you",Child's Play
312,catmandan-15096,A Cult Classic,10,10 April 2016,"I watched this movie when I was just 6 years old and that very night it gave me nightmares. This was definitely not a movie for children but I saw it anyway. Since then, I have been a fan of the Child's Play franchise and I watch every installment. This one is definitely a classic. I'd advise you to watch this one alone at night with the doors locked. Any Chucky movie is a timeless classic that I think not only I like but the entire community of hardcore Chucky fans will love to death. There are many deaths in this movie and I won't give anything away if you haven't seen it already. Must watch on Blue-Ray disc or DVD. This one will have you scaring your little sister by asking her: Wanna play?",Child's Play
313,night_reiner,Child's Play (Chucky 1),9,31 December 2005,"Child's Play is a classic movie and the beginning to the five (so far) movies starring Chucky...voiced by Brad Dourif. In this movie various characters are met...which I will not go into, cautioned by the ""spoiler""...but mainly our two main characters Charles Lee Ray (the soul of Chucky) and Andy Barcley (Alex Vincent). Chucky is well...a doll, and Andy is a rather young boy (5 or 6.. forget) who comes into contact with his new Good Guy doll. I rate this movie a 9 out of 10, with 10 being the best, because I enjoyed it a lot and couldn't bring myself to not repeatedly watch it over and over again. It lacks the extra point because...I hate to admit...it was flawed (minorly). I think many mature people would enjoy this and the other movies as well...mature people! It is rated R for a reason you know.",Child's Play
314,stepansiroky,The first part is the best part,8,5 January 2019,"This part is definitely the best part of the whole franchise. I surely have to admit, that Chucky looks like he's alive. Very good 80´s horror.",Child's Play
