0,SnoopyStyle,intriguing premise done poorly,5,27 May 2021,"An ancient Aztec dagger does a Freaky Friday switcheroo with high school teen Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) and serial killer The Butcher (Vince Vaughn). She has twenty four hours to switch back.I really like this premise. It has great potential and I can't think of another Freaky Friday horror movie. Sure, possessions happen a lot but this is trying to be a horror comedy. It could have been great. First, I don't buy hottie Kathryn Newton as some kind of outcast at school. They need to ugly her up and give her a pair of glasses. I buy the jocks being lecherous and sleazy. They could do more of that at the beginning. Second, I don't buy Vince Vaughn acting like a girlie girl. It looks like he's pretending. I'm not sure that he could do anything more. He's a giant man pretending to be a little girl. It doesn't work and don't get me started with the kiss. The possibilities are amazing but the reality is less than satisfying. Finally, Millie and her friends should be going for the knife right away. Their first move should be trying to convince Charlene. The kids are mostly bad at planning and their salvation is a lot of convenient occurrences. There are a couple scenes where I like the inventiveness of the writing but overall, the writing needs to be smarter. The characters need to be smarter. The whole thing needs to be smarter.",Freaky
1,nogodnomasters,Not Prom. Homecoming.,8,29 November 2020,"The butcher (Vince Vaughn) swaps places with the final girl (Kathryn Newton). Milly is the mascot of the pun filled Blissful Beavers. In the killers body she must convince her friends of the swap, get the murder weapon out of the evidence locker, and stab her body (now that of the killer) in the shoulder, all within 24 hours or the change is permanent. The title is clearly homage to ""Freaky Friday.""I liked the plot and the acting and it appears the actors had fun with the role reversals. I didn't like the ending of the home invasion. I though maybe Milly returning to school with some swagger and handling a knife like a killer leaving doubt would have been more fun.Guide: F-word. Brief sex. No nudity.",Freaky
2,classicsoncall,"""Don't leave me alone with murder Barbie!""",5,28 July 2021,"This was a little too teen oriented for my taste, but it did have it's moments. The best were Vince Vaughn's spots following the body swap with Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) in which she became the Blissfield Butcher. The opening scene had some creatively gruesome murders committed by the Butcher when Vaughn still occupied his own body, the sickest was the broken wine bottle stuffed down the throat of the male teen. The tennis racket header was also kind of nasty. Once Millie/Butcher convinces her high school friends what happened as the result of an Aztec knife curse, a countdown begins to make the body exchange occur again before the result becomes permanent. Some of the murders are exceptionally violent for younger teens so I'd say discretion is advised. Not to mention an early simulated sex scene that's a bit in poor taste, but I guess I did just mention it. If I had to do it over again I'd give this movie a pass, but since I stumbled upon it thinking it would be more cleverly written, the die has already been cast.",Freaky
3,jboothmillard,Freaky,6,19 April 2021,"I saw the trailer for this scary movie in the cinema, from the format and title, I could tell it was Freaky Friday with a twist, in fact, it was originally to be titled Freaky Friday the 13th. The cinemas closed due to lockdown before it could be released, so thank goodness it went online instead, from Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Sinister, Get Out), directed by Christopher Landon (Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, Happy Death Day). Basically, four teenagers are brutally murdered by a serial killer known as the Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughn). Before leaving, the killer steals an ancient dagger known as La Dola. The next day, bullied high school student Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton) attends the Blissfield Valley High School homecoming football game, where she performs as the school mascot. As Millie waits for a ride home, the Butcher attacks her. As the moon is full, the killer stabs Millie in the shoulder with La Dola, causing an identical wound to instantly appear on his shoulder. Millie's older sister Charlene (Dana Drori), a police officer, arrives and scares off the Butcher. The police collect the dagger as evidence and a manhunt is initiated to catch the Butcher. Following the stroke of midnight, supernatural forces cause the Butcher and Millie to switch bodies. The following morning, on Friday the 13th, the Butcher in Millie's body wakes in her bedroom. The killer acts strangely towards Millie's mother Coral (Katie Finneran) and Charlene and cannot resist the temptation to try and kill them. Meanwhile, Millie wakes in the Butcher's body, in a dilapidated building and flees in distress. The Butcher, posing as Millie, finds a new wardrobe and heads to the high school, remaining quiet and continuing to act coldly to the students. Millie meanwhile makes her way to the high school to find her friends. The Butcher kills Millie's chief tormentor Ryler (Melissa Collazo) by freezing her to death in a cryotherapy tank in the girl's locker room. The Butcher realises Millie's innocent appearance grants him immunity to get away with murder. He next kills wood shop teacher Mr. Bernardi (Alan Ruck), another one of Millie's tormentors, slicing him in half with a table saw. Millie finds her best friends, black Nyla Chones (Celeste O'Connor) and gay Joshua ""Josh"" Detmer (Misha Osherovich); they immediately attack her, thinking she is the killer. Eventually, through performing the school mascot dance routine, answering personal questions, and their trademark handshake, Millie proves her identity. Nyla and Josh research La Dola, and with the help of a Spanish teacher to translate an online article they discover the dagger's power to switch bodies. But the article also details that if the killer is not stabbed again with the dagger before midnight, their body switch will become permanent. Later that afternoon, the Butcher lures Millie's crush Booker Strode (Uriah Shelton) into a monster themed mini golf course to kill him, but Millie, Nyla, and Josh arrive just in time to save him. Millie knocks both the Butcher and Booker unconscious, and she and her friends bring them both to Josh's house. After tying the Butcher to a chair, Millie and Nyla try to explain the situation to Booker, who remains unconvinced. But Millie recites a love poem she anonymously wrote to him weeks earlier, convincing him of her identity. Josh watches over the Butcher while Millie, Nyla, and Booker drive to the police station to get La Dola being held in evidence. Nyla tricks Charlene, the only officer in the station, into leaving so she can steal the dagger. Waiting outside in the car, Booker reveals that he has always liked Millie, and Millie says she has enjoyed the newfound strength and confidence she feels whilst in the Butcher's body, and they briefly kiss. Josh's mother (Brooke Jaye Taylor) mistakes the Butcher for Millie and frees him, and the killer escapes. While Charlene catches Nyla trying to steal La Dola, Millie sees the Butcher enter the police station and runs in after him, but Charlene tries to detain her, unaware of the situation. Millie overpowers her sister and locks her in a jail cell while the Butcher escapes in a police car. At the Blissfield Valley High Homecoming dance, three football players attempt to rape the Butcher, thinking he is Millie, while another football player reveals himself as gay trying to kiss Josh. The Butcher murders the four footballer players. As midnight approaches, Millie finds the Butcher and they engage in a fight. Eventually, the killer is held down by Nyla and Josh while Booker stops the police from interfering. For a moment, it looks like they are too late as Booker's watch sounds, but Millie realises that he mentioned having it set five minutes earlier to avoid being late for classes. Millie stabs the Butcher with La Dola and they switch back to their own bodies just as the police shoot down the Butcher. Later, Millie and Booker reunite, and they kiss again. But the Butcher has faked his death, waking in the ambulance, and returns to Millie's home. Millie, Charlene, and their mother struggle to overpower the Butcher, and the killer mocks Millie's physical weakness and anxiety. But Millie finally kills the Butcher by impaling him with a broken table leg. Also starring Ezra Sexton as Brett, Emily Holder as Sandra, Nicholas Stargel as Isaac, Kelly Lamor Wilson as Ginny, and Mitchell Hoog as Evan. Vaughn makes up for his mistake of playing Norman Bates in the atrocious remake of Psycho and makes a convincing psycho killer, and is hilarious being girly following the body switch, and Newton is marvellous being all sweet and innocent, and of course turns with the killer in her body making constantly sinister stares and smirks. The body swap format is always one used to humorous effect, this one is no different, it cleverly mixes teen movie traits and scary movie conventions with a witty script filled with in-jokes, amusingly over-the-top gory kills, and much more to make you laugh and jump in equal measure, a fun horror comedy. Good!",Freaky
4,paul_haakonsen,This was such a wonderful surprise of a movie...,7,4 December 2020,"As I sat down to watch the 2020 movie titled ""Freaky"", I must admit that I wasn't really expecting the movie to be very outstanding or memorable. But still, it had Vince Vaughn in it, so chances were that it would be watchable.Turns out that ""Freaky"" was surprisingly good. This movie totally surprised me. I will say that the movie started out by having me thinking it was just a senseless rip-off of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, but that all changed - and for the better.The movie's storyline turned out to be one that brought suspense, comedy and thrills along with it, mixing the elements in a very enjoyable manner. I was genuinely entertained by what writers Michael Kennedy and Christopher Landon managed to deliver for ""Freaky"".Now, if you think ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""Friday the 13th"", then you actually have the result that is ""Freaky"". I kid you not! And it works out so very, very well. And yeah, a body-swap horror comedy done the way that director Christopher Landon did with ""Freaky"" just worked marvelously.I will say that Vince Vaughn definitely had nailed some iconic and classic Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees moves and mannerisms in the beginning of the movie, and he pulled it off so very well. But when the story progressed and The Butcher (played by Vince Vaughn) switched bodies with Millie (played by Kathryn Newton) the movie took a turn for the better, and it become absolutely splendid.And it should be said that there were so many nods towards established and well-known horror movies throughout the course of ""Freaky"", and that was just so much fun to pick up on.""Freaky"" was made so enjoyable and entertaining mostly by Vince Vaughn's performance as a teenage girl trapped in a hulking body of a mass murdered. There were just so many laughs to be had there, and his ways of delivering the dialogue, his expressions, his mannerisms and behavior all just came together so well for a very, very funny outcome.This was definitely a very good movie, and I can highly recommend that you sit down to watch it if you have the chance. My rating of ""Freaky"" is a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This movie was such a wonderful surprise.",Freaky
5,Quinoa1984,More good horror comedy times from Landon and Blumhouse,7,21 November 2020,"It finally crystalizes with Freaky, the latest in the kind of high concept genre cinema Hollywood used to release on the regular (with slightly higher budgets) from Christopher Landon following his two Happy Death Day movies that this filmmaker is a bit more rote when it comes to Horror than he is totally adept and a natural (or at least has a clever sensibility on the regular) as a comedy writer and director. He takes this concept we have seen so often - echoes of the obvious Freaky Friday, sure, and even for a couple of minutes Big, but I see a lot more of Face/Off once this teenage girl is embodied by a serial killer and that's as high a compliment I could think to grant - and uses his R rating for hilarious bloodshed, and then some (body parts do come apart at points) while taking the poss out of what it means to be a somewhat neglected/bullied teen girl... Or Vince Vaughn.Vaughn hasn't been this funny in (checks calendar, holy sheet man) 15 years, which is when Wedding Crashers gave him that opening ten minutes of raucous insanity with some other moments of inspired dialog. Here he commits completely to embodying this type, but also makes her human as well. And when Catherine Newton is swapped with this ""Blissfield Butcher"" (and of course the town is called Blissfield), she especially goes to town, perfects the Kubrick stare and gets to have fun being the violent psychotic type (who, you know, can get knocked around a lot being a teenage girl). Where Landon falters is with the casting and writing of Millie's co-patriots, who are (Patton Oswalt voice) GAY BEST FRIEEEND and sorta woke black girl, and in those brief but notable moments when it means to be more heartfelt (a scene between Butcher/Millie and the mother in a dressing room between doors is exoected) doesn't work as well as it should, which is where Death Day has the edge.Where it excels is as a self-conscious and knowing horror comedy, which occasionally goes for drawing out suspense and shocks and is by no means bad at it but nothing we haven't seen before (keen lighting for that, uh, haunted indoor mini-golf set, I think) and draws out giant belly laughs at the kinds of jokes and dialog and even physical comedy that logically has been done but is executed with enthusiasm and two very game performers. It'll be an ideal party movie for the teens of many stripes for a while and gives me more of what I'd want out of a Scream sequelboot than I know Ill get when the time comes.",Freaky
6,BandSAboutMovies,I had fun!,7,23 December 2020,"By all rights, I should hate this movie, a semi-remake of Freaky Friday that instead subverts the source material by turning it into a slasher. But you know, it ended up hitting me the right way and I was behind it pretty much all the way.Directed by Christopher Beau Landon - yes, the son of Michael - who wrote Disturbia - that's not even a word - and several of the Paranormal Activity movies before directing the Happy Death Day films. If you liked those, well, this will definitely give you more of what those movies offered, this is set in the same universe - Landon said that, ""They definitely share the same DNA and there's a good chance Millie and Tree will bump into each other someday"" - and was originally titled Freaky Friday the 13th.Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Big Little Lies) is a teenager who has been tormented by bullies, both of the teenager and teacher* varieties. Meanwhile, the urban legend of the Blissfield Butcher continues, as he keeps killing her classmates. Now that he possesses a McGuffin called La Dola - an ancient Mayan sacrificial dagger - he looks to gain even more power. But when he runs into our heroine - her mother (Katie Finneran, who is great in this) has left her behind at a football game where all she gets to do is wear a beaver mascot costume - she battles the Butcher and when he stabs her, they end up switching bodies.So yeah - this turns into a body swap comedy and you'd think, after the gory as hell open, this is where they lose you. But no - if anything, this gets way more fun.Millie's friends make for some of the best scenes in the film. Nyla (Celeste O'Connor) and Josh (Misha Osherovich) have been with her through the worst parts of high school, so having their best friend in the body of a killing machine is just another trial to be endured.Speaking of that killer, Vince Vaughn shines in this. There's plenty of silly physical comedy, but also some really nice scenes like when he admits to the love interest that she left the note he treasures (body swap pronouns are a little hard) or when he has a moment with her mother while hiding in a changing room.Landon - who wrote the movie along with Michael Kennedy - said that the film was influenced by the Scream series, along with Cherry Falls, Fright Night, Jennifer's Body, The Blob and Urban Legend. There's also a fair bit of Halloween in here, particularly the opening series of murders, and references to Heathers, Child's Play, Creepshow, Galaxy Quest, Carrie, The Faculty, The Craft and Supernatural. There's also a bottle down the throat kill that came directly from the 2009 slasher remake Sorority Row.I had fun with this. Here's hoping you do the same.*The funny thing is that the teacher that is the worst to her is Alan Ruck, who knows a thing about bring bullied, what with playing Cameron in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.",Freaky
7,CinemaSerf,Surprisingly entertaining...,7,14 September 2021,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought ""over my dead body""! Well I did go and see it, and aside from the fact that it's the least scary slasher/horror film I think I've yet to see, I did rather enjoy it. The premiss is that a young girl, firmly in the sights of a brutal serial killer is saved when a freak occurrence causes them to swap bodies and in best ""Flash Gordon"" tradition, they only have 24 hours to save... It does run a bit to stereotype, but both Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton have some fun and that is quite contagious in an asinine sort of manner. It is certainly no worse than many of Blumhouse's more recent - and ostensibly more serious - efforts, and the last ten minutes combine the tiniest element of jeopardy with some comedy and some slapstick (intentional or otherwise?) - enough to send you packing from the cinema pleasantly surprised - well it did for me, anyway...",Freaky
8,george.schmidt,Vaughn & Newton make a DynamicDuo having a field day in this fun mixed w/fear horror comedy in a perfect blend.,9,1 October 2021,"FREAKY (2020) ***1/2 Vince Vaughn, Kathryn Newton, Celeste O' Connor, Misha Osherovich, Emily Holder, Nicholas Stargel, Kelly Lamor Wilson. High concept horror comedy with serial killer Vaughn (having a field day) transposing his soul with that of a would-be victim, teen misfit Newton (ditto) when he attempts to kill her with a supernatural dagger that is cursed causing their transmogrification with the hitch begin they have 24 hours to reverse the process or be doomed in their new vessels. Filmmaker Christopher Landon (who co-wrote the sharply edged and sharp witted script with Michael Kennedy) transcends the slasher genre while embracing its tropes (the killer is rightbehindyou!) and infusing some truly heinous kills and LOL quips while balancing the gore with heart (often at the same time; a rare feat for a thriller). Fun and fear mixed perfectly together.",Freaky
9,neil-476,"Worth it for Vaughn alone, but great fun generally",8,16 July 2021,"After a masked killer savagely slaughters four teens, we meet high school teen Millie. Still recovering from her father's death (as are her mother and cop sister), she is a bit of a social outcast, picked on at school. She is stabbed, but not killed, by the psycho killer using a supernatural Aztec knife: this has the effect of switching them into each other's bodies. Millie only has 24 years to try to reverse things before it becomes permanent.After the inspired idea of turning Groundhog Day into a horror movie in Happy Death Day, the same people try the same idea with Freaky Friday. And, again, they are successful. In fact, as someone who sees so many films that I get blase about them, it is always a pleasure when a movie exceeds expectations, and this is a little gem.Its success is helped immeasurably by Vince Vaughn: to see this enormous man playing a diffident schoolgirl is priceless. He is very funny and entirely believable.There is some very graphic violence and some very bad language - it is a modern horror movie after all. But it has a good script, some heart, and it is often very funny. I really liked it.",Freaky
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Exceptionally enjoyable mainstream genre effort,10,8 May 2021,"After attending a homecoming game, a high-school student is confronted by the town's masked slasher and miraculously escapes, only to realize it was due to an ancient cursed dagger that allowed them to switch bodies and must convince her friends of the switch to stop the killer killing her classmates.This was a far better effort than it should've been. Among its better features is the strikingly fun and engaging setup that comes bout here. The idea of the killers' history and urban legend in the town serves as an impressive enough entrance point to get to the fateful swap which occurs rather nicely through the incantations associated with the dagger. There's a lot of fun associated with how they all come to terms with everything, from her glee at discovering being a teenage girl to his discomfort being a male and trying to convince her friends who he really is which leads to some genuinely hysterical comedy. This is all explored with the film's gleefully fun and rousing kill scenes. From the straightforward stalking and chasing found in the opening mansion attack to the ambushes towards the students and faculty at the school as they're unaware of her true identity, it has plenty to like about it. As the idea of them becoming aware of the swap and trying to help out with getting everything under control under the bizarre circumstances trying to ensure everyone is aware and trying to stop the killers' rampage, there's a nice bit of action and suspense involving getting into the finale. As well, there's also a lot to like with the film's theme of female empowerment through unexpected means. As she initially starts off as a shy and timid teenager and becomes a brash and seductive one while taken over by the killer, the fact that this causes her to become more open and forthright with her crush while in the serial killer's body is what brings them together. This whole aspect of the final half comes off rather well as the fight to stop the rampage brings them together by realizing their true feelings for each other which her to also work on her own self-confidence later on. It doesn't have much wrong with it and is really only in one area of the film. This is the finale, which seems to be entirely based around the slasher setup of the killer never being dead and returning for a final scene at the end. Frankly, it could've cut off everything at the crime scene and removed the family confronting him in the house which is cliched, adds nothing to the story overall and feels like an absolutely afterthought with the lack of motivation and absence of tension it demonstrates. This is really all that's really wrong with the film though.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underaged drinking and a clothed sex scene.",Freaky
11,deloudelouvain,Good enough to entertain me on a friday night.,7,7 January 2021,"You can't take Freaky too seriously. If that's what you're looking for in a movie then you should just pass on this one. But if you're just looking for some easy entertainment, mindless fun and some
gory scenes then Freaky is a good option. The story has a fast pace so you never get bored, the slashing scenes are funny, inventive and well made. As for the acting it was good from the whole cast. Vince Vaughn plays a character that I would not have expected him to play, and he did it well. Freaky is a good friday night popcorn slasher comedy.",Freaky
12,blanbrn,Far out and strange different film still good vice like entertainment!,5,25 November 2020,"""Freaky"" is one film that you might call a horror comedy parody like film still even for all of it's fun and joy it's pretty good entertainment. The story is simple as a local serial killer is on the loose known as the Butcher(in a role that Vince Vaughn hams up) killing young girls. Only something strange and different happens when he tries young and popular high school student Millie(Kathryn Newton). A change happens it's like a body switch a transformation happens between the two. The film is filled with plenty of slapstick it's like horror comedy at it's best still the blood and gore is present making a viewer feel like they are watching a classic teen slasher flick. Overall not the best type of film to be made still it's fun and tasty entertainment to dine on with the horror and comedy mix making it the ideal party feast!",Freaky
13,thesar-2,"Creepy, Sheaky and...",9,19 February 2021,"See? This is why I like to go in cold.Had I done that for the similarly toned and fun Happy Deathday, I would've even enjoyed that one more. (Though it's hard for me - to love it more. I DID love that Deathday movie...and even the sequel's not too bad...)I digress. I loved this movie and won't spoil a thing for you as I knew NOTHING except it was horror, comedy and had Vince Vaughn in it. Other than that, I read nothing, watched no trailers...and I was loving enjoying this film unravel before me without having to guess or wait for things to happen had I previously peaked at the synopsis, etc.What I will say: it's a great homage while including the latest teens out there and has fun/playtime but keeps this a SOLID and WELCOMED R-Rating. Please, I implore you: don't read anything about the plot or watch any reviews/trailers and just rent/buy/watch this fantastic horror-comedy that will soon rank high in my list of favorite recent horrors, if not for all time.That all said, it's not perfect and a tad long. Originally, I thought the end dragged since we previously had the climax. And although it was 100% clichéd, it was still very much fun and they made it their own here.If you liked The Final Girls, American Horror Story: 1984, Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil, Happy Deathday, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever, The Babysitter and/or Scream, you would, indeed, have as much fun here as I did.***Final thoughts: By the way, like The Final Girls, once the main attraction premise was revealed that I hadn't seen coming, I was like: DAMN...of course! LOL. Even though I LOVED the cold opening and was already onboard because of that, the birth of its focused idea all-but handcuffed me to the remaining minutes of the movie.",Freaky
14,FeastMode,they had something here,4,3 June 2021,"This movie was a rollercoaster. It starts with a great opening scene that sets up the tone. Then it dives hard into typical lame high school setting with numerous over-the-top cliches. Then it becomes really funny and very entertaining. Then it becomes really stupid and unfunny.Unfortunately that last parts spans basically the whole third act. I really liked the tone and was into the movie for a while. But i thought they made some terrible choices with regards to the script. And all the laughs were in the first half. Even worse, the latest attempts at humor are cringe-yi really wish it has a stronger third act. This is a basic premise taken in a new direction, and is done well at first. If executed better, i could have really liked it (1 viewing, 6/2/2021)",Freaky

16,Cineanalyst,Genre Swap,5,26 July 2021,"The gimmick seems obvious here: take a cool idea from another movie and make it into a slasher horror comedy. ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) becomes ""Happy Death Day"" (2017). ""Freaky Friday"" (adapted in 1976 and 2003) becomes ""Freaky."" Body swap via genre swap. The success of these Christopher Landon Blumhouse productions pretty much entirely rests upon whether one thinks that a promising high concept. It's not complicated; indeed, it rather reminds me of the movie-pitches gag in ""The Player"" (1992) that ludicrously proposed combining two very different movies--""Out of Africa"" meets ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Ghosts"" meets ""Manchurian Candidate."" Landon, then, it would seem pitched Jason Blum, ""Freaky Friday"" meets ""Friday the 13th."" Of course, there's a dash of gender-bender ""The Hot Chick"" (2002) here and of the better slashers such as ""Halloween"" (1978) there, but that's the gist of it.Even the locker poem here is plagiarized (Sara Teasdale, ""I Am Not Yours""). Perhaps not surprising for a filmmaker and studio that rose to prominence on the back of cribbing its gimmick from ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999), with the supposed-found-footage ""Paranormal Activity"" series. One of Landon's earlier scripts, ""Disturbia"" (2007), is a blatant ""Rear Window"" (1954) rip-off, too. Now, I've long ago accepted that in the postmodern age and especially with cinema nowadays clogged by franchise sequels and IP remakes and reboots that originality has largely become merely reworking other movies, but this is pushing it. Even that that's the ironic point of it all is a notion in horror pastiches at least as old as ""Scream"" (1996), but really probably older than that--a pastiche of a pastiche and so on, with irony stacked so thick that there doesn't seem to have been any original meaning to be ironic about.So, was it funny? Did we enjoy all the little nods and winks to other movies and making fun of tropes but using them anyways? Even politically-incorrect ""word police"" criticisms between a diverse trio of friends, the black and gay ones to the white female. Colorful, well blocked and scored gore that looks and sounds similar to the ""Happy Death Day"" movies--heaven forbid they every carry out the threat of them and ""Freaky"" being in the same so-called ""cinematic universe."" Sure, I admit I found some of it amusing. Watching a dead-eyed teenage blonde girl stabbing people remains more refreshingly ridiculous--although still not all that new, either, anymore--than the usual masked large silent adult male, and vise versa of a grown man acting like a female teen. Especially when that man is Vince Vaughn, who already played Norman Bates--in the 1998 remake, of course. The obligatory ""Freaky Friday"" style of the characters learning lessons from their body swaps is one-sided and desultory, though, as is the also-obligatory (apparently) romantic interest, the outrageousness of Vaughn making out in the back seat of a car with a supposed high-school boy aside. Most of all, though, now I'm just trying to think of other movies that might work as slasher comedies. The formula here seems to be to take something vaguely magical or sci-fi that's already been a comedy and done a few times. Hmm....",Freaky
17,westsideschl,Usual Dumb Escape Sequence,6,9 March 2021,"Positive: Comedy horror. Good screaming.
Neutral: The usual mind/body switch, but sorta well done this time.
Negatives: The usual bullying at school. Usual weird room with offbeat props & draped hanging plastic for cheap effect. Usual ugly face mask killer w/knife. Usual killing instruments of a hooked knife, chainsaw, tables, and just plain knives. Usual running to escape. Hide after a short distance and a few minutes then creep back out to be chased again.

18,The-Sarkologist,A New Take on the Slasher Film,8,28 November 2020,"There doesn't seem to be all that many movies around these days, and anyway, this one sort of looked interesting, if the blurb was anything to go by (though I didn't bother watching the trailer). It seemed different, but a part of me was a little worried at the beginning when it seemed to basically be another slasher flick. Well, it is sort of, but after the intro, I realised that this may not be the case. I guess it has something to do with the way the film is set up.It opens with four friends having a get together and all of the sudden they are killed one by one. This is why I was a little worried, though when I think about it, slasher flicks don't tend to open this way (though since I haven't watched many of them, namely because I don't like them, I can't say that I'm an expert). Anyway, it then cuts to this high-school girl who happens to be quite daggy, and hangs around with a couple of friends who are also quite daggy. We then follow her through a typical day and learn of the people that she has problems with.This sort of gave me the idea of who was actually going to die in the film, because yeah, it happens to be one of those films. Slasher flicks tend to have them killed one by one, however in this one we have three friends who are sort of outcasts, and when we are introduced to the bullies, we suddenly get an idea of where it is going. Oh, and they also have the bodyswap scene, which is the main motivator for the film - the serial killer becomes the girl, and the girl lands up in the body of the serial killer, and of course they only have a limited amount of time to switch back.Yeah, it's sort of different, though I'd have to say that it probably isn't the only bodyswap film out there. In fact I believe I have seen similar films previously, especially where we have a body swap (and I believe it is Hot Chick that I'm thinking of here). I do have to admit that swapping with a serial killer is sort of something different.Mind you, the thing that sort of got me was how this serial killer, once he landed up in the woman's body, somehow realised how to dress cool. Sure, it is a major factor in the film that overnight she goes from being a dag to being, well, this pretty awesome chick, however when you discover how the serial killer actually lives, it is sort of puzzling how he somehow knew how to make the woman look pretty awesome. In a way it sort of doesn't make sense, but then again this is a black comedy, and it sort of needed it to be like that for it to work.Yeah, it's actually pretty funny in parts, and I guess that I why I liked it. It is certainly a different take on your typical slasher film, and it certainly kept me entertained. Yeah, the scene in the car was pretty awesome, and the few people that were in the cinema found it pretty entertaining as well. Yeah, I liked it.",Freaky

20,UniqueParticle,Vince Vaughn as killer? Sold lol,10,25 July 2021,"Been meaning to watch Freaky for awhile being horror is my favorite genre, love the cast and the director glad it came on HBO! This movie is so much fun and refreshing. The story is very enjoyable where it's a horror version of Freaky Friday with touches of comedy mashed in. The Butchers mask is so awesome/cool looking which is another great aspect about the director kinda like Happy Death Day was very original at least with the mask. Kathryn Newton is perfect I love her in nearly anything! Thanks for appreciating my review to those that have!",Freaky
21,cruise01,Fun killer slasher thriller that has Vince Vaughn having fun with the role.,8,5 December 2020,"4 out of 5 stars.Freaky is a good comedy horror film which has lots of fun for a killer thriller. I think Christopher Landon may be on a roll with making killer thrillers and having lots of fun with the concepts. Like Happy Death Day having the main girl die in so many ways while attempting to stop the killer. Freaky being a freaky friday concept with a high school girl Millie (Kathryn Newton) who is struggling with a past in the family. And lacks the confidence in her social life. But when she comes across a killer known as the Butcher (Vince Vaughn). He uses some ancient artifact knife to stab Millie. And they both awaken the next day with swapped bodies. Millie being in Vince Vaughns body. And Butcher being in Kathryn Newtons body. Both actors had fun with there characters. Kathryn having a dark and sexy side. Which she lures her victims in. While Vince Vaughn enjoys playing as a high school girl. And on the fun side. Butcher is on the wanted list. So Millie and her friends are on the run from police. While trying to find Butcher and that knife to switch there bodies back.Fun concept and plot. It does add a little emotional connection with Millie. Who had a rough past and struggling emotionally. While she sees life in a different perspective as the Butchers body. It does lack the scares for a horror movie. But it does have some bloody fun thrills. The movie does have some humor added as well which has a few laughs.Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton did a great job. Celeste O Connor and Misha Osherovich were also great playing Millies closest friends.Overall, it is a thriller with lots of bloody fun. Great cast. Humor and fast energy for a killer thriller.",Freaky
22,eddie_baggins,A fun and silly Horror/Comedy mash-up,6,8 March 2021,"Blumhouse's latest high-concept horror/comedy hybrid Freaky has no right being as entertaining and even inventive as it is at times, as Happy Death Day director Christopher Landon and his having a blast cast enjoy this blood splattered version of Freaky Friday.There's nothing truly original about the film and it doesn't try to cover off any new ground in its body swapping concept but when you have a film such as this so self-aware of what it is and what it's trying to do, none of that matters with only those wanting to examine elements more than they need to be likely to be disappointed by this fast moving genre mashup.Wasting little time getting into things as an extremely over the top and insane blood filled opening (death by tennis racquet!) hits us right in the face, Freaky keeps up the pace as shy and quietly spoken high schooler Millie unfortunately finds herself becoming the latest victim of the Blissfield Butcher whose use of an ancient and mystical weapon sees the two souls swap bodies for some hilariously staged hijinks.While Big Little Lies star Kathryn Newton is fine in her role taking on duties as a devious killer, the real star of this show is a Vince Vaughan doing what he does best as the well over 6 foot tall man mountain does a great job at inhabiting the likeness of a teenage girl in a life and death game of cat and mouse and its the perfect dose of good dumb fun getting to watch the well-liked star doing such silly but enjoyable work.The film suffers badly whenever its more light-hearted and ridiculous moments take a back seat to odd moments of seriousness about loss and love and you do wish that the film had forgone any attempt to deliver any life lesson moments to instead focus purely on the fun it could have with the body swap situation done the way of a gory horror/comedy, while the films final almost tacked on 10 - 15 minutes feels as though it was a last minute rushed job but its not enough to stop Freaky from being one of 2020's more enjoyable thrill rides.Final Say -With a game cast and with a sense of playfulness occurring around its central concept, Freaky is a far better film than it had any right being even if its unlikely to be remembered for long once the credits have finished rolling.3 change room conversations out of 5",Freaky

25,gwnightscream,Pretty Good Horror/Slasher Comedy,6,10 February 2021,"This 2020 horror comedy stars Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton.
This tells about teenage girl, Millie (Newton) who becomes targeted by a serial killer, The Butcher (Vaughn), but when he tries stabbing her with an ancient, mystical dagger, they switch bodies. Millie tries to get back in her body within 24 hours or she'll be trapped in his forever.

26,jtindahouse,A mash-up of concepts that works pretty well due to some clever writing,8,10 December 2020,"I really like where Vince Vaughan's career has gone in later years. He was undoubtedly one of the funniest actors working in the business in his earlier years, but these days he's more than happy to show his versatility. Films like 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Brawl in Cell Block 99' and 'Arkansas' have benefitted so much because of his presence. Now a film like 'Freaky' comes along where he gets to play two characters, and does both masterfully. As a giant, menacing serial killer his is highly credible, and then playing a teenage girl in a giant's body he is hilarious to watch. This was a fun ride.The film starts with a truly great opening sequence. It was tense, funny, smart and creative. Not enough horror movies - or any genre of films to be fair - remember the importance of starting their films off with a bang. There are some extremely dumb characters decisions that are going to annoy some people, although at times the decisions almost seemed so dumb that the movie may have been parodying the genre. I'm not entirely sure about that one.'Freaky' is 'The Hot Chick' meets 'Freaky Friday' meets... pick any slasher horror movie you like. The concept was a lot of fun and the movie itself worked pretty well due to some smart writing and good casting. There's a lot to like here. My advice would be just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Freaky

And now have 24 hours to swap back before it become permanent.
Vince Vaughn plays his part quite we'll, one when where he is the killer, he got inspired a little off of Michael Myers(Halloween) and Jason Voorhees(Friday The 13th), and then when he's a teenage girl in a 6'5"" mans body, then he shifts from scary to funny like no problem,. Kathryn Newton is also great has the shy Millie, and also goes into a great shift when the killer enters her body, she sells it well with a cold eye stare. Supporting actors also really shine in there roles, the movie never tries to be something that it's not, if you loved both Happy Death Days, then I hope ya'll will give Freaky a look.",Freaky

It was much better than what I expected. I knew Vince Vaughn acting like a teenage girl would be worth the price of admission, but I didn't expect that Kathryn Newton as the girl - inhabited by Vaughn's serial killer - would also be brilliant.The movie is also consistently entertaining, with some decent kills, including somebody being cut down the middle, head first, by a bandsaw.I say check it out.",Freaky
29,stevendbeard,Horror/Comedy,8,14 November 2020,"I saw ""Freaky"", starring Vince Vaughn-Hacksaw Ridge, The Lost World:Jurassic Park; Kathryn Newton-Big Little Lies_tv, Blockers; Uriah Shelton-Girl Meets World_tv, The Glades_tv and Alan Ruck-Speed, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
This is a horror/comedy based on the 1972 Freaky Friday book written by Mary Rodgers-and also the Disney movies-and the movie is written & directed by Christopher Landon, who also did the Happy Death Day movies, Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones and The Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse. Vince plays a serial killer in the vein of Jason-he has a similar hockey style mask-that is terrorizing a town. Kathryn is a shy high school girl-no boyfriend, she dresses drably, doesn't comb her hair, but you can tell that she could be a popular girl if she worked at it-that is the latest target for Vince. In his latest kill_a_thon, Vince finds a knife that just happens to be cursed and he uses it on Kathryn. But, instead of killing her, it swaps their bodies, with him in her body and vice versa-that's where most of the comedy comes from. Through diligent research-and the help of a couple of her friends-Kathryn discovers that there is a time limit on when they can switch back or it becomes permanent. Uriah plays the boy that Kathryn likes-but she doesn't think he knows she exists-and Alan plays one of her teachers. It's not all fun and games though, the violence is pretty graphic-there is one scene in particular that shows her cutting a person in half with a table saw.
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, sexual content-no nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes. If you like these types of movies-horror/comedy-you should enjoy it. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Freaky

34,Pairic,Dark Fun,7,7 July 2021,"Freaky: Starts off with a pre-title sequence like your typical Slasher flick, four teens encounter a serial killer. But the Blissfield Butcher is more versatile than your average assassin, his prey are dispatched via bottle rammed down a throat, temples impaled by a tennis racquet, head battered in with a toilet seat lid and impaled on a wall by a spear. After that things get gruesome. Anyway a teen girl Millie switches bodies with the Blissfield Butcher, the McGuffin being an ancient Aztecan dagger which is cursed (naturally). Some good scenes with both appreciating the differences in their body strength, the now male Millie being able to bash a bully and the female Butcher finding it more difficult to subdue male victims. Some wry sub-textual commentary going on. Nevertheless, victims are subdued and eliminated some deserving it - especially predators bullies, another - a nasty girl didn't really deserve to be shoved into a cryogenic therapy chamber. Anyway people get bisected by a rotary saw, cut up with a chainsaw to mention a couple of murder methods. More dark comedy than horror despite the graphic violence. There's a subplot about Millie's mother which imo could have been excised allowing the film to come in at 90 minutes rather than it's 100 minute running time. An entertaining thriller though as Millie and her friends race to beat a deadline. Directed and Co-Written by Christopher Landon. 7/10.",Freaky
35,masonfisk,LOT OF BLOODY FUN...!,7,7 January 2021,"The recent body switch movie w/a murderous twist. A mass murderer has just plied his trade on a house full of partying teens & seems intent on causing more of a ruckus as the local school's dance is upon the town. We then focus to our heroine, played by Kathryn Newton (from Detective Pikachu), who lives in a estrogen heavy household (a lush of a mom trying to keep the family together after the death of her husband & her sister, a deputy on the police force, resentful of her mom & hoping to push Newton to be more assertive) & is the odd person out both at home & at school (her pair of friends are on the lower social strata of the institution) where she hopes to gain a scholarship to an out of state college & is the school mascot on the cheerleading team. Enter the aforementioned serial killer, now revealed to be Vince Vaughn, who descends on the school grounds (the football field to be exact) & attacks Newton (who's been ghosted by her drunk passed out mother for pick up) & tries to kill her managing to stab her w/a dagger (which he got from the opening carnage) in the shoulder but something happens (as if the gathering storm clouds didn't foretell it!) where their essences switch from one to the other so now Newton becomes the killer stalking the student body while Vaughn has to stop her (him?) after he convinces his best buds of what has happened. Directed w/the same off the wall slant he brought to the Happy Death Day movies, Christopher Landon (son of Michael), pitches the jokes & gore in equal measure never forgetting to let them organically mesh w/each other & other than an unnecessary coda, the movie is a bloody laugh riot. Also starring Alan Ruck (Cameron Frye from Ferris Bueller's Day Off) as an unctuous shop teacher.",Freaky
36,questl-18592,Freak Out,6,26 February 2021,"Freaky is another film by Christopher Landon wherein he takes an old idea and gives it a bloody, horror movie twist and I'm starting to get a little tired of the whole schtick. The Happy Death Day movies are fun, but they're fun primarily because Jessica Rothe is an inspiration in the role. She's perfectly cast for it and she brings a life to those performances that saves the whole thing. Unfortunately, for as much as I might like Vaughn and Newton, neither of them is really given the opportunity to make this their movie. This extends into the pacing of the film as well because it felt like it moved from point to point a little too quick for me rather than living in some of these moments and allowing there to be any sense of connection or tension building.Look, I'm all for taking a classic idea and giving it a genre shuffle but there needs to be more to it than this. I want this to be a good movie and I think it could have been, it's just not and that's frustrating as all get out. It's still a decent experience and a good enough popcorn flick, it's just not going to reach the same heights as some of the greats. Rather than going out and buying this now, wait until you can find it streaming somewhere cause I can't say this is worth paying for right now.",Freaky
37,aidanratesmovies,Freaky is a blast- Vaughn rocks this film,10,13 November 2020,"Although it may not be totally original, Freaky is an absolute blast, combining both horror and comedy geniously, as well as having many solid performances. First off, Vince Vaughn is fantastic in this film, in both parts. He provides a hilarious depiction of his female co-star, as well as proving to be an interesting and frightening killer. He is by far the films standout, and although the other actors are rather good as well, there is no doubt that Vaugn certainly had more to work with, there for more to do. It's a nice, fun change of pace from the typical oh so serious horror films we have received recently, an is truly entertaining all throughout. The beginning is a bit average, nothing too special, but I found myself kind of amazed at how well this plot worked in this film, and how well it was executed. The kills are creative and gruesome, the cinematography is often excellent, and the music is often rather fun as well- if not a bit expected. In the end, Freaky is a creepy little delight, that proves to be rather funny, as well as somewhat thrilling to watch at times. It has familiar moments, weaker moments, but it's a delightfully eccentric twist that is executed properly and very well. Certainly one I would be willing to watch again.

39,davidmvining,A disappointing genre mashup,4,29 March 2021,"There's appeal to the genre mashup. Two genres that rarely go together meshing together for perhaps the first time provides a sense of originality that's missing from many movies, especially when it comes to the genres at hand. Max Landis has made a screenwriting career out of this where Chronicle was the found footage movie and a superhero movie, American Ultra was a spy movie and a stoner comedy, and Bright was a fantasy movie and a cop movie. The director of Freaky, Christopher Landon, has done something similar in his short career as writer/director, most notably with Happy Death Day, which was a well-made and amusing combination of the serial killer movie with Groundhog Day. What made that movie work in its limited capacity was the film's strong focus on its main character's emotional journey through the genre mashup happenings she ended up caught in. Freaky uses some of the same conventions, combining the serial killer film with a body swap comedy out of the 80s (playing off the title of one of the most famous of them, Freaky Friday), but the script's emotional and character elements are deficient at best, dragging what starts as an amusing little slice of genre into unfocused and random storytelling beats that never come together.The film begins with a winking serial killer opening as four teens hang out in an empty mansion owned by one of their parents'. They all get murdered in inventive ways, and we see our killer, The Butcher. With knowing echoes of Michael Meyers in John Carpenter's Halloween, he's presented as a bulking presence of murder, played by Vince Vaughn. We then cut to Millie, a shy high schooler in the same town of Blissfield, as she goes about her typical day of school flanked by her best friends Celeste and Josh. Everything up to this point is fine. The opening with the killings is inventive and a decent introduction. The stuff is school is a little heavy-handed, especially when we get to Millie's shop teacher who's such an unrepentant little tyrant of no depth that we know, from the moment he first opens his mouth, that he's going to end up dead somehow.Then the body swap happens, and we see the movie's greatest strengths. The Butcher had stolen an old Aztec dagger (with Spanish written into it? Sure), and by stabbing Millie, left alone after a football game by her alcoholic mother with her older sheriff's deputy sister on the way to pick her up, but not killing her, a curse falls on them both where they switch bodies. She wakes up the next morning in his body, on a dirty mattress in the Old Mill, and he wakes up in her bed (fully made up, of course), and he slowly learns his position. The joys of this film really rest on the performances, most notably Vince Vaughn as the sixteen year old in a grown man's body (similar to Jack Black's fun in the Jumanji movies), and Kathryn Newton as the psychotic killer trapped in a teenage girl's body. Vaughn embraces the absurdity fully, flailing his hands around as he runs, pitching up his voice, and reacting to his new body with amusement. Newton's also a lot of fun as she stares off into space with a killer's gaze, realizing that she can move around the world without getting chased as a killer automatically. These joys are relatively short lived, though.The problem is really around Millie. She has, essentially, three different arcs that never really intersect. The first is about her father, who died a year before the action of the movie. Her mother is still in a deep state of depression, and Millie has become more reserved. The next is about her crush, Booker, that she had slipped a secret poem to sometime before (and is only revealed late in the film as a last second thing, undermining its effect at the time), sits next to in shop class, and mostly just mopes around hoping he'll notice her. The third is an unfocused desire to be stronger. All three little stories get their due, but they end up feeling almost like they're happening to separate characters. The death of her father feels unconnected from her crush on Booker which feels unconnected to her desire to be stronger. In fact, the stuff about her dead father ends up playing more with her mother, a very peripheral character, than with her.And I think that's the main source of my problems with the movie, there are too many characters given too much prominence. There's a complete lack of narrative focus, and it feels like a first draft rushed into production. Considering this was produced by Blumhouse Productions, it wouldn't surprise me if Jason Blum saw Landon's first draft and immediately greenlit the project. The script for Happy Death Day probably got more attention as Landon worked to find financial backers, the sort of time that he didn't need in order to sell Freaky. So, he had ideas that he hadn't quite ironed out, but before he could decide to cut characters and even arcs, he was behind the camera with Vince Vaughn playacting as a teenaged girl.There's also some plot mechanics that feel strange at best. There's an extended, okay-looking, action scene where Vaughn as Millie has to convince his two friends that he is who he says he is. It's fine with some amusing beats, but there's a point later in the film where Millie could do the same with her sister. The sister, the sheriff's deputy, is trying to get Millie in the Butcher's body into a prison cell, but Millie disarms the sister, throws her into the cell, and then runs off. Millie feels like there's a ticking clock, of course, because the Butcher just got away and is getting ready to kill again, but how long would it take to convince Millie's sister of the body swapping? Millie doesn't even try, and if she had succeeded, she would have had the sheriff's office on her side. Ultimately, nothing comes of the confrontation at all, like it was a half-thought out idea that never got the rewrite treatment it needed to become something more. And the back half of the film is just littered with this, as undeveloped ideas come to either nothing or unconvincing little conclusions that feel like they happen in isolation to everything around them.There's charm to the movie, of course. The acting is amusing. The concept is entertaining, especially when the Butcher in Millie's body realizes how weak he is and has to improvise to kill. However, there's just too much going off in too many directions for the movie to have the sort of focus it needs in order to provide Millie with the kind of emotional payoff the movie so obviously wants in the end. I was disappointed in the fractured, unfocused storytelling that marred an entertaining genre mashup.",Freaky
40,vengeance20,Not A Bad Slasher!,8,5 July 2021,"So I finally get to see Christopher Landon's newest Film Freaky! Was supposed to watch this last year on the 13th November, 2020, but Cinemas shut down again due to CoViD.The film follows Millie, a shy teenage girl who one night gets attacked by a serial killer known as ""The Butcher"" & ends up switching bodies with him via a stabbing by a mystical dagger. It is then Millie has only 24 hours before the body switch becomes permanent.I found the film to be pretty good! The concept mixing like with Happy Death Day was a good idea! It's a Freaky Friday meets Scream! Katheryn Newton was hot af in the film & the violence & deaths were gory as hell hence the high rating! The story was pretty good too & unique!My only annoyances were the wke lft under tones & snipes! I felt they were unnecessary & clearly a ploy to appeal to the generation of teens today! Moreover, the sexism & treatment of the male characters was off, the end climax was not only completely unneeded, but clearly a way to demonstrate female empowerment! When are filmmakers going top learn to leave that crap out!?But aside from those negatives, the film was pretty good & I think definitely worth a watch for Katheryn, it's unique concept & of course if you enjoyed Happy Death Day!8/10.",Freaky
41,arungeorge13,Vince Vaughn is the best thing about this teen slasher! [+63%],6,5 December 2020,"I guessed I enjoyed Freaky more than I was supposed to. And that's mostly due to Vince Vaughn, who rises above the mundane script, adding little comedic touches of his own. Otherwise, this is a straightforward teen slasher that comes bundled with its modern clichés. Vince Vaughn is an actor who has played tougher roles of late (especially in the Craig S Zahler films), but one who hasn't forgotten what he's incredibly good at. He plays serial killer 'The Butcher' (à la Jason Voorhees, minus the texture) who switches bodies with a reserved 17-year-old high-schooler named Millie (Kathryn Newton).Millie's backstory is a complete 'seen-that-before', replete with a dead dad angle, a cop sister and a mostly drunk but caring mother. Her friends, one black and the other gay, round up the character sketches. Things only get interesting when Millie and The Butcher switch bodies. For more than half the film, Vince plays a teenage girl and generates the loudest laughs. Newton, on the other hand, doesn't have much to do except alternating between foxy and vicious. So, this clearly isn't her film (performance-wise) though she's compensated with some pretty fun kill-scenes.This is as good a throwback teen slasher as it can get - nonsensical, entertaining, and downright gory. However, Freaky also feels like this toned down high-school romance hiding quietly under its slasher layers. Yes, there are jarring tonal disparities but if there's one thing holding it all together, it's the sheer delight of seeing Vince prance around like a teenager. Also, Vince's version of Millie is a lot more buoyant and chatty. I'd say this is a good thing even if it slightly messes with film's continuity. The extended climax is what made me cut half a star because it felt completely unnecessary. Nonetheless, you'll certainly be entertained by most of what Freaky has to offer.",Freaky
42,rivertam26,Bloody good fun,8,13 November 2020,"Christopher Landon of Happy Death Day gives us the horror version of Freaky Friday in this clever genre mashup. Vince Vaughn in his best comedic role since Wedding Crashers plays a campy serial killer with a wooden mask and a bunch of weapons that likes to murder teens in increasingly goretastic ways. The movie is fun but and I mean this in the best way it feels like a Disney horror flick. It has a big heart and a bunch of comedy that mostly hits. Katherine Newton is okay in the lead. She's engaging when she's Millie but as the killer she's just not believable. That being said the film is filled with colorful characters, stylish cinematography and a sense of fun. It never quite reaches the potential it promises but it's a bloody good time nonetheless.****/5

43,Pumpkin_Man,A Fun Bloody Body-Swapping Blast!!!,10,14 November 2020,"I absolutely love body-swapping comedies, such as Freaky Friday and The Hot Chick. I also absolutely love horror slashers like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Scream. To combine these different genres was a dream come true. I'm glad it's getting such positive reviews. It deserves it. Kathryn Newton was great and so fun to watch her go from a sweet shy vulnerable high school girl named Millie, to bloodthirsty serial killer. Vince Vaughn was great too. It was also fun to see him as an evil killer, turn into Millie and acting like a teenaged girl. The gore and killings were awesome and brutal.Millie Kessler is an average high school girl. Her family is going through a tragedy because of her father dying a year ago. She gets picked on by her peers and even the teachers. The night before the Homecoming dance, she's sitting in the parking lot and the Blissfield Butcher begins to attack her. He stabs her with an ancient Aztec dagger that he stole and that makes them switch bodies.On Friday the 13th, the Butcher wakes up as Millie in her girly bedroom, and Millie wakes up as the Butcher in his gory grotesque lair. Millie must convince her friends that it's her in the killer's body and switch bodies back in 24 hours, or the switch becomes permanent. Throughout the day, the Butcher in Millie's body goes on a bloody rampage. It's so fun to watch. If you love body swapping comedies, and gory horror slashers, I would definitely recommend FREAKY!!!",Freaky

45,Sergiodave,A fun horror,7,8 December 2020,"The latest horror movie from Blumhouse is better than a lot of their previous movies, primarily due to Vince Vaughn who is better playing a teenage girl than most half his age.

Realistically though, it really isn't that great. Vince Vaughn is doing a good job, but that's pretty much it. Otherwise it's your basic horror/scary/comedy mashup with nothing all that original. So in the right conditions with some friends, turn your brain off and just let it happen.",Freaky
47,gedikreverdi,Freaky Friday meets Scream,9,5 December 2020,"The opening scene was awesome. The boy killed by a bottle in the mouth reminded me of sorority row remake and the final girl of the opening scene gets out of the secret closet and runs for her parents coming home and got killed the last minute. That was very similar to the opening scene of scream. Then the butcher steals a mystical dagger from the house. Millie the timid girl waits for her mom in front of the school but she fell asleep drunk. The butcher shows up and stabs her and the bodies swap. Both woke up startled. After a long fight at the school Millie's best friends josh and Nyla convinced of him being Mille when he danced the way mascot of the football team dances. They ran away the police after them with the tiny car and found refuge in a discount clothing shop where Millie's mom works.It was really funny when Millie in the body of the butcher was asked out by his mom for a coffee when he was hiding in the Changing cabin while running away from his police officer older sister. Millie killed the bully teacher by a electric saw and froze to death the gossip girl. She was somehow taking revenge on the bullies. Then they captured her and tied up in a chair in the house of josh. And goes out to steal the dagger from the station. Josh's mom comes back home earlier and the scene was really fun when he said he was straight and the mom was doubting that more than anything. And the butcher untied herself and came after them. They then escaped home and met at the police station. Millie takes the police car and heads for the old mill where the party's taking place. He kills 3 bullies there and again with a chainsaw one of them. And a boy hitting on josh and bullying him. They somehow capture Millie before it's too late and stab him to get her body back. The police shot the killer after that but he wasn't dead and at this point I was hopeful about a sequel. But at the last scene the butcher came after Millie to her house and fought three of them until Millie gets to stab him with a log right in the chest like he were a vampire.
Vince Vaughn was the best thing about this movie. He acted flawless as a teenage girl when he read the poem to her crush to convince him and when they flirted at the back seat while waiting for the others at the police station. I'd like to see him more in slashers like this.",Freaky
48,IonicBreezeMachine,Vince Vaughn's performance that captures the comedy and horror carries a somewhat messy slasher effort.,6,21 March 2021,"Set in Blissfield during a killing spree by The Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughn), the movie follows Millie (Kathryn Newton) a meek and timid high school girl dealing with an Alcoholic mother and an emotionally distant sister while dealing with the casual cruelty from both staff and students at High School. When a chance encounter between the Butcher and Millie results in Millie being stabbed with a dagger called La Dola, the following morning finds Millie and the Butcher have traded bodies. Now with only 24 Hours to shift back before the change becomes permanant Millie must try to evade authorities and convince her friends of her true identity before the Butcher can continue his rampage in Millie's body.Directed and co written by Christopher Landon of the Happy Death Day films, Freaky is Landon's attempt to merge the slasher genre with the old staple of the Body Swap premise. While the movie is anchored by a strong performance by Vince Vaughn playing both a vicious killer and our teenage heroine, Landon struggles to merge the slasher and body swap concepts with the same level of success of time loop/travel and slashers in his happy death day films.In the movie Kathryn Newton is supposed to start off as this meek introverted high school student and in the opening setup I really didn't buy it, while the filmmakers try to downplay her looks for contrast in later scenes it just doesn't feel all that authentic. The movie's opening is very mixed. While Landon is unburdened by the PG-13 rating that held his Happy Death Day films from going full force and allows for some nice gore shots in both the opening and the later parts of the movie, the movie has similar problems to many modern day slasher films where the opening ""developments"" are basically used for establishing unlikable characters you know are going to die so it takes away from the shock factor. A lot of the opening is played fairly over the top as well with characters playing up their dumb jock, mean girl, or alcoholic traits that feel like they should've been dialed back a bit more to allow for some of the craziness of the premise to shine through more than it does.While the opening is very shaky, the movie really finds its footing once the body swap takes place around the half hour mark. Vince Vaughn is a lot of fun playing a teenage girl in a grown mans body, and while it's not quite on the level of when Jack Black did it in Jumanji, it's still a really solid performance that reminds us how versatile an actor Vaughn can be. The movie has a lot of fun with Kathryn Newton playing a slasher who excels during this part of the movie gleefully disemboweling the kill fodder with nice gore work to boot. Intermixed with the kill and comedy scenes, there's also a surprising number of sweet character moments that don't go for cheap comic shots such as a moment where Millie gets to confess her feelings to longtime crush Booker played by Uriah Shelton, and the filmmakers despite the dangling opportunities don't go for any lowbrow jokes or things of a similar nature and allow the scene to play out as a solid character moment, but do get some humor from the fact the body has killed people and has yellow teeth.Freaky doesn't quite reach the benchmark Landon set for himself with the first Happy Death Day, but Freaky is still a solid slasher comedy with entertaining kills and genuinely decent humor and heart after a rather shaky setup from which it manages to recover.",Freaky

Here a serial killer and your typical loser high school girl swap places.
It's a cute idea.The core of this movie is the swap element and Kathryn Newton and Vince Vaughn are more than good enough to sell it.
Vince Vaughn has experience of this pastiche type of acting and Kathryn Newton pulled off the Terminator coldness with style.The horror/slasher element is pretty much as good as it gets.
It would have been interesting if they could have played off the killers ability to trick and surprise his victims using his new body a little more but it was nice they didn't go overboard with it.I think this was a bold and interesting move (I am not sure what the area in the middle of a venn diagram that consists of ""Freaky Friday"" and ""Friday the 13th"" fans looks like but I imagine it isn't huge) and I enjoyed it.At the end of the day this is a slasher movie and includes all the silliness that the genre brings - but that is fine by me.",Freaky

The movie stars the notable actor Vince Vaughn(The Cell 2000), who does a thoroughly professional acting job of a difficult character. Kathryn Newton is the other main actor of the film and she does her role with the same professional attitude.The movie is a slasher with a supernatural twist. It is quite well-paced and will hold your attention for the opening thirty minutes or so after which it begins to get slightly boring then picks up the pace again.

The screenwriters played it cautiously. We get jokes from Kathryn Newton character in Vaughn body peeing in the restroom with a peepee. But no jokes from Vince Vaughn character in Newton's body with a vag; double standard or tabou?

Happy Death Day,
Big.You get this slasher / horror / comedy, sound good?Actually the slasher theme isn't too bad with a very sick in the head killer walking around killing people for fun in some nasty ways, both as a male and female, yes read on.The comedy element for me was just not funny especially as Vince Vaughn is literally camping it up.Ok now to the nitty gritty, basically the killers mind gets transferred into a teenage girls body and visa versa, so the teenage girl is running around looking like the killer and the killer has become the teenage girl by the power of a magic dagger.I know this is just the start of the sillyness there is more to come in the film.One very interesting part was the whole concept of male and female and how each treat each other also throwing in a gay character, I actually found this more interesting in places than the film itself.Such a shame because this could and should have been a lot more than we got, it's basically a light hearted teen smashed but it could have dropped the whole comedy and concentrated on sexuality, gender stereotypes and slasher elements then this could have been an epic movie which for me was just lost.Ok to watch if you find it on TV.Rating 6 out of 10",Freaky
55,abisio,Another good Blum House movie but leave you wanting more,8,16 November 2020,"Blum House has successfully refreshed the horror genre several times with good ideas and more irreverent tone. The recent box office success like Happy Death Day, its follow up or Invisible Man shows that you still get good mileage of the classics with some imagination.
Freaky is basically a version of Freaky Friday but this time the body exchange is between a very insecure and shy student and a violent serial killer.
The prologue of the movie is quite promising for slasher films fans. Four young persons are killed in very violent way. The killer gets away with a sacrificial dagger by mistake with some magic characteristics. Vince Vaughn is the killer and is really terrifying in those first scenes.
Then enters Kathryn Newton; the shy adolescent who after a failed attempt by the psycho swaps bodies with the killer.
Sounds interesting ? And funny ?. Well it really is; and Vaughn is excellent as the killer and is even better and lots of fun as the adolescent girl. Sadly Newton is not near as convincing and/or good in any of the parts.
The rest of the cast is decent but cliched. The gay and the black friend, the controlling mother, the school bullies, etc.
While the first four death are fine, set setup and the middle of the movie lags with unnecessary sentimental dialogs and stupid actions/decisions. The third act and epilogue recover the pace; but you keep waiting for more deaths and / or more comedy or perhaps both.
In brief; entertaining but not as fun as Happy Death Day",Freaky
56,bob-the-movie-man,"No, not like the Disney version",5,3 July 2021,"Some B-movies really pack a much bigger punch than you would expect. ""Nobody"" is a perfect recent example. But movie karma needs to be balanced with something!Positives:
If you are into your ""teen slasher"" movies, then this is more of the same and features some innovative ways to dispatch the victims. One is certainly no way to treat a fine wine!Vince Vaughn has fun mincing around as his alter-ego and Kathryn Newton (soon to be in the next ""Ant-Man"" movie) is personable enough as the cutie-cum-serial-killer.It's always good to see Ferris-actor Alan Ruck on the big screen. Here, he actually plays two parts in the film. (This joke (C) One Mann's Movies.)Negatives:
It's flagged as ""comedy/horror"" but failed to meet my personal 6-laugh test. It's just not funny enough to pass muster unless, that is, you view crude dialogue as ""funny"". And the dialogue does get ickily crude at some points. For example, when evil-Millie ends up alone with three jocks, there's a line of misogynist dialogue (that I won't repeat) but which sets the level.As a Blumhouse production, the horror is ultra-gory which will put off many viewers lacking a strong stomach. But because of the associated black comedy, the horror isn't remotely tense or scary. This might be why the film only got a UK-15 certificate. But my personal view is that, with the violence and the offensive dialogue, the BBFC under called this one, and it should have been an 18.There's a lot of schmaltz layered on regarding the relationship between Millie and her mum (Katie Finneran, channelling a Laura Dern look). A store cubicle exchange between Finneran and Vaughn is particularly stomach-churning.The movie leaves logic at the door many times. A formulaic post-finale ending assumes a superhero ability to shrug off bullets.Summary Thoughts on ""Freaky"": The 'body-swap idea has gone through dozens of movie versions, with Disney's ""Freaky Friday"" the most well known: it's actually had two outings, once in 1976 with a young Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris and again in 2003 with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie-Lee Curtis. (The latter is a firm Mann-family favourite).This new version tries a serial-killer twist on the story, which is a good idea. But, in my view, the movie fails to execute well on the concept. The director is Christopher Landon who did the ""Happy Death Day"" movies. This is in a similar vein. So I'm quite happy to concede that, for the target audience of teens who enjoy those types of flicks, they might get a fun Saturday night out with this. But, for me, this fell between the stools of comedy and horror and is instantly forgettable.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or Tiktok (@onemannsmovies).

63,CANpatbuck3664,Freaky Ultimately Slays its Victims but I Wanted Something More to Push it Over the Top,7,5 February 2021,"Body swap comedies have been around for decades with varied degrees of merit and success. It was both intriguing and pleasantly nostalgic to see someone trying to rework the formula in a new genre. Much like cinematic time travel, if its not thought out or properly tweaked, including that kind of plot device can be an invitation for audience nitpicking. Freaky is a throwback, there's a bare bones explanation and minus some exposition, you're expected to come along and not ask questions. This was a free spirited decision by the screenwriting team but it didn't bog me down or ruin the movie. If the movie is doing its job, you shouldn't be focusing on that and there are movies come out all the time where the explanation is ""magic?"" (Freaky Friday comes to mind but so does BIG). They do just enough to propel the story and it was silly enough to avoid too many specific questions.With Freaky firmly being a horror/comedy does it deliver the goods on what you're looking for? We get to both almost immediately as the beginning moments of the film are also the best for me. The introduction of the killer has some brutal kills and pretty funny bits wrapped together. It sets up the tone for the rest of the film and moving ahead, you know what you're getting. While the more meta material fades to the back, Christopher Landon and his team are trying to have their cake and eat it too. They try to make an actual slasher movie while lampooning it at the same time. Freaky doesn't always gel as the best in this genre do but there are more than enough funny jokes and violent deaths to satisfy fans of slasher movies and horror/comedies.The biggest draw for this movie other than the twist on a familiar premise is Vince Vaughn playing the co-lead. He's a funny comedian and a surprisingly talented dramatic actor but he's been in need of a career reboot for years. He was on a roll for years but the hits are fewer and farther between now. I think he's solid at pretending to be a frantic teenage girl but he was still a little too restrained. Millie is such a door mouse that despite Vaughn talking like a teenager, I thought he was still too composed. I tip my hat to him for taking on this role but he wasn't a totally seamless fit. Kathryn Newton was a lot of fun after Millie makes her switch but he's undercut by Millie's earlier scenes as well. Her being meek almost makes up her entire character, her sidekicks/friends/ family have a lot more personality. That being said, after the switch, she plays off the extreme moments with a nice wink and a nod. Celeste O'Connor and Misha Osherovich jump back and forth between portraying their respective stereotypes and instead parodying those same stereotypes. But they each had funny moments and decent comedic timing and they play off of Vince pretty well.Freaky is decent overall and provides the requisite laughs and thrills but I was still a little let down. I'm a big fan of Landon, check out my reviews for Happy Death Day and its sequel 2U. So I went in ready to hand this movie extra points and it just never wowed me or got to that next level. I was hoping for more specific references or pointed dialogue to how ridiculous slasher movies can be but that's not the direction they wanted to go. Props to Newton and Vaughn for embracing the silliness of the premise and committing to the bit and I'll admit that I did laugh enough to make Freaky worthwhile. If you love a body swap movie and wouldn't mind a horror twist on it, I'd give it a 6.5/10 and Freaky can be checked out on your preferred streaming service.",Freaky

69,dfle3,"Freaky: Gory, absurd, amusing slasher-comedy. 70%",7,19 November 2020,"A high-concept film combining elements of films like ""Freaky Friday"", ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Scream"", ""Freaky"" is entertaining enough for people who don't mind the mingling of disparate genres. If you don't like taking liberties with genres, well, then, for a family friendly comedic Disney film, see the original ""Freaky Friday"", which starred a very young Jodie Foster (15 years old). For a straight horror film see ""Friday the 13th"". ""Scream"" is a self-aware slasher film which had fun with the genre and its tropes.For fans of slasher slash horror films, ""Freaky"" is par for the course as far as the gore goes for MA 15+ films. The plot involves two people unintentionally swapping bodies: a middle-aged man who is a serial killer (played by Vince Vaughn) and a teenage high school girl (""Millie"", played by Kathryn Newton). I can't say that ""Freaky Friday"" started off that genre of story but it's where I first came across it as a child, watching rental videos. Now, obviously, you're wondering how on Earth two people can swap bodies. You're overthinking things! Just go with it!The film is amusing enough in the comedy department. Can you imagine a cute teenage girl trying to be a serial killer? Absurd, right? Well...not as sublimely ridiculous as an even younger ""Hit-Girl"" (played by Chloë Grace Moretz when she was 12 years old) in the gloriously violent superhero film ""Kick-Ass"". When ""Freaky"" is not being bloody or sexual (sex scenes are minimal in this film but there is sexual talk and moments of sexual menace), it does later come across as a comedic Disney action film.The only person whose name I knew in the cast was Vince Vaughn, which I knew for his work in comedy films (right now I can't think of a film that I've seen with him in it but I'm not a film nerd). I can't say that I could have come up with his name to star in a film in which he plays a serial killer whose body is inhabited by a teenage girl. However, if someone had mentioned his name I'm sure that I would gone along with it as an appropriate choice. It's hard to say what names that I would have come up with for this role. Steve Carrell, perhaps, though he is terminally short and one scene would have been weakened with a short man doing it (the scene with Vince and a teenage boy in a shower room at high school).Whilst you get scenes of bloody horror, you do get meta humour and sociological satire. Millie is not a stereotypical teenage girl like you see in Hollywood films. She's attractive but bland, like her female best friend, Nyla (played by Celeste O'Connor). Her male best friend, Josh (played by Misher Osherovich) is gay and sassy and is the most interesting of the three of them. He comes up with some of the meta humour and sociological observations in the film.""Freaky"" is not a film that takes itself seriously but that being said, it does its mocking with a straight face. Vince Vaughn perhaps best exemplifies that. Playing a teenage girl, he is almost subtle with it. He doesn't over-egg the pudding of his performance. In fact, there is a really 'interesting' scene with his character in the back seat of a car with a teenage boy who Millie has a crush on. The two actors in this scene must know how absurd the film is at this point but they bravely push on. Vince could quite possibly earn an Academy Award for Best Actor just for this scene!I don't know if there are plans for any sequels to this film, turning it into a franchise. That being said, if they do plan sequels, I'd be surprised if they surprised me with what direction they wanted to take things. I've seen the first few ""Friday the 13th"" films and I've casually read about some of the further sequels its spawned. It's hard to imagine any sequels to ""Freaky"" breaking new ground, whatever direction they wanted to take things. On the topic of being predictable and I don't mean this in a negative sense, I could tell what was going to happen at the climax of a scene where Millie is trying to regain her body from the serial killer. I feel pleased with myself for having being able to recall the scene which presaged that moment. Maybe I should rewatch that scene though to make sure that it makes sense and there are no plot holes in it.Before I forget, there must be some dark wish-fulfilment occurring in this film. I don't have a degree in English Literature, so I can't posit in detailed terms Freudian notions of transference or whatever but I do have to observe that the choice of murder victims is well set up and you could theorise notions of dark desires, displacement, transference or schizophrenia in these choices. To be more transparent about what I'm saying, I'm suggesting that these are the kind of everyday choices that ordinary people might fantasise about after a bad experience with someone.Lastly, I do have to mention some plot holes...or just self-aware absurdities created for the film. Firstly, the first murder committed by the serial killer in their new guise...and what, exactly, was that device doing in a high school changing room? Secondly, how, exactly, was the serial killer able to continue on, after the 'resolution' to the body swap issue after they'd been......with regards to that second plot hole, that pretty much seems a bog standard scenario for those slasher films where the killer is like the ones in ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"".Oh, the score for the end credits reminded me of the theme from the film ""Jaws"".",Freaky
70,ethanbresnett,This film is an absolute blast!,7,2 July 2021,"This film was built for pure entertainment purposes and it delivered me pure entertainment!Much like the Happy Death Day films also by Christopher Landon, Freaky has a tongue in cheek central premise, a tongue in cheek tone and style, and has a decently engaging if predictable plot. It won't set the world of horror alight, nor will it the world of comedy, but it manages to blend the two genres in an enjoyable fashion that makes for a very fun watch.Vince Vaughn was the clear highlight of this film and could not have played the part better. I think with a different actor the concept may have fallen apart, but thanks to Vince it could not have worked out better. Kathryn Newton was also great, conveying the steely and sinister persona of a serial killer flawlessly.In terms of the plot it was all very fun, well paced and with a good script. I do think more comedy could have been extracted from the body swap situation, and the horror elements could have been a bit more suspenseful and amped up. It was all perfectly good, with some particularly gory and graphic murder scenes, but it all felt relatively familiar and the overarching plot was decidedly predictable. Not that this detracted from the entertainment in any way.If you love all the body swapping laughs of Freaky Friday and all the slashy horror gore of Halloween then look no further than Freaky for a very enjoyable watch!",Freaky
71,midnitepantera,Fun horror twist on Freaky Friday :o,6,20 December 2020,"Vince Vaughn was hilarious playing a teen girl. It would be a horror to be a teen girl and be trapped in an old dudes body! Ha hahaha Overall, fun pop-corn movie with some blood and gore, but not overkill (no pun intended). More of a teen movie similar to The Babysitter (decent little flick). But much better than The Babysitter 2, which was horrible.",Freaky

The end result though...I was a little disappointed. It could have been funnier. Don't get me wrong, I still love Vince Vaughn...and him playing a teenage girl was hysterical.Lots of gratuitous gore and some poking fun of political correctness...like gender pronouns, excellent slasher film moments at the end, but overall it left me a little flat.Worth seeing, but don't set the bar too high.This is a slasher film take on the original teen film Freaky Friday (I liked the proposed title of Freaky Friday The 13th! That tells you everything you need to know in the title!!!!), with a teenager and in this case a serial killer switching bodies. Great idea for a twist on a classic.",Freaky
73,SnobReviews,A ton of bloody fun.,6,8 December 2020,"Bloody fun and often hilarious; ""Freaky"" is the rare instance that comedy and horror can come together and take you a wild ride.In the slasher-comedy, after swapping bodies with a serial killer, a young girl in high school discovers she has less than 24 hours before the change becomes permanent.Featuring an A+ performance from Vince Vaughn, ""Freaky"" is a non-stop violent and funny flick that kept me entertained for nearly two hours. It's definitely predictable and not perfect but this is the perfect film to stream on a weekend with pizza. I had a great time and seriously wanted more. Kathryn Newton is also really good and looking forward to seeing in upcoming roles. A gender-bending twist on ""Freaky Friday"", the film will leave you satisfied and is definitely worth... the stab.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!",Freaky
74,daisukereds,"Kathryn Newton is great, Vince is not",5,28 January 2021,"Had low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. Still, this movie isn't memorable or warrant a repeat viewing.
The story plot is.. curious, or the take on it is. There's little you can do to spice a generic slasher story, and while this doesn't really break new ground, it is all in execution and presentation. The way scenes are shot, sound editing and music choices, characters in general and the delivery and content of most* lines. In general, it elevated the simplistic concept behind the script.Kathryn Newton is really good! The friends are likeable too (I'm personally out of touch with teenagers, but these ones seemed annoyingly accurate to stereotypes and generic ones). Señora Cayenes was a nice character (for her brief appearance), and the mom is written in an interesting way.. she useless, but ""her incompetence doesn't linger"". She actually had more writing about her than I would expect in a different movie. I guess (in a good way), it doesn't distract you from the plot of the movie.Everything about this movie is uplifting (in a way) and made me enjoy it more than I should have.. until Vince Vaughn is on screen, that is*. There was no way he would be able to pull it off.. not many can, specially not a girl. Can't really recommend it because of him, and BARELY goes over the 5 mark for me in spite of his delivery and lines. What really ties it up is the ending. That was actually good.Still, it is a gore-y movie at times, so don't forget that.",Freaky

Overall rating 77/100Freaky is about A young girl in high school who, after switching bodies with a deranged serial killer discovers she has less than 24 hours before the change becomes permanent. I had such a fun time with Freaky, but there were a few things that held It back from reaching its full potential.My first few positives would be the effective gore and great kills. The great over the top slasher tone, as well as the humour and fun dynamic between the two main characters. This movies slasher moments were excellent. The gore was over the top and used very effectively to add impact to the scenes, it was the kind of over-the-top fun you can expect from this kind of genre, the kills were also very creative. I felt like the kills were actually different and fresh compared to other slashers and didn't go for conventional generic kills which was nice to watch. I loved this film a lot when it had its over-the-top slasher tone, I personally didn't think this stayed consistent throughout (more on that later) it never treated itself too seriously and I respected that about the film, it made my enjoyment level so much higher for it, and the little attention to detail in the soundtrack and even the font of the writing for the change of days was so much fun. I also thought the film was absolutely hilarious. The amount of clever and well-timed humour they could get out of two completely opposite people switching bodies was excellently executed. The dynamic between Millie (Kathryn Newton) and The Butcher (Vince Vaughn) was fantastic and there were constant laugh out loud moments. It was a clever idea that was very well executed and was refreshing to watch.My next few positives would be the fantastic cast. The excellent cinematography, the great set up for the main plot point. As well as the development to the plot and the great representation. The Whole cast here did a fantastic job. Everyone had fantastic chemistry and excellent comedic timing. Vince Vaughn was brilliant, and it was nice to see him back in a leading comedic role again. His timing and delivery were excellent, he didn't hold back which was amazing to watch. But also, Kathryn Newton did a fantastic job here, both her serious and comedic acting was brilliant, and I think she has a bright future ahead of her. Other key standouts for me were Celeste O'Connor, Misha Osherovich and Uriah Shelton who all did a fantastic job and had loads of charm to their performances, hopefully they get some more work out of this. The cinematography was also excellent, considering the small five million budget, the visuals were extremely strong, and they made the most out of the limited budget they had. With particularly excellent usage of colour and CGI. I loved the set up for the main plot point of the body swap, it was set up in the way of a classic slasher with a chase and dwas incredibly fun to watch and well executed. It set up the tone for the film as a whole and served its purpose well. I also loved the development to the plot, it never once got boring, keeping you entertained at a nice fast pace with good character development and strong twists to keep you invested. Finally, I also thought that the movie handled its representation of LGBTQ and black characters within horror very well, Both Celeste and Misha were very strong supporting cast members that actually served a lot to the plot and the main characters, also cleverly playing on the joke of these types of characters being underrepresented or killed early in horror films, this was cleverly done and refreshing to see.However, there was a far few negatives that for me, held the film back from reaching its full potential. There was a fair amount of genre tropes, a lazy set up and some very forced conflict. For me, despite some refreshing twists on genre tropes, the film still couldn't escape a lot of them. Especially with the main character, she fitted into the stereotypical high school outsider for this kind of film, and a lot of character decisions were very predictable and generic that made the more refreshing moments and creative decisions have slightly less impact. The conflict at Millie at her school just felt forced and it was never really explained or developed properly, so it felt unneeded and once again fell into genre tropes that could have been avoided. I also thought the set up was very lazily done, having Millie being stuck at her school and straight away and not to make the sensible decision to go home with her friends was silly to me. It felt lazily written which most of this film wasn't and could have been handled much better.My final few negatives would be the tonal imbalance, the lack of emotional connection and the unneeded ending. The film never fully managed to balance its horror and its comedy. It felt imbalanced far too often throughout the film. It started off strong as a horror/slasher and then as soon as the comedy came into play the film struggled to find a good balance. And for me there wasn't enough kills and horror elements throughout, therefore I found myself enjoying it and viewed it more as a comedy. I also found myself emotionally disconnected from the film. Whilst appreciating the development and the film adding more depth to Millie and her family it wasn't needed for this type of film. I think trying to add emotion onto an already imbalanced mix of comedy and horror was the wrong choice, if it was cut from the film I would have still enjoyed it equally as much. I also found the ending to be completely unnecessary. It felt like the film had already ended, with satisfying arcs for the characters and the antagonist dead. But somehow it didn't end there and the whole final sequence felt unnecessary and tagged on for the sake of it, holding no purpose whatsoever, if they wanted to set up a sequel this was not the way to do it.My final few positives would be the fantastic script, the great character development. The fantastic rising of stakes and the fun final act. The script for this film was excellent, the comedic writing was incredibly clever, playing on genre tropes. Whilst also playing on the body swapping dynamic excellently. I also liked how the character of Millie developed. Despite the character depth not being needed it definitely added layers to some of the characters and Millie. And how her character developed in her confidence of herself and it was nice to see, I cared about the characters which isn't always the case with films like this. I also thought the final act and the rising of the stakes was excellent. It was entertaining, hilarious and gruesome, adding a new layer just enough times for it to be unpredictable, with a clever nod to one particular moment at the beginning of the film. And the characters had good arcs and before the unneeded ending was a satisfying end to the film.Overall, Freaky can't escape some tired genre tropes. And works better as a comedy than a horror with both of the genres not fully gelling. But the film is elevated by the fantastic and charming cast. Its fantastic dialogue and humour and the execution of its creative idea. And I still had a fun time with it.",Freaky
77,faer_kr,Laughter and entertainment,9,16 November 2020,"What kind of ""this body is not mine"" but without Rob Schneider and version of evil is this?
A film that masterfully combines comedy and suspense, it is not horror.
It is about a murderer called the butcher who in an attack takes an ancient knife and when attacking a girl unleashes a curse by changing bodies with him.
Quality.
Entertaining
Performances at the level.
Vince Vaughn acts spectacular as a teenage girl.
The characters of the girl's friends and boyfriend steal the screen.
Has all the essence of this body is not mine.
The comedy is organic.
The deaths are fine, even some dismemberments look great on screen, excess blood.

78,flicklover,Alot less cool than it thinks it is!,5,13 November 2020,"When I saw the trailer firbthis I was cautiously optimistic that it could be ok. It looked like a Scream meets Freaky Friday. Well, it is that but it is really not very good.Of course this type of horror comedy is not to be taken seriously but it is not very funny or scary at all. The premise is just as the trailer shows. A high school girl gets attacked by a serial killer and they switch bodies. That's it.The serial killer the Blissfield Butcher is played by Vince Vaughn. The high school girl Millie is played by Kathryn Newton. Millie is attacked by the killer with a sacred Aztec dagger that has the power to switch their bodies. The fun of the film is watching each of them adjust in their new bodies. Vaughn does a good job with a very thin script. Newton just goes around looking evil. The film is gory but nothing we've never seen before in much better films. It has a couple of decent chuckles but again been there seen that.The film wants to convince you that it is really cool and edgy but it really isn't.Lazy film.Grade: C-",Freaky

This movie doesn't waste time introducing everyone and getting right to the basic plot. There's no time wasted with the why or the how; it just and right into the story.Vince Vaughn did an amazing job with this. He was hysterical as a 17 year old girl.

82,darkreignn,So much fun - a much needed respite from 2020,8,17 November 2020,"I'm a fan of ""Happy Death Day,"" so when I saw that Christopher Landon was returning to make another comedic slasher, and this time it was rated R and starring Vince Vaughn, I could barely contain my excitement. COVID has us all spending the majority of our time in the safety of our own homes, but I gladly risked infection to watch this movie in a semi-full theatre (and yes, one member of my audience happened to be coughing at an intermittent basis). Now, a few days after my showing, I'm happy to report that not only do I not have the coronavirus, but ""Freaky"" is one fine film.I had a smile on my face for about 90% of this films running time. From its bloody start that's reminiscent of the best of 80s slashers to its very funny second act that leads to a tense final 20 minutes, ""Freaky"" delivers one hour and forty minutes of flat out fun. Let's talk about the horror: Filled to the brim with ridiculously horrific kills and geysers of gushing blood, if you enjoy slasher films, you will 100% like this movie. Christopher Landon didn't skimp on the violence, or the tension. With a cat-and-mouse game in someone's giant mansion and a fight in a high school woodshop classroom, ""Freaky"" has enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most diehard slasher fans.In terms of comedy, ""Freaky"" delivers in spades. Vince Vaughn is pitch perfect in the role he was born to play: that of a teenaged girl. There are so many hilarious set pieces that will have you squirming and laughing at the same (just wait for the already infamous car sequence - you'll know it when you see it). It also helps that Vince is a genuinely good actor, and when paired with the fantastic and utterly gorgeous Kathryn Newton, this film becomes elevated to new heights. A silly horror-comedy has no right employing actors as good as these, but Christopher Landon seems to realize that grade-A actors improve grade-B material; and that's not to say that the story here is bad, because it isn't. In fact, the basic premise of a high school girl switching bodies with a serial killer is so unique that even the most jaded movie-goer will find themselves entertained at the concept.""Freaky"" is fun - if you're looking for a good time at the movies, 2020 didn't have much to offer you, until now. I would highly recommend this movie to comedy and horror lovers alike; if you happen to enjoy both genres, you just found your perfect cup of tea.",Freaky

His performance is as funny as you can imagine, and really steals the show. So much so that it feels as though his gimmick may have been underused, as much of the run-time gets padded down by a couple corny teen drama moments.Otherwise, it's simple, silly and has fun within it's familiar parameters.",Freaky

But with chainsaws and broken bottle weapons!A unique film that actually stars actors who seem actually young, and not like 30 year old high school students (update: well I just checked and this cast is the most baby faced 24 year olds I've seen). It's funny to see their violent deaths but also sometimes it's kind of cringe, like seeing a preteen try to kiss middle aged, body-swapped Vince Vaughn. Who not 24 hours ago was a vicious serial killer. I honestly feel like, yeah maybe hold off on that.But otherwise, strangely cathartic.

A few laughs, an interesting concept, good acting, and overall a good watch. But this could have been a lot better, and it is not nearly as funny as 'happy death day'.The negatives:
First of all Kathryn Newton is gorgeous, sexy and pretty far from being a weirdo hanging out with losers and playing an ""undesirable"" girl. It is impossible to buy into that premiss. She also looks like her age i.e. 23yo, so not really high school.
The writing and directing is also a bit off. They could have made this more creepy, less peppy, and darker but still put in a couple of better jokes, but they did not. I also think they should have taken the concept a bit further and had the killer in Millie's body explore the sexual bits more. The writing about Millie's family with a dead husband, how they act towards each other, who they are, and what they do is all very generic, very boring, very lazy writing. I suppose that was sort of the point, but it does not work. And finally, with better writing, better directing, and perhaps a few changes to characters they should have also draged it out a bit more and really hammer in the creepy-ness and stalking feel of normal slasher movies. Due to the above this almost feels pretentious, almost too much of ""here we are! We are twisting the slasher genre and we want you to laugh and this is a great movie!"" - vibe from this.With that said, and almost contradictory to what I just said, this movie also don't take itself too serious. This is gory, but also creative. This is fun and good watch. I just wish they put in a little bit more effort into making the movie and it would have been great.The good stuff is about the actors - they all do a great job. The premiss of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist is fun and interesting. Kathryn is very good as a killer, perhaps she has found her calling? Set design and music is used very well and there are a lot of fun good moments.I really recommend this, especially if you have nothing else to watch.

The rest of the cast is really good too, especially Vince Vaughn of course. Some killing scenes are quite thrilling/suspenseful and really gory.

Still, an audience for this kind of horror comedy does indeed exist.What happens when a shy, outcast, bullied high schooler switches bodies with a hulking, brutish serial killing butcher? Hilarity of course. Plus some deaths. Well, lots of deaths. But it's okay, because tennis rackets, wine bottles, hooks, circular saws and cryogenic freezers are used. Cool! Also there's Vince Vaughn suddenly inhabiting a girl. Awkward!Actually, ""Freaky"" isn't as awful as its promise, nor its premise. Sure the characters are one dimensional, even the two-dimensional ones, but this is not a thespian experiment. ""Freaky"" goes about it's colourful business in a bouncy, well trimmed manner, dispensing of boorish characters in quick fashion whilst pausing long enough for a couple of well placed quips.

Christopher Landon's previous Happy Death Day movies were fun but they felt like they were missing something.

104,phoenixinvictus,A great comedy horror,7,21 August 2021,Vince Vaughn has proven throughout his career how versatile he can be.

It brings back that nostalgia for the 80's.,Freaky
105,hoernkeem,"Freaky (2020, Christopher Landon) A fun horror/comedy twist on the Freaky Friday mold with Vaughn elevating basic material",7,26 August 2021,"Freaky (2020, Christopher Landon)
From the decimated wasteland that was the latter half of 2020, due to the COVID 19 pandemic, this little gem of a movie actually made it to theaters in November. The film stars Vince Vaughn and Katheryn Newton and is directed by Christopher Landon who wrote more than a few 'Paranormal Activity' films and was writer/director for both 'Happy Death Day' movies. That explains a lot as when I watched this movie I got a very 'Happy Death Day' vibe from it as it does a good job of blending horror and comedy and as with 'Happy Death Day' which put a twisted spin on 'Groundhog Day' this movie does the same sort of retooling with 'Freaky Friday' as its template. When I say template they borrow the concept only in the broadest of strokes namely the body swapping concept which is a concept that gets constantly revived every so often usually as a straightforward comedy involving a younger and older person swapping roles.The town of Blissfield has an urban legend/serial killer known as the Blissfield Butcher. The urban legend becomes very real one night when the Butcher, played by Vaughn, breaks into a mansion killing a handful of teens in gruesome fashion and stealing an ancient dagger. The next day we meet Millie Kessler, Katheryn Newton, who is a bullied teen on the lower end of her high school's social structure. She has a few good friends, an alcoholic mom and a cop sister. After the football game that night where she is the mascot she is left all alone and is attacked by the Butcher who stabs her with the ancient dagger, but instead of death something supernatural occurs. The Butcher stumbles away back to his hideout scared off, and Millie after some pampering is taken home. The next day, however, both wake up realizing they have swapped bodies. The new Millie starts going on a subtle killing rampage despite her lack of physical strength which is played up for laughs. Millie now in the Butcher's body has a chore ahead of her convincing people she is not a killer while figuring out how to get her body back. That is the basic setup and it causes a few scares and more than a few laughs. Vince Vaughn's presence adds some legit comedy acting skill to the movie as he is hilarious at channeling his inner sweet sixteen. As an added benefit in a bad situation for Millie the Butcher, while in her body, really vamps it up showing her she has more to offer the world than just the role of bullied mascot. This bit is slightly eye rolling as it is right out of the 'She's All That'/'Not Another Teen Movie' playbook. She is clearly portrayed as the ""pretty ugly girl"" however in this iteration she doesn't even have glasses to remove to make her beautiful. All she does is done a leather coat, put on some lipstick and adopt a devil may care attitude.I will be interested to see if Landon, as a writer/director, attempts this trick again taking some classic film concept and turning it into a new, fresh horror/comedy concept. The guy isn't crafting 'Schindler's List' or 'Jurassic Park' but these films are fun and original outside of the basic concept. They provide some decent horror gore along with some good laughs as well and for a mid-tier Blumhouse style film that is really all we are looking for. The cast does a good job but Newton and Vaughn both elevate the film a bit with their interpretations of the body swapping roles. Newton's work is not going unnoticed either as she has been cast as Cassie Lang in the upcoming Ant-Man film. Landon is on the verge of pioneering this formula, and I for one wouldn't mind seeing more in what could be a new, twisted mashup genre.Eric's Grade: B.",Freaky
106,rmmil,Unimaginative,4,9 February 2021,"I wanted to like this film, at least I thought I would going into it. I remember when it came out, the film had decent reviews for a horror film, and I love the ""Happy Death Day"" movies, so coming from the same creative team I thought this would be good.It's not, not so much.The concept is original, Freaky Friday meets horror film, but the delivery is surprisingly flat.One issue I had was that the serial killer is just that, ""the serial killer"". There's zero attempt at backstory. The pacing of the film felt rushed because it gave itself an arbitrary deadline of 24 hours. If the film had taken place over days it would have allowed setups for funnier moments than what we got, along with some fleshing out of the characters beyond what we got, because even though the killer is underdeveloped, so is the star, actually.She's kinda an outcast nerd (completely unbelievable as no woman who looks like her would be a high school ""outcast""), who likes a boy. That's all we really know, again due to an unnecessary time crunch plot device.Okay for a horror film, but underwhelming overall. Does not live up to the hype.",Freaky

Vince Vaughn turns in a solid performance as a teenage girl and the rest of the cast are cliched millenials but its self aware enough to be fun.

Freaky steals bits and pieces from every other comedy/horror/teen romance movie, without an original thought of it's own, and not in any kind of intelligent homage way either. It's not near as clever as Scream, Happy Death Day or even Freaky Friday. This movie takes the low road with way too many F-bombs and vulgar slurs (yea, I know they're teens but it's little much) and these characters are boring, poorly acted, stereotyped teens. To top it off, the slasher and gore scenes were low budget and not very creative.

If I were 16 being at the theatre with my friends messing around, I would love this, I think.It's not at all a bad movie, it's just the wrong decade, or even millennium, for me. I had my teenager slasher moment back in the day. I will admit that Vince did a really good job here. I had to laugh here and there.If I should compare it to some other movies, it would be a mashup with Scream, Child's Play and Friday The 13th and maybe a bit of Trading Places, with Eddie Murphy. That should almost cover all the bases. I will admit, it was quite fun at times.I liked Happy Death Day 1 & 2 better, with the complication of time and space.I can't go higher than 6.5/10 on this.

125,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"Fun With An Intentionally Cheesy Tongue-In-Cheekiness, At Times Just Cheesy And Formulaic",6,21 November 2020,"Centered on director-driven productions that are low-budget and made fast, Blumhouse productions share similar values in the vein of Roger Corman productions, which give their films an old school efficiency to them.In the case of Freaky, the script gets straight to the point. In the beginning horror movie section, the film practically holds a clipboard and just proceeds to check everything off before you get to say hello, ""That's our villain. That's the girl. That's her problem. This is her family and their recent tragedy. These are her friends."" Happy Death Day director Christopher Landon executed in an intentionally cheesy self-aware meta fashion. Vince Vaughn's serial killer wears an Incan mask that resembles Jason Voorhees. The tongue-in-cheekiness is intentionally cheesy and funny at times, other times it is just cheesy and formula.At the point of the body switch, the genre shifts to being a straight-up situation comedy. The irony and the jokes are in place but they are not tight enough nor pushing its clever premise far enough to get maximum laughs. Vince Vaughn is hilarious playing out the body swap gag but isn't given enough to do because he is always hurried along to the next scene. I laughed a few times but didn't leave with a full stomach of seeing Vince Vaughn acting like a high school girl.Originally titled Freaky Friday the 13th, which is actually a better title, the film never tonally reconciles the meta-horror and the Freaky Friday family comedy elements together. At times, when Millie as Vince Vaughn is running around the high school with her friends searching for the killer while hiding from the adults, it feels like a Goosebumps movie. When there are brutal killings, it is R-rated graphic to an extent of where I feel like I am supposed to laugh at the violence. I can't quite give an R-rated dark comedic belly laugh at a brutal killing cause of the PG-13 nature embedded into the context.If director Christopher Landon said the point was to have both the PG-13 and R-rated elements together, I would say fine, but the script and the jokes have to be clever enough to make that meta tone consistent. It is as if the speed of how fast they made this movie has compromised the potential of its own premise. There is a great premise here. I do think the humor and the tone could have been drafted some more and chisel the dialogue.I know there's a better version of this that could have been made.",Freaky
126,noahbetancourt,Unique and refreshing slasher comedy,8,21 November 2020,"Freaky is by far, one of the most entertaining slasher films of the 21st century. The plot is very simple, and has been done in many films, but to have the body swap premise in a horror film keeps things very interesting. Unlike most body swap films, the acting is very consistent between the two actors. Vince Vaughn is hysterical as a shy teen girl, and Katherine Newton was very convincing as a crazed killer, she definitely had the more impressive performance out of the two. The movie delivers a pretty good amount of humor and the kills are nice and gory. For fans of the genre, Freaky is definitely a refreshing and enjoyable film.",Freaky

Wrong!
Four people die brutally before the opening credits roll on ""Freaky"".
There is genuine horror on the screen that might make you squirm and look away.
Like all good horror movies it mixes both the terror with comedy and a self awareness that's been apparent in this genre since the 90's.
Blumhouse have produced some of the scariest movies of this century and now you can add this slasher.
Try if you will to picture 6 footer Vince Vaughan as a teenage girl in the backseat of a car kissing her boyfriend.
OK too scary.
Vince puts in an outstanding performance as ""The Blissfield Butcher"" and its not the first time we've seen his scary or effeminate side. Who remembers the remake of ""Psycho""?
Kathryn Newton stands her ground brilliantly leaping from bullied schoolgirl to deranged serial killer.
""Freaky"" is a mash of ""Halloween"", ""Carrie""& ""Friday the 13th"" plus a few other classic fright movies get a nod in this comedy, horror, thriller.
Congrats Director Christopher Landon on landing on this winning formula.

129,seige-hound,A Surpisingly Good Horror Comedy,8,26 November 2020,"Freaky is to Freaky Friday what Happy Death Day was to Groundhog Day. Essentially a horror comedy spin on the body-swap genre of movies, Freaky tells the story of a young insecure high school senior swapping bodies with a deranged serial killer, and has 24 hours to undo it before the swap is permenant.The biggest standout is the performances of Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton, especially when they play the 'swapped' versions of the characters. Vince Vaughn does a fantastic job playing a funny, awkward and nerdy teenage girl, similar to Jack Black's performance in Jumanji, and Kathryn is incredible as a serial killer in the body of a teen, especially as she tries to figure out how to effectively kill without the strength of her original body.This movie certainly isn't perfect, but I honestly can't think of any specific issues I have with it. Freaky knows exactly what it wants to be, and does that very well. I'm very happy I got to see this in cinemas. This is certainly a dumb fun crowd pleaser, but not quite as 'dumb' as you might expect from the premise.Definitely worth the watch. I personally think it's better than Happy Death Day, but with the pandemic, I don't think it'll be as successful as that film. I was all by myself in the theatre (albeit for a matinee showing) so not sure if it'll get the recognition it deserves. I personally am a big fan of this recent Horror Comedy trend coming from Blumhouse. Looking forward to seeing what they do next.",Freaky

Plenty of good reviews here.
I can only add that it draws inspiration from Mean Girls, Friday the 13th, and Freaky Friday, and it is original because of the inclusion that slasher/horror genre.

The story development is quite fast and there is really no time to yawn.
All the teenager/horror stereotypes are well covered and the level of humor is on good level.
I've really appreciated the gore scenes... not many, but all of them were placed at the right time and with a clever use of practical effects.

I had expected this Blumhouse Production to be another miss and make me feel life's regrets of trying to see a new horror film on Friday the 13th. However, this fresh take on ""Freaky Friday"" was most welcome. It was a vibrant display of kill or be killed with comedy being a side note throughout, and not in the absolute classic, cheesy way that older slashers offer. My initial reservations were with Vince Vaughn knowing that he was a comedic actor. Those reservations were unnecessary as Vaughn playing a teenage girl was hilarious throughout as he tries to convince those around him that he's not the Butcher. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Kathryn Newton who played Millie, did a fantastic job of carrying the ominous presence of the Butcher to high school where the killing continues. By the end you'll be left laughing one moment and in the same scene cringing at the acts of violence.Overall, a really great slasher/comedy that I would recommend seeing in theatres on any given night.

They gay student didn't sound like so much gay after the butcher appeared.2. There are too many unnecessary F bombs. The movie offers humor and some scary moments.

If your love one (straight) becomes same sex like you, would you kiss and be with that someone when it becomes permanent?!

146,MrMcMurphy,Vince Vaughn is next level,9,11 December 2020,Can't believe what he does with this movie.Almost stopped watching this movie in the beginning.Glad I kept going because I got to see the master at work.Haven't lol'd this much at a movie since Bruce Almighty was in theaters.,Freaky
147,HollisWoods,A fun slumber party flik,6,2 February 2021,"Freaky wastes no time in establishing itself as a horror comedy. The deaths in the opening scene as the Butcher makes his mark are just so stupid and ridiculous, and it paves the mood of the rest of the film. The humor in the movie as a whole is okay, but the crazy murders keep the consistent levity of the movie.We all know the tale of Freaky Friday, whether you watched the original film or the Lindsay Lohan edition. This creative twist on story was quite clever, and thankfully utilized well in the film. The first half of the movie is really good and presented an intriguing adventure. However the second half of the film fell flat to me. The pacing started to drag on and it seemed like forever for the movie to end. The ending itself was okay, but when watching Freaky, the first half is more entertaining part.Vince Vaughn & Kathryn Newton are undoubtedly the stars of the show. Vince did a good job of being the menacing Butcher; and I'm sure he had plenty of fun pretending to be a teenage girl. His performance probably would've been funnier, but Jack Black raised the bar for grown men pretending to be a teenage girl (if you can even say that's a thing) in the recent Jumanji movies, so the entire film I kept comparing the two, deciding Jack Black was the better performance.Kathryn Newton did such a great job of establishing the sweet character of Millie, but when the swap happened, she gave it her all. She played crazy evil so well. No offence to Vince, but Kathryn was the better actor here. I loved it when she was on screen and I really enjoyed her performances of both characters overall.I wouldn't watch it again, but it was cute. Freaky would work well as a one time slumber party flik, especially if the theme is cheesy horror films. If you're looking for a good High School horror movie, or a film where a teenage girl is stuck in a grown man's body, then Scream and Jumanji are the movies I'd recommend before this one.",Freaky

The opening sequence set a decent tone and the movie never gets boring, good performances all round and funny too. Kathryn Newton carries the whole movie with just subtle movements and body language once she takes on the serial killer's soul. This takes talent, the look on her face when she gets thwarted or annoyed is priceless and she has some good one liners. As for the kills, some were creative and nasty others were lame or complete non-sense and just would never happen (e.g.: the freezer). Other bad aspects include the fact that it's not a body swap but a ""gender swap"" and I should have seen this coming. The scene in the cop car had me at full body eye-roll mode and kind of ruined the movie a little. It felt band-wagony and I'm not a fan. Other than that it was good to see Vince again and I enjoy the movie for what it was.",Freaky

157,ToxicJug,A fun film that turns the drained slasher subgenre on its head,7,4 October 2021,"Freaky does not come without its flaws (of course) but it does add an interesting and rather fun premise of a film into the iconicly cliche slasher subgenre! I could say that the beginning of this film sets up a cliche premise or that the ending of the film was as predictable as it gets. While both of those statements may be true, the entire rest of the film goes a totally different direction than expected making the basic opening forgivable and the lackluster ending is barely noticeable on first watch coming off of the fun Rollercoaster ride that Freaky was throughout! Before I close out this review i should also add that Vince Vaughn runs the show in this film putting his full acting ability on display! He manages to make you belive that he is a teenage girl trapped in a grown man's body and it is hilarious, impressive, and entertaining (nowhere near as awkward as one might assume it too be). Freaky is a fun horror comedy that turns a beat to death slasher premise on its head and makes it unique. While the body switching premise has been done 100 times before, seeing it done in a slasher film was interesting and new! If you can get through the low points of this film, your bound to have a good time!",Freaky

159,huntersmithx,Vince Vaughn carries this freakingly middling Slasher Comedy.,7,15 November 2020,"For those who enjoyed Jack Black getting to role-play as a hilariously sassy teenage girl stuck in a man's body in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, you'll get to see the same schtick here in Freaky- Vince Vaughn's soul is swapped with an outcast teenage girl. He's more hilarious than the film has the right to be, but also frightening as the Blissfield Butcher. Kathryn Newton in her two roles also have considerable effect, switching from the typical outcast student girl next door to the hot serial killer next door. Of course it's essentially Freaky Friday the 13th, but it also harkens to Face/Off (of which I now want to see an official Horror equivalent to).In brass tacs, this is a one-and-done effort built mostly of spare parts and every high school screenplay cliche in the book. Early on in the film, every student and teacher has that Netflix syndrome where they talk 30-60 overly clever words a minute. There's the jagoff jocks that turn into wannabe murderers, snarky mean girls, a stereotypical gay token sidekick. Add in a sibling rivalry (the sister is a police officer which is cool), a dead family member and alcoholic parent that serves some pretense for an arc that weaves in and out; but nothing of major impact comes of it and especially with the somewhat abrupt ending.Freaky can serve as a nice pitstop for those wanting to visit the theater, but if you're looking for another true quality picture worth the cash and travel- that will have to wait.

Cameron is the best character in this movie, hands down. The premise is simple but has a very different twist to it, Vince Vaughn is the best part of this movie. Vince Vaughn was funny to watch play a teenage girl in this movie. Blumhouse did good with this one. The kills looked cool but sadly they killed Cameron. The comedy lands, Freaky is a funny movie.

Misha who plays Josh & Celeste who plays Nyla were perfectly cast for this film, adding so many well timed laughs into this. The horror side of it, like a lot of horrors, is pretty predictable but the visual side of it is really good, there's one at the start that's brilliant to watch if you're not squeamish & another later in the film that are top notch! The Kessler family aren't pushed completely to the side, there's a nice scene in the change rooms with the mother & you can tell the sister is protective. The love interest with Booker (Uriah) is a nice add to the story & delivered some great scenes, especially one in the car with Vince when he's Millie!

If you treat it as a brain-dead popcorn film, you'll have a good enough time of it but, I won't lie, by the end of it I was starting to find myself a little bored.Also - got to be said - Kathryn Newton could have done with some extra direction for when she were ""evil"" because she just came across as a rubbish Terminator (Robert Patrick version) with the way she walked around and used her eyes to stare ""menacingly"".Comes to something when you're rooting for the body of Vince Vaughn no matter what ""mind"" is inside of it.",Freaky

It's the horror equivalent to movies like Face/Off. While it's not quite as bonkers as that movie was it's still fun to watch.Kathryn Newton and Vince Vaughn basically play two different characters throughout the movie. She is a high school student still grieving over her father's passing while Vaughn is a legendary serial killer called the Blissfield Butcher. One night they cross paths with each other and end up switching bodies. And it's the week before the big dance too!As mentioned earlier, FREAKY is a lot gorier than I expected for a teen horror movie;yeah I know it's rated R but sometimes even that is just a marketing misdirection. The performances are all very good. Newton is sympathetic as her good self and when Vaughn is ""playing"" her she has some creepy moments. Vince Vaughn still has comedic timing and his towering stature lends itself to physical comedy.Most of the cast is fine but there are a lot of characters that just check off a slot. Like there's the mean prep girl; the black best friend; the mean teacher, and the gay best friend, jerk jocks, etc. Alan Ruck is the mean teacher and he's probably the funniest one since he's so cruel without reason.2020 has been a year of colossal disappointments and terrifying circumstances so seeing a horror movie that doesn't suck is a nice surprise.",Freaky

Here, the longeurs really underline the wooden performances. Vaughan isn't as great as others have said playing the female-possessed killer. It's pretty much a by the numbers ""camp"" performance.I saw it in the theatre or I might not have got past the roll call of cliched high-school characters. The bad girls, the sassy black friend and yes, the gay pal who actually does say ""B*tch PLEASE"".The female lead is presentable but untalented. The plot limps along (the well known serial killer traps two friends in a basement and after he sustains a light beating with pots and pans he convinces them in SECONDS that he's not a killer, not even a MAN, he's their friend!), the script is dull, flat and joke-free and the climax is as underwhelming as one had come to expect, false ending and all (we're still doing false endings?).The two Happy Death Days movies were great, and that is why I ended up seeing this.

For those of us who enjoy a little mashup every now and then, I can't imagine anything more fun in this day and age.

187,willcrabbe,A bundle of gory fun with a show stealing performance by Vince Vaughn,6,29 June 2021,"Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, Scouts Guide To The Apocalypse) adds to his collection of tongue-in-cheek horror films with the new gender bending horror-comedy Freaky. The film is essentially a homage to classic teen slashers such as Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13th as well as body swapping classics like Freaky Friday. Indeed the original title was pitched as 'Freaky Friday the 13th' as a direct reference to both influences, but copyright meant they were only able to salvage the first word in the moniker.The opening of the film introduces us to our serial killer 'The Blissfield Butcher' (Vince Vaughn) as he brutally dispatches a house full of teenagers in a whole manner of gruesome ways. Before he leaves he steals an ancient mystical dagger known as 'La Dola' which he later uses to attack teenager Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton). This inadvertently causes the two to swap bodies. With only 24 hours to reverse the transition, Millie must track down La Dola before The Butcher uses his new found identity to reek havoc on the local high school population.I have to say that this was some of the most fun I've had with a new release this year. The kills and violence were bloody but darkly comedic and over the top, and the jokes came at a steady pace and mostly landed (there were some BIG laughs in my screening).I felt the film was a little slow to get going in the opening stages but it really comes into its own when the switch happens and we get to see Vince Vaughn flex his acting chops as he pretends to be a 17 year old girl. Watching all six-foot-five of him fully commit to this role was a joy to watch and served as the beating heart and driving force of the production. It's nice to see him return to a more comedically focussed role after a series of straight-edged dramatic performances in Hacksaw Ridge (2016), Brawl in Cell Block 99 (2017) and Dragged Across Concrete (2018). Kathryn Newton did a great job as well replicating a middle aged serial killer possessing a teenagers body and brought a lot of menace and sardonic style to proceedings. The supporting cast do a decent job, but the film definitely slumps in the parts where Vaughn is off screen.In summation, Freaky is a huge bundle of gory fun led by a show stealing performance from Vince Vaughn. While it may not be the best film you'll watch this year, it's definitely one that's worth a watch just to see the actors having an absolute blast.",Freaky

Vince vaughn and Kathryn Newton both turn in ample performances.The only cons - The ending is pretty mediocre. The final act doesn't even need to be there. Just a repeat of an ending they already did.Also found it a bit bugging that only the douches in the film get the OTT slayings.

190,ChrisinDesMoines,More horror/slasher than I was expecting,9,10 March 2021,"As a rule, I'm not a horror movie fanatic outside of the Classic Mummy, Dracula and Frankenstein movies, but this had Vince Vaughn in it so I was expecting more comedy than it actually provided.So the basic premise is that a serial killer (Vaughn) steals an ancient Aztec sacrificial knife and attempts to kill a high school girl (Newton) with it but because he was unsuccessful in the 'sacrifice' they switched bodies so now the teen girl is occupying the Blissfield Butcher's body and the serial killer is now occupying the body of the teen girl, which obviously leads to some comical moments in a dark comedy way.Vaughn can be quite intimidating and if you think that he is comedic playing a serial killer, I got news for you. He doesn't in this movie and I would hate to come across him in a bad mood because he is quite capable of leaving chills running up and down your spine and does it efficiently. Newton does an equally good job of portraying a cold blooded killer in this movie making this movie a lot less comedic than I was expecting. Where the comedic situations comes in is when Vaughn is trying to convince her high school friends that she's actually Millie Kessler and Vaughn doing a pretty good job of convincing you that he's actually a teen girl who is trying to adjust to her new newfound strength, height and bodily functions (the scene of her urinating while standing up does provide some chuckles) meanwhile Millie (Newton) needs to adapt to ""his"" lack of strength and find new and creative ways to overpower and kill his intended victims but takes joy in the fact that he is no longer viewed as a threat by his victims, once again providing some uneasy chuckles.If you watch this expecting something like Scary Movie or Zombieland you'll be disappointed, it isn't that type of comedy, but I can't quite put it fully into the Friday the 13th or Saw category either and I think that's why I like it so much. After seeing this I wouldn't mind seeing Vaughn get into more dramatic roles, I was a bit surprised at how he presented himself as a serial killer, but seeing him acting like a guy possessed by a teenaged girl was pretty impressive by the serious tone he handled it with.All in all I liked the movie and will most likely watch it again at a later date, there are some graphic scenes, it is a slasher movie after all, but leading up to it you can't help but watch at how (Newton) gets creative in ""adapting"" to lack of body strength. Besides... the guys she kills do kinda deserve it anyway...If you enjoy dark humor like I do you'll likely enjoy this movie. If you enjoy hardcore slasher movies, I think you'll enjoy this but you will have some more comedic elements than you may like. If the only horror movies that you like are the comedy type, I'm a little reluctant to recommend this one to you.",Freaky

The performances are adequate, even fun at times with Vince Vaughn going all in on his portrayal of a shy teenage girl.The biggest problem with the movie is it's inconsistent tone... it feels like a made for Disney TV movie with 30 seconds of inappropriate language and phenomenal gore shoehorned in, resulting in a film too mature for viewers under 14 and too juvenile for adult entertainment.

Wow there were eleven seriously gory murders, a few very touching scenes about the protagonist losing her father and the central cast was a riot! It all worked beautifully and Vince Vaughn was perfect to add to the mix. Misha Osheravich was hilarious.

201,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Vince Vaughn plays a better teenage girl than most teenage girls.,7,15 November 2020,"It's a little late for a Halloween/slasher movie, but it looks like they really wanted that Friday the 13th release date. And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be.Just when you think it's another generic, teen angst, alcohol-drinking, sex-thirsting movie, the kills start happening. Not only were they gory, but they were also quite creative. The movie just knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. Plus, watching mean bullies die in horrific ways was just so satisfying to watch. (Hopefully, I'm not the only one...)More importantly, Vince Vaughn is the reason you should watch this. You have this 6-foot-5 giant of a man running around as a teenage girl. From the way he speaks to his subtle mannerisms, it was just plain funny. He's the man-- or the woman, I mean.As for the negatives, it mostly has to do with the writing. Basically, everything with the family was boring and predictable. It was probably the most generic part of the movie. They lazily tell you everything you need to know as soon as they're introduced.I also hate it when movies portray a character as ""ugly"" or ""undesirable"" and the actress is anything but. In other words, they want you to believe that Kathryn Newton's Millie is some kind of weirdo loser, but I just never bought it.There's also a disconnect between Newton's Millie, who is shy, timid and quiet, and Vince Vaughn's Millie, who is girly-girl, talkative and fun. They just felt like different people. There's also, sort of, two endings. There was the natural conclusion, and everything was good, but then it goes on for another 10 minutes, and it was just unnecessary.Despite some annoying tropes and poor writing, this was a fun, self-aware movie with some horrific kills and really funny body swap moments.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of Vince Vaughn, fans of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist, or fans of watching scumbag bullies get what's coming to them.Thanks for reading!",Freaky

As for Kathryn Newton she had a solid performance going from a shy school girl to a murderous madman.The plot was really well done as it brought lots of laughs and always felt like the movie was moving along and never really slowing down.

Vince Vaughn was hysterical when he was playing the teenage girl. Kathryn Newton got the psycho demeanor down perfectly.But the blood, guts and gore was completely unnecessary. It all could have been implied and would have been even scarier and funnier.A great, funny, edge of your seat thriller with some unexpected twists.

222,courtneypedersen,Much Better Than Expected,8,10 August 2021,"I'm not a big fan of Kathryn Newton. To me, she is just another bottle blonde actress with mediocre talent in a long line of bottle blonde actresses with mediocre talent. So imagine how surprised I was to find how convincing she was not only as a meek teenager but also as a male serial killer trapped in a teen girl's body. She actually gave me the creeps a few times with her portrayal of the serial killer. And of course, Vince Vaughn did not disappoint with the comedy aspect of his role and was thoroughly creepy himself as the serial killer.I think what helped me the most with enjoying this movie was not having high expectations. This isn't supposed to be a cerebral experience. This movie is all about fun and not taking itself too seriously. It's not your typical horror movie in that it's intention is to scare the audience. There are times where it seems as though it's a spoof of horror movies (such as the scene where Vince Vaughn is trying to walk around while wearing an Aaron Rodgers mask and asks ""how do killers do this?"") but that's not a bad thing. It was a unique take on a story told dozens of times (Freaky Friday) and was thoroughly entertaining.If you like the Happy Death Day movies, you are sure to enjoy this. And if you're a fan of horror movies, you will probably enjoy it. Just make sure you're not watching it with the hope of being scared or having to figure out a puzzle because this is not that kind of movie.

Everyone, except Vince Vaughn, was an unknown to me and he has been a hit or miss over the last 15 years. The previews showed nothing but a horror comedy so the cold open being an homage to Friday the 13th while taking itself seriously and emoting genuine emotion was a great introduction to the rest of the film which didn't stray from the comedy element like the intro. The female lead played her role well but Vince Vaughn completely stole the show acting as a teenage girl. Writing that sentence feels weird but the performance never gave off an inappropriate or creepy vibe. I found myself laughing hysterically for many of his scenes and the film sent you home with unforced character development and arc for Millie and her family. There are some stereotypical characters, at some points it was an obvious commentary on old horror films but other times came off as a genuine cliché instead of a satirized cliché.

248,whineycracker2000,Predictable fun,6,22 November 2020,"'Freaky' is exactly what you would expect it to be. Flashy and superficial with inventive kills, solid production value, hit-or-miss comedy, and a likable lead. Clearly riding on the coattails of the surprisingly successful Happy Death Day (although nowhere nearly as original or rewarding) Freaky more or less delivers on its promise to be a fun and harmless teen horror/comedy hybrid, and a cameo by Alan Ruck (Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off) was certainly an added bonus.Tons of praise have been given to Vince Vaughan but I feel the film belongs to Kathyrn Newton's Millie (The same was true of 2003's Freaky Friday. Curtis got all the praise, but Lindsay's performance was the anchor of the film). Aside from Millie and The Butcher, the supporting characters are all stock, although Misha Osherovich does bring a certain whimsy and spunk to his role as the standard gay sidekick.Newton has a lovable presence and she plays the role of a serial killer with a lot of conviction and focus. I was surprised at how seriously she took the role, considering the minimal level of ambition on display in every other department. Vaughan, on the other hand, didn't possess the same nuance or energy, and I was never convinced he was inhabiting the body of a teenage girl. His mannerisms were stereotypically female but were not specific to the character of Millie-or at least the version of her we are introduced to at the beginning of the film. His performance seemed very dialed-in to me.The film suffers considerably by including the ""parent died last year and the main character is still grieving"" cliché- one that is so over-used the writers should know better. Is there no other back story one can think of to provide the requisite ""heart"" these types of films require? Had the film developed a stronger backstory, it could have been something more memorable.Tropes aside, the film provides 104 minutes of passable, mildly entertaining fare.",Freaky

265,JRodFilms,"""Freaky"" will make you say Yass Queen!",5,20 November 2020,"""Freaky"" is the new slasher comedy starring Vince Vaughn who plays The Blissfield Butcher, the brutal killer terrorizing a town and who ends up swapping bodies with 17 year old high school student Millie, played by Kathryn Newton. It's sort of a slasher 'Cinderella' where the protagonist Millie has 24 hours to stab the butcher back with his own dagger, or else she stays The Blissfield Butcher forever!The story begins with Millie, the unpopular girl at her school organizing a boring evening with her mom instead of getting ready for the prom. That's what her sister thinks anyway, who plays the local deputy with her own struggles; such as distancing herself from the family since their father is no longer in the picture and their mother is an alcoholic.Millie's mother works at the local discount outlet in her town; and this is pretty much the fodder for the torment she receives from Ryler, the mean girl at school. Millie does however have a few friends at school, Nyla and Josh, who seem to be cooler than Millie and come to her defense against her tormenter.However, her friends can't save her all the time; especially from her mean shop teacher and being constantly humiliated on the football field while posing as the team's mascot. One night when Millie's mom has one too many drinks and forgets to pick up her daughter, Millie is stalked by the Blissfield Butcher, and ends up being stabbed with his dagger. Millie's sister comes and saves the day, but it's too late, as Millie transitions from geeky nerdy unpopular girl, to brutal and sexy serial killer seductress!Truthfully, I wasn't sure about seeing ""Freaky"" so quickly as I have a disdain for horror comedy. I find that sub genre to be almost a parody of itself; overly meta and self aware. I will give ""Freaky"" credit for knowing what it is from the beginning; with the advertising of the film gearing towards a female and gay male audience.As a slasher film, ""Freaky"" may even get some horror fans excited, with its somewhat shocking opening and the many references to the classic films that inspired it: such as ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"" and ""Candyman"". But just like any horror slasher comedy, ""Freaky"" comes with its inherit flaws.Although individually, Millie and The Blissfield Butcher have their own personalities and qualities, this seems to be lost during the transition. Instead of acting shy and awkward, The Blissfield Butcher (as Millie) comes out swinging with a new wardrobe and hairstyle; as she slow-mo walks into school in a wonderful nod to the 80s film ""Heathers"".This definitely treads into the geek to chic sub-genre; as now the football players want to date her, and even Ryler tries to befriend her, which... let's just say Millie gives her the cold shoulder. Besides some of the kills which are already given away in the trailers such as Ryler freezing to death and the shop teacher's run in with a buzzsaw, Millie does not get all Blissfield Butcher on our ass.The Blissfield Butcher, when portrayed by Vince Vaughn, seemed like an interesting, brutal, demented serial killer. Unfortunately, Millie is never really given a chance to become him in that way. The same goes for Vince Vaughn as Millie. When he becomes her, he is no longer awkward but conventional and ready to kiss boys.""Freaky"" is not perfect, but at least somewhat takes itself seriously. The concept could be interesting if really approached with darker material. Sort of like if Chucky really did possess Andy, and then Andy started killing. Still, it says a lot when one of the more interesting moments of the film is a clip from ""The Real Housewives of New York City"".",Freaky

269,juliamacon,The Fun Horror Comedy We Need Right Now,9,7 December 2020,"A serial killer steals an ancient magical dagger during one of his murder sprees and plunges it into the wrong teenage girl, causing them to switch bodies and it's up to her to convince her friends that she's now in the body of a man and that they have 24 hours to switch them back before they're trapped in each other's bodies forever.Freaky might go more for the goofy than the truly funny at times, but there's an infectious sense of fun throughout and the performances are excellent across the board with Vine Vaughn and Kathryn Newton being given the most to work with and making the most of it. It's similar in tone to Christopher Landon's other horror comedies, so if you enjoy those, you're probably going to enjoy this one as well. If you didn't like this then this might not be for you, but there's an added bonus of this one being rated R which means it comes with a lot more gore than the Happy Death Day movies.",Freaky

277,BlurayAddictAU,Freaky excels in every way you'd want it to!,7,11 November 2020,"After bringing us the genre blending slasher time loop comedy delight that was Happy Death Day and it's more sci-fi leaning sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, Christopher Landon is back with FREAKY.Keeping with his ongoing theme of taking two genres and slamming them together to great effect, FREAKY asks what would happen if The Hot Chick played out as a slasher film (who wouldn't want to watch that).FREAKY feels like a return to the straightforward simplistic fare of the first Happy Death Day for Landon, which works to great effect. After the fun (and quite gory!) stereotypical teen slasher film opening sequence we are introduced to Kathryn Newton's Millie Kessler, a student at Blissfield High who though some body swap magic gets put into the body of Vince Vaughn's aptly named serial killer, The Blissfield Butcher.This is where both Newton and Vaughn really start to have some fun, with Newton now a menacing serial killer in a teen body and Vaughn gleefully acting as a teen student in a comparatively massive and hilariously overpowered body.There isn't anything absolutely groundbreaking going on here but that's kind of what makes this film a whole lot of fun, It let's the focus stay on the great two performances and is honestly a perfect film to get away from 2020 for a while.FREAKY excels in every way you'd want it to, it fits perfectly into Landon's filmography and style with two great performances at the centre.Highly recommended if you enjoyed Landon's earlier Happy Death Day films or even if you're just a slasher fan, you won't be disappointed.FREAKY slashes into cinemas this Thursday the 12th November Australia wide!

Then the killer accidentally switches bodies with the girl he's trying to kill, and things get so ridiculous you can't help but just laugh.

I am not saying copy other movies, but for characters to barely react and to have no fun at all in their new body felt so, so wrong.Watch this, if you want to see a light horror-comedy, but not if you are seriously interested in the concept and want to see a fresh take on body-switching.This is imo not THE BODY SWITCHER HORROR flick, I was hoping it to be.

Good acting. But the plot and direction is atrocious. The draw of this movie was the body-swapping. So, why was there a need for the extended scenes where the ""butcher"" stalks his victims slowly, in a campy way? I mean, he is in the body of a meek teenage girl who no one bats an eye at. 'She' could have easily used that to get close to her victims and stab them in the guts. No one would have suspected a thing until the knife was well inside their guts.All the time spent doing this campy stalking could have been used to further the comedy that comes from the body-swapping concept.

300,samuelwha,"A Fun, Freaky Slasher",6,16 November 2020,"Freaky tells the story of a teenage girl who wakes up one morning to find her consciousness stuck inside the body of the man who tried to murder her the night before. She quickly realizes that this must mean that the killer's consciousness is in her body, and she spends the rest of the film trying to mitigate consequences and get her body back.On paper, this is a firecracker of an idea. It's simple, straightforward, but also creative and promising. It is Freaky Friday meets Friday the 13th, a fun but spooky body-swapping teen slasher film. And surely, when the credits roll, Freaky's finest accomplishment is that it does good service to this idea. Writers Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy spend their 101 minutes with the concept leaving hardly any conceptual stone unturned, managing to wring humour, tension and heart from the story in all of the right ways, while always keeping good pace and never forgetting what kind of movie it is: a fun one.The trouble with Freaky, however, is that it's greatest strength is also it's weakness. In servicing it's central idea, this Freaky Friday the 13th, the film does manage to hit the right notes. But what notes are those? Well, they are the notes, the themes, the plot devices, the characters and the twists laid out by the film's inspirations. That is to say, in trying to be Freaky Friday and in trying to be Friday the 13th, Freaky more or less is those movies. It does an admirable job at mashing the two, but at the end of the day, it is never more than the sum of its parts. And so, as a viewer, you spend only so much of Freaky enjoying the idea before you realize that you have seen this movie before. You know where it goes. You know how it ends. The movie shies away from subverting expectations in any way, obviously frightened that it will veer to far from it's predecessors, but then it becomes it's predecessors.This quality becomes even more egregious as the film the progresses. Near the end of the film, when the clock is ticking and the stakes are high, the viewer never feels any real sense of threat because they have seen a slasher before. The killer always escapes their confines. The killer always appears to have the upper hand. The final girl always comes out on top. And then there are body-swapping movies. The protagonist always gets her body back. The protagonist always learns a heartfelt lesson. Things always workout. And Freaky never grows self-aware here, as it attempts to throw twists and turns into the final few minutes that cause the audience's eyes to glaze over. By this point, they has seen the film spend over an hour setting itself into a specific mold. They know that it's not going to veer from that, and it doesn't.And so, while I would recommend seeing Freaky with some friends, popping some popcorn, and enjoying the hijinks, never expect to be on the edge of your seat with Freaky. Enjoy it for what it is, and try to forget what it isn't.",Freaky

Vince Vaughn's performance, despite maybe mimicking a stereotypical teenage girl rather than specifically Kathryn Newton (who's also great), is excellent. The gore is also outstanding if you're into that, every death is unique and very bloody. The only problem is that there are some parts of the movie that are so terrible I can't believe they were written by the same people. I think they stand out as being bad because the rest of the movie is so good, but there were moments that were so hammy and cringe inducing that I actually had to look away because I couldn't take it. It's very much a matter of personal preference, and it probably won't affect many other people the same way, but there was something about the distilled corniness of some scenes that just broke something in me, and I'm not sure why.

329,musicalfreakpst,Why Freaky doesn't get Freakeehhhh,7,12 February 2021,"For a production company like Blumhouse ""Freaky"" really feels like it knows what it's doing. The first act showed it would be fun! But the sad storyline is something that was all too well present, maybe a bit too much. You have character building and you have story derailing. ""Freaky"" gave us a few good laughs but the writers are trying to hit every stereotype at the same time and also try to break them down. And do the same with the archetype. There could've been so much more from Freaky. I mean if the first Happy Death Day can have Tree die 16 times. You could've made Freaky, 16 times as over the top as this story and film presents itself from the first ""credits roll.""Score: C-",Freaky

332,dontscrewupp,Watch it now!,10,8 December 2020,"Conservatives wouldn't like this movie. But it's okay. It's not meant for them.I never felt like I wanted to be part of a movie fandom as much as I do now. Sign me right now, I wand a sequel and I want it bad.This movie was funny, thrilling and even gruesome at time, all done very tastefully.The characters felt like real people living in today's society. I loved the representation, and how they subverted tropes and the way they even acknowledged the bad ones.Kathryn Newton as Millie, aka Murder Barbie, was funny, relatable and quite literally, a killer. She was such a blast to watch.Celeste O'Connor and Misha Osherovich (Josh and Nyla) were incredible as well. Josh was really funny, and Nyla was an amazing friend.Vince Vaughn as The Butcher... I mean, it was so seamless, switching from one character to the other. I loved him so much as Millie but that's hardly a surprise as I really enjoy the trope of middle age men playing tiny blonde teenage girls.I also loved Melissa Collazo as Ryler. I think she portrayed the mean type of girl perfectly.Uriah Shelton as Brooker on the other hand... can I just say, dreamy? because that's how I felt. Ugh my heart. He doesn't appear a lot until pretty close to the end, but I loved every scene he was in.The ending was so satisfying to watch. Some people might think the later part of it was unnecessary, but I was literally so tensed. I didn't know what's going to happen and I was scared it's going to ruin the entire movie for me. Luckily it didn't, and I loved every bit of it. But I was genuinely terrified there for a second. I was so engaged.It's not a realistic slasher, but that doesn't make it less of a good movie. In fact, unrealistic slashers, such as The Babysitter, are probably my favorite subgenre at the moment.If you haven't watch it yet, trust me, and go watch it now.",Freaky

There were times in the film where I ended up rooting for the killer. I also liked how when you think the film is about to end, you are left in suspense as the movie still continues just a bit longer with that ending scene in Millie's house.I'd give this film a 9/10, pretty enjoyable and easy to follow along.

364,toweblake,"""Freaky"" isn't so freaky",8,25 December 2020,"So, I just finished watching ""Freaky"" and I have to say Vince Vaughn (Blissfield Butcher) and Kathryn Newton (Millie Kessler) made this film. It's hard to believe that Vince can play a better teenage girl than an actual teenager and that Kathryn can go from a sweet girl who is trying to find herself after losing her father to a brutal serial killer. It's amazing what these actors can do, just switching their emotions on and off.The movie takes the viewer on a thrilling chase when Millie Kessler (Vince Vaughn) wakes up in a serial killer's body after she was attacked the night prior. Now it's a race against time to try to stop The Blissfield Butcher (Kathryn Newton) before he kills more of the kids in her school, and take her body back before it's too late!This movie has some of the best acting in a body swap movie I've ever seen. And the soundtrack (by Bear McCreary) For this movie is impressive, it immerses the viewer in the action. The only real complaint I have is that the movie isn't really that much of a horror movie, it's just a little bit gory and they call that ""horror"" while it might be ok for some people it's not for a true Horror fan, it didn't really scratch the horror itch I had going into the film, but despite its lack of Horror or what I believe to be true Horror, I would still recommend the movie to my friends and family who like suspense and a good laugh.",Freaky
365,gemcaptivatedbyfilm,Freaky Is Freakishly Awesome!!,7,14 January 2021,"Freaky is freakishly fun!!
I went into this with low expectations, I thought it'd be a harmless cringe-fest and on some level, it was but in a good way, it's a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, and it's refreshing. If you're into horror and teen comedies like me then it's a perfect mix. I'll be honest I thought it would be mostly teen comedy and very mild horror but it was surprisingly gory and fabulous! I, a lover of all things horror had so much fun watching this film... It didn't hold back. The real star of this film was of course Vince Vaughn... Seeing him as a teenage girl was something I never knew I needed, It was hilarious. He was incredible in this part, just so damn charming and funny. I also didn't know I needed badass, possessed-by-murderer Kathryn Newton but hey, that was great too! I have so much love for her as an actress... I could honestly enjoy her acting in absolutely anything.
Now if you don't go into this with a blank open mind, you probably won't enjoy it. It's not an incredible film, it's not going to win any awards... but it wasn't made for that. It's a fun film. A simple, escape from reality, have a laugh, see some bloody murders kind of film... and it's so refreshing at a time like this. You will enjoy it and you will laugh.
For what it is, it is great.
It's listed as a horror, comedy and thriller... That is exactly what it is.

Vince Vaughn is hilarious and at times scary, depending on who he is at the time. The director, Christopher Landon has a real knack for this usually very difficult genre of horror comedy- he really is able to check all the important boxes for each genre without losing tempo. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the genre. One note- the death scenes are not for the squeamish. They are, at times absurd, but grounded, making them feel realistic. They are also very creative, graphic and at times, elaborate. So, you know, 'viewer discretion advise'...",Freaky
368,hamhauk,A good time was had by all,8,29 August 2021,"Had a lot of fun watching this one. If you're into the slasher genre, it's worth a watch. Brutal kills, silly humor. Doesn't take itself seriously and delivers. Performances were good.",Freaky
369,kransanon,A Much Needed Crowd Pleaser,7,18 December 2020,"Freaky is a fun horror-comedy where you don't have to think too hard and can sit back and enjoy the ride. It has all the gore someone would want in a slasher flick with some creative kills filled with cartoonish reactions. It mashes the genres up in a fun and interesting way while staying completely true to itself.From Director Christopher Landon, Freaky is a fun-filled blood galore. While not perfect, it's still a great entertainer joined together by amazing performances and a decent script. Both the horror and comedic aspects of the film are established well with graphic kills and actual moments of suspense while the characters, especially the leads, react to the absurdity of the situation. The main thing I didn't like was that not too much backstory is given for the killers origins or the ancient knife responsible for the body swap. It's a bit cartoonish as well and that works both in favor and against it at moments. For example, the lead is a despised girl who is constantly bullied in school because she doesn't look like ""other girls."" One day, she ties her hair, puts on a leather coat together with red lipstick, and now she a hot chick who grabs everyone's attention. Though, those are minor things that do not drag down the immensely fun and well-crafted story.Acting-wise, Vince Vaughn is just too good in both his characters and so is Kathryn Newton. They both completely own their characters. Though, as mentioned previously, the lack of development with Vince Vaughn's character is a major drawback. Celeste O'Connor is good as Nyla and so is Misha Osherovich as Josh (Millie's friends). The rest of the cast also do the required decent enough job.A major asset of the film is the brilliantly executed set-pieces when it comes to killing. The Cinematography by Lorie Rose is also decent though it had some lighting issues. The Production Design team also did a decent job in creating the high school set up together with the aftermath's of the killings even if it had to look cartoonish in some instances. Another asset was the Editing which showed great pace in build-up to the story carried all the way to the finish, though, as mentioned before, it could not pick up the exclusion of The Butcher's or the knives back story. The music from Bear McCreary was disappointing, though, as it never gave you the chills of a horror-comedy.Overall, Freaky is surprisingly a really good film filled with a fun rollercoaster of events and thrilling kills. Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton both play their roles excellently, and it could not have been as good without them. It's really recommended. Please Hollywood make more mindless (not dumb), entertaining, movies.",Freaky

The gory scenes are well done, the chasings aren't too bad either. It's an easy movie, predictable but with a good-timed comedy. The characters development (not) it's quite similar to The Hot Chick, same as the root of the plot. But in general is a fine movie if you're not in the mood to be 100% invested and just want to pass the time as you check your phone once or twice, it's perfectly fine.

This is an October 31st Halloween movie which is best enjoyed with a group. It has bits of strong suspense, gruesome action, and constant humour (both intentional and unintentional) which keeps you entertained. Vince Vaughn is both scary and laugh-out-loud hilarious. You never buy the story but Vaughn and Kathryn Newton's characters trigger your curiosity to find out their fate.

I don't read reviews nor do I judge a film off the ratings but anyone who says they don't take some of the praise or criticism to heart before they form their own opinions are just plain lying. Unless you avoid both at all costs. Well going in with low expectations from pretty bad the ratings/reviews I guess I enjoyed it more than someone with higher expectations. I was surprised by how much I loved Landon's Happy Death Day when it was first released because it just looked silly. I also really liked his sci-fi approach in Happy Death Day 2U which is an unpopular opinion apparently.BUT this. I don't know what Christopher Landon was going for here unless he was told by Universal to cut half of the movie out of the finished film because this is my first and only explanation as to what I just watched. It went no where. Mediocre. It was predictable. I thought that the knife (yeah the one on display right at the beginning of the film it still triggers me) would have been a better plot device if we got a story of why it was created and how it was used. As I saw the knife I thought to myself maybe the knife was used for eternal youth by switching bodies with a younger person think The Skeleton Key. EVEN I had a better idea than this films did. I really do hope there's a better version of this film out there because I know Landon can do better than this. Newton's performance was the only thing I throughly enjoyed about this movie. Just more mindless entertainment akin to what I expected from happy death day but again that was a good film.,Freaky

The whole cast was spot on and I giggled and whole heartingly laughed. I've always liked Vince Vaughn and thought he was sadistic as a serial killer and quite adorable as a teenage girl. I recognized Kathryn Newton from Supernatural and thought she did quite a good job as becoming a serial killer. I don't really know how to classify the movie because it was a bit of everything. Less horror, but more campy, funny and at times intense and endearing. Definitely a movie I will watch again.",Freaky
386,Cpaleschi,Freaky Friday Horror Comedy,8,20 February 2021,"If you expect this to be a serious horror then you'll be disappointed, and you're slightly dumber than the average post. It's obviously a comedic take on the Freaky Friday premise (hence the name) and it does a good job.Vince Vaughn does a great job at playing two contrasting roles. There are some cliche moments but on a whole the movie is fun, comedic, silly, a little gruesome and worth a watch.Don't take it seriously and you'll enjoy it.",Freaky

388,lucetta7806,Fun horror comedy,9,7 December 2020,Best horror comedy I've seen in a long time. Vince Vaughn playing a teenage girl in this Freaky Friday scenario was the best part of the movie. The kills are and inventive and full of gore. The beginning plays tribute to Friday the 13th as well as Halloween in the way Vince Vaughn kills and chases his prey. There seemed to be two endings to this movie and I thought the second was unnecessary. But over all it's a great mix of funny and scary which most movies like this seem to miss.,Freaky
389,roxxylrose,Meh,5,24 March 2021,"If you're a teen and haven't seen a body swapping movie before, you'll probably like this. The acting was pretty good (except for the shop teacher). Vince Vaughn was great, as always. The storyline was pretty tired, though. Been there, done it, seen it, bought the shirt, went home, had a weird dream about it, discussed it with my friends and forgot about it for years. Kinda boring. A few laughs. One particularly stupid murder, and a bunch of slasher stuff. Glad the theaters are closed otherwise I would have spent a lot more money on disappointment.",Freaky

Even though there were a few low points. Mostly this movie made me laugh and cheer and cringe and swoon. Most of the kills were epic. Vince Vaughn as the killer was amazing and as Millie omg it could have gone so wrong but was so right. The girl that played millie when she went pyscho mode omgshe nailed it. There a scene in it that made me laugh and cringe spoiler it the booker and vince csr scene it was epic. The supporting cast was spot one. The dialog and acting was superb and then the script and directing was good. All in all this movie was a great follow up to happy death day 1 and 2. Cant wait to see what else he can do.,Freaky

if i were to complain, i would have to complain a bit about the ending. the ending is good, but it feels like a last minute add-on. the ending makes me think that there was another ending for this movie, but they scrapped it last minute.

415,cyclopsandgambit,Another Blumhouse Wonder,9,12 July 2021,"Wow, I don't think I can put into words just how much I enjoyed this film but for you readers I will try.Three films came to mind while I watched this one. The first obviously is Freaky Friday. It has to right? It's an almost direct copy! Well other then the fact this teenage girl named Millie Kessler, a bullied teen from an unhappy home, (She was played excellently by Kathryn Newton) isn't switching bodies with her mother. No that would be too cliché now. She does in fact switch bodies with Vince Vaughn's character known as The Blissfield Butcher. And no that isn't just a friendly nickname given to the towns actual butcher. No this butcher is a serial killer.A fun concept as The Butcher tries to stab Millie and due to the weapon used a body switch occurs and if Millie, now in the body of Vince (which is hysterical to watch) has to stab the butcher now in the body of Kathryn before midnight otherwise the change becomes permanent.Now the second film this reminds me of is Friday 13th. The fact the body change occurs on Friday 13th is but a small reflection, the fact that the butcher is just as fast, strong and near invulnerable as Michael Myers is a much bigger one. He also uses a variety of weapons when his trusted blade is unavailable. Such as breaking a tennis racket in half and jabbing both sides into a victims neck. He also wears a mask, he moves as quietly and effectively as a Michael Myers ninja. The film pays its respect to the film well, including its gore. We see some very bloody deaths in this film, so all your gore fans can sit back and enjoy.The last film and I think the film is mostly inspired by, the movie Scream. Its set in a small town, the killings seem to be exciting news, so is the media attention. We have a small sheriff station and a few scenes seem to replica some of Scream, especially the last kill at the beginning of the film where the girl can hear her parents car pull up, she calls daddy and tries to run to them but is killed and hung up for her parents to find. Sound familiar? It's the opening death of Drew Barrymore.Vince and Kathryn play off each other really well, they also play their switched personalities exceptionally well. ""Millie"" becomes a strong, confident person and dresses to match. She kills people around her with difficulty as she isn't in the Butchers body, so she isn't as strong but that doesn't stop her from fulfilling the Butchers mission to kill. ""The Butcher"" has a equal difficult time trying to convince her best friends of her true identity while looking like the world most famous serial killer. This is where Vince shines through.The side characters in this are also fun, we have a few bully jocks, a popular girl, a rude woodshop teacher and a horror movie cliché of a gay guy and a black girl best friends. What's great about her best friends however, is that they do the opposite to how you expect them to behave, cliché's are breaking all around with this two.The only negative character and by negative I only mean he is a full on cliché and behaves as such and the writers never subvert our expectations with him, and that's the perfect jock that Millie is in love with but is too afraid to ask out who turns out loves her anyway and they kiss and I am assuming live happily together. But I would have liked something different, the only thing that's gives him credit is that he loves Millie even in the Butchers body. But I still think him being her perfect guy and him loving her from the start is just to predictable. Of course that may be me just nit picking.Her mother and older sister are nice additions to the group of characters, the older sister being the sheriff and has grown apart from the family, the mom being too over protective and a depressed drunk because of her husband dying. But they each learn lessons through the movie that see them becoming different people especially to Millie, a fact proven when they team up to fight the Butcher who is now back in his own body. That fight scene was great and was choregraphed perfectly. So props to whoever wrote and produced it.So I guess I did have a lot to write about after all. It was a great film and I have to give props to all the cast, the writers, the production and the wardrobe designers. Christopher Landon and Jason Blum created a new take on a classic and told it with a new perspective while paying homage to other great horrors. I praise you. 9 out of 10 stars.",Freaky
