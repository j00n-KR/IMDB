0,TheLittleSongbird,Yet another classic of the horror genre,10,13 October 2011,"There has been a time that I wasn't really that fond of horror films, finding some had cheap excessive gore, bad acting and scripting and a lack of genuine thrills and suspense. I couldn't have been more wrong, some of the best of the genres are anything but these. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best, it screams horror classic from the character Leatherface to the many times it's been imitated/parodied but never equalled. I think the use of the documentary-style realism is masterful, and the fact it is low-budget makes no difference to me, in fact to me this adds to the gritty, harsh and creepy tone this film conveys. The gore is not at all excessive, in fact its count is quite low, and when it is used, it never feels cheap or gimmicky. The script is razor sharp, the story is compelling and Tobe Hooper's direction is probably Texas Chainsaw Massacre's strongest asset. I was fine with the acting as well, Leatherface is genuinely unnerving. In conclusion, a classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
1,Leofwine_draca,"A masterwork of raw, visceral horror",9,12 November 2016,"This low-budget monstrosity has a gritty feel to it which makes it feel like a documentary - the same kind of realism was also exploited in THE EVIL DEAD, and taken to a logical progression in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. All three films deal with rural isolation and horror, with young protagonists battling to survive against something very nasty in the woods and countryside. Rightly acclaimed as a masterpiece in gruelling terror, the sheer psychological torment taking place in this film got it banned for 25 years in the UK before censors wised up and released it in an uncut form.Violent without being gory, brutal without being graphic, the hype that surrounds this film inevitably detracts from a final viewing, as no film can live up to it. Very much a product of its time, this and THE EXORCIST helped to usher in a new wave of graphic, in-your-face gorily violent horror films in the 1970s in which there were no boundaries. However, unlike THE EXORCIST, it only briefly tampers with nauseating the viewer (the finger-sucking and hand-cutting moments spring to mind), instead brutalising us with an endless psychological assault.The backwoods psycho theme has always made frightening viewing, as indeed the Ed Gein case showed us that these things aren't based in fantasy. Opening with a voice-over telling us that the events are true make this feel even more like a documentary. We learn of corpse-robbing and body snatchers; Burke and Hare are very much still alive, it seems. We then get a quick succession of camera flashes in utter darkness in which we get glimpses of decayed corpses. Coupled with the strange guttural noises, this is a very frightening and disturbing scene which then continues into a beautifully composed yet disgusting shot of a decayed body tied to a graveyard statue, the work of vandals. The film now really begins.The violence is implied rather than shown, and indeed there is little blood in the film; most of the gore is left to the imagination. The last half hour consists of the sole survivor being chased, attacked, kidnapped and taken back to the cannibals' house to take part in a meal, and finally escaping. The non-stop screaming makes this segment extremely irritating and takes a lot of the realism away from things; the hysterical over-acting is amateurish in the extreme. Thankfully director Tobe Hooper gets some great images in the final chase through the woods, in which the pretty, bloodied young blonde girl is pursued by Leatherface, swinging his chainsaw all about. In the end, Leatherface accidentally saws his own leg open (portrayed comically) and the hitch hiker is torn apart under the wheels of a heavy truck - a fitting demise.Hooper's film succeeds in creating a truly unforgettable clan of manic cannibals. There's the friendly 'Old Man', the owner of a gas station who secretly acts as the chuckling head of the family; the insane 'Hitchhiker', who whines, moans, laughs a lot and enjoys killing things; 'Grandpa', the ancient, corpse-like toothless figure who sucks blood, and finally the most memorable of the lot, 'Leatherface', the hulking figure who wears a mask made of human flesh and who carries a gigantic chainsaw. Gunnar Hansen makes his creation an almost mythical figure; witness his final ad-libbed dance in the sunset, another beautiful moment of sheer expressionism. Many words can be used to describe this film; disturbing, frightening, nightmarish, effective, realistic...but the best would simply be to call it excellent. Tobe Hooper would go on to make some more good films (but never as scary as this one) before his career petered out in the '90s.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
2,SnoopyStyle,brings more blood and gore to the horror at the time,8,1 April 2015,"It's Aug 18, 1973. Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), her handicap brother Franklin, her boyfriend Jerry, Kirk and Pam drive their van to visit her grandfather's grave which had been desecrated. They pass through the horrible smell of the slaughterhouse. They pick up a creepy disturbed hitchhiker who slices open his hand. He acts up cutting Franklin and they kick him out. He smears his blood on the van. At the gas stop, they're told that the tanks are empty. Franklin wants to see the old family house but the guy warns against it. They find the old abandoned family mansion but they are taken by the cannibalistic family with the chainsaw welding Leatherface.This along with 'Night of the Living Dead' bring in a new grotesque dynamism to the horror genre. The hitchhiker is crazy weird. The movie is bloody and violent. It's known for the low camera angles pointing up at the girls' behind. The acting is functional considering the amateurs involved. Franklin does need to be played by a better actor. Leatherface is an amazing horror killer. This is more compelling and generally better than one would expect.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
3,kosmasp,Dawn of Terror,6,3 November 2010,"You cannot argue about the impact this movie had on the horror landscape. You can argue about how you feel about it and if you like the movies it spawned (be it sequels or remakes or rip-offs). You can wonder why Tobe Hooper never really made anything big after that (Poltergeist being referenced as a Spielberg movie, though officially Mr. 'berg only produced it).Or you can just sit back and let the terror begin. This being filmed on the same location as his previous film (Eggshells, an experimental feature, that seemed to just exist for Tobe to try things out and then use them to make TCM), is extremely well shot (for the documentary feeling it aims for).Very quick and with some very strange characters and with some odd (acting) choices, this still has quite a bit going for it. Even if you feel it hasn't dated very good, it has dated better than a few other films. Still nowhere near anything Romero and others did (in my humble opinion), but definitely something that you should watch at least once!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
4,gavin6942,"Far Better Than I Expected, and Not What I Expected",8,29 May 2007,"A group of kids pick up a hitchhiker while driving through Texas. After the hitchhiker goes nuts, they get lost and end up at a residence. A most sinister residence, because it is the home of Leatherface and his cannibalistic family.I watched these films in the wrong order. I've seen the remake, the prequel to the remake, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2... but never the original until now. So I got a little surprise because I had figured it would be a lot like the remake or like ""House of 1000 Corpses"". And while it has some similarities to these, it's really its own film.There's a difference between 1970s and 1980s horror. The 1980s had more of a dark humor, even when it wasn't intentional. The 1970s were more gritty, much more exploitative. My point can be made by watching this one and then watching the sequel -- the tone is entirely different. I often cite ""Last House on the Left"" and I'll do it again now -- this is the epitome of exploitative and gritty 1970s film. But ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" isn't far behind.We have the now familiar aspects (the hitchhiker, the house, the chainsaw) but done in a grisly manner. This isn't a ""fun"" hitchhiker who wants to play guitar and smoke -- he's deranged and carries photos of mutilated cattle on him. And this isn't a ""fun"" house with so much blood and gore that it becomes more fantasy than reality -- when the girl comes in contact with the meat hook, you can feel it.What I think this film does as far as horror history is concerned, is it has a lot of running and chasing. Many films have running and chasing, but that is what defines this film -- how far can you be chased by a chainsaw before you can run no farther? Will you make it to the gas station? Will that save you? This film is a classic and a must-see. The most disturbing part for me didn't even involve a chainsaw, but an old man. You'll know it when you see it -- absolutely disgusting. And that's what sells this film. Before the dozens of knockoffs, this was the original and in some ways no remake will ever compare. Do check this out.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
5,jboothmillard,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,8,22 September 2005,"I will admit that when I first watched this film from director Tobe Hooper (Salem's Lot, Poltergeist), I had some expectation, but I thought it was rubbish. Seeing it again, I changed my opinion, and I now know why it is a little low-budget masterpiece. Basically, five friends: Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), Jerry (Allen Danziger), disabled Franklin Hardesty (Paul A. Partain), Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn), are driving to the grave of Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. On the way, they pick up an insane Hitchhiker (Edwin Neal), who acts strangely, at one point cutting his own hand with a knife. Shortly after he uses his razor blade to cut Franklin's arm, the group stop the van and throw him out before continuing their journey. They stop at a gas station to fill up, but they are told that there is no gas, and a delivery will arrive later. They intend to return later, and arrive at the old slaughterhouse, formerly owned by relatives of Franklin. Trying to find help, they stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk enters and hears what sounds like pigs grunting, and then appears Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), a large mute man wearing a mask made of dead skin. Leatherface kills Kirk with a sledgehammer to the head and drags him into the abattoir. Pam enters soon after, and trips up, falling into a room with a caged chicken, and furniture and ornaments made of human bones. She tries to fun away, but Leatherface grabs her, and impales her in the back onto a large meat hook, and in agony, she watches Kirk being butchered with a chainsaw. Jerry leaves Franklin and Sally with the van while he goes to look for Kirk and Pam. He also finds and enters the old house, and is shocked to find Pam still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him with the sledgehammer. When darkness falls, Sally and Franklin set out with a flashlight to find their friends. As they get closer to the old house, Leatherface suddenly lunges out with his chainsaw, and mutilates Franklin in his wheelchair. Sally flees and enters the old house but runs back out after finding the remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface, jumping from the second-floor window, and returns to the gas station. The proprietor, aka ""The Cook"", aka ""The Old Man"" (Jim Siedow) calms her down and offers to help her, but ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, and there is the hitchhiker, revealed as Leatherface's brother, who taunts her. After waking from unconsciousness, Sally has been tied up at the dinner table, with Leatherface dressed as a woman; he, the hitchhiker and the old man antagonise her and mock her screams for help. Sally begs them to let her go and says she will do whatever they want, but they ignore her. They decide to bring down the Grandfather (John Dugan), one of the elderly bodies from upstairs, revealed to be alive. The sick family decide, as the best killer, that Grandfather should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer, but he is too weak. When she gets the opportunity, Sally does make her escape, breaking through the window. She is chased by the hitchhiker and Leatherface wielding the roaring chainsaw. The hitchhiker is run over by an oncoming truck, and Leatherface is hit on the head by its driver with a wrench and accidentally saws his leg. Sally finally escapes, jumping into the back of an oncoming pickup truck, and the film ends with Leatherface angrily swinging his chainsaw. This is supposed to be a really violent film, the most memorable deaths being a guy hit on the head with a sledge hammer, a woman hung on a meat hook in the back, and obviously people mashed up by the chain saw. But you almost never see any blood spill, it is mainly your imagination that creates these gruesome images, which makes it all the more powerful. The film was banned for some time, and the BBFC refused to give it a certificate, but now it is in the public's eye, it is a must-see horror film. It was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
6,Woodyanders,Truly deserves its cult horror classic reputation,9,29 October 2009,"A vanload of kids driving across the country run afoul of a crazed degenerate family of vicious redneck killers in remote rural Texas. That's it for the (admittedly slight) set-up, but the plot is basically inconsequential as this one's really all about creating and sustaining a supremely dark, grim, and unsparingly harsh mood that gets under your skin and makes you squirm like a hapless fish caught on a hook. Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake. Hooper's strong evocation of the bleak, dusty and desolate Texas backwoods projects a profound sense of dread and unease which never lets up for a minute. Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience. The admirable refusal to provide some kind of explanation for why the horrific goings-on occur qualifies as another major asset; instead Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel merely present a stark and unwavering depiction of random gratuitous violence and unbridled savagery as if such horrible things happen all the time. This movie is further enhanced by a wickedly funny sense of black-as-coal gallows humor, with the loony hick clan -- the weary, bitter old man (marvelously played by Jim Siedow), unhinged hitchhiker (a deliciously batty portrayal by Edwin Neal), and the freakish, squealing, gibbering Leatherface (an astonishingly bestial and bloodcurdling Gunnar Hansen) -- serving as a strikingly grotesque caricature of your typical American family. Marilyn Burns makes for a fetching and pitiable luckless damsel-in-distress as Sally while Paul A. Partain contributes a memorably obnoxious performance as the extremely whiny, hateful and unsympathetic cripple Franklin. Kudos are also in order for the wondrous wealth of inspired macabre touches: a chicken in a birdcage, the armchair made out of human bones, and the aged grandfather (John Dugan in hideously wizened make-up) who drinks human blood. The spare, droning and dissonant experimental score by Hooper and Wayne Bell adds substantially to the picture's considerable unsettling impact. Daniel Pearl's grainy, but polished cinematography offers several smooth and sinuous tracking shots that are positively breathtaking to behold. Essential viewing.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
7,Tweekums,A film that proves you don't have to show lots of gore or have a high body count to terrifying.,9,15 April 2017,"As the film opens the radio tells us that there have been a number of grave robberies in a small Texas town. We are then introduced to our unfortunate young protagonists; Sally and her disabled brother Franklin, who are visiting to check that their grandfather's grave hadn't been tampered with, and their friends Pam, Jerry and Kirk. Not long into the film they pick up a strange hitch hiker who talks about the work at the local abattoir before cutting his hand with Franklin's knife then cutting Franklin. They quickly stop and push him out before driving off. Soon they stop to refuel the van but the petrol station has run out; the proprietor says they should wait there for the delivery but Franklin suggests they go to his grandfather's old house. Here Pam and Kirk go off for a swim but the waterhole is empty; they do however here a petrol powered generator at the neighbours' house so go to ask for some fuel. Things quickly get nasty and they are attacked by 'Leatherface'; a hulking, hideously masked assailant. Kirk goes to search for them and meets a similar fate. Sally and Franklin are the next to make the same mistake. Franklin is killed but Sally manages to flee followed by a chain saw wielding Leatherface! Her terrors are only just beginning.This classic horror film has gained quite a reputation for being horrifically gory strangely it is almost gore free but the title and the fact that it was banned for many years here in the UK suggest it must have been horrific. In fact it is very much about what you don't see that makes it frightening; the imagination is more than capable of filling in the blanks. There is also the fact that there is prolonged intense threat; for the last half hour or so it looks as if Sally could meet a grizzly death at any moment. The cast of unknowns to a fine job; Marilyn Burns is particularly good in the role of Sally; she really looks as though she is terrified rather than merely acting. The groups tormentors, a family of cannibals, are a mixed bunch; each frightening in their own way this is especially true of Leatherface; one of the genre's iconic characters. The level of terror is increased by the ordinariness of the setting it is easier to imagine oneself running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere than turning up at a Transylvanian castle! Overall I'd say that while this isn't perfect it is really scary and clearly had an influence on later horror films making it a must see for horror fans.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
8,ma-cortes,A group of youngsters stumble across a psycho family who carries out a brutal and homicidal slaughter,7,8 February 2015,"Classic Terror Hooper film in low budget and lots of violence and gore . An idyllic journey in southern Texas driving a van by a group of young people becomes a nightmare when they pick up a young man . A disgrace is committed and ignoring all the warnings they are looking for a shelter in remote farmland . Later, they wind up in the nightmare clutches of a psychopathic family who kill and eat passing travellers ; finally are relentlessly pursued by maniac Leatherface wielding a chainsaw. As the youngsters are dispatched unceremoniously and mercilessly . This noisy as well as visceral film contains images of graphic violence and may not be suitable for all audiences , viewer discretion is advised. The movie contains a pernicious as well as strong stuff . It packs grisly horror, tension, mayhem, horrible gore and lots of blood and guts. Washed-out as well as granulated cinematography and the camera often assumes a pointedly aggressive stance . Screeching and eerie musical score by means of strange and offbeat sounds . The creepy screenplay by Tobe Hooper and short production proceed a bestial and savage picture plenty of chainsaws , meat-hooks and many other things . The motion picture was well directed by Tobe Hooper.The film is based on real events about the secluded farmhouse of Plainfield (Wisconsin)handyman Ed Gein ,( Leatherface character) who admitted today he disembowelled and butchered the body of old widow, authorities found the decapitated boy hanging in Gein's woodshed, gutted out and strung up by the heels. Investigators have also discovered the head and face of 54 years old woman. Portions of the bodies of ten or more people had also been found among the body parts, human skulls, furniture made of human skill, box full of noses, skin from a human head, a belt made of female nipples, one small skull believed to be that of a six-year-old child. Authorities suspected cannibalism. The Ed Gein grisly killings made horrendously startling to people. The Geins lived a fairly good distance away from Plainfield little town. When we look at Gein's life , we just have this sense of incredible isolation from any human contact, except with his crazy mother. He grew up in a household with an alcoholic and abusive father and a mother who was very domineering. She was a fanatic and did not let Ed or his brother to have much to do with the outside world, because there were sinners out there.The mother denied them any meaningful relationship with the outside world and particularly with women . So Gein grew up with this very powerful ambivalence towards his mother and he developed this resentment and hatred . Gein was looked at as the nerdy kid that his contemporaries would poke fun at, which also tended to confirm for him a lot of his mother's paranoia. Gein's house really was a symbolic representation of what was going on his head. He kept many dentures and human bodies around.Firsly, he started robbing graves. Gein said that he had begun to do this a few years after his mother's death. He almost seemed to take a glee in creating novel artifacts out dead bodies, and various human handiwork .He would make bells made out of nipples and used human shinbones to prop up a coffee table, plus took the tops of skulls and inverted them and used them four soup bowls and upholstered a chair in human skin. Like the film, he cut the faces of corpses and used them as masks and flayed the top of the torso of one of his victims and also created some leggings. After he began to sew together these parts of skin from various corpses, events correctly reflected on this creepy movie.It's followed by various sequels such as ¨The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2¨ (1986) by Tobe Hooper with Dennis Hopper , Caroline Williams , Bill Moseley,¨Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III¨ (1990) by Jeff Burr with Kate Hodge , Ken Foree , Viggo Mortensen , Tom Everett ; ¨The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre¨(1994) by Kim Henkel with Renée Zellweger ,Matthew McConaughey , Robert Jacks as Leatherface .

9,BA_Harrison,"Pure, unadulterated, 100% blood-curdling cinematic terror.",10,9 October 2006,"Oozing death and decay from its opening frames to its intense and gruelling finale, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a tour de force of raw cinematic horror and one of the finest films ever made. Based on the real life story of Ed Gein, a grave robbing cannibalistic murderer, the movie is a dark journey into the depths of sheer hopelessness and absolute brutality.Made on a shoestring budget by director Tobe Hooper, this 1974 classic of screen terror utilises inventive cinematography combined with a truly ominous soundtrack (but surprisingly little gore), to bring to life the story of five teenagersSally, Pam, Jerry, Kirk, and wheelchair-bound Franklin who stumble upon a charnel house occupied by a family of maniacs.Setting the oppressive tone immediately, Hooper commences his gruesome proceedings with a news report about a spate of grave desecrations in Texas, whilst simultaneously showing us a grisly 'work of art' assembled atop a tombstone, made from the decaying remnants of a freshly exhumed corpse.The 'artist' responsible for this macabre sculpture is a crazy hitchhiker, who is picked up by the unsuspecting group of friends, who are on their way to visit a house (which belongs to the family of one of the girls). The hitchhiker is unceremoniously booted out of the van when he goes bonkers, cutting one of the teens with a razor.But he is not the only lunatic in the area, and it isn't long before the hapless youngsters meet the other members of his murderous family, including the legendary Leatherface, a maniac in a butcher's apron and a human-skin mask with a fondness for heavy-duty power tools! One by one, the teens fall prey to the crazy killers, until only Sally is left; she endures a night of terror at the hands of cannibalistic clan, before making a break for freedom, only to be pursued by the hitchhiker and Leatherface (brandishing his revving chainsaw)...The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a relentless assault on the senses which presents its audience with a series of powerful sequences which are guaranteed to shock and disturb. Whether it's the first victim twitching uncontrollably after being clubbed on the head with a lump-hammer, witnessing the next being hung on a meat-hook or watching poor old Sally being held down to be 'whacked' by a cadaverous old man, the nightmarish images of Hooper's movie will stay with you long after the film has finished.Much imitated, but never bettered, TCM is genuinely worthy of its status as one of the most highly acclaimed horrors of all time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
10,Quinoa1984,Terrifying Filmaking,10,10 February 2000,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most horrifying films I have (and will) ever seen. Unlike some other horror projects in the past, this one is based on the true story of Ed Gein, the Wisconsin man who killed people, had some transvestitism (Psycho and Silence of the Lambs were also his creative children), then put their face skin on his (arguabl). The facts are changed around just enough, but that's good because if they showed the real story, people would be puking in the movie theater.The impact of seeing this, even on a small TV screen in my bedroom, at the probably too-tender young age of 12 has never left me. Like Friedkin's Exorcist, Tobe Hooper's gift and intelligence with his film, and what elevates it as grungy, awfully brutal art, is that he doesn't back away from showing us these 'things' – the house where Leatherface and his meat-eating freak-show of a family live at under the guise of a dad that serves BBQ a town over, is filled with decay and rot and weird skeletons.There's one sequence in fact that just has a girl falling into a room in this house where she and a boy wander to – cause it's one of 'those' horror films after all, with supposedly dumb kids wandering where they shouldn't, only these are at least moderately smarter and nicer, if no less fatalistic, than the kids in 80's slashers – and Hooper just shows us this room, almost for a good five minutes of screen time. By the time the Wiley Leatherface shows up it is almost, just *almost* a relief till the hanging on the meat hook comes around.This is a master's class in atmosphere; originally Hooper, for some odd reason, wanted to get a PG rating (!) for the film. And while it's R is not unearned, it doesn't have nearly as much blood as one might expect, or would think if one sees one of the turgid remakes (I only saw the 2003 film and it left a bad taste not unlike from the Grandpa in this movie's underwear). He trusts that his audience won't like everything they see, and that's the kicker: this is the perpetually ""feel-bad"" horror film, yet unlike a latter-day movie like Saw, this is one where we do care about what will happen to this girl, her wheelchair-bound brother (annoying as he may be), and there's even a sliver, just a hint, at some social satire with this van of Texas hippies coming upon the backwoods: the deep-fried Texas cannibal holocaust version of Deliverance.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
11,tavm,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was one really effective horror movie,8,25 August 2008,"Well, after 27 years of curiosity of this controversial cult classic horror movie, I finally saw The Texas Chain Saw Massacre on YouTube which uploaded it a couple of weeks ago. When I first read about this in the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate in 1981 when the movie was re-released, the paper's critic at the time, David Foil, called it ""awful"" and gave a zero rating. I also read in Danny Peary's ""Cult Movies"" book that, compared to Wes Craven's Last House on the Left (which I have yet to see) which to him encouraged the audience to cheer for the killings, we're shocked at them here. No kidding! I especially felt sorry for the wheelchair-impaired Franklin especially when his sister Sally treated him badly before his fate. Sally though, as played by Marilyn Burns, does get the sympathy since she suffers the most especially when director Tobe Hooper cuts to extreme close-up on each of her eyes as she screams constantly dreading what Leatherface and his family are going to do to her. Not sure if I want to say this is a great horror movie but it's certainly one of the most effective ever. In fact, I'm not sure if I could have handled this film when I first read about it at age 13... P.S. Being a Louisiana resident, I'd like to acknowledge that the narrator was New Orleans native John Larroquette.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
12,BandSAboutMovies,Perfect.,10,23 November 2018,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not a movie. It is a force of nature. Where Night of the Living Dead took 1960's horror past giant monsters and gothic monsters into modern concerns within the conceit of zombies. This film doesn't need to exist within the supernatural. In fact, it's so outside the realm of the unreal that so many people think it's based on a real story. Or even is a real film, years before movies like The Blair Witch Project tried to pull stunts like that.
The real stunt of this movie is that it was made in the first place. Filmed in an early 1900s farmhouse in Round Rock, Texas on a small budget, the crew shot the film seven days a week, 16 hours a day, with temperatures that reached 110° F. Gunnar Hansen, who played Leatherface, was really a poet. A poet wearing a dead skin mask for 16 hours a day for over twenty five days straight.The house was filled with real animal remains, animal blood from a local slaughterhouse and furniture made from animal bones. As you can imagine, keeping all these dead things trapped within a poorly ventilated house led to conditions which were anything but fair to the actors.Director Tobe Hooper envisoned this film as a PG related film, so he made each cut work so that you never see any of the actual carnage. But it backfired -- as a result, the film's entire feel is one of brutality. It's actually hard to watch unless you properly prepare yourself for it.""The film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of five youths, in particular Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin."" That opening dialogue, by future sitcom actor John Larroquette for the price of a joint, suggests that the film you are about to watch is true. While it has some basis in the stories of Ed Gein and Elmer Wayne Henley, there never really was a Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was invented by Hooper and writer Kim Henkel. Yet there's always someone willing to convince you that there was.It's actually a pretty simple film. A vanful of hippies comes face to face with a cannibal clan who are being forced out of their way of life by industrialized improvements to the meat processing industry. Despite their astrology, peace and love, they are utterly annihilated and even the strongest of them is driven insane by the end.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that ignores the rules of the hero's journey and characters needing to undergo some personal growth. Everyone is lucky if they survive and even the villains and heroes that do won't make it for long. Modern highways will push their way into the backwoods. Police procedures will improve. And the only work this clan will have is just trying to keep their way of life alive.You can see the bloody influence of this film on nearly every horror film that came in its wake. Hell, Rob Zombie has made an entire career out of trying to remake something a tenth this good. This is a film that oozes malevolence and ill will from the very moment it begins to play.I'm always struck by the fact that hardly anyone involved ever made their money back. The film's original distributor was Bryanston Distribution Company, which turned out to be a Mafia front operated by Louis ""Butchie"" Peraino, who used Chainsaw to launder money that he had made from Deep Throat. The investors did make their money back, but the crew only made $405 each, scant pay for the hell on Earth they went through (Edwin Neal, the Hitchhiker, claimed that this film was more miserable then being in Vietnam and he'd wanted to kill Hooper for some time). After an arrest for obscenity, the cast and crew filed suit against Peraino and were awarded $25,000 each, which came from new owners New Line Cinema.There's a sequel to this film which exists in its own universe. I love that it's everything that this movie isn't.

I find this very hard to believe because this movie hasn't aged a single day. And although cinema has gone through a major evolution in the past 30 years, most nowadays thrillers don't come even close to TCM when it comes to atmosphere and ""creepyness"". This is horror in the purest possible form and it'll rank always high on the list of movies that influenced cinema the most. That's probably why some suckers have decided to remake it... By the end of this year, a new TCM will be shown in theaters and I ask you why ? Is it to satisfy younger fans and blow them away with stunning visuals and sound effects. That isn't necessary at all. The original still has the ability to impress any public...and how !!! The most powerful aspect about this movie is without a doubt the choice of the innocent victims. The diabolical family didn't intend to chase the group of youngsters, they just happened to be there and fell into their hands. It could have been anybody. This form of random terror is usual stuff nowadays but back in 1974, this scared a lot of people. Of course there are many other great elements to find in TCM. For example Leatherface and the rest of his family...( including the Chainsaw ). Never in this movie is really explained what drives them to such madness. Sure you can make up many theories about the fact the closure of the slaughterhouse and such but you'll never a 100 % sure about the origin of the madness. They're freaking maniacs and you don't want to come across them. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one big thrill, in fact. The grave robbing, the terrifying news bulletins and the demonic house ...all these elements contribute in making this movie one of the most memorable and important films ever !TCM is loosely ( better say VERY loosely ) based on a true story. That is to say : Leatherface owes his existence to the horrible serial killer Ed Gein. Without a doubt the most influential psychopath in American history as he was also the base for other horror milestones such as Norman Bates and Hannibal Lector. We have Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel to thank for all the rest of this terrific movie. They've created this low budget piece of cinema and by doing that, they changed the horror industry forever. Tobe Hooper continued making good horror during the 70 ( Eaten Alive ) and in the early 80's he even was a star for a little while ! Steven Spielberg let him direct his production Poltergeist which was a huge success as well.
TCM is coming straight from the best horror decade: The 70's. Very recently we've this discussed this wonderful 10 years of horror here on the message boards of this website. The amount of highlights in this decade is incredible and almost impossible to list...You've got The Exorcist, Halloween, Suspiria, The Omen, The Wicker Man, Last house on the Left, Dawn of the Dead and tons of other immortal titles. Texas Chainsaw Massacre sure is one of them. This version will always be superior...even if the make 10 remakes and a 1.000 more rip-offsGreatest ""rewind""-moment : The character of Pam who fall down in the Leatherface house. When she looks around the camera follows her view and you see nothing but human bones ! Terrific piece of horror",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

15,Theo Robertson,It`s Not A Video Nasty - It`s A Black Comedy,6,19 May 2003,"THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is one of the most infamous films ever made , a film that is often mentioned by people who scapegoat video nasties for much of the world`s problems . This is laughable . And nor does TCM deserve to be lumped together with garbage like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE  and NIGHT OF THE DEMON or all those other video nasties because despite the low budget and technical flaws this is a relatively good film storywise . In fact it`s not really a horror film let alone a video nasty . Okay it follows the same structure as any cheap horror film of having a bunch of teenagers stalked in some dark woods but that`s where the similarity ends . TCM is more similar in tone to DELIVERANCE in having a bunch of city dwellers fight for their lives against rural folk . In fact you could describe it as "" Scooby Doo on acid "" ! Seriously , think about it , a bunch of pesky kids get mixed up in grave robbing and weird backwoods communities . All it really needs is a great dane and an unshaven youth saying "" Yoikes "" , in which case the film would have ended with someone pulling off Leatherface`s mask to reveal the sherrif saying "" If it wasn`t for those pesky kids ....""
So why is TCM so infamous ? It`s because it`s funny . So the humour is in very bad taste , but come on admit it , you laughed when the lad in a wheelchair fell down the hill , you laughed when the hitchhiker started doing his bizarre routine in the van , and you laughed at the end when the truck driver left the rig with that terrified look on his face . You may have felt self disgust for doing so but that`s the whole point about TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - It`s not a horror film , it`s a black comedy",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
16,Hey_Sweden,Retains its status as a horror classic.,10,3 June 2012,"Co-writer / director Tobe Hooper's landmark and extremely influential rural shocker is the quintessential unrelenting nightmare, a movie that ultimately grabs you and then refuses to let go.One of a handful of movies to derive inspiration from the activities of the real-life Ed Gein, it deals with a group of young adults who visit the homestead of a grandfather to two of them, only to find out that some of the local residents are a grave robbing family of cannibals who proceed to terrorize these unfortunate young schmucks.As has been said, the power of the movie comes from the fact that it doesn't really *show* much of a massacre. The body count is respectable, but we never *see* weapons come into contact with flesh that often, or very much blood. Hooper and company lay on the thick and sweltering atmosphere in a movie that perfectly captures the utter desolation of its Texas locations. They firmly cemented the chain saw as an iconic weapon in the genre, and similarly made an icon out of the memorable Leatherface character, played with true physical presence by Gunnar Hansen. The actor also gives him a human element by making him both childish and not terribly bright.After a slow and steady build up, the tension is cranked up more and more until the movie starts hammering away at its audience in the same way that its Final Girl, Sally (excellent screamer Marilyn Burns) is terrorized. It gives all of us a palpable ""you are there"" feeling; its immediacy is such that it's impossible to completely distance ourselves from the madness taking place on screen. It places its worst horrors right in our brains; we can *feel* a hook penetrate a body even though it's not explicitly shown. Beginning with ominous narration by a then unknown John Larroquette, it soon gives us a taste of what's to come with the use of some gruesome imagery. The soundtrack merely adds to the authentic feel without ever distracting from it. The acting from all concerned is decent, although the character of Franklin (Paul A. Partain) certainly can grate on the nerves. Kudos really goes to three of the actors playing the murderous family: Hansen is great, as is the lovable Jim Siedow as the schizophrenic Cook, and the hilarious Edwin Neal as the Hitchhiker, who adds much humour to the production. ""I think we just picked up Dracula"", quips Franklin when he and his companions give the Hitchhiker a ride.Deserving of much praise is the art direction by Robert A. Burns, who gives the home of the cannibals some of the best macabre decorations ever to be seen in the genre. Best of all is the incredibly intense climactic ""dinner"" scene, which is kind of an assault on the senses.The movie has been much imitated over the years, but never equalled.Followed 12 years later by ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""; Lou Perryman, who played L. G. in that film, was the assistant cameraman here. Numerous sequels, prequels, and reboots have followed. None of them, though, have the impact of this initial effort.10 out of 10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
17,Doylenf,"Gripping, disturbing, grainy looking thriller from the '70s...",5,21 April 2008,"Tobe Hooper must have gotten on the bandwagon that began when all the slasher films started a trend in the mid-'60s that continues to this day, getting bloodier and gorier with each new film, only done a little more stylishly by someone like Quentin Tarantino.This one seems more like a cheap exploitation film that capitalizes on the idea of a man running berserk with a chainsaw, intent on butchering whomever comes into or near his decrepit old farmhouse. And unfortunately, he's not the only insane creature. It seems there's a family of butchers who thrive on the killing and torturing of their victims.MARILYN BURNS has the biggest role among the teens that stumble upon a haven of killers and she no doubt earned her ""Scream Queen"" reputation for the way she shrieks violently for the last half-hour or so of the movie. PAUL A. PARTAIN is the wimpy wheelchair friend without a full deck, such an annoying character that his demise comes as somewhat of a relief, although I'm assuming his character was meant to be a nuisance all the way through.Trouble is, none of the characters have likable traits so that caring what happens to them is not a top priority. The accent is strictly on the chills that come from the realistic look of a house full of menace at every turn, a showcase of human bones, skulls, body parts and all that is weird and downright gruesome. In addition, the man with the leather face and chainsaw (GUNNAR HANSEN) is a gruesome enough sight on his own, especially in close-ups.Strictly for those looking for cheap thrills, it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a spine-tingler filmed on a low budget with a cast of relatively unknown players, a grindhouse sort of film that lingers in the memory for all the wrong reasons. Summing up: Be warned, a disturbing film without subtlety or taste--but then, what can you expect from that title? Oddly enough, some call it a cult classic.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
18,preppy-3,THIS is a classic?,1,30 September 2002,"First off I want to make one thing clear...I'm a huge horror movie fan. I love them--old ones, new ones, gory, non-gory...everything. But I really HATE this film!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Five 20-somethings (all of them annoying) are out on a road in rural Texas. They're running low on gas so two of them go to an isolated farmhouse to get some. In no time at all, one is hit in the head with a sledgehammer and the other is hung up on a meat hook. The others come looking and one by one are killed until one is left (Sally well-acted by Marilyn Burns). Can she get away?Hopeless. This film is a mess. The first 45 minutes are very very dull. We listen to these five uninteresting characters yap endlessly about nothing. No insight to their characters or their motivations. One in particular (Franklyn) is VERY annoying--I couldn't wait for him to get it. When they start getting killed, you could care less. They never come across as real people so how can you get upset about their being killed? And the killings aren't ever remotely gory. You hear them,but don't see them. And the constant chainsaw on the soundtrack gave me a headache.Also the acting mostly sucks. The family all overacts (although some of the sounds Leatherface gave did spook me)...Burns gave out the only good performance. Unfortunately she's TOO good. When she's being tortured and abused by the family at the end hearing her screaming and seeing her crying is way too realistic.No gore, no plot, no characters, no point and--most important of all--no scares. A worthless piece of garbage. As one of the previous posters mentioned, the only people who seem to like it are those who saw it in 1974 (when it was really shocking). Most younger people (in their 20s) who I've spoken to who have seen it, don't like it. Not worth anybody's time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
19,poolandrews,"""Everything means something, I suppose."" Good but not brilliant 70's exploitation horror.",6,12 August 2005,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre starts with some rolling text that is there for no good purpose as far as I can see & it informs us that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre takes place on 'August 18, 1973' where a group of five friends are on a fun road trip of some sort, but it's never really made clear what their doing exactly. Because of a recent spate of grave desecration's in the area Sally (Marilyn Burns) & her Brother the wheelchair bound Franklin Hardesty (Paul A. Partain) decide to check their Grandfather's grave on the way & stop off at his old derelict run-down house. After a scary incident with a psychotic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) they arrive at the house where Sally's memories come flooding back, Kirk (William Vail) & his girlfriend Pam (Teri McMinn) decide to head to a nearby creek for a swim but notice a house in the distance which they head for in search of gas for their van. Jerry (Allen Danziger) also disappears towards the creek leaving just Sally & Frankin behind, hours later it becomes dark & when none of their friends have returned Sally & Franklin feel they must go & look for them, instead they find terror & death as they are attacked by the chainsaw wielding maniac Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen)...Co-written, co-produced & directed by Tobe Hooper The Texas Chain Saw Massacre seems to be regarded by many as the best horror film ever made, while it's undoubtedly a good film & succeeds at what it sets out to do I personally don't find it a particularly entertaining or watchable film, in fact I'm probably one of the few people who much prefers Hooper's sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). The script by Hooper & Kim Henkel is a little slow & frankly dull, I found the character of Franklin very annoying & everyone else were just plain bland & uninteresting. This could be down to Hooper & Henkel's attempts to create realistic, gritty & factual down to Earth characters but I tend to think it's just bad writing. No real explanation is given for anything & the film plods along like any other slasher, yes I know this was probably the first of it's kind but that doesn't automatically make it the best. The film is played totally straight & first time director Hooper manages to create some genuinely creepy, unsettling & horrific moments like the way Leatherface is introduced when he kills Kirk, a brutal, short, bleak & minimalist scene which is highly effective. As are some of the interior shots of the Sawyer house with the furniture made of human & animal bones, the grimy dirty bizarre ornament strewn realistic house actually feels like it might belong to the Sawyer family if they had existed rather than feeling like a Hollywood production designers imagination gone wild. The opening sequence is also a stand out moment as Hooper presents a scene in which a rotten corpse is shown through quick flashes & close-up camera shots. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ends rather suddenly & I hated all that annoying screaming constantly coming from Sally for the last 15 or so minutes, at one point I literary pressed mute on my remote control because it was getting on my nerves so much, I'm surprised my family didn't call the police with all the ear piercing screaming coming from my bedroom! Despite it's exploitative title forget about any chainsaw massacres as only one person is actually killed with a chainsaw & there is virtually no blood or gore whatsoever even though there's a decent looking decomposing corpse at the start. Technically The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is pretty good throughout considering the supposed $140,000 budget although it is a little cheap looking at times. The cinematography by Daniel Pearl in particular is impressive with some cool angles, some nice smooth camera movements & some excellent use of light, sunset, dark & camera glare from the sun. The film prefers to rely on background noise & sound effects rather than music which works well. The acting is quite good as well apart from the annoying Partain as Franklin. The DVD I own features various deleted & alternate scenes which would add nothing to be honest if they were put back in. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a regarded as a classic & horror fans should watch it as soon as possible but don't go into it expecting the best film ever which is probably the reason why I was ultimately disappointed with it. Despite all that it does well I just didn't like it as a film that much, I found it a bit boring, certain things annoyed me & got on my nerves & I had the feeling all the way through that I'd seen it all before as I had only watched it for the first time as recently as 2000, after years of hearing how fantastic it was the word over-hyped sprung to mind as the closing credits began to roll.

20,Bunuel1976,"THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (Tobe Hooper, 1974) ***",7,17 October 2004,"I finally managed to watch this after never having had the opportunity to do so on either TV or PAL VHS. Unfortunately, the DVD I rented from a local shop was the R4 bare-bones edition!Amongst other things, I had read that the film was nowhere nearly as gory as it was made up to be and, now that I've seen it for myself, I certainly agree (the first half, especially, is pretty harmless). Actually, what the film has going for it is a relentless tension and a genuine creepiness, particularly during its latter stages (when it really comes into its own as a compelling and heart-pounding horror piece).I realize that all of this may not be anything new to anyone here who has already watched THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE scores of times. Still, to me, while I concede that the film is reasonably well made (particularly some effective quick cutting to accentuate the moments of shock), I would not rank it among my favorites from the genre – it may be a modern 'classic' but it's NOT in the same league as some of the older milestones I love so much (or even contemporaries like THE WICKER MAN [1973], for that matter)!The film's young cast – a staple of the slasher subgenre, and a regrettable one – is, all things considered, not as bad (and useless) as that of later entries. Marilyn Burns in particular acquits herself quite well in a difficult role (where she is driven to such a frenzy by her close encounters with the backwoods family of cannibals that she twice escapes with her life by hurling herself through the window-panes of the house! Ouch!). As for the villains themselves: Leatherface, while under-developed, is certainly a memorable creation (aided a great deal by his unconventional 'costume') but his two brothers I found to be particularly obnoxious and, for me, brought the film down a notch or two. That said, the lecherous wheelchair-bound old man's decrepit make-up – not forgetting the house itself (a veritable character in its own right), with its generally 'sick' décor – do get under one's skin after a while!The various murders and mutilations are depicted in a quite vicious manner – particularly for its time – but these do not, in the end, come off as exploitative (as with most other slashers) because the film, perhaps mercifully, certainly does not linger on the blood and other nasty detail in order to heighten the sensation of the moment. The film's conclusion, then, is satisfactorily harrowing – and a memorable one, in my opinion.I've only seen two other films by Tobe Hooper – the original TV version of SALEM'S LOT (1979) and POLTERGEIST (1982) – but, compared to this, they both seem fairly impersonal if still expertly done (no doubt a result of the over-riding 'influence' of author Stephen King and producer Steven Spielberg, respectively).In the end, this film – the original, the one and only 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' – has not whetted my appetite enough for similar things, certainly not so much that I would want to seek out its (reportedly vastly inferior) sequels…and, least of all, the upcoming remake which promises to be simply god-awful (produced by Michael Bay? What a riot)! That said, I would still love to pick up the R2 SE (from Universal) which, apart from the supplements featured on Pioneer's R1 DVD, also includes the feature-length documentary 'The Shocking Truth' (which has to be purchased individually outside of this region!).",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

But their trip takes a horrifying and gruesome turn they couldn't possibly have imagined. Most of the horror movies I have found genuinely frightening in my life have dealt with things like ghosts, exorcisms, and things that go bump in the night. When it comes to people being chased by lunatics with masks, I usually don't find that very scary. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, however, is a notable exception. It's a truly harrowing experience when you watch this movie for the first time. Or at least it was when I first saw it, years before the countless imitators began cropping up. I'm lucky in that respect, I suppose. I really don't know how this holds up for a generation that has unfortunately seen the copycats before the original. I can only hope intelligent younger viewers will be able to recognize how groundbreaking and shocking this was for its time, and how well it still holds up in today's era of glossy horror movies that offer few scares.It's easily Tobe Hooper's best directorial effort. He paces the film well and builds the tension before the explosive final half-hour, which is just insanity that will have you glued to your seat. His direction is creative and fresh, giving the film a unique look and sound that was unlike anything that had come before. Nothing he would do later (and he would still do some good movies) would match the brilliance of this film. This was followed by sequels, prequels, and remakes. Only the first sequel did Hooper have any creative involvement and it was a completely different experience than this. The majority of these later efforts are garbage made by imitators that only seem to get what made TCM work on a surface level. Marilyn Burns is screaming a lot? Okay, let's have our characters scream even louder and longer! Stupid stuff like that, which only serves to show these filmmakers as the posers they are, not innovators. It's a hugely influential film that ranks up there in the top five horror movies of all time, in my opinion. So many parts of this are iconic and, frankly, taken for granted by many today. If you haven't seen it, please do so on an appropriately dark night. If you're a younger viewer looking to get into older horror films, this has to be one of your first stops.

The current batch of torture porn crap passing as horror films obviously owe much to this film, and they've borrowed certain characteristics wholesale: the fetid, rotten production design; the fixation on human dismemberment and carnage; the depiction of rural Americans as psychotic, deformed cannibals. But the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is better than just about every modern-day horror film in just about every way. Advanced technology has allowed horror-brat directors like Eli Roth and Alexandre Aja to show the destruction of a human body in literal and painstaking detail, but they have no idea how to actually scare an audience. Hooper, by contrast, uses actual skill to suggest much more than he actually shows, and if you think about this film afterwards, you'll realize that there is very little bloodshed. The violence in this film is actually somewhat understated, and it's all the more terrifying for that. I will never forget the first appearance of Leatherface, who thumps a guy on the head with a mallet and drags him down to his lab with all the nonchalance of a butcher readying a slab of meat for sale. Eli Roth would have focused all of his attention on the impact of the mallet with the skull -- we probably would have been treated to an image of the skull caving in and blood splattering the walls. Hooper, instead, understands that it's the casual nature of the killing that's most disturbing -- not the bloodshed -- and that's what he shows. Hooper decided to make his movie about frightening situations rather than graphic gore and as a result created a small horror masterpiece.Grade: A+",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
28,Uriah43,Raw Violence,4,5 September 2014,"Despite the fact that this movie made a fortune and has received all kinds of popular acclaim, I dare say that this movie really isn't that good--especially when compared to similar movies made afterward. Having said that, it is this very fact that makes ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" so special. After all, without this particular movie one wonders if movies like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" would have ever been created. Likewise, it is equally fair to ask if there would have been bogeymen like ""Michael Myers"" or ""Jason Voorhes"" without ""Leatherface"". I doubt it. Now, although this specific movie wasn't the first ""slasher film"" ever produced it certainly did its share toward setting the foundation for the sub-genre that so many horror fans have come to know and love. Part of the reason for this is that viewers during this particular time-period weren't accustomed to seeing so much raw violence on the movie screen. And that's pretty much all that this movie has to offer as there is little character development, suspense or even gore for that matter. Additionally, the acting and the script were all pretty basic as well. But give the devil his due, the director (Tobe Hooper) used quite a bit of imagination and what few resources he had he used to the maximum extent.

It regards a van load of young folks traveling to Texas to check on a grave site after reports of grave robbing. Central plot regards the search for gas and the farm house that homes a family of cannibals including the makeup wearing, chainsaw swinging hulking Leatherface. The first big problem here is that, with the exception of Marilyn Burns, these kids are cardboard. Burns is our vision into terrifying events that include being bound, gagged and held in position to be knocked over the head by grandpa. She spends a lot of time running and screaming and viewers can feel her trauma. While her friends are not interesting the villains steal their moments including Edwin Neal as a deranged hitchhiker, and Gunnar Hansen as the infamous Leatherface whose whirling chainsaw craze is our last witness. Teri McMinn plays the famed victim who is impaled on a meat hook and later found barely alive in a freezer. While story is thin director Tobe Hooper creates realism to the highest degree including a shrine of bones that leads one victim to a nasty hook impalement.

A lot of the film's few positives here are mostly tied to the scenes involving the main killer who is one of the most legendary figures in the genre for good reason here. Vicious, imposing and cruel while displaying a perverse demented streak here with his affinity towards putting on the skin of his victims' faces as a select series of masks for different occasions all make this a truly demented and wholly appealing killer here. That nearly all of the best scenes here come from him isn't an accident, as the film gets in some really chilling appearances here with his first encounter from behind the metal door where he strikes the victim in grisly fashion, hauls the body inside and then emphatically slams the door behind him which is a truly striking image. The other fun scenes here are his other scenes, from the surprise ambushes around the house knocking them off while preparing this for the film's undisputed highlight effort in the chainsaw-wielding chase through the woods. This is quite an extended, action-packed chase through the woods as the film picks up considerably showing this as the thick overgrowth of prickly branches providing a great stumbling block to hold her momentum as the baring chainsaw cuts up the trees in the background to allow her to get further away and into the house which is filled with creepy encounters and chilling chases that makes this scene wholly impressive. The only other facet that works here is the purely demented and bizarre family dinner scene, which is unbelievably original for what goes on there as the psychological torture of them gathering around to mock her hysterical screaming and the physical torture as they let the grandfather drink her blood and try to kill her with the attempted hammering to the head which sets up the thrilling finale. These here make up the film's actual positive posts as there are a few minor flaws here. The film's main issue here is the fact that there's not a whole lot of really impressive elements here since so much of the film comes off as weird rather than scary. The initial encounter with the hitchhiker is a perfect example as he's just plainly demented yet he's supposed to be scary and the scene drags on to an inevitable conclusion which is weird rather than scary. Likewise, the big family dinner is even weirder as it consists of yelling and hysterical screaming that ends up going nowhere as their antics just come off as bizarre more than terrifying, which even more for the fact of the feminine mask worn here. The other big flaw here is the useless amount of time featured in the beginning, as there's a lot of aimless walking around the different locations that don't build up to anything about the characters or getting to realize they're completely deserving of their fates. As well, the lack of graphic action is a problem, but it's still enjoyable enough overall.Rated R: Violence, Language and mild drug use.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
31,AaronCapenBanner,Appalling Horror.,1,2 September 2013,"Tobe Hooper became famous for this shocker about five friends driving their van in the country, who pick up a bizarre hitch-hiker, which leads them to a(seemingly) abandoned house, where a nightmare awaits them all...Though an undeniable cult classic, I found this to be an appalling piece of cinema on every conceivable level. Brutally violent, sadistic, and ugly film tries to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, but instead makes it all so unsavory and nihilistic, that it remains a disturbingly joyless experience. Yet, some people find a chainsaw-wielding maniac entertaining! OK...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
32,Aaron1375,Better than I thought it would be.,8,1 April 2003,"I kept hearing people talking about this one.  Either it was really good, or really bad.  I found it to be a pretty good horror flick.  Not too much gore as one might expect by the title, but all in all it didn't disappoint.  A group of teens are driving through Texas (I don't know why the plot outline says they are hippies) so a brother and sister can make sure a grave of a relative is undisturbed.  Apparently, a lot of bodies have been dug up in the cemetery and some of the bodies have even been put in crude poses.  The brother is confined to a wheelchair...also along for the drive is the sister's boyfriend and another young couple.  After the cemetery they drive along and see a hitchhiker and decide to pick him up.  This would be mistake number one for these rather stupid teens, but hey they are teens so it is realistic that they would be incredibly dumb.  The hitchhiker seems friendly enough at first, but later goes crazy so they dump him and continue on. They then hit a gas station, but there is no gas.  Despite the attendant there basically telling them they would be better off not going to any houses in the area because of the people in the area, the teens do anyway as they go to a house that used to belong to the brother and sister's grandfather.  Once there the couple goes for a swim, but there is no water in the swimming hole, so they go to the neighbors who might have gas and also have a bunch of cars underneath camouflage.  This would tip off most of us to get the heck out, but no the teens proceed to walk right in the house and get killed by Leatherface.  One complaint about this movie is that I think the killings could have been spaced out a bit more, but overall it was a rather good flick.  Though it is pretty sad to watch the teens basically walk right into Leatherface's house and get whacked off.  Only the blond caused him any trouble.  I also wasn't thrilled when Leather face the gruesome killer didn't even seem to be the head of his strange family, but I can overlook that.  This one almost plays out like a snuff film at times, and it is hard to see in some areas, but this just enhances the mood in the movie.  All in all a good movie and a lot, lot, lot better than the only other Texas I have seen...part 4.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
33,Wuchakk,Disturbing iconic slasher about a demented family in rural Texas,6,18 November 2019,"After a van of young people picks up a psycho hitchhiker in east Texas they stumble upon a farm house of crazies, including a burly mute man with a mask made of human-skin.Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) is a seminal, iconic slasher that's genuinely disturbing and horrific because it plays out in a gritty, realistic manner. While some viewers might find a couple of scenes amusing, like Franklin in his wheelchair accidently rolling down the hill and, later, having a hammy fit in the dilapidated building, it doesn't change the fact that this is a serious, unsettling horror flick.By contrast, Rob Zombie's homage (or rip-off), ""House of 1000 Corpses"" (2003), wasn't disturbing or horrific at all because he opted for an over-the-top, cartoony approach. It was colorful and amusing, yes, but not unsettling or horrifying.Other positives include the rural locations, cool nighttime sequences, e.g. the thorn bush, and the effectively photographed women with no raunch: Teri McMinn (Pam) and Marilyn Burns (Sally). They're girl-next-door types, but alluring enough.So this is a standout film as far as serious slasher horror goes and I can understand those who give it a high rating, but horror movies are about more than just scaring & troubling the viewer. For me, the last act is overly one-dimensional, focusing too much on the eye-rolling demonic dirtbag family and a girl fleeing & screaming. It's thoroughly manic, indeed, but also vacuous and uninspiring.The film runs 1 hour, 23 minutes; there's also an 88 minute unrated version. It was shot in east Texas as follows: Round Rock (house), Bastrop (gas station/BBQ shack), Leander (cemetery) and Watterson (slaughterhouse). The house has since been moved to Kingsland and refurbished as a restaurant.GRADE: B-/C+",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
34,The_Void,The epitome of horror,8,4 October 2004,"In technical terms, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a bad film. The acting and the script are terrible, and the production values are extremely low. Not only that, but the film lacks any real plot and the characters are so badly done that we can't care for them at all. So then, why is this film one of the most important and influential that cinema has to offer? Why does it have legions of fans, why has it become one of the most imitated films in cinema history? Because it's absolute pure, balls to the wall, uncompromising, unflinching horror - that's why! In fact, it may even be the 'purest' horror film ever made. There is nothing here but horror, and that gets a big thumbs up from me. And every other horror fan, I'm sure. The film, loosely based on the American serial killer, Ed Gein, features very little in the way of gore, but masses and masses in the way of suspense. At times, like the part of the film that sees Leatherface chase our heroine, chainsaw in hand through the woodlands of the area that surrounds the killer's house, the suspense is so tense that it's hard to watch. The sequence itself actually doesn't last long, but because it's so nail-biting, it feels like it lasts for hours. The films plays like this for the majority of it's running time; it doesn't show the chainsaw tearing flesh, but it does show you the build up, and, at times, brief imagery depicting what is happening; and that's all we need. The film is very brutal and it is not an experience that you will easily forget; the scene that sees the almost deceased grandfather suck on a young girls finger is an image that I personally will never forget. The majority of the characters in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre aren't worth mentioning, with two exceptions; Franklin and, of course, Leatherface. Franklin is, probably, one of the most annoying characters ever created in cinema. So annoying, in fact, that you'll be over the moon when he gets it. In stark contrast to Franklin, Leatherface is the absolute star of the show. Like the film itself, Leatherface is brutal. From the ungraceful way that he moves, down to the cold and animalistic way that he behaves, Leatherface is the epitome of terror. When coupled with the movie's weapon of choice, and my personal favourite - the chainsaw, it takes the character into a whole different dimension. The chainsaw is a piece of kit that takes on a life of it's own when it's engine is revved. It screams terror, and Tobe Hooper obviously knew this from the callous way that the weapon is brought to life in this film. There isn't much else to say about this film that hasn't been said a million times before, so I guess all there is left is - watch it! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a film of such majestic importance that it should be made a crime for any fan of cinema not to watch it. Highest recommendations from me.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
35,mm-39,Not bad,7,23 August 2000,"This movie was done by a University in Texas with student actors and a very low budget; comparing it to the Blair Witch Project this one blows it away.  For what they had to work with its not a bad film.  When it came out in 74 it must have been a  fresh and original film.  It's been copied so many different ways by other movies and I consider that flattery.  My wife jumped a few times and she never does that with movies, and you could see where the Blair Witch got the scary idea of running threw woods from this movie. Cutting to the chase, what scares the viewer is some crazy chasing you with a chainsaw. Its been done before with guns, knifes, and masks, but a chainsaw threw the woods, at night ads extra for the film.  Its low budget,there is no Michael Cane in this film, and by far its not a 10. This film compensates with camera angles (close ups of eye balls) and urban stories about events that happen in different parts of the country.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
36,HumanoidOfFlesh,A morbid masterpiece of gut-wrenching horror!,10,24 October 2001,"Tobe Hooper created one of the most terrifying,disturbing and realistic films in horror genre history.There's a very little visible violence in this film,but the atmosphere of sheer dread and terror is simply overwhelming.""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is loosely based on activities of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.Gein,a necrophiliac serial killer and devotee of the wartime Nazi concentration camp medical experimentalists is thought to have inspired the Alfred Hitchcock thriller ""Psycho""(1960)and two low-budget horror movies ""Deranged""(1974)and ""Three on a Meathook""(1972)by his macabre deeds in the late 50's.On one occasion he plundered a Wisconsin graveyard by night for edible body parts,and flayed one corpse to fashion a waistcoat souvenir.Some time later,when police called at his house to question Gein about a missing elderly woman,they discovered the gutted torso of one of his earlier female victims hanging from the beams.In the basement of his house parts of human bodies hung from hooks on the walls,in the kitchen the refrigerator contained frozen body parts.Oh,and there was an armchair...with real arms.So it's really obvious that Leatherface brilliantly played by Gunnar Hansen was influenced by Ed Gein.The cinematography is grainy,even ugly-looking at times,the music composed by Tobe Hooper is genuinely creepy and the acting is brilliant.""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is a REAL horror,and also an overwhelming assault on the viewer's senses.10 out of 10-surely they don't make them like this anymore.Along with ""Last House on the Left""(1972)and ""Cannibal Holocaust""(1979)this is one of my favourite horror movies from the 70's.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
37,StevePulaski,"A landmark, masterwork for the genre, that is unfit for any star rating.",8,8 January 2013,"Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a viciously brutal exercise in horror, yet can be considered one of the early masterworks of the genre that paved the way for the slasher character to take effect along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It accentuates a low-budget, gritty feeling of dread by not only dropping us into a seamy, hot climate, but giving us group of characters whom we intimately focus on in the beginning before left to mourn their deaths by the rolling of the credits.Our story is slim, like many horror films, centering around a group of five friends that venture out to the countryside to investigate reports of a grave being defiled. The grave in question belongs to Sarah (Marylin Burns) and her paraplegic brother's (Paul A. Patain) grandfather, and upon finding the grave, they intend to explore an old family home that belonged to one of Sarah's relatives, which is where they encounter Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), a vicious, masked killing with a chainsaw as a weapon of choice and his family of sociopathic, cannibalistic murderers that unleash their unbelievably gruesome fury on the five innocent victims.Tobe Hooper gives us time to spend with these characters, more-so than I was expecting. the scenes with the hitchhiker, who they pick up early in their excursion just to discover he's a sick, twisted soul, give us roughly fifteen minutes of dialog, only necessary to the viewer that wants their deaths to have a bit more of a ""pang"" effect. It is when you explore horror cinema of the 1970's and 1980's do you realize what is sorely lacking from the genre in today's time. Not only are we given significantly less films of the genre today, but we are subjected to gimmicky ""advances"" such as 3D, lame scenes of torture, no characters, stock villains, excessive gore, and, worst of all, not the slightest shred of consuming dread or suspense.At least we can say with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, we were provided with what would serve as long term building blocks for the horror genre. To argue over which slasher film implemented the best style and worked the best is entirely subjective and open for some strong debate. Contrasting, say, John Carpenter's Halloween is a difficult one, seeing as while it was still a slasher film, just in the genre's very early state, it was polished, complete, and looked almost like a project along the lines of seventies film noir. Not a gory, brutal horror film to which it would appear.Hooper uses grit and realism to portray his atmosphere, while Carpenter used stylistic measures and defining camera angles. Both films share the characteristic of a low budget, while Halloween ($325,000) chose to use it in a more cleaned up, stylish way, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, shot for less than $300,000 on 16mm, chose to heavily utilize film grain, slow moving video, and a lot of rough, scratchy sound.Probably the most noticeable use of the scratchy sound comes during the end sequence, when we hear a lot of blood-curdling screams and shrieks of terror. This is when The Texas Chainsaw Massacre becomes alive, showing not only the gruesome torture, but showing it in a way that is unnerving to the audiences. This was one of the first times we felt like voyeurs in the audience; witnesses to crime that went unsolved and unpunished, and we just sat there and took it in. Shame on us? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a landmark, masterwork for the genre, unfit for any star rating I can think of. I'll compromise at three; for a film this unique, gratifying, and truly horrific, a star rating should be the least of anyone's concern.Starring: Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Allen Danzinger, Jim Siedow, William Vail, Teri McMinn, and Gunnar Hansen. Directed by: Tobe Hooper.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,The definition of fear... remind me to not accept that invite to dinner that Leatherface sent me,10,19 May 2002,"Texas Chain Saw Massacre, this movie is a legend in the horror genre. I have heard so much about this movie, the interesting thing is, my mom told me it's one of the bloodiest movies she's ever seen, then she paused and said ""Wait, actually there wasn't that much blood it's just creepy"". So I had to see this movie, was it really that scary? Is it really that bloody? Is it really that creepy? I had to see for myself, so of course I bought the movie, it was on sale, watched it during the day, not much effect, was pretty disappointed. But then my friends came over and we wanted to watch a scary movie and they all saw that I had The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, we turned off the lights, turned on the surround sound and then the screams came as I realized this is one messed up movie! Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin travel with three friends to a cemetery where the Hardestys' grandfather is buried to investigate reports of vandalism and corpse defilement. Afterward, they decide to visit an old Hardesty family homestead, and on the way, the group picks up a hitchhiker. The man speaks and acts bizarrely, and then slashes himself and Franklin with a straight razor before being forced from the group's van. Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming hole, and the couple heads off to find it. Instead, they stumble upon a nearby house. Kirk decides to ask the residents for some gas, while Pam waits on the front steps. Receiving no answer but finding the door unlocked, Kirk enters the house and is immediately murdered by Leatherface. Pam enters soon after to find the house filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee but is caught by Leatherface and impaled on a meat hook. At sunset, Sally's boyfriend Jerry heads out to look for the others. Finding the couple's blanket outside the neighboring house, he investigates and finds Pam still alive inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface appears and kills him, stuffing Pam back inside the freezer afterward. With darkness setting, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the killer's house, calling for the others, Leatherface lunges out of the darkness and murders Franklin with a chainsaw. She is captured and invited to Leatherface's house for a family dinner she'll never forget.Movies from the 1970's are so special to me, the reason why I think some of the greatest horror movies came out of that decade is due to the fact that directors didn't hold back like today. Most directors of today's Hollywood are too scared of the censors or go too far and make the audience gag rather than scream. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre I'm sure Tobe Hooper wasn't exactly expecting this movie to become the classic it has. Leatherface is frightening and I'm not so sure I'd accept an invitation from him and his family for dinner. I think they made the Manson family look like the Cleavers, you haven't seen a horror film until you've seen The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.10/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Still I probably say this old classic was the best not just because of it's first born, but for the fact of it's blood and real terror realism as they just don't make a film like this anymore as this 1974 gem was done in it's own way actually this picture would change the way torture horror would be done. Set in rural Texas on a hot August weekend five youths cruise around on a getaway in the country only to wonder and fall upon an old house of a masked butcher(leather face)and his grave robbing skin flesh eating family!

It was not bad to watch all these years later... not as good as I remembered it to be though - maybe I've seen to many horror films but it's just not as good these days as it used to be for me.

Despite its pretty fearsome reputation, it's not a very gory film at all (although, I'm sure many have sworn they witnessed lots of blood-letting, such is the movie's power). But this is still a pretty relentless bit of horror cinema that certainly puts its audience on edge. The most standout aspect to me is in spite of having a very low budget this is really a very well made film indeed. Tobe Hooper directs the thing perfectly and the story about a group of young people coming accidentally across a group of psychotic ex slaughterhouse employees is told with uncanny skill. Events unfold in a beautifully macabre fashion, helped immeasurably by a very effective dissonant soundtrack of sometimes experimental noise which captures the mood and place, while the cinematography is really excellent too with potent imagery and a great sense of framing. Low budget film-makers today could learn a lot from watching this film I can tell you.The story is loosely based on the events surrounding the notorious Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, although, we are talking very loosely, as Hooper has used this source to create something which would have been utterly new in 1974. It's often the little details that stand out like the opening close-ups of the sun accompanied by avant-garde music, a cemetery vandalised in an obscene manner, a shot of a dead armadillo and a strange conversation with a sinister drunk in a cemetery. The shots of the slaughterhouse and the talk of men being put out of work there by machines adds social context and lays the scene for what is to come. Later we see menacing details like piles of bones on doorsteps, an abandoned tent with camping gear bizarrely tied to a tree and a loose human tooth on a front porch. All these little imaginative details are beautifully added into the mix and slowly build up to what is still to come. Of course once we meet the homicidal family and the terror that follows that encounter the film's horror credentials cannot be faulted. This includes Marilyn Burns being pursued at length by the brilliantly macabre Leatherface replete with chainsaw and the grotesque borderline surreal dinner table scene which includes Grandpa, the ancient corpse-like killer.Basically, this is an out-and-out classic film, with a powerful imagination and young film-makers using their low budget to maximum effect. It has huge amounts of atmosphere and sense of place (the rotting Texas environment is one of its chief strengths in actual fact); it looks and sounds great; while its horror ideas were a fantastic new shot in the arm to the genre and remain influential to this day. It remains a brilliant achievement and always will be.

What surprised me while watching this movie, is the lack of gore in it. And I thought this movie was gonna have LOTS of blood and gore.

It's possibly the best movie of this type I have ever seen. It just seems too outlandish and too over the top to give it a perfect score. And yet, at times (and for a good part of the last half hour or so) this movie isn't just frightening - it's downright terrifying. Director (and co-writer) Tobe Hooper did a marvellous job of building this from a quiet and almost slow beginning (which was effective in and of itself) into a movie that causes you to squirm, wince and turn away on a regular basis - and he does it all with the use of fear rather than gore, because there's actually surprisingly little gore involved in this. This movie is about terror - pure, primal terror, absolutely superbly depicted by actress Marilyn Burns, who played Sally, who's the last of the main characters to meet ""the family."" Her performance and moreso her depiction of terror is absolutely chilling.As I said, the movie starts slowly. A narrator actually begins, reading words that are already displayed as white letters on black background. What could be more everyday and even pedestrian as that. The narration gives this a cold, perhaps dull, and definitely ""documentary"" feel. The opening scenes are creepy rather than frightening - a graveyard has been desecrated; corpses interred and dismembered - but no explanation as to why or by whom. Five young people come on the scene. Travelling in a van they chat about life - and a lot about horoscopes. Capricorn is being captured by Saturn, or some such astrological mumbo-jumbo, but we get the point - things are out of whack in the cosmos, and something bad is going to happen. Picking up a weird hitch-hiker along the way, the five are introduced to this strange family of psycho cannibals, and the terror ensues. The first appearance of the killer makes you jump, and ultimately leads to a last half hour that is absolutely riveting, and no less exhausting as we watch Sally desperately trying to escape from this madness that she's fallen into.I loved the ending to this. There are no loose ends tied up; and there's not going to be a dead killer coming back to life. In the end, the terrified Sally simply escapes in the back of a pickup truck while her chainsaw wielding pursuer runs after her and then, having given up, waves the chainsaw around madly. Sally is left terrified. The movie ends abruptly, but somehow you're left satisfied that you've been taken on one of the great rides in horror movie history. Wow!

They run into a hitch-hiker and decide to give him a lift. Bad idea! It no time at all, they realize how crazy their new passenger is. But he's nothing compared with the rest of his family that our band of travelers is soon to encounter. They'll have to fight to stay alive or they'll become victims of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.If you were to ask me about what makes The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a horror classic and such a well remembered film, my answer would be even simpler than the movie's plot. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has an intensity that few (if any) horror movies can match. In a nutshell, that's all there is to it. The intensity comes from the raw, gritty, brutal feel of the movie that, once the family is introduced, does not let up for a moment during the second half of the movie. Another contributing factor to the film's visceral edge is its realism. From the acting to the sets to the lighting, it all has a realistic, almost documentary feel to it as if the horrifying events on screen were actually happening. It is a gut-wrenching experience that never fails to leave me feeling drained. And isn't that the intent of a movie like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? As far as I'm concerned, this is what horror is all about.I would be remiss if I wrote something on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and didn't mention Marilyn Burns. Her performance is quite simply amazing. Some argue that all she does in the second half of the movie is scream. Well, have you ever tried to do that? Have you ever tried to look terrified beyond all imagination for that length of time? Her only defense mechanism against the terror she faced was to scream and Burns does that to perfection. I have no difficulty at all in proclaiming it one of the ten best performances by a female in a horror movie. She's just that good.I try to restrict the 10/10 ratings I give out to those movies that I consider to be the best of the best. I want it to mean something. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the movies I'm quite comfortable in rating a 10/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Always picking up on little details I missed before, mainly technically speaking or my perception of mood and attitudes of characters/situations are changing. The simplicity of raw rural low-budget horror in its build-up and pay-off has never felt as pure, maniac and threatening on what is an intense nightmarish awakening from the everyday mundane.

Vast open spaces, nonchalant toiling is broken up by abrupt impactful violence before morphing into chaotic suffocation and monstrous wickedness, as everything gradually spirals out of control to the point of no coming back. From the eerie opening with the bulb flashes, camera clicks and stolid narration detailing the true to life facts of the tradegy to become through to the naturally ponderous conversations between the soon to be victims, Leatherface slamming the metal door shut after his startling first appearance and the final third of the film when the anxiety and madness breaks out the sheer emotional torment was simply heightened on the big screen and surround sound. The experience was outstandingly shattering... just listen to that chainsaw go! That finale going from Sally's crazy laughter of relief to Leatherface's swirling chainsaw dance of frustration is what horror is all about. Loved every minute of it! Yep, that also included a whining Franklin.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
47,paul2001sw-1,Groundbreakingly nasty,8,13 February 2006,"When I was at (an all-boys) school in the 1980s, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was the film that everyone had to claim to have seen to prove they were hard, quite a feat given that the movie was already ten years old. But it was undoubtedly years ahead of its time. With its naturalistic, off-focus story telling, the absence of a score (the chainsaw provides its own grim music), its hapless teenage protagonists, and with the way (for the first half of the film) that everything is conveyed by suggestion, not what we actually see, it could be as modern as 'The Blair Witch Project' were it not for the very 70s clothing and hairstyles. On the downside, the acting is poor and the plot simplistic to the point of junenivility (for this movie, it surely doesn't really count as a spoiler to say that is basically involves a bunch of psychopaths cutting people up). Yet when the film shifts gear and transforms itself into more of a ""conventional"" horror movie, it does so with such conviction, and such utter repulsiveness, that it still stands out almost unparallelled. Although the whole experience has clearly been contrived to shock, it still succeeds in doing so, a deliberate piece of nastiness that slices through the viewer as the eponymous chain saw slices through its victims. I'm glad that all films aren't like this one; yet in it's own way, it stands as one of many landmark films from American cinema's glory years.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
48,Pjtaylor-96-138044,PG? No way.,7,24 December 2020,"Bizarrely, this incredibly effective early slasher is the result of director Tobe Hooper's attempt to make PG-rated horror, a rating that this intense and somewhat gruesome flick couldn't achieve in its wildest dreams. That isn't a bad thing, though; 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)' opts to keep its most grisly images off screen, ironically making them all the more impactful. Don't get me wrong, there's still quite a bit of violence and gore here (see its surprisingly powerful opening featuring rotting corpses arranged like macabre marionettes), it's just that it's nowhere near as graphic as many other entries in its genre. Its focus is firmly on atmosphere. Its third act is deliriously tense and exciting, a nasty and over-the-top fight for survival. In fact, it's the last few minutes that stand-out as the affair's absolute best. These alone are some of the most engaging and affecting in the slasher genre, somehow transcending their potentially hokey nature to be truly affecting. The film as a whole has the uncanny ability to both get under your skin and pull you to the edge of your seat. It's a really good horror movie. 7/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
49,ThomasDrufke,I've Got Barbecue,8,14 October 2017,"In my opinion, horror films actually end up aging pretty well, especially low-budget ones. There's something about the grainy, inexpensiveness to the early days of horror that I always find really creepy. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is no different. Everything from the unknown cast to the real-life inspiration for the story, this film feeds off a truly terrifying vibe.At a mere 80 minutes in length, the runtime flies by. There is no slow burn here. Once the group of friends reaches their destination about 20 minutes in, the film goes off the rails for the rest of the time. Inspired by real life events done by Ed Gein, Leatherface proves to be one of the most menacing horror villains of all time. Rarely ever saying a word, and if he does it's extremely mumbled, he terrifies with his size, his unforgettable mask made of human flesh, and of course a chain saw. It's always difficult to review films that were pioneers for their genre. Much like Psycho, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre changed the horror genre and inspired many slasher films thereafter. And similar to most horror films now in days, it has the common ""last girl"" theme to it as well. All of the unknown actors are okay, especially without given too much material to work with, but Marilyn Burns is a force to be reckoned with here. Watching her both physically and emotionally go through terrifying event after terrifying event was a thrill, and it mostly has to do with her acting. If there was ever an actress who nailed the ""horror scream"", it was Marilyn Burns.Overall, TCSM is a horror classic. It delivers scares (and not meaningless jump scares), blood, twists, and creativity. I doubt I'll ever have the will-power to sit through this one again, but it's certainly worth a watch.8.2/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

What a macabre, horrifying film this is, with eerie tension from the beginning. I was surprised at just how good the production quality was - the cinematography, editing, and sound design are all fantastic. Even the performances from the no-name cast are solid. The references to the slaughter of animals and the way the murders are carried out, without remorse and with people treated as animals, put humanity in an evil, cruel light (and I hope make more people give up eating meat). It was clearly influenced by Psycho but itself was highly influential to the genre, and this is an elevated, intelligent slasher film.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
51,ericstevenson,Does it hold up?,8,1 October 2017,"We begin Slasher Month with one of the most beloved slasher movies of all time. Unfortunately, there aren't that many of them in general. What I love about this film is the atmosphere. The director knows how to set up a creepy world. The funny thing is that two people are killed with a sledgehammer and only one with a chainsaw. I guess ""The Texas Sledgehammer Massacre"" doesn't sound as good. The villain is known as Leatherface, although he's never actually referred to that in the movie itself. The pacing is probably what sets this film up so well. Leatherface doesn't appear until a third into the movie.We actually get really good buildup and scenes that actually end up mattering later in the story. The best scene is of course the one where the woman is tied up. This is where we get great camera angles and a mood that makes it seem like we're right there in on the action. I'm reminded of a horrible film ""Chaos"" and how this one did a violent premise much better. This movie didn't contain any nudity or rape so it's of much better taste. It doesn't feature everyone as an irredeemable jerk and it has at least one person make it out at the end.

54,CuriosityKilledShawn,Amazingly bad!,1,6 May 2004,"(There may be some spoilers here so beware.)Honestly, I thought it was a joke. I really didn't think this was seriously the movie everyone raved about. It's TERRIBLE! I mean it's really, REALLY bad. How on earth ANYBODY could enjoy this film is far beyond my vast, vast, incredibly vast understanding. It so bad you cannot even laugh AT it.
First of all the film's so called 'gritty' look is, plain and simple, the result of the shoddiest photography this side of 70's [adult films]. The framing is horrifically composed and makes a drunken wedding video look like Laurence of Arabia. The sound is inaudible and the dialogue, worthless as it is, is nothing more than mumbles. As the 'story' develops so does the incomprehension. Mid-way through you'll tell yourself 'This cannot become anymore senseless.' Well it does. By the end you'll be completely lost and then...it's over. Just like that. I was assuming there was half an hour left but it just ends without resolving anything or giving us the payoff we deserve. What a rip-off!There is also ZERO suspense. Characters are killed almost right away leaving no room for excitement. Plus there is only ONE massacre with a chainsaw and you don't even see anything and it mostly occurs off camera. The final chase with the one character that actually gets some interaction with the bad guy is obviously the best bit of the movie but by this point I just wanted it to be over.I've no idea why so many people say this is a great movie or call it 'horror with a dark comic edge'. It's nothing of the sort. It's an embarrassingly amateur schlockfest that Ed Wood himself would disown. Check out the 2003 remake which is a zillion times the movie this dreadful nonsense is. Do not come within a mile of this! You have been warned.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

56,callanvass,"""A Whole Family of Draculas""",8,30 November 2014,"Five friends decide to visit their Grandfather's grave that has been desecrated in ritualistic fashion. Things aren't going so well, because they had to lug their handicapped brother, Franklin along with them. To make matters worse, they are shaken up by a sadistic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) . The real nightmare begins when they go to their old family house and they encounter a chainsaw wielding maniac. This is NOT one of my favorite horror movies! I think it's overpraised and dated, but it is a pretty good horror movie. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. Leatherface has never been one of my favorites for some reason. I find him dull compared to some of the other horror icons. It isn't a fun film by any means! It has an amateurish quality that works in its favor, but also hampers it in ways as well. This is just raw and gritty filmmaking, and I certainly have to give it credit for that. This felt like real terror. It also has a subtle, yet creepy score that chills you to the bone. They didn't have a huge budget to work with and they managed a solid horror movie. My main problem with this movie, is that it's somewhat dull at times. It's never ""boring"" , just a few too many scenes with characters wandering around with boring conversation. Some will call that effective, I call it meandering. This was a product of its time, and rather daring back then. By today's standards, it comes across as somewhat tame. It's disturbing, don't get me wrong. I just think the sequels and subsequent remakes have tarnished its reputation. They really lucked out because of the excellent use of location. That big house is very eerie! I don't know if I'd call it a fluke, but Tobe Hooper hasn't done anything as successful as this. He was certainly feeling it during this movie! The shots during Sally's torture scenes are very hard to endure I don't know what happened, but Tobe seemed to lose his touch after this. There isn't much gore in this movie, but there is disturbing things. Marilyn Burns legitimately cut herself on the branches, while filming. People are bludgeoned to death, and more. It's not very gory, but it doesn't really need that much of it. There are some throwaway characters, but there is a few performances that truly standout. Marilyn Burns is overshadowed in some ways, but she deserves all the praise in the world. It must have been emotionally and physically exhausting to play that part. She came through big time and screamed like a champ. She's pretty easy on the eyes as well. Gunnar Hansen is the original Leatherface! He deserves critical acclaim for that alone. The weird pig noises were creepy and he was very intimidating! Paul A. Partain is both sympathetic and annoying. That being said, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. He's in a wheel-chair, so that makes it hard for anyone to hate him. It was a dynamic performance in my opinion. Edwin Neal is a scary SOB! I will never pick up a hitchhiker, solely because of this performance. You won't forget him anytime soon. Jim Siedow yells too much as the Cook, but he played his part well. The last 10 minutes are legendary! Especially the last 5 minutes. The last scene of Marilyn Burns on the getaway truck, maniacally laughing, is classic! Despite that it isn't one of my favorites, I did give it a lot of praise. It is somewhat overrated, but it does a lot right as well. There is a reason why it became so popular among horror fans! I'm not afraid to admit that. It should be mandatory viewing to watch this movie, if you're a horror fan. 8.4/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

62,TheMovieDiorama,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the most influential horror films of all time.,7,28 February 2018,"It's horrifying imagery is notorious for having the film banned in many countries upon release back in 1974. Years later, audiences adapted to the horror genre and can fully appreciate how this film changed the game for future horror films. The plot is simple. Group of youths are on a road trip, run out of gas and stop by a local gas station. They explore and encounter the horror icon that is...Leatherface. A chain saw wielding psychopath. One by one, the innocent souls are slaughtered by gruesome methods. Hammered to the head, spiked on the back and of course, chain sawed to death. Disturbing, visceral and terrifying...surprisingly this has not aged well. I do not doubt its influence and I admire the courage and bravery to make such a daring film back in those days. Yet for some reason, it just seems ridiculously outdated. It's not the late Tobe Hooper's fault, in fact his directing talent is what made this rather captivating. The constant quick zooms (whilst in tracking shots as well), extreme close ups of bones and eyeballs, the infamous scene of Leatherface swinging his chain saw like a wrecking ball (would pay to see Leatherface imitate Miley Cyrus). It's a fresh unique style and it works so well. Then the implementation of intrusive sound effects that just invade your eardrums. Absolutely effective and heightens the lunacy of the whole situation. The use of gore was subtle, there isn't tonnes of blood...rather a minimal amount I would say but it still looked savage and brutal. I appreciate the quick deaths, it didn't feel Hollywood. Whack, hammer to head. Done. Bye bye. Next victim please. Its cold smooth efficiency is what made Leatherface and the film terrifying. The major problem is the amateurish acting. Now don't tell me ""oh it was 1974, acting was always bad in horror""...Rosemary's Baby was 1968.

66,insomniac_rod,The neverending myth. Time made justice to this movie.,10,23 August 2004,"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is part of the exclusive group of the considered ""The Best Horror Movies of All Time"", and it's place is very well deserved. TCM started the cannibal craziness that became very popular in the 70's and changed the horror genre without advice. Plus, Leatherface became an important icon to the genre. Tobe Hooper and Tim Henkel squeezed every cent of the ultra low budget they counted with to produce the movie. The result is one of the best horror movies ever made. Call me heretic but I consider TCM at the pair of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Psycho"", the most respected horror movies of all time. What these three horror masterpieces have in common is that each of them set standards and rules to the genre, in other words these movies changed the genre. You can love or hate these movies but you need to respect their hierarchy. I doubt someone could be against ""Psycho"" or ""The Exorcist"" because the names Hitchcock and Blatty impose respect because of their huge and respected trajectory. On the other hand, Tobe Hooper has been heavily criticized for his opera prima. TCM has been called ""disgusting"", ""disturbing"", ""video nasty"", and other adjectives. Divine Justice came to Hoooper and his movie is considered one of the most influential horror movies of all time. *SPOILERS* Most horror fans know the plot of TCM and those who haven't seen it have pretty much a general idea about it. Five young adults (Sally and Franklin Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, and Kirk) are terrorized by a cannibal family (this is the Sawyers). TCM features important moments in horror history and set standards that were later used in almost every horror movie (until today).One of the most shocking scenes in horror movies history is Leatherface's first appearance. His presentation couldn't be more scary and unexpected. The atmosphere is very creepy and dark, couldn't be more perfect for Leatherface's introduction to the horror world. After Kirk falls accidentally to the floor, Leatherface slams the door where he ""prepares"" dinner opening it and savagely hits Kirk in the head causing him a convulsion. Then he takes his dead body to his room and closes the door.Brilliant death and scene overall. The other death scenes are scary and perfectly done. Pam's death is perfect as your imagination plays an important part for setting a scary moment. Surprisingly, there's no blood but the scene doesn't need it. Jerry's death is also great and shocking but it's Franklin's death the most memorable on the movie. While he and Sally search in the woods for their friends, Leatherface suddenly appears and slaughters him with his chainsaw. The chasing scenes are the best you can get from in these kind of movies. The first one, when Leatherface carrying his chainsaw runs after Sally through the dark woods. This is the mother of all the chasing sequences in horror movies. The other happens in the end of the movie when Sally manages to escape from the demented family. The characters are something you haven't seen before. Unlike most horror films, TCM has four villains. Meet the horror icon Leatherface, The Cook, Hitch hiker, and Grandpa. Leatherface is probably the deadliest killer in the 70's horror movies. Before the 80's slasher craziness began, Leatherface showed that villains shouldn't be necessary unstoppable and immortal. With his hammer and his beloved chainsaw he could terrorize anyone. The Cook is an iconic character in the genre. He is insane but smart, and very violent. His attitude changed from moment to moment. At the beginning he behaves correctly while attending the gas station and at the ending when he's yelling, jumping, and hitting Sally you wonder if it's the same character. His acts are truly frightening. Hitch hiker is pure evil. He is totally insane, he doesn't behaves at any moment but is as deadly as Leatherface. His wicked behavior proved that he was a key element in the killings for the family's cause. Grandpa is something you need to see to believe.Great acting by Marylin Burns the first Slasher Scream Queen. Her performance is totally believable. You can say she really lived everything that was shown in the movie. The casting is excellent and you can't get much better in any other horror movie. Seems like the Sawyers were having a good time and all got along pretty good.Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a respected movie in the industry.It's an event that none horror movie fan should miss and this is a true horror movie. With minimal budget but a creative and wicked mind Tobe Hooper created one of the best horror movies of all time. No doubt about it. TCM is a reference to horror in general.

I watched it again recently to get a look at the older movies before watching what I have heard is a ""stupid, stupid remake,"" and was amazed that I ever enjoyed this movie. I respect it in that it is incredibly effective, especially as horror movies go, but the last time I had seen it was at a time when I was also impressed but absolute garbage like the Faces of Death movies  movies that there is no reason for anyone to watch. Ever. The movies is based on a true story, as they say (how loosely based is still a matter of debate), which adds an element of intrigue to the story, but it is simply an unappealing and sick movie that it's difficult to enjoy, even for horror fans. I am a huge horror fan, but when I see a blonde girl screaming in terror literally nonstop, it gets a little hard to take. It's cool to see a teenager scream and then get slashed by a masked killer, but to watch a teenager screaming endlessly as this sick and twisted family forces her to participate in their disgusting family rituals is not amusing in the least. What is this, an exploration of the depths of human depravity?The movie gets high marks because it certainly is well made and effective, I just can't help being put off by it. It's not fun to watch, even as a gory horror film, which I think counts against it in the end. There is a way to make a movie like this without being too over the top and gratuitous but still remaining faithful to whatever it was that really took place that summer in Texas. Glamorizing the violence and shoving the audience's faces into the sick things that this family was into is not the way. Texas Chainsaw comes off as a hugely effective movie that's really weakly made. They allowed to sheer disgustingness of this family tell the story, rather than use the endless opportunities afforded by the medium to create a fascinating story, and a whole series of stupid sequels did not help much.Ah well",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

72,Captain_Couth,Classic Horror Films series.,10,29 October 2004,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is one of the most horrifying films of all times. Not only did this movie spawn three sequels but it was recently remade (badly might I add) by a big Hollywood company. It also was responsible for many knock-offs and cut rate rip-offs. Despite the fact that there's really no graphic set pieces or expensive special effects, the filmis creepy and scary as hell and it's some what based upon a true story.A group of grave robbers are raiding the small cemeteries in the back country of Texas. To this day none of them have been caught and the local authorities are clueless to who or what is doing it. A van full of young adults are traveling through the area and they bear witness to one of these ""excavations"". Inspite of the bad omens they continue to drive through the area until they decide to pick up a very unusual hitch hiker. This is when the fun begins.Tobe Hooper and Kin Henkel have created a modern day horror classic. Utilizing the best out of a low budget and testing the boundaries of sanity with the cast, Hooper and company have given us a crazy family that give's Manson's clique a run for the money. They have also blessed us with Leatherface, a nasty individual who's very screen presence is a true mark of horror.The writing is excellent and the cast of unknown actors give a very good performance. I have to highly recommend this film. You'll never experience a horror film as intense as this one. Like I mentioned before, it's not graphic in gore or blood (part two is all that and more) but don't let that discourage you from watching...The Texas Chain Saw Massacre!!!A+Please for the love of god don't waste your time with the remake.

(And why do such blood-thirsty killers as this lot seem to have no taste for even kinky sex?) I think we all know this one's story, inside-out and backwards, but in a nutshell - Young, hippie-ish adults on a happy outing in rural Texas quickly meet their deaths, 1-2-3, at the hands of a deranged ""family"" of cannibals. The women suffer the worst and Sally eventually meets ""Grandpa"" and gets the royal treatment. (All wrapped up with an ending that makes you wonder why it took 12 long years for the sequel to finally arrive) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is brutal, shocking, and very effective low-budget horror from 1974. Considering all of the butchering that goes on in this film, it's surprising how little blood is actually spilled before the viewer's eyes.Now 40 years old, this one picture alone has certainly earned its cult status for literally being the one to start a ferocious trend in the genre of horror which still continues to thrive to this very day.*Note* - Oftentimes unintentionally laughable, if you choose to judge The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by today's rigid standards of over-the-top gore & horror, then any thrills or enjoyment in what this pre-CGI horror film has to offer will be completely lost on you.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
74,dee.reid,"A definitive horror film - ""the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""",10,15 April 2004,"From the grim opening narration by a gravely voiced John Larroquette, to the grisly shot of a decaying corpse that has been so delicately placed atop of a tombstone, to the final shot of Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) angrily wielding his weapon of choice in the air with the rising sun behind him, Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic ""the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" fixes you in its gravitational pull and sucks you into its dark, twisted universe. ""Massacre,"" inspired in part by the real life of serial killer Ed Gein, tells the horrifying story of five teenagers who are on a drive through the Texas country. They pick up a hitchhiker, which naturally turns out to be a bad idea. He cuts one of them (doesn't kill him), and then gets out. They stop by a house and encounter the cannibalistic family that lives there.From what I just described, you'd expect this film to be another slice and dice horror movie because it has such a narrow plot. That is not so with this film. What you end up getting from this film is a grueling experience in sheer terror. The cinematography is eerie (as to match the tone of the film and heighten the experience) and adds new dimensions to a one-sided and (typically) empty genre.One of the many reasons ""Massacre"" works is because of the extreme, macabre nature of the film. The events unfolding in front of us (the dinner scene, Marilyn Burns's chase through the woods with Leatherface right behind her) occur in such a surreal and frightening fashion that we have to step back and ask ourselves, ""Is this stuff really happening?"" I know I asked myself that question several times during my first viewing of this film. Tobe Hooper made one of the best and most influential horror films in 1974 and certainly one of the most memorable movie maniacs of all time - Leatherface. Leatherface is played to grisly perfection by Gunnar Hansen (his face is never actually seen). He is just so convincingly played as both an idiot and a cold-blooded killer; it's a shame that he was skipped over by the Academy.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is one of the best horror films I have and probably ever will see. It is no wonder that this film is regarded as a classic.10/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

What bothers me about it is how much it drags in its third act. There's little sense of danger.It looks excellent though and reminds us that gore and macabre was never a bad thing; it was the way the movie was made.

77,MBunge,No longer truly horrifying but still an interesting experience,7,18 October 2010,"As one of the granddaddies of the modern horror genre, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has aged surprisingly well. It can't match the extravagant gore of its descendants but it retains a captivating, almost mesmerizing quality.The plot is almost elemental. Five young people are driving through rural Texas in the summer of 1973. Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Marilyn Burns and Paul A. Partain) have come out to see if a buried relative has been unearthed by grave robbers. Sally's boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger), as well as another couple named Kirk and Pam (William Vail and Teri Meminn), have come along to see the abandoned Hardesty homestead. All five end up running into a family of cannibals, including the chain saw wielding Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). That doesn't work out too well for any of them, as you can probably guess from the movie's title.While it was beyond shocking for its day, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre isn't even as viscerally disgusting as any random episode of CSI or as sadistically violent as the average episode of 24. Whether that says something good or bad about American popular culture is a discussion for another day. But shorn of its sensory overload, you can recognize that this is a pretty well made film. It's very low budget, the dialog is nothing to write home about and Sally, Jerry, Pam and Kirk are all pretty generic victims. The crippled Franklin, though, is interesting. Instead of being the most victim-like of them all, he has a bit of depth. He's both the voice of reason that no one ever listens to and he represents the fascination with the strange and unknown that gets people into trouble. Leatherface and his family are also profoundly bizarre. Even now, after filmmakers have spent decades trying to top this movie, these cannibals remain genuinely creepy and unsettling because of the matter-of-fact way in which they're presented.Tobe Hooper's direction is the most noteworthy thing about this movie. It looks as good as any cheap movie ever can look and instead of relying on excessive close ups to grab the audience by the throat, Hooper shoots most of the scenes in the film at either middle or long distance. It creates a disturbingly voyeuristic feel to the story, like you're observing something that's really happening. Hooper also creates a couple of shots that are as iconic as anything in the horror genre - Leatherface slamming a steel door shut and Sally getting slashed by the Hitchhiker as she tries to run away. At those moments, your heart still beats a little faster, no matter how cynical and jaded you think you are.It's also fascinating to watch this progenitor of horror and witness the conventions of the genre being formed before your eyes. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre doesn't possess the sizzling rage and hate of The Last House on the Left and it only flirts with the ominous dread and suspense of Halloween. No, what this film contributed to the conventions of horror are the threat of unspeakable violence and a weird, macabre ridiculousness. The ideas a killer in a hockey mask or wearing a fedora and razor sharp fingers flow directly from a guy with a chainsaw, a butcher's smock and a face made of someone else's skin. This movie established the outlandish as one of the principal features of the horror movie.The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is more of a curiosity than a truly terrifying experience nowadays. It can't quite give you the thrills and chills of the modern horror movie, but it's still not something you want to watch when you're all alone late at night.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
78,Lechuguilla,"Vivid, Violent, And Vacuous",5,31 August 2014,"Horror of horrors describes its popular reputation. The images are vivid. The action is violent. And the characters are vacuous. Whatever a viewer thinks of this film, he or she is not likely to forget it.Five youthful hippies driving through rural Texas in a van get more than they bargained for when they encounter a bizarre looking hitchhiker near a slaughterhouse. From this point on, van occupants' luck goes from bad to worse. The first-half plot, during daytime, trends somewhat dull, though some scenes foreshadow what is to come in the second half.As dusk settles in, the horror action heats up, peaking in the dead of night. Indeed, the scariest scenes are those that take place outdoors in the dark. One sequence in particular is frightening; two characters trudge through thick brush with just a flashlight. Suddenly upon them is the face of a maniacal man with a buzzing chainsaw. The lighting on the man's face, and the suddenness with which he attacks, creates a bogeyman straight out of a child's nightmare.But what is the point of the movie? Apparently there is none, apart from provoking sheer fright. Those sequences that are most disturbing could be condensed into about twenty to thirty minutes. Much of the rest of the plot is filler, to extend the runtime so as to ensure a full-length movie.That's not the only problem. The story tells us nothing about the characters, either the five hippies or the villains. What's their history; what is their motivation? We don't know. They're all arbitrary, vacuously unimportant, in the script's quest for terror.Cast and acting are largely irrelevant. Marilyn Burns gives a good performance, but she has more opportunity to act than the others. Performances of the villains are all outrageously hammy; they act like they've got mad cow disease. Visuals trend grainy. Sound effects are good. Interior sets are appropriate for the genre and could be described as garbage Gothic.Being a work of fiction, the story is not very imaginative. But it is simple and straightforward, absent any subtext to interfere with the vividly clean images of horror and violent action. I guess that's what viewers most want in this film genre. And the film delivers.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
79,jimbo-53-186511,Shock-horror,4,6 September 2015,"Five friends go on a road trip to their grandfathers house and discover along the way that his grave has been desecrated. Once they arrive there, two of the friends venture across to a neighbouring property in the belief that they'll be able to get hold of some gasoline for their van. However, they unwittingly stumble across a chainsaw wielding lunatic who begins to pick them off one by one.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that has developed a bit of a cult following and seems to be regarded by many as being one of the greatest horror films of all time. However, watching it today I really can't understand why it has garnered such a reputation...The principal cast are a bunch of annoying teens which seem to be the staple for many horror films, they make the clichéd dumb decisions such as picking up a lunatic hitchhiker (even though they all agree that he doesn't look right). They then unwittingly end up in a neighbouring property to said lunatics and find themselves being picked off one by one.A good horror film will provide the audience with atmosphere and creepiness, but director Tobe Hooper is uninterested in all of this and just decides to have the chainsaw wielding nutter pounce on his victims with no real warning. Yes it's quite effective and is likely to make you jump (at least the first time), but as the film progresses it becomes more and more predictable and this ultimately means that much of the film is devoid of suspense. Character development is also non-existent meaning that we're not really given any reason to care for any of the characters.I can recall two good scenes in this film; the scene where the first victim enters the house and the camera pans round the front room is quite chilling and the scene where Sally is being chased round the woods is quite scary and suspenseful, but sadly these moments are few and far between.It's evident that Hooper isn't really interested in his characters, but his directing is actually excellent and he does frame many intense and shocking scenes and certainly gets the most out of his cast. However, the final 15 minutes really undo all his hard work; Hooper goes a bit overboard here and over directs and also allows the cast to overact which cheapens what little he had achieved prior to these moments. The real killer here (excuse the pun) comes with what happens to Sally in the house; they have her in their house and could easily kill her, but decide to let Grandad kill her even though he doesn't have the strength to hit her over the head with a hammer then she escapes??? It's probably one of the lamest and most contrived of reasons for a victim to escape her captors. Why didn't one of the others just hit her over the head and have done with it?Texas Chainsaw Massacre has one sole purpose and that purpose is to shock, but that's really all it does. It has no real suspense, no atmosphere, no creepiness and no characters to care about. Many people seem to put it on a pedestal that it simply doesn't belong on. In fact when it ended I thought the best thing about this film was Marilyn Burns nipples.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
80,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""It's a good picture!"" One of the seminal horror classics of all time, RIP Tobe Hooper",10,13 September 2017,"Among other things the early seventies were a time of cinematic experimentation, and horror directors were doing their best to push the limits of what they were allowed to show on screen. Professor turned rogue filmmaker Tobe Hooper had no studios telling him what to do when he directed this masterful horror classic, just a camera, a group of friends, and the hot Texan sun. Although he couldn't have been aware at the time, it was truly the work of a director at the top of his game and I personally don't think he ever quite topped it. It was such a great little slice of southern slaughter that all those silly and unnecessary sequels and prequels, and prequels to the prequels(!) tried in vain and failed one and all to replicate its brutal magic, it was such insane horror lightning in a bottle that they made together. When I first saw it I thought it more than lived up to its big ""nasty"" reputation and I found it to be one hell of a demented blast! It's pretty low on plot but high on the most intense of unrelenting atmospheres. And even though Leatherface became the star, for me it's really the entire experience of the picture that makes you feel swept away and unsettled just by the act of sitting though it, as everything looks so oppressively nasty and all grubby and weather beaten and it feels like the group of young road trippers enter a nightmare of surrealistic proportions as they fall prey to what is essentially a human slaughterhouse and are stuck in a remote region of the rottenest backwater country hellhole where no one can be trusted and no one could possibly hear their cries for help. It establishes such an immediate note of strong dread and deep rural decay right from the opening piercing flashes of exhumed defiled corpses and a kind of music tone which right away is enough to put the viewer on edge, and they builds upon that phenomenally until it all culminates in that gloriously mad dinner sequence that really starts the ball rolling and doesn't let up until the end credits roll and you're laughing along with the very-likely unhinged lone survivor as she speeds on her way to freedom! For such a violent icky flick it's also quite a beautiful one at certain points, Hooper brought a lot of little touches both artistic and otherwise that helped to elevate it above just being a low budget shocked and made it into something truly special and long-lasting. It's the idea of being trapped in that kind of gruelling nightmare Twilight Zone situation that's really frightening about it, and while The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was never going to have a great story or dialogue, it skilfully relied on and utilised its fearsome visual and atmospheric qualities to take the audience to a dark place of insanity that they'd never gone to before. I was also always impressed by how scary it was even though there's no gore worth a damn in it! I mean a poor dude gets his handsome noggin bashed in which is as sickening a moment as it is sudden, and a girl gets hoisted onto a meat hook and a fat guy in a wheelchair gets chainsawed to sh*t, but there's no real blood to any of it, it's mainly left to your own mind to fill in the gruesome details, it's a great example of a movie just effortlessly proving you don't need blood and guts to produce effective horror, but genuine fear, tension, atmosphere and terrific threatening antagonists. And we got a fantastic trio of loony bad guys in this that all played off each other like a macabre Three Stooges and were all scary in different ways. The grave-digging hitchhiker with his completely manic scarred face seemed like a real crazy man they'd hired, it's so absurdly hilarious when he gives Marilyn Burns a certain look during the dinner scene that really says it all! The bucktoothed ""cook"" father of the maniacs is a hoot as he veers between acting kindly and concerned and maliciously cruel, he seems like he means well somewhere and would like a quiet life but when push comes to shove the man just can't resist going back for another jab with the broom handle! And of course the late Gunnar Hansen to this day cuts such an epic hulking nightmare figure as he chases the beautiful would-be victim through the spooky blue tinted woods in the dead of night with that chainsaw that it's no wonder he became viewed as one of the horror movie character greats. Marilyn Burns was a lot better than people remember, she really screamed herself ragged! And I love her screams, they terrifically helped to sell the mounting terror and bizarre insanity of what she found herself trapped in - you'd be screaming too!! How good she was at conveying that her character was starting to lose it and expressing the fear played a big factor as to why the film is still so effective today, all the actors who've sadly passed on will live forever as a part of this classic. I think Texas Chainsaw had the same kind of qualities that other endearing horror movies from back in the day had like Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Halloween, they were all low budget, they were raw and fresh, relentless, and their directors were so resourceful with what they had at their disposal, and despite their limitations they were still able to create something that thirty or forty years later, has the same impact that it had when it was first made. This is a favourite of mine, it's a classic among classics and still packs enough of a grim visceral punch to get the hearts pounding, and the chainsaws revving! x",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
81,dwpollar,Low-budget intended shocker film...,3,6 July 2001,"1st watched 7/6/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): Low-budget intended shocker film supposedly based on a true story about a case in Texas in the 50's.  This movie seems to start out promising as we are introduced to the group of kids who are traveling to their future grisly ending, but when the movie focuses on the disgusting, cannabilistic, perverted family that kills the kids it becomes less and less appealing. This was the pre-cursor to the Friday the 13th, Halloween genre except that the characters that are killed are not quite as stupid or foolish as the victims appear to be in the other films mentioned.  I think Hooper was trying to portray a real-life story but seems to get carried away with the ridiculousness of the chainsaw killers and their warped family.  It is probably true that without this movie others of this genre would not have followed, but again I'm not sure I'm happy about this because only a couple of those that followed were very good.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
82,drownnnsoda,Still as raw as freshly packed steak,10,17 July 2014,"I've seen this film probably a hundred times, but just got back from seeing it on the big screen for the first time, and I was gobsmacked by how effective and absolutely ghastly it really is. I'm not sure if I forgot, or if seeing it on a restored 4K print was just that overwhelming, but regardless, the experience reinforced my belief that it is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever made, and without a doubt the greatest American horror film of all time. We all know the story: a group of hippieish young people are traveling through Texas back country to visit old family property. Meanwhile, a string of grave robberies and desecrations are occurring in the locale. The innocents meet with the perpetrators of the crimes, and utter madness breaks loose.Tobe Hooper will never outlive the reputation of this film; nothing he has made before or since has come close to the level of mastery here. The tension in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" lies in a lot of places, but one of them is in the space between Hooper's precise attention to detail and the borderline guerrilla filmmaking technique that the film employs. Having not seen the film in its entirety in several years now, I always seemed to remember it as an exercise in dread as opposed to one in serious, skilled filmmaking, but I was completely wrong— it's both to the tenth degree. It is a gritty and raw film that is very much visually unpolished on a surface level, but it's also gorgeously shot and rich in subtext. Every zoom, every pan, and every angle is precise and calculated— the purpose is primarily to unsettle or abhor us, but also to make us feel the desolation of the landscape and the helplessness of the surroundings. Deliberate shots of the hot Texas sun and the glowing moon work in correspondence with the film's astrological and premonitory warnings, as well as its ever-mounting sense of dread that spills over into complete deprivation in the last act.The realness of the performances also really intensifies the proceedings. The characters and actors who embody them look and feel like relatively normal college kids— not ones who are up to no good, either— remember, this film predates the slasher as we know it (although it is integral to the construction of that prototype)— but just normal kids out for a drive on a languid summer afternoon. Marilyn Burns' tormented performance is unrestrained and completely real— her screams, tears, and battle wounds are unforgettable, and even Paul Partain's hokey take on the anxious and annoying disabled brother feels authentic. The only rivalry comes from the film's antagonists; the backwoods clan of father, sons, and the inexplicably zombified grandpa who turn humans into food and furniture, and exude levels of debauchery and lunacy rarely captured on film. Their family affairs are at times darkly humorous, but the film never loses its seriousness to this. It still feels like a funeral march from beginning to end.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is one to be experienced to be believed; it really is a sensory experience (or rather, an assault on the senses). It's gorgeous and it's hideous, and everything from the calculated cinematography and natural performances to the orchestra of horrific sounds, screams, and buzzing chainsaws make it one of the most savage and robust offerings of the genre. It's a film that is still scarier than anything that has come out of American cinema in decades, and, just as it will outlive Hooper, it will outlive all of its sequels, remakes, and imitators, because it's just that darned good. While watching it on the big screen, my twenty year old friend who accompanied me was gripping my hand throughout half of the film, and almost jumped out of her seat twice. While timeless classics tend to be few and far between for genre films such as these, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is one of a diminutive minority that has not lost an ounce of its vitality after four decades. 10/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Other than that TTCM is a work of horror fiction. A family of freaks that robs graves,stalks, kills and eats people hunts five hippies that are visiting a family gravesite. While The Texas Chainsaw Massacre made a lot of money, it was made for little money. Even so, everything that was done here works and is taken very seriously. The gritty realism goes a long way in selling the story and the performances are so good, raw and totally unhinged. The score by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell sets the bleak tone for the film. While TTCM is notorious for being a violent film, there is little blood shed or gore. The right tone, atmosphere, disturbing images and great performances make the film work.

There are only a fistful of films which epitomize the term 'Horror' as this unforgettable masterpiece of low-budget Horror does. ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" has been called the purest Horror film of all-time, and it is indeed true that hardly another film delivers pure terror that could compare to this absolute classic of Horror's greatest decade, the gritty and brutal 70s. In the beginning, the film shows half-decayed corpses, bizarrely positioned on sticks in the desert. This opening sequence alone is capable of giving you the creeps.***SPOILERS!*** Loosely based on the crimes of insane hilly-billy serial killer Ed Gein, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" tells the tale of five young people, who want to relax at their grandfather's old farm in Texas. As fate wants it, the neighbors are a demented family of chainsaw-swinging cannibals... A diabolical family of ultra-demented psychos, and a bunch of innocent victims, including two beautiful girls and a guy in a wheel-chair - The result is one of the most purely terrifying films ever brought to screen. The most memorable member of the psycho family, Leatherface, has long become one of the greatest icons of the Horror genre.As it must be the case with most of my fellow Horror fans, I have personally seen this film many times, and it never looses its incomparable morbidity and genuine creepiness. Overall, the storyline of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is quite simple, and while it is doubtlessly a Gore classic, films that were considerably gorier had been made before 1974. Neither does the film stun with technical superiority or the stylistic elegance that many Italian Horror films delivered at the day. What makes ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" so brilliant and uniquely scary is the key element that it delivers like hardly another film: Pure terror. Period. Hardly another film epitomizes the term Horror as this film does, hardly another possesses its incomparable morbidity. As mentioned before, the film is not nearly as gory as one might imagine. In fact, there is very little explicitly graphic gore. What makes this film so morbid and terrifying is that it feels so incredibly real. One almost has the impression of being there, the film will not only make viewers scared for the victims, it is capable of making the audience scared for their own ass. I could praise this film's terrifying greatness for a long time, but I'll just say that it is absolutely essential to see for everyone who is interested in Horror (in case there is anybody who hasn't already seen it). Tobe Hooper is a genius for accomplishing this film with a tiny budget of about 140,000 Dollars, and making it one of the most terrifying cinematic experiences ever brought to screen. No matter how many crappy remakes they make, this original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is one of the most influential, important and purest Horror films of all-time and no one interested in cinema can afford to miss it. An absolute must!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
89,MarieGabrielle,The sense of dread is palpable...no other film compares...,9,6 November 2006,"and THAT is what is missing in the many remakes, including the most recent, Prequel TCM (2006).1974, post-Vietnam era. The sense that anything could happen. If I am not mistaken, there is an old VHS version with the following captions regarding Elmer Wayne Henley and Dean Corll (The Pasadena, Texas ""Candyman"" murderer). As John Larroquette narrates the infamous idyllic summer prologue, the story begins.It is gritty, and looks to be 110 degrees. The hitchhiker is classic. Definitely insane. They are driving an old Chevy van, and eventually (after the hitcher educates them about head cheese) drop him off quickly. He has gouged his hand out, just for fun.So the suspense builds. They are looking for Kathy Hardesty's grandfather's house, now deserted. They find a lot filled with abandoned cars. Why?. It is never explained.Leatherface (Bubba) does not appear until later. We know something horrible is going to happen, we just don't know when, or to whom. The metal door slamming shut as we catch a glimpse of ""Leatherface""/Bubba is truly scary. More than any gore, dismembering, or scenes from the recent ""Hostel"".I can recall re-watching this in the very early 90's and thinking, wow, this could have been bigger!! Another film you may enjoy is the original ""Toolbox Murders"" my friend at the time also noted it had the same deranged and paranoid slant to it. Great and original. 9/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
90,Jonny_Numb,"""Look what your brother did to the door!""",7,22 April 2003,"(Possible spoilers.)Wallowing in bitterness after wasting my money on Robozo Zombie's garbage fest, ""House of 1,ooo Corpses,"" I decided to give ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" another look.  It's not a masterpiece, but it is an above-average horror film that makes a virtue of its low budget, its grainy film stock, and authentic locations.  A group of kids (including a man-child in a wheelchair) out for an afternoon drive run out of gas and eventually fall victim to a family of cannibalistic hillbillies, led by Leatherface, a masked deviant who wields the titular weapon.  The slim plot is both a plus and a detracting factor--on one hand, this minimalism gives the film a documentary, ""you-are-there"" feel; but it also renders the characters as not much more than one-dimensional cannibal fodder (even the lone heroine spends much of the last act screaming insanely).  The macabre humor is quite strong (""Look what your brother did to the door!"" always merits a laugh), as are the hillbillies:  Edwin Neal as a psychotic hitchhiker, Jim Siedow as a seemingly normal gas station owner, and the aforementioned Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen).  The house where these deviants reside is an impressive set consisting of furniture crafted out of limbs and bone, and mummified relatives residing upstairs.  ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a memorable horror film, certainly a labor of love and an impressive low-budget effort, but it's far from a masterpiece.6.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
91,aidanratesmovies,"Dull natured, and messy, but with some good moments",4,30 March 2020,"Although brilliantly shot, especially for such a low budget, Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not only aged poorly, but lacks truly any redeeming qualities to make it much of a film in total. The film starts out with a compelling enough storyline, with a group load of kids on their way to an abandoned house. The film seems to have enough up its sleeve to continue journeying into interesting circumstances, but it only gets messier from there. The film's dialogue is mostly random and on the nose, making for conversations that are simply awkward and hard to follow. On top of that, the film lacks much of a plot at all once it all begins to start, and I left the film wondering what the hell just happened? There is no context, no explanation, no clear motive, and no reason why anything is happening in the film, and it simply just feels like a mess. At times it is successfully scary though, with some cool scenes involving Leatherface towards the middle. The cinematography at times can be surprisingly good, with a truly hauntingly beautiful touch. The film seems to have some interesting concepts layed out, but never makes much of them, and instead goes for a muddled or scattered version of what could have been. In the end, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not as great as a horror film now as it was for its time, but it does have its moments. Its sense of atmosphere, situations and circumstances, and use of cinematography make for what could have been a compelling piece of work, ultimately dragged down by a messy script and a spectacularly dull nature.My Rating: 4/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
92,rbverhoef,"Has some nice moments, but does not deliver in the end",7,1 November 2004,"The 1974 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' from director Tobe Hooper is better than the 2003 remake, but that doesn't make this movie good. We follow five teenagers in a van, heading for something I did not really understand. May the house they end up was already their final destination, because of events it will be. The first half of the movie shows how the five take a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) who cuts himself with a knife and continues with cutting one of the five. After they have ditched the hitchhiker, so they think, they go to an old abandoned house.Two of them, Pam (Teri McMinn) and Kirk (William Vail), go for a swim, but find out the water is not there anymore. They go to an old house for gas and disappear. Jerry (Allen Danziger) is the next one to disappear when he wants to find Pam and Kirk. Siblings Sally (Marilyn Burns) and Franklin (Paul A. Partain), the guy who was cut by the hitchhiker and is in a wheelchair, wait until dark, the perfect time to get worried. They start looking for the other three and then Franklin gets massacred by a guy with a chainsaw (Gunnar Hansen). Sally runs for the second half of the movie, although she is caught a couple of times and escapes a couple of times.I have told you a lot and nothing at the same time. That certain people will die is a given; it is more how it happens and the uncertainty of what happens to Sally that makes this movie suspenseful. Although I wasn't really scared I thought there were some interesting parts. The way the camera photographs the house where the teens disappear and how it shows the eyes of Sally when she is in the middle of the horror gave me a chilly feeling. Still, this wasn't enough for me to please a horror film.The movie is good in a way it doesn't want to explain the actions of a killer, although we can simply speak of a madman's actions, and it doesn't dramatize either. We see what happens and move on to the next act and we see what happens there. The atmosphere is good in the first half as well. Where suspense builds up there, giving us a feeling that something big is about to happen, the all-running, all-screaming second half does not deliver.

93,Samiam3,Where is the brilliance?,6,21 July 2009,"Movies do not always have to be nice or politically correct, but if one wants to take that approach, then at least have the decency to do it well. The right way gives you films like Psycho, and the wrong way gives you a film like Texas Chain Saw Massacre. There are two ways in which an sadistic perverted film like this may be considered acceptable. If it was trying to tell a true story like the recently made Australian film Wolf Creek, that would be acceptable. If it was trying to deliver a logical message, about say humanity, that would be acceptable. Unfortuanety, neither is the case with Tobe Hooper's debut, making me wonder why people find this so brilliant. Just because it is scary and was produced from mere pocket change in my opinion does not amount to brilliance. The only reason I made it through this was because, as dumb as Tobe Hooper is at least he keeps his story moving. After the introduction, there is never really a dull moment, although it occasionally feels repetitious, Texas Chainsaw massacre has energy. enough to make it watchable but I can recommend better films like this.The story is simple, five kids take a road trip to an old house which used to belong to the parents of one of them. Living nearby is a family of slaughter house workers. In a matter of hours all but one of the kids 'Sally' are dead, and she too is in great danger. In the middle of nowhere, with absolutely nothing, has has to save herself.What little money the film has obviously went to set decoration. Everything else is poor. One thing that annoyed me was too many badly lit wide shots during scenes of conversation showing a total lack of experience on the director's part. People may call this brilliant or revolutionary, but those kinds of comments are really not very useful. It doesn't in anyway hint as to whether you will or will not enjoy the film. If you hear any of your friends say such things about Texas Chain Saw Massacre, ask them about their reasons for praising it, before going out to see it yourself. It may not be as special as you think.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

95,onepotato2,somewhat effective,3,2 May 2008,"One thing that is definitely not dated about this horror movie, is the soundtrack under the credits. I don't know of another horror movie that skipped the horror theme music and substituted an eerie questioning tone (ooohWWR? ...ooohWWR?) It's a memorable part-animal/part-music noise and it sets the creepy tone immediately. The best scenes in the movie come early - the first kill is the most shocking, followed by a malevolent sliding-door slam that suggests Leatherface is a horrifying force to be reckoned with. Sadly he ends up being the usual beleaguered, sympathetic, bullied, dumb child (with a falsetto voice? um... OK). I found the second half of the movie to be at least as silly as that. The last part is so unstructured that you beg for someone to stuff a sock in Sally's mouth, to shut up her screaming. The remake allows viewer fear to build up for long stretches, which was effective, but that movie also descends into silliness.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

97,framptonhollis,headcheese,10,3 October 2017,"""There's just some things you gotta do. Don't mean you have to like it.""In proper context, that quote is much more sinister than it may appear......and that's because this ""proper context"" I speak of happens to be one of the most grotesque sequences from ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", a nightmarish thrill ride that is often considered to be one of the scariest films ever made. When I first saw it, it legitimately got me shaking on various occasions; to be honest, I have a much higher tolerance for gore than grit, which is why, to me, this film is so effective. People often think of ""Massacre"" as being this gruesome splatter fest, but it really isn't; as a matter of fact, it's something much more disturbing than that. It's one of those movies in which the imperfections become perfections, a movie that relies heavily on its atmosphere and visuals. The slight musical score is not over- dramatic like in many of today's horror movies (I loved ""It"", but I must admit that its major flaw was the overly loud, generic ""horror"" soundtrack that just took me out of the movie), and the sound effects would likely have been no less than silly in any other film. But, ""Massacre"" is a triumph of not only horror cinema, but cinema in general, and it therefore succeeds at making the seemingly impossible possible. It's clever, creative, and creepy, more so than almost any other film of its genre!Another great aspect of this film is its humor, which often goes overlooked. While, particularly towards the end, ""Massacre"" is a bone chilling horror sensation, it also has some laugh out loud moments, particularly within its first half hour. The naive, wheelchair bound Franklin may just be the oddest character in the whole film, which is saying quite a bit, especially since he's one of the film's protagonists. There are scenes featuring that man that use bizzaro humor in a way that is bound to please weirdos like myself. The comedy in this film is totally unique, and I have yet to see a movie that exactly replicates the same comic atmosphere this one does. It's a mixture of off putting weirdness, subtle creepiness, and outlandish absurdist comedy that is so unspeakably perfect and fits the film's atmosphere of realism jammed together with surrealism perfectly.Perfect.That's a word I find myself using a lot in this review.And, ""Massacre"" certainly ISN'T ""perfect"" by any means, but that's a large part of what makes it so good and so believable. There is some real cinematic sorcery going on here, and it deserves to be worshiped with the utmost respect. This is more than some cheap exploitation flick, this is a work of hilarious, petrifying, and ingenious art!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
98,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Tobe Hooper's beginning,7,19 March 2014,"There's something about the title of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and how people think of it. Many just think of it of being about a chain saw wielding killer who stalks people and cuts them up for fun. However, that is just skimming the surface of this particular horror franchise. What some may not realize about this story is that there is more than one could expect to see - and that doesn't include scares. There's another aspect about this movie that first time director Tobe Hooper included that will have the audiences baffled, stunned and amazed. That aspect is the sheer bizarre atmosphere that is this film.Viewers will follow the path of five friends who are on the road, heading toward a relative's house. On their way, they run low on fuel and look for a place to rest for the night. What they don't know, is that they're not going to see the light of day. Unbeknownst to them, something, a danger so unspeakable is headed their way that quite frankly if anyone ran into, should high tail it out of there. This danger is a family of psychotically deranged cannibals that have no conceivable conscience. But, the most deadly individual is the man (if he is one) known as ""Leatherface"".This guy is not to be messed with. He is the towering, chain saw wielding killer and can this beast run! Strangely enough, he and the rest of his cohorts were the ones who were given the most attention to when it came to character development. The audience actually gets to understand his place in the family and how the overall family acts. This is also a major flaw. With the antagonists more developed, this left our main characters on the sidelines and are basically only fodder for Leatherface. Sure, audiences' will understand that they're friends but what else is there to learn? Not much else - or at least from what's given to us. Along with that is a rather underwelming plot. There really isn't much of a plot at all. Friends travel and end up running into the goons. Not much else. There are a few twists but nothing that wasn't too oddball or unpredictable.However, in place of this is the bizarre aspect that was mentioned earlier, credited to Tobe Hooper. The way of life that takes place with these killers are something to behold. It will make the viewer question to themselves, ""Who enjoys this kind of thing?"". It's that bizarre. Another element that viewers should enjoy is how the movie pushes the endurance meter. To see how long one can watch the screen without turning away or closing their eyes is a serious plus. Adding to this is how little music is in the running time. It is almost to the point of completely absent, yet when it is heard, it's distinct. Still, it should've been more prevalent because there were areas that could've used the emphasis of terror. With all this, it still amounts to a decent horror film.It's surprising that with uneven character development, lackluster music and a very thin plot, that this movie made the impact it did and will for future viewers. With an atmosphere and characters so bizarre, it's hard not to sit down and wonder how things will turn out.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
99,raulfaust,Freakshow,8,8 August 2011,"Well, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is an indeed classic of the horror genre. I went to see this expecting the lowest, since these old horror films tend to be very lame and bad produced.This film has many accomplishments that I really didn't expect. First, we have an amazing cast that delivers to the spectator many things. Marilyn Burns is very believable in her screams and her natural reactions to fight ""death"". The whole family is insane and the actors make a good job in portraying sick people. Their actions are so sadistic that make the film becomes painfully to watch. And more than that, the director builds a truly horrifying atmosphere without even showing gore. Instead of gore, he preferred to use psychological torture along with a creepy atmosphere sound and directing which agonizes and disturbs more than any gore in this world.My only complain about this film is the small budget; with such a good director it had, they could and should have invest more money in this picture. The photography is very poor and it gets too dark in many times, so the spectator loses many facial expressions and movements. I found that this photography's bad quality ruins some things, but doesn't spoil the film's overall quality.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

He has made a lot of complete flops throughout his career, which makes it all the more surprising that his first feature film is so damn good. To me ""Texas Chainsaw"" is a true work of art, the savage beauty of this movie is incredible. The deaths come in some very stylish shots: instead of the standard killer comes closer-violin music routine, we see the murders from a random shot, plain, which make them even more brutal. It's just a bunch of stuff happening and suddenly hey, murder. The cinematography is fit for postcards, Texas has never looked greater.

101,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Slightly stream-of-consciousness review,10,5 August 2013,"The filmmakers' use of ambient noises only, the deliberately slow pacing, and the nearly first-person perspective make us, from the first scene, the building of a grotesque human scarecrow in the cemetery, forget that we're watching a movie, and we soon feel like we're standing in that cemetery, and a character in this van ride through hell on a hot summer day, as nothing more than passive observers along for the ride. We hear and see exactly what the characters see and hear. When they pause to pick up Dracula, we're just as unnerved by him as they are. When he tries to set the van on fire, we hear the same sizzling noises and crackling fire they do, not a distracting music score.When they find the gas station with the old man at work, we're tricked, just like they are, into thinking that we're not alone and that everything will be all right. We even learn our destination: wheelchair boy's parents' farmhouse.But after we arrive at the farmhouse, our hopes are quashed as we find nothing but an abandoned building. There is no melodramatic build-up to showing the house, it just appears to us, the viewers, as it does to the characters in the film as they arrive there: a roadside building, overgrown with trees, bushes, and climbing vines. ""Oh, I wish they hadn't let the place fall apart!"" ""Now it looks like the birthplace of Bela Lugosi!"" It's pitch black inside, even when it's burning in the midday summer sun. Hope of a swim in a nearby lake to cool off is quickly obliterated, as the lake is now an open field. ""If I have any more fun today, I don't think I'll be able to take it!"" Again we're tricked into a false sense of security and hope, as we spot a house in the distance. Gasoline? People? A sanctuary? Hardly. Another house burning under the same sun. Oddly, this house is brighter than the first house. Quite odd, considering the horrors littered inside this second house; human bones and animals, some dead, some still alive. But the two characters that witness these things won't get to tell their tale.It's nightfall now. Where are their friends? Over the hills and far away, through tangled vines, trees, and bushes, to the lake where they went. And to the old house near it. And the unimaginable horrors inside it, only barely glimpsed before they were.....Brilliant suspense/ comic/ mockumentary/ horror/ exploitation fare draws us in from minute one and doesn't let us go. Again, through its deliberately slow pacing in the early scenes, the lack of any proper musical score, and the low-budget, gritty photography, we soon forget that we're watching a movie, and feel almost like we're another character in the van, in the house full of unnamed, unknown killers, like ""Hitchhiker"", and ""Old Man"". In this slaughterhouse. At the dinner table, just in time for ""dinner"".The morning after, we break out of the ""window in hell"" and run for our lives in the rising sun, and as the killer does his little dance of death with a buzzing chainsaw in the first light of morning.People remember this as being a violent, gory horror because the real horror is mostly implied, which lets the viewers imagine, and falsely remember seeing violence and bloodshed.Its low budget ($83000) is an asset: it makes the film look grittier and more graphic, without being overly gory. But since the filmmakers were competent in what they were doing, it does not seem inept and amateurish.Its slightly grainy photography and not-tack-sharp sound are assets, it gives the film a documentary look.No-name cast is an asset: everyone is expendable and we don't know who (if anyone) will survive.No proper musical score is an asset: it gives the film a cinéma vérité feel. A proper music score would be distracting, and greatly lessen the film's effect.The fact that some people still incorrectly think that this film is based on a true story shows how well written and presented it is.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

103,slayrrr666,One of the greatest horror films ever made!!!,10,3 November 2005,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a classic horror film.**SPOILERS**After receiving word that their relatives' graves may have been robbed, Sally Hardesty, (Marilyn Burns) her invalid brother Franklin, (Paul Partain) and their friends Jerry, (Alan Danziger) Kirk, (William Vail) and Pam, (Terri McMinn) drive through Texas to get to the location. While along they way, they get stranded in this strange town, which has a large house on the edge of town. Thinking a break along the nearby creek might be good for them, they stop and look around. As night falls and the rest of the group hasn't returned yet, Sally and Franklin decide to head into the night to look for them. While searching, they run into the chainsaw-wielding maniac Leatherface, (Gunner Hansen) who chases Sally through the woods.The Good News: Wow, this is a great film! Even though Jason may be my favorite slasher villain, Leatherface is the first, so he holds special commendation. He is also one of the more unique killers in that he is based on a real person, the notorious Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Gein. The main differences, of course, being the leather mask and the chainsaw. Both are ingenious weapons for any killer to lay claim to: being the first masked killer in cinema history, and for having the most feared weapon of all time. That mask, the knowledge that it is sewn together from human skin, is completely freaky and scary, and that drained color tone, combined with Hansen's strong performance, make up one scary slasher. Even the other performers in the film are incredible. The family at the end is just a bunch of wackos, and the dinner scene is just completely freaky. It takes a special skill to successfully creep out the audience, and they play it so well that you sometimes wonder if these are actual actors or real insane people that he hires to scare the wits out of the rest of the cast. Even without Leatherface in the picture, it can scare you how good they are. Wow, highlights, where do we start. For me, I can sit till the end of time watching Leatherface chase Sally through the woods, chainsaw blaring, as we all hear her screams running around for at least ten minutes. This is pure suspense genius. All we see is the chase, running through the woods, with Leatherface sometimes cutting up tree branches that probably shouldn't have been cut, but that just makes the scene more suspenseful. It gives her a chance to get farther away, and yet he still manages to catch up with her, and the doom we feel when he is within striking distance and she is barely getting away are some of the scariest scenes in the history of cinema. This even comes after one of the biggest jumps I've ever had. Two people are walking in the woods, talking innocently, when after a while we hear a twig snap. One of them shines a flashlight in the direction of the noise, and from out of the darkness roars Leatherface, chainsaw blaring as loud as he is, and he then slices the first character up in not-very-gory fashion. Even still, the way it's filmed is so carefully planned out that we think we see the actual cutting of the character, but we never see a drop of blood. That is a brilliant twist over our heads, as we expect something and then something completely by surprise happens that shocks us. Leatherface's first on-screen appearance/kill is also a shock for first time viewers. One character goes walking around the house by himself and stumbles over a loose nail in the floor. When he regains his footing, a secret door has opened, and in the middle stands Leatherface, hammer in hand. With one swift blow to the head, he's down. He picks up the carcass, hauls it back into the room, and then just slamming the door shut, where it's loud banging comes as a long shock. I don't even have to use the dinner scene, that is too marvelous for me to spoil here, as I've said too much already. It needs to be seen yourself to know what I mean. Even the last five minutes are simply incredible, action-packed pieces of lunacy that no one in their sane mind could have come up with, and the brilliant acting already mentioned just drive the scene home so well that it gives the viewer goosebumps just thinking about a scene like that. That is how well made this film is.The Bad News: The main problem I have with this film is that Leatherface is not the mass murderer many think he is. We only get five kills in the film, and even worse, only one by chainsaw. Granted, the chainsaw kill is the best one in the film and one of the best in horror history, it still can't make up for the fact that hardly anyone dies in the film. This is a problem that even the remake and nearly all the sequels have in common. A massacre is not five deaths. That can be a bad traffic accident. The storyline needs to be changed so that he has the opportunity to slash up multiple victims. I might be scared of him more if I knew, that in his whole series, he was capable of killing more than one ""Friday the 13th"" film. These are not body count flicks, so don't be expecting a large cast to be killed off.The Final Verdict: This is a pretty solid film. It is a bona fide classic; it has some great shock moments and one of the better villains in horror history. Just kill more people along the way. That part of the critique should not be taken seriously, though, and this film MUST be seen as soon as possible.Rated R: Violence, mild Language and the murder of a handicapped person",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
104,Chase_Witherspoon,Much maligned movie,9,21 November 2005,"While the modus operandi of the principal villain in this tale is novel, the story itself is hackneyed and unconvincing. If you're looking for plot, character development and production values, you've come to the wrong place.You can appreciate this film as an experiment in film-making. Interesting photographic techniques, the unconventional use of light and sound, bizarre make-up - it overwhelms the senses. Despite the grainy print (a positive feature that DVD fortunately can't diminish) and use of a bland savanna as a setting, it remains a truly visual experience. The dialogue is nothing to write home about, the acting is, well, intense to say the least, but the reputation ascribed to this film, goes far beyond anything actually depicted, and is totally unwarranted.This film heralded a new epoch in the horror genre, a prelude to the ""slasher"" sub-genre that would emerge in the late seventies. But take note, this is a cut above (no pun intended) the rest and shouldn't be blamed for the likes of William Lustig's ""Maniac"", or others of the ilk.If you watch - and subsequently enjoy - this movie, I'd recommend you try to catch ""Deranged"" (1974), which is loosely based on the same subject. Watching both films should give you a sense of the creators' perspective when developing the same material, and emphasise the importance of this film as an exponent of experimental film-making. As with ""Chain Saw"", the title ""Deranged"" begets a more gruesome image than the film actually conveys.

105,moviewizguy,A horror flick with a lot of potential falls short.,5,10 January 2013,"I liked TCM the first time I saw it. It scared and disturbed me. On a rewatch, however, I noticed a lot of flaws pertaining to this B-movie slasher flick that cannot be ignored. But before I get to all that, there is a lot to admire about the film: the foreboding atmosphere, Leatherface's first appearance which is shocking and memorable, the Grandpa character, and it's competently made by a filmmaker who knows what he's doing.However, there are some downright frustrating things about the film, the main one being the characters. Unfortunately, the most sympathetic/least annoying characters are killed off first. And then there's Frankie. Oh, Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. I don't know how I could stand him the first time around, but he is such an annoying character, despite him being in a wheelchair. The scene with him refusing to give his sister Sally the flashlight makes me want to punch a kitten in the face, but that's just one of many occasions where I wanted him to die, and, fortunately, he does. Next, there's Sally. She makes the second half of the film almost unbearable to watch. Her constant screaming is an assault to the senses. It may very well rival Michael Bay's action scenes in any of the ""Transformer"" films in giving you a headache. Seriously, apart from flailing around uselessly, that's all she does in the entire film. As opposed to Laurie in ""Halloween,"" she makes one hell of an incompetent heroine.Furthermore, there isn't much of a plot here. It's pretty uneventful when compared to the 2003 remake. The film doesn't give any chances for the victims to fight back, and they die too easily which I guess is the point to show Leatherface as a big, unstoppable monster or whatever. Where's the fun in that when there's no even playing field though? But maybe this isn't supposed to be a fun, entertaining film. If the filmmakers' job was to scare people, TCM only does so on occasion. Again, having actress Marilyn Burns screaming is more aggravating than scary, and you have villains (the father and brother) who are just as annoying. Overall, TCM has a lot of potential in being a great horror film, but falls short mainly due to its characters.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
106,mhorg2018,Overrated,3,19 November 2020,"I'm going to be totally honest here. It's the title of this film that gets one going before even sitting down in a dark theater or home to watch it. It might have been rough for 1974, but when I saw it with the at least amusing, Massacre at Central High, after hearing about this for years, I was disappointed. It was really kind of dull, with 90 percent of the violence (not a bad thing, but considering the title!) implied. It dragged in parts and didn't even get a jump scare out of me. It's still better than the five hundred remakes, reboots and reimagining's of it, but really, I consider it overrated. It is however, better than either the original or the remake of Last House on the Left.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

108,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Funny and Suspenseful Slasher,6,12 September 2014,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre certainly doesn't have the same atmosphere and thrilling moments as My Bloody Valentine (1981) or Sleepaway Camp (1983). Still, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a great slasher movie, low-budget but still pulling off providing entertainment the whole way through. I won't spoil the plot, but it has elements of Terror at Red Wolf Inn, Redneck Zombies and the Hills Have Eyes. There is cannibalism involved, along with a creepy family that makes this one disturbing movie. The soundtrack was unmemorable, but the acting was decent enough. I don't think I agree with its current 7.5/10 rating, I think that's a little much, but TCM is still a good enough movie. Sadly its been remade and copied various times over the years, leaving it unoriginal and predictable. This has been the fate of countless slasher films, unfortunately. While TCM isn't one of my favorites, it's still worth checking out, and whatever you do make sure you view this one before watching any of the remakes.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
109,pyrocitor,"Disturbing, sickening, chilling and uncomfortably amoral - a cornerstone of the slasher genre",8,5 February 2009,"Often more terrifying than individual efforts of the slasher film, a subgenre permeating Hollywood horror films since the 1970s, is envisioning the motivation or inspiration which led the filmmakers in question to fathom such gruesome spectacles. Such is without question the case with director Tobe Hooper, and the infamous story encircling his legendary call to fame. Hooper cites his inspiration as a combination of planning a film involving wilderness and isolation, and an incident when, attempting to determine a way through a crowd of people in a crowded department store, spotting a chain saw. This combination of concise efficiency and gruesomely twisted yet darkly humorous inspiration ably serve as metaphoric for Hooper's ensuing film, with content as bold, striking, no nonsense and macabre as its title: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Now recognised as a cornerstone in the horror genre, Hooper's film proves a remarkable exercise in visceral, abrasive horror as much for its restraint as for its gruesome excesses. Effectively setting the mould for all future slasher films (collection of attractive, carefree teenagers, isolated location, creepy locals and a continuous ominous sense of foreboding), for a film associated with so much bloody death and dismemberment, the film is made all the more astonishing upon the realisation of how minimal the on-screen gore actually is. And yet its inclusion is not even necessary, as Hooper mines traumatic, emotional horror with unsettling canniness, allowing the audiences' minds to fill in the blanks while providing just enough gruesome sounds to drive the point sickeningly home. However, this notion of ""the point"" is arguably what makes The Texas Chain Saw Massacre the most frightening: the fact that for all intents and purposes, there does not appear to be one. The film goes about its grotesque business in an alarmingly efficient and unashamedly amoral fashion, with no real social commentary (there is a fleeting reference to unemployment leading to the grisly happenings, as well as the recurring slaughterhouse motif and earlier mention of animal cruelty being enough to put almost any viewer off meat) or attempt to justify the incredible violence presented. Instead, Hooper's film attempts to evoke sadistic pleasure in forcing the viewer to look at the grotesque or disturbing - the film's opening, cutting from shots of dismembered corpses strung up on public monuments to a drawn out close up of a dead armadillo, only serving to foreshadow the incredibly distasteful collection of characters and vicious events to come. Rather than trying to infuse his film with morality, Hooper seems more interested in questioning the morality of the viewer watching, exploring why audiences would choose to take in such a film, and to what effect. And far more unsettling than Hooper's collection of unsavoury individuals and gruesome violence is the reversal of the appraisal of them back at the viewer, begging the question that if what happens in the film is so distasteful, what does makes the viewer who watches it for leisure?But disregarding such self-reflexive questions of spectator morality, Hooper's film firmly earns its grisly reputation, proving a masterpiece in sight and sound, the strikingly jarring, viciously innovative cinematography and editing crafting a horrifying immediacy to the macabre events. With scenes often shot out of focus, from a distance or from uncomfortably close angles (at one point alternating between three increasingly zoomed in close-ups on an eye) the decidedly anti-Hollywood veneer to Hooper's film provides a terrifyingly credible sense of being present, or closely observing the massacre taking place. However, arguably even more effective is the chillingly different musical score, a cacophonous collection of mechanical clanging and screeching designed to replicate the sounds cows would hear within a slaughterhouse, intensifying the terror to almost unbearable levels. Such astounding technical work is what prevents the film from ever appearing dated and keeps it grounded during its occasional comic moments, some intentional, some not (there is a strangely humorous undertone to the cumbersome Leatherface and his incessantly screaming prey), assuring that despite the frequent potential of losing the viewer, Hooper is always capable of wrenching new screams or shudders from them. The cast of mostly unprofessional actors are unanimously impressive, giving unpolished, naturalistic performances which make the grim spectacle all the more real. Despite a lack of character, Marilyn Burns energetically delivers on the screaming terror front, her all consuming horror coming across as frighteningly genuine. Paul A. Partain delivers occasional comic relief as well as moments of chilling foreshadowing as Burns' knife obsessed wheelchair bound brother, and Edwin Neal gives a disturbingly vivid and credible performance as an unhinged, psychopathic hitchhiker. Finally, Gunnar Hansen essays the now timeless Leatherface killer with eerie precision, adding an intriguing level of odd pathos and occasional humour behind his twisted, foreboding and flat out terrifying physical exterior.Just as eerily unsettling as it is flat out terrifying, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre never goes for easy scares, instead adhering to a naturalistic, vivid sense of sickening terror making it all the more memorable and gripping. Untainted by decades of inferior knockoffs, barely slowed down by the occasional unintentionally comic or clunky moment, and its fright factor boosted by an uncomfortably irreverent sense of amorality, the film easily merits its reputation as a gruesome classic of the slasher horror genre - just trying shaking it out of your head afterwards. -8.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
110,Pumpkin_Man,Creepy and Very Disturbing!!!,10,9 June 2016,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is definitely a cult classic horror film that raised the stakes for 1970's horror films, but to me, it's not the best. In fact, I much prefer the 2003 remake. Franklin is very annoying. The music and the sounds used in the background at the farmhouse are scary. Sally, her brother, and their friends are driving to see if their grandpa's grave has been robbed, but it hasn't. They stop at a farmhouse and one by one, unknowingly enter Leatherface's domain. The Sawyer house is incredibly creepy and very detailed with bone ornaments and decapitated head lamps. The chase scene in the woods kinda dragged and went on forever. For most of the kills, Leatherface uses a sledgehammer. Only during the chase scenes is when he uses a chainsaw. Will Sally be able to outrun the psychotic Leatherface? If you love classic 70's horror, you might enjoy THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE!!!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
111,Maciste_Brother,Inspired brilliance!,10,21 October 2003,"So much has been written about THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE these days that it seems almost redundant to write a review about it. Needless to say, TCM is one of my top films of all time. It's so good on so many levels that it would take a book to write a perfect review of this once-maligned flick. Some people, who have never seen it before, wonder what's so great about it after watching it for the first time, well, this is probably because TCM is the most copied movie of all time and TCM will look too familiar to newbies. You can literally trace x number of  horror movies (or even action movies) back to this film. The thing is, TCM is a groundbreaking movie but few people back then noticed it. Mainly because when this low budget movie was originally released by its unscrupulous distributors it was dismissed as another trashy drive-in horror movie, when in fact few realized the brilliance to be found within it. After TCM was released, few horror films could afford to go back to Hammer style horror or the usual boring fare. You can really see the difference in movies made before TCM and those made after TCM became a big hit. The unrelentingly blunt, chaotic, savage, take-no-prisoners attitude of TCM was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before and this aspect of TCM is what makes it truly groundbreaking. Horror movies or even movies in general simply couldn't be cutesy or quaint anymore.The film is unsettling and funny. It's totally original with its brazen, full-throttled approach to horror when most films made in those days were static, slow and poky. The level of energy this movie has is truly amazing. For a low budget flick, the camera is stunningly fluid and rarely static. The editing is sharp. The music is ominous but never overwhelming. The look of the film is perfect; it's looks so natural and un-Hollywood like which adds a lot in creating the uneasy atmosphere of the movie. But the direction by Tobe Hooper is inspired brilliance and even though Hooper often injected bits of black humor here and there which could  have made the film less authentic, the humor never overtakes the story (which is probably what many didn't like about the sequel, which, btw, I recommend too) because the rawness of what's occurs on screen is never pulled back. The direction is perfect for this gruesome horror story. What's really remarkable about TCM is that there isn't a ""weakest link"" about it. Even though the budget was almost next to nothing and the conditions of making the movie were, according to many articles, hellish, the film doesn't have one weak element. Everything fits perfectly. Technically, the film is amazing. There isn't a scene that feels excessive or some performance that wasn't good. Everything is top notch.TCM is filled with classic moments: the beginning, with the flashes of the corpses; the scene at the cemetery; the hitchhiker in the van; Kirk facing Leatherface; Pam and the swing shot; Pam falling in a room filled with bones and feathers; Pam and the hook scene; Leatherface surprised by Jerry; Sally being chased by Leatherface (the scene is only screams and chainsaws, for a whole 6 minutes. Amazing!); Sally being poked by Drayton; Sally at the diner table (yikes!); Grandpa and the hammer; Sally being chased by the hitchhiker and Leatherface during the chaotic ""live-wired"" ending; a crazed Sally in the pick-up truck. The film is one amazing moment after another, from beginning to end.The actors are mostly unknowns to us today but that doesn't mean their acting wasn't good. The entire cast is excellent and game, ready to give their all. What I really like about the script is that everyone comes across as real. Some characters are even unappealing, like Franklin, the guy in the wheelchair, which you won't see done in movies these days. Today, everyone has to be cute, fun and likable, but in an edgy kind of way. Franklin is a real pain in the ass but having him in the movie makes the film feel more realistic. As for Marilyn Burns, well, she's probably the most underrated ""scream queen"" in history of film. While other actresses have made a career out of horror films and eventually moved on to other genres, Marilyn has been unlucky in this aspect. You'd think her career would have taken off after TCM but it didn't. The release of the TCM early in the 1970s is probably one reason why her star never shone like Jamie Lee Curtis. The ""fans boys"" that followed Jamie Lee's films were too young when TCM was released. As for the actors who played the Sawyer family, well, there isn't enough praise in the world for them. Jim Siedow is totally unforgettable. The same for Gunnar as Leatherface. But the greatest performance in TCM is surely given by Edwin Neal, the hitchhiker. Man, oh man, what a performance. His performance is so unbelievably believable that I wonder: was he even acting?Another great thing about THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is how it captures the feel and attitude of its time. It's a great time capsule. It's so in the moment, that watching it is like traveling back in time and being there in 1973 or 1974. And remember, this was a very troubled time. Vietnam. The Manson Massacre. Richard Speck. Nixon, etc. TCM is a true statement of the time it was made.But the thing that always gives me the creeps when I watch TCM is the scene at the beginning, when they drive by the cattle ranch and we see the poor animals while Franklin talks about how they are killed and everything. This gives the whole movie its queasy, black humor subtext: the folly of mass consumerism. The general public doesn't see how animals are killed in slaughterhouses. Our meats are always packaged neatly and look appealing. But we never see the real horror behind the benign act of buying some ground beef at a store. The story of TCM is sorta like what happens to the cattle but instead we see cannibals processing their food which, obviously, comes from humans. Hooper seemed to be using the whole horror story as a statement about mass consumerism gone horribly wrong. Sally running away from the Sawyer house is like the cow that got away from the slaughterhouse.All in all, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is so good that it's one of those rare gems that can be truly appreciated as a straight horror movie, as a black comedy and even as an art film. Personally, I think the film gets better and better with time. There hasn't been anything done like it since. The whole movie was the result of catching lightning in a jar. It's a one of kind film experience that can never be duplicated.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
112,baumer,Disturbing. Tense.,10,27 July 1999,"I realize that I have already written a review of this film but I just watched it again for the first time in a few years and I have to say more about it. TCM is a film that is a prime example of why horror films of the 90's can never match the horror of the 70's and 80's. This film was a dark disturbing look at a family gone mad. They have no reason, no remorse and no pity for doing the things that they do. The only thing I can even think of is that they have all worked at a slaughter house and the daily grind of taking an animal's life has desensitized them to the value of life, whether it be human or animal. I found it quite interesting that the film goes into great detail on how a cow is killed. Because what that does (besides gross us out) is it shows how sadistic a process it is to get our meat from the animal that it came from to the cellophane wrappers in the grocery store. And then when these butchers do the same thing to the humans in the story, it becomes more real, more disturbing and more eye opening. It makes the characters helpless. And it easy to live vicariously through the characters in this film, especially the main (Debbie) character. You can see how mad she has become by going through what she has. She has been brutalized in almost every way you can imagine. Physically, she is a mess, but psychologically she would never be the same after her experience. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a rare film that shows that you don't need special effects or even a large budget to make a scary film. All you need is some ingenuity, a vision and a horrific story. TCM has all three.Last House On The Left was disturbing because it was mean and graphic, TCM is disturbing because I have never felt that a film was more of a documentary than a Hollywood film. And that is perhaps why Hollywood can not produce really good horror films, because they all try to put their own take on things and then edit the hell out of the film. Some of the best horror films have been independents ( Halloween, Evil Dead and TCM ). I don't for one second believe that Debbie is an actor. To me she really went through this nightmare. She really was tortured by a sick family of cannibals. Her performance was one of sheer terror. When she screams, you believe that it is real. It felt and looked like Tobe Hooper just put a camera at this house and film all that went on there. And there really has to be a Leatherface. He felt that real. Also, the fact that there was absolutely no lighting can be attributed to two things. 1) I know they had no budget. But secondly, the darkness adds to the fear, the paranoia and the mass confusion that this movie makes us experience. There are times when you don't know what's going on. All you hear is that disgusting buzz saw. And you know it is close, but just not how close. I really believe that the lighting, or lack there of, is really a good element that this film possesses. There are people that have said that this film doesn't stand up well over time, that it has lost some of its scares. Well I challenge anyone to watch this film with the lights off, and alone. If you don't get frightened by all that this movie stands for, then I don't think there is a movie out there that can frighten you. Not Halloween, not Jaws and not Aliens. Because as great as those films are, they are not any more frightening than this film is. And if you are honest with yourself, no matter how much of a fan of modern horror you are, you have to admit that a horror film from 1974 beats the living hell out of anything that has been pawned off in the 90's. Urban Legend, Lake Placid, The Haunting, H2O, The Final Friday, Carrie 2, they all pale in comparison to what Texas Chainsaw Massacre will do to you. This film is the personification of fear. Films will never be made like this again. They are too intelligent and frightful. Tobe Hooper is a horror genius. This is his best and most honest work. Fear... is to know The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

114,gedikreverdi,A groundbreaking film for its time,6,1 August 2021,"There are some iconic scenes like Leatherface catching Sam from behind at the front door of the house while she was trying to run away and Sally being chased down the dirt road by Leatherface holding his chainsaw up in the air. I can get why this film is such a classic. But the problem is that there's no plot and dialogues are so weak. Besides all of the actors were a bit mediocre. They're traveling in their ford minivan and they ended up at a rundown gas station and there was no gas so they went over to the old ruined house that one of the girls grew up in. Franklin the paraplegic guy acted like a child all the time. Sam and Kirk wanted to swim and went to a creek nearby. But it was all dried up. So they went over to the house close to the dried creek to buy some gas. The house is so beautiful on the outside. Leatherface immediately killed Kirk and put Sam on the hook. When the other guy arrived he saw Sam in the refrigerator and he was killed too. The grandparents were upstairs and I thought they were dead but grandpa was alive. He looked exactly like a walking dead. The very long chase sequence of Sally was amazing. After Franklin got killed in the woods, she was chased thru the thick branches and twigs and then she walked into their house and saw the grandparents and then jumped off the window and ran over to the gas station. The longer the chase sequence, the bette and this one was flawless. But then she didn't stop screaming. She took refuge in that gas station but he was one of them too. The man took her to the house and that weirdo hitchhiker that they picked up earlier turned out to be Leatherface's brother. They were all portrayed as half wits and there were almost no dialogue. They made the grandpa such her bloody fingers and wanted him to kill her because he's the best. He couldn't properly hit her with the hammer and she managed to run away. After stopping a truck, she got to get away in the back of another truck. The ending of this film was too much of a torture porn with the endless screaming of Sally and the cannibal family members acting very funny without almost any talking. The gore was almost nonexistent but it was very disturbing.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
115,IonicBreezeMachine,Tobe Hooper's breakout hit is a classic for a reason.,8,10 October 2021,"Five teenagers consisting of Sally (Marilyn Burns), Sally's wheelchair bound brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain), Sally's boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger) and their friends Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn) drive across Texas to visit the burial site of Sally's grandfather to make sure it hasn't been hit by the rash of grave robbing that have struck the state. When the five make a side visit to Sally's Grandfathers former homestead, the group come face to face with a nightmarish family of cannibals.Released in 1974, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre became a breakout hit for sophomore director Tobe Hooper and along with other films like Psycho, Bay of Blood, and Black Christmas is recognized as a precursor of the slasher genre prior to the its establishment with John Carpenter's Halloween. 40+ years later, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre holds up as a prime example of the genre with its Ed Gein inspired narrative, atmosphere, performances, and craft that makes the film such a terrifying and engaging sit.From its opening narration read by John Larroquette, to its almost crime scene type cinematography of the opening grave disturbances, Texas Chainsaw Massacre has this almost docudrama like approach to its story and characters that utilizes its low frills/polish approach to give the impression these are actual people in a true crime story. The group have good chemistry with one another and are all engaging presences. When we get to the cannibal family with its most prominent member Leatherface, the film manages to take the premise and execution for unrelenting chills as well as hints of dark as black humor. Some characters do become a little grating such as Sally's brother Franklin who spends most of his screentime whining, moaning, and complaining, but it does add to the authenticity of the group dynamic. Despite its title suggesting otherwise, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is nowhere near as bloody or violent as people remember it being. The movie famously used only two pints of blood with Hooper purposefully limiting the gorework in the hopes of getting a PG rating (he didn't) but while the film never shows anything explicitly, it does suggest the violence and terror through atmosphere and acting of the players with the production design on the kill house being particularly memorable with multiple household items made of human bones.The Texas Chainsaw Massacare is a classic of the genre for a reason. With a simple premise and gritty production values and style that work with the limited budget, the film showcases Tobe Hooper's ingenuity as a director and raw intensity even when the blood and gore is more restrained than most people remember.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

117,TOMASBBloodhound,A template for so many others.,8,24 September 2006,"Who would have thought that this low, low budget film would have served as inspiration for so many other horror films for years to come. Not only have there been sequels, but also a couple remakes. A new film about the childhood of Leatherface will be out soon, as well. That such a small film could become such a pop culture phenomenon is truly amazing.The film itself, directed by Tobe Hooper was filmed over just a few days one hot summer in Texas. Hooper allegedly got the idea by imagining himself slicing his way through a crowded store using a chainsaw. Other accounts claim the film was inspired by the real life story of serial killer Ed Gein who, like Leatherface, wore around the skin from dead bodies. Either way you slice it, this film has all you need to make an effective horror film. It's brutal, cheap, atmospheric, has a great villain, and most of all, it's scary. The story deals with five young adults becoming stranded near a rural farmhouse where a cannibalistic family dwells, waiting for just these kinds of victims to happen by. There are about three generations of the family represented by some truly sick individuals. The most memorable being ""Leatherface"". He's a great big guy running around the property with a chainsaw and wearing a mask of human skin. The concept alone is shocking. The execution is outstanding.Despite the title, the film doesn't rely on too much gore. Only one victim is actually killed with the weapon of record. A couple of victims are bashed over the head like cattle from the slaughterhouse where the family once worked. Another young woman is hung on a meat hook. Apparently, the first young man whom we see Leatherface dispose of had never seen actor Gunnar Hansen in costume yet. His expression of shock when first confronted is genuine. As usual, the last good person standing is a female. She was played by the beautiful Marilyn Burns, and she gives as terrified a performance as any other woman in a similar film. Scene after scene pushes the characters and the audience to the limit. Just how much horror can you endure? How many disgusting characters will we be introduced to? One interesting footnote was that director Tobe Hooper intended this film to get a PG rating. He cut it numerous times, but no luck. What was he thinking? If released today, it would probably just be able to grab a PG-13. There are some who insist on looking for deeper meanings in this simplistic story. Some would claim that our victims' plight resembles that of many Americans in the 1970s during the gas crisis. Stuck, and at the mercy of those around us. The wheelchair-bound character Franklin would seem the perfect metaphor for being completely at the mercy of those who might not have any left to spare. Even if you don't look any deeper than the surface, you'll find a really terrific horror film here.8 of 10 stars. The Hound.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The documentary-look, the great acting, the original way to tell a story, even the effective marketing(the based on a true story); everything is classic. No wonder why it is considered among the best horror films ever done.Most of the film's scare factor is in the fact that Leatherface & his family are NOT superhuman, unlike other slasher-movies, there was nothing supernatural about them. They were just bizarre psychos whose only interest was to kill whoever they meet.The story is the classic slasher movie. A group of friends goes to the rural areas of the U.S. only to find a group of killers in an old house. What makes this movie different, is the way it handles the suspense for the most part of the movie. They pick up a hitchhiker and the whole scene turns so scary it's almost impossible to stop looking the screen, it's a superb way to handle suspense that one can only wonder why director Tobe Hooper's career never was a big one.Gunnar Hansen's portrayal of Leatherface is remarkable in the fact that he gives lots of humanity to his character. He is not a mindless killer, he has the emotions of a human being, but so distorted and twisted that he is truly scary. It's so real that it makes you wonder if truly there are people like those depicted in film.The rest of the cast does a good job in this low-budget film, you really feel for the victims, as one by one is killed by Leatherface. There is not really ultra violence here, but the movie doesn't need those gimmicks to be disturbing. The way it looks, they it feels, that's enough to give a powerful impression in the viewer.Maybe dated by now, but always remembered as a classic. Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre will always be considered a landmark in the horror genre.10/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

If you consider it's obviously low budget though, it's likely the most downright disturbing and horrifying movie ever made. A clear high-water mark in gore-to-dollar ratio, so-to-speak.Young children are actually exposed to harsher violence in modern media than what is shown in this film, but it manages to seem more real than most of the modern stuff, possibly because it comes from simpler times.

I wanted the experience to fill in a blank in my film knowledge, but I doubt I'll be sleeping well after this. It's pretty sick stuff with nothing to say about anything, but I guess a lot of people get off on that. To be blunt about it, this movie is ""torture porn"", which is one adjective too many for me personally. While it doesn't fully live up to all the hype I've read over the years, it should float your boat if you're into this kind of thing.

Well I don't think they are good, I mean of course The Shining and The Exorcist are of course Classics, they have a certain something and they can be watched these days too, because they are pretty descent. But the Omen and Rosemary's Baby, now that are two weak films, I don't know why they are so FAMOUS. They are BAD. But now on to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which had me belive for a moment it was actually based on a true story. It was good man, this is a classic and a good one too. It has great directing, a good story, good actors and so on. There is not as much blood in it as I expected there would be, but it still is gruesome. Leatherface is the best killer I have seen in a film up to date, he RULES. The directing style is superb and it sometimes reminded me of another great flick whose directors certainly know this one: The Blair Witch Project. This one is not to be missed by Horror fans and Film-freaks. It is one of the few TRUE classics.8/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
121,The_Movie_Cat,"""Do you think that guy'll try to follow us?""",8,13 May 2000,"Of course, the guy in question doesn't actually follow them, but they walk right into his house in a movie which defies classic character stupidity. This is less a horror film that makes you cry ""don't go into the cellar""; than ""don't go into that spooky old deserted house covered in dirt with dead animals' heads hanging on the wall and a squealing pig in the kitchen, particularly when you've just given a lift to a hitch-hiking madman who tried to knife you and said he worked in the local abattoir"".When I first saw this in the rental outlet I misread the title and presumed it was about a series of murders in a local DIY hardware shop - The Texas Chain Store Massacre. Okay, I didn't, it was just an excuse for my pathetic joke, but I was relieved to find that the film is actually set in a confines and atmosphere that do lead to ten or fifteen minutes of genuine terror. Banned in England for years, viewers today may spend more time laughing at the hippie studentspeak, along with the flares and sideburns, but at the end result there's nothing scarier than a deserted house in pitch darkness where a leathermasked man chases you with a chainsaw.Ultimately, you could see why it would be banned - there's no plot, no message, no agenda. It has nothing to say, and does nothing to condemn the behaviour demonstrated within. It's not even based upon a deeper psychology, as with The Driller Killer. The film is solely a surreal look at Southern sensibilities and outcast behaviour. Of course, anyone that's seen American Psycho will know what's going to happen up until just two minutes before the end, thanks to that movie's spoiler display of the video in the background. Not that it matters. While the real scares come in the chase between the moody Sally (Marilyn Burns) and the lip-licking Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), the last fifteen minutes see the tension dissipated as what has been underlying the film all along - a sense of camp self-parody - comes to the fore. We're introduced to Grandfather (John Dugan), essentially an ashen-faced corpse, who is designated the one who tries to strike a fatal blow to Sally's head. We watch as the arthritic grandfather tries in vain to hit her head with a mallet, his shaky hands constantly dropping the hammer with sub-comic effect. This can be a really silly film, as with the man in a HGV lorry who gets out and starts running... plot illogic, genre clichés and stereotypical character flaws are all built in to the plot with what was, I assume, self-aware irony. Pointless yet great fun, while the film is ultimately a joke, it is a good one, and for several minutes does achieve the aim of being genuinely terrifying.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

123,fernandoschiavi,"The feature is arguably one of the best horror films of all time, not only for bringing sharp direction and unexpectedly good interpretations and graphic disturbing scenes",8,31 July 2021,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a brutal, dirty, shocking movie that gets to the point of being shocking and sickening. Tobe Hooper innovated and created one of the most influential films in the history of cinema and even with several productions that tried to copy this work, it continues to stand out as the best.No other movie I've seen after him was capable of such a feat. Perhaps because of the perfect mixture of atmosphere, bizarre atmosphere, precarious photographic and documentary, added to the performance of the actors and the almost total lack of soundtrack, they help to convey an enormous realism to the film. The work looks more like a road movie interrupted by a haunting event, rather than a horror movie. In the first 35 minutes of the film, nothing happens apart from following the five young protagonists traveling and talking in their van. It is only after the 36th minute of the film that things start to take a horror movie, although some passages have already left the tense atmosphere and the gloomy atmosphere. Among these passages, the chilling opening stands out, with macabre flashes in the decaying remains of dismembered corpses. As well as the radio announcing a series of tragic and violent headlines and the crazy hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) scene. All these scenes leave a feeling of constant restlessness in the viewer, as if preparing us for something bigger. Almost notice. From then onwards, one of the most harrowing films of all time begins, in a mausoleum of horrors and bizarre made up of some of the most disturbing scenes in cinema.And when violence takes over in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Leatherface haunts. A simple puppet of old Sawyer (Jim Siedow) he seems to have no awareness of his actions, which makes him even more frightening. How could he not shiver at the sound of his chainsaw engine? Or not repulsed by the human skin mask he wears to hide his disfigured face? How not to feel the pain of Kirk (William Vail) with each hammer blow to his face or the helpless and paraplegic Franklyn (Paul A. Partain) as he is sawn in half in his wheelchair? In the following scenes there will be minutes and more minutes, endless, of hell - running, MMA intent for survival, chases, fatigue, the infernal buzz of an electric chainsaw, incessant and meticulously brutal, the terror is called stalking incessantly to automatic sympathy of the spectator for the protagonist, and as if coming from 'everything and how much', the places to run to. But no scene is more horrifying than the dinner where the ghastly Grandpa, with a sledgehammer, tries to whack Sally in the head. Pure bizarreness. The film's only flaw may be that it doesn't provide more information about the villains' past - but come to think of it, perhaps that's what makes them so threatening.Until today, the film works very well in the visual aspect. Made with a very low budget - approximately 300,000 dollars - the film surprises for the richness of details of its main locations and for the reality of its practical effects.Compared to dozens of other good productions later, Tobe Hooper's film is actually slower paced, with less action and mostly little free blood screening. However, despite this scorching natural chaos, the silence in the opening scenes, the ""nothing"" miles away, are a precise synthesis of everything that the film precedes. If right away, all we see is the sky, horizon... It's amazing how Tobe Hooper manages to keep the terror and the heavy mood in all the scenes, even in some bizarre scenes like the dead grandpa of the family, it's not clear if is dead or alive. Tobe Hooper makes good use of cameras to build good horror scenes. The scene where Sally despairs and we see everything from her point of view, plus the close-ups in her eyes are spectacular.The situations and dialogues presented at the beginning of the film lead to the possible interpretation that the cannibal family was not exactly the group of villains in the film, but victims of changes in the US economy at the time. They would have been driven to act violently for failing to maintain their slaughterhouse. Even so, they would only have gone from being simple grave robbers to murderers after the ""invasion"" of young people on their land. The low camera effect and Tobe's mise-en-scène corroborate this interpretation by frequently reversing the antagonistic position between the youngsters and the family of cannibals. In the first half of the film, however, the slow camera movement and low angles are used exclusively around the young people - which would represent the locals' feeling about their interference - the ""old"" versus the ""new"".The cannibal family has its members at different levels of Leatherface, the central figure of this circus, who previously worked with animal slaughter, it seems that he actually doesn't understand more about this species selectivism, and it seems that in his head humans don't pass from potential dangers. With the body of an adult with ""mental problems"" and the mind of a small child, it also seems that for a moment he doesn't even want to kill, but is protecting his own habitat, like a caveman - as bizarre as possible, of course. He has a brother, who doesn't exactly have a performance in the film, but who everyone knows as Hitchicker - hitchhiker. He's the most brazen of them all, the kind who makes the whole point in the world of mocking the victims before coldly killing them. Besides, he has a grandfather.... This one doesn't even have reactions, he's the walking dead in a wheelchair. But it serves well to explain that family traditions with the practices of cannibalism and psychopathy come from a long time ago.There are several highlights of this gem of fantastic cinema. The opening with a sequence of macabre flashes highlighting pieces of corpses decomposed and desecrated in a cemetery. The denouement with furious Leatherface dancing like a true maniac, doing stunts with his ferocious chainsaw tearing through the air in sudden jerks. And especially the insane chase where Leatherface runs at night in a forest after the young Sally Hardesty with her chainsaw whirring and thirsty to rip the woman's body apart. The scene takes so long, in several interminable minutes, that it practically forces us to hope that it is soon captured and thus ends the agony and torture in the spectator of so much running and hallucinated screams of pure despair. Never before in the history of Horror has a film been so marked by hysterical screams, screams of terror and despair so constant and even excessive - that it was something so remarkable and frightening.One of the best things about Massacre is that this side of screams of fear doesn't sound fake, maybe that's why it's so authentic, it perfectly represents the intensity of what it's like to die for someone who wants so much to live. And still talking about this aspect, this is one of the best tricks in the film, no one can be trusted, everyone should not only be feared but also avoided, there is no one to ask for help, and in this climate of conspiracy there only seem to be dead ends for all sides of thorny bushes. Screaming won't help you and you're alone... And live as long as your legs can handle running and your mind thinks fast of the right place to run.There are several ways to talk about this work. One might start by saying that it provides a variety of interesting interpretations, sociological philosophies, theories of thought, and analyses. Such as female representation, Karma, species selectivism and respectively, of course, the themes of cannibalism, capitalism, family representation, etc. This only goes to show a part of how much, as a horror, this is one of the main reasons for being so enshrined.However, the script written by Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper himself leaves a lot to be desired. From the beginning of the projection, we followed several obvious visual references and narratives, which dictate the characters' fates going forward. The shot in which the camera moves through a slaughterhouse while one of the youngsters explains, in full detail, how the slaughter of defenseless animals is carried out, and the reading of a pessimistic horoscope for the following days, are good examples of poor narrative development. Of the duo. As if that weren't enough, the climax of the third act involves an extremely unexpected and improbable solution (deus-ex machina) to the story's outcome.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is arguably one of the best horror films of all time, not only for bringing sharp direction and unexpectedly good interpretations and graphic rawness to its disturbing and violent scenes, but for doing something different from what is expected and showing that it's not always necessary to have a nice budget to create a definitive classic. Despite some flaws, other technical and creative requirements make The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a must-see for every lover of the seventh art. Understanding and appreciating how such a simple and inexpensive film could be so successful and massively influential decades after its release is one of the most positive and intriguing points of the experience.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Showing on a local cinema as a retro screener to celebrate a related anniversary date for the film, I decided to give this film a chance.It's so well known that a synopsis is not needed, but we have here a daddy of the torture porn genre, yet it is far more than that. It is incredibly well made, with some wonderful scenes and shots, it really grabs you.Leatherface is also interesting, as despite the horror he is actually quite a weak villain, and no unstoppable Michael Myers type of force. That's what makes him interesting. A brutal nasty figure, but also frighteningly child-like.The killings when they come are brutal, and there are some very memorable scenes, including the introduction of Leatherface and the meat hook scene, and the ending is just mesmerising.This is still a hard watch even after its age, but really it's a fabulous movie.

125,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Brutal classic,8,16 March 2006,"Sally, along with her brother and some friends, go to a graveyard that has been ransacked to see if the remains of their grandfather are still there and in one piece. They also decide to visit their old family home in the Texan countryside. After they do a bit of exploring they discover that there are some seriously demented people living nearby and their vacation quickly descends into a nightmare.Like many camp horror films that followed it, this film is pretty simple in terms of story and the film's undisputed strength comes in the atmosphere and the sense of danger. Added to that is the fact that many key fright scenes take place during the day, yet the gruesome sense of terror is more than present, it unrelenting. Pounding away beneath the surface. In addition to using natural light the film makes a large use of natural sound - piercing screams and that chainsaw! Many of the films murders have none of that sudden jolt of music that many other horror films ridiculously over use.Also some clever cinematography adds a punch. Especially during the dinner scene. Tobe Hooper cruises a fine line of what to show and what to leave to the imagination and he keeps that balance shockingly well throughout. Certain things you hear but don't see; some you see but without and non diagetic sound accompaniment; some you see but from an obscured angle; some you see in their entirety but for only a second. This really forces the viewer to imagine the a lot of terror and by the time the film is over it'll stick with you. And this is not a horror film easily forgotten. 8/10Rated R: horror violence and gruesome images",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
126,FilmOtaku,Classic horror film that becomes less scary and more enjoyable with age,8,19 October 2003,"Having recently caught a midnight showing of Texas Chainsaw Massacre at a local theater, I was reminded how age and an audience can affect one's perspective on a film.  When I first saw this film approximately 17 years ago, I was a fearless 13 year old who relished in the gore and parts that made me jump.  When I watched it a few years later I had become a certified film junkie and therefore viewed it from a more clinical perspective; looking past the gore and the cheap scares and appreciating Hooper's direction more.  Now, having seen it as a 30 year old I sat back and simply enjoyed it with an audience that obviously contained certified TCM fanatics. As an audience we ate up the gore, we cheered on the bad guys, castigated the teens for their profound stupidity and willed Leatherface to make mincemeat of Franklin as quickly as possible. It is not surprising that Texas Chainsaw Massacre is Tobe Hooper's first film.  He gets arty with shots, (the extended scene of the close-ups of Sally's eyeball) the continuity is at times questionable and the story line is fairly weak.  Having said that, it is extremely important to also mention the incredible effect this film had on American cinema.  Before TCM we had very few films about serial killers.  Arguably, the best known films featuring serial killing and mass murder would probably be the old monster films such as Dracula and the like.  Suddenly, we have a serial killer who not only decorates his home with trinkets and furniture comprised of human and animal remains, but who chases after you with a chainsaw wearing a mask made of human skin.  Not only is this a groundbreaking moment in horror film history, setting the stage for every Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees to come, but it is a film that stands the test of time and continues to have a profound impact upon viewing.--Shelly",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

129,Ben_Cheshire,This movie will make you turn vegetarian.,10,13 April 2004,"I can see why a whole generation of people in the 70's went vegetarian. This movie is a powerful, disturbing illustration of the double standard in society of what it is not okay to do to humans, but okay to do to animals (chop them up, skin them, use their corpses for raw materials and eventually eat them). There are hints all the way through this movie to this subtext: the first half hour of dialogue is laced with references to abbatoirs, animal cruelty - and the killings themselves are basically doing to humans what society does to animals (in an exaggerated, horror movie way, obviously). The fact that Leather face wears a mask of human skin, and this is called 'Leather' refers to the fact that we skin cows then wear their skin and call it leather. And the fact that Leatherface wears a butcher's apron the entire time, and the place he chops up bodies is sealed off by a big steel door which reminds one of a kitchen and an abbatoir.This might be the sickest, most disturbing thing i've ever seen - and i'm fairly open minded. Tobe Hooper's seminal horror classic is brilliant, to say the least, but i wouldn't recommend you see it - i certainly wish i hadn't.

130,tonypeacock-1,"Dated, low budget but gore free slasher horror.",7,27 May 2021,"I've had a few days to mull over this film and here are my thoughts about it:Dated 1970s production extremely low budget. Filmed on 16mm film stock I believe. The 16mm film adds to the gritty documentary like cinematography.Now the title, and indeed pictures and clips of this film you may have seen may make you believe it is a slasher horror blood-fest. It surprisingly isn't and indeed has very little gore when compared to more recent horror films.It has a simple story, a group of five teenagers drive through Texas in a camper van. On their journey they encounter a 'strange' family of cannibals who gradually start to kill them.The final act is probably the best of the film and shows a character called Sally (Marilyn Burns) being mentally tortured at a dinner table scene with constant screaming and close up shots such as her bulging eyeballs showing her terror at the crazy captor family including a crazed character with a Leather like face.Now the actual chainsaw is used briefly as she escapes from the house trying to get help on a local road escaping the leatherfaced chainsaw wielding madman.Now I admit for a purported slasher horror, admittedly an early example the gore is minimalist. It is the sheer terror of Sally's plight that makes the film terrifying in a different way.The constant screaming can become tiresome.The film begins with a written summary of the events of the film and ends with a black screen suddenly. Certainly the career high of Director Tobe Hooper.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This movie was dreadful..The acting was horrible just bad...And leatherface was not scary he was annoying....and I mean annoying...I thought the remake was much better. The actors were far superior to the ones in the classic and it was actually scary opposed to this one which was just annoying.This movie is about a group of friends who are visiting their grandfathers house when they are attacked by a chainsaw wielding maniac and his cannibal family.This movie was just unenjoyable to the core.

The movie builds, revealing the depravity of the family, until you see the creepy grandfather, who I swore was dead, start sucking vigorously on the girl's finger. Say what you want, that is the creepiest moment in the film. It also has a killer ending with Leatherface heaving his chainsaw around his head while lamenting the loss of his family's new couch ornament.

133,Prichards12345,The cast of Scooby Doo come to a sticky end...,5,22 October 2016,"And that's about all the plot there is to this movie. Technically for such a low budgeter the film is fine; it looks good, is surprisingly well-acted and directed, and sticks in the memory: and yet I just can't give it a high mark as there is something squamous and uncouth about the damn thing! TCM may have been seen by some critics as a satire on American family values but the final 20 minutes isn't much above the level of torture porn. The final survivor of the Mystery Machine Mob is subjected to mockery and psychological torture that I felt crossed the line. It's exhausting (entirely the point) and a bit too nasty. There is very little gore here, however, and I hope it's because of artistic choice rather than not having enough money to film such stuff. Director Tobe Hooper does a great job of making you think you see more than you actually do; your imagination takes over and runs wild. It's very cleverly done.The plot, though, is almost non-existent, and I found the victims unengaging and not particularly worth caring about. When they get whittled down by Leather-Face I didn't really feel much - maybe it's because the death scenes are handled matter of factly but pretty perfunctorily.A real stand out sequence is the scene where Leather-Face chases the girl thorough the woods - suspense rather than horror, excellently done. And the opening is queasily effective, too. This consists of live action ""snapshots"" of grave robbed corpses arranged artistically on a funeral monument, and it's this that starts the flimsy story in motion.As a genuine horror film fan I re-watched this movie with an open mind having not seen it in many years (and not enjoying it first time around) and my impression is still the same. It probably deserves a higher mark but it's just not a film to enjoy - too much dragging the viewer through the ordure. I did the same with Scanners recently and was pleasantly surprised. But not with this movie.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
134,DarthVoorhees,An uncompromising horror classic...,9,11 August 2010,"Horror has gone through stages, 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' marks the transition into the modern age of horror. 'Texas Chainsaw; was darker, scarier, and grittier than anything seen before it. It is a classic that is still effective and capable of scaring people after nearly forty years. Why? Tobe Hooper realized the true nature of fear. Horror films often are merely freak shows full of grotesques. 'Texas Chainsaw' takes a group of people and drags them ever closer to a place they would never want to go to. Hooper doesn't think his audience is stupid. Suspense is key.'Texas Chainsaw' feels real. It has sensationalist tendencies but there are pieces when we almost ignore them. The film looks like somebody brought out a home video camera and shot away. The feel of the film is blunt, to the point, and in many ways brilliant. Much is made of the documentary style filmmaking and it really is the highlight of the film. In someways it isn't what Hooper adds to his film but rather the horror clichés he omits. There isn't an overbearing soundtrack telling us how to feel. Our first introduction to the psychopath Leatherface is so abrupt we barely have time to collect our senses. It doesn't go for cheap jumpy scares. It heightens the tension but also strengthens our bound with the characters. I for one felt I was brought with into the Sawyer household and snuck into the rooms with our characters. It isn't because these characters are really all that well written, besides for Sally and Franklin, none of them have any sort of personality. The reason we care for them is because the distance is lessened. Real empathy is generated when we view these characters as human beings and not stereotypes. There isn't a glaring horror soundtrack or a character archetype spouting clichés. We forget we are in a horror film. The grimness of the situation speaks for it's self. The bones, the hideous man child, and the cannibalism need no more accenting lest they become over the top.People seem to forget that Chainsaw is a well acted picture too. Jim Siedow, Gunner Hansen, and Ed O'Neil all create fully fleshed out villains. We've seen various characters like Leatherface in countless horror films but Hansen adds depth to it. He isn't merely a mute with a chainsaw. Acting mute doesn't mean throwing a performance away. Hansen' performance is fully dimensional despite us never seeing his face. There is a brilliant scene in the film which really highlights both Hansen and Hooper's work. It is the first scene where we get to get a really close look at Leatherface, his face is accented by the dim sunlight coming through the slits of the shudders. Horror doesn't advertise that it's horror, we take a good look at Leatherface the only sound being his childlike groans. Leatherface looks somewhat pathetic in this scene, sad and unaware of the evil he is doing. That is really the strength of all the actors of the Sawyer family. In a twisted way they don't believe what they are doing is wrong. In someways the absurdness of the scenes where Siedow gathers his family for a meal both give us a break from the terror while intensifying it at the same time. We find ourselves with a little smirk but we soon realize the horror behind it. The Swayer family gives brilliant performances which bring out the best of the script.All in all 'Texas Chainsaw' is a well shot and well acted film which won't be forgotten any time soon. It's a blueprint every horror film actor should look at.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
135,acidburn-10,70's horror at it's best,10,6 March 2007,"Major classic horror from the 1970's where five teens take a road trip across Texas stop by an old house and gets stalked and killed by Leatherface.Director Tobe Hooper knows how to scare his audience and starts out slowly to shock us with a bang, then another, and then just keeps the shocks coming while keeping up a sweaty pace. Even if you know what's coming, the creepy feeling of the terror closing in is still freakishly intense.I love the contrast between the colourful 70's fashion (bell bottoms, flashy shirts, crazy sideburns) and the deadly surrounding and also not knowing what's about to happen to them.What this movie has which the other sequels lack is a sense of realism like we get to know the characters before they meet they're fates. When the horror kicks in, it's brutal and exhausting. We have the seemingly never-ending chasing-scene where poor heroine Marilyn Burns is followed by the furious Leatherface through the woods, in the house and through the woods again. Without Hooper's excellent direction this scene would die after a minute or so, but it has Leatherface so close onto Burns that you're glued to the seat and praying the she'll get away.The acting is top notch, Marylin Burns (Sally) truly gave a believable performance as the lead heroine, Paul A Partian (Franklin) plays the annoying wheelchair bound brother excellently, Edwin Neal (Hitchiker) gave me shivers every time I saw him especially the van scene he's maybe a bit too believable as a psycho. Jim Siedow (Old Man) gives a deranged, unpredictable performance and last but not least Gunner Hansen as Leatherface himself gives a rather startling performance as the chainsaw wielding psychopath.Despite there not being much gore, this movie packs a punch with really tense scenes like when Leatherface drags a doomed girl through the house and hangs her on the meat hook, I can only imagine the pain and torture she's suffered and the most brutal murder of all Franklin murdered with the chainsaw defenceless in his wheelchair, and the scary invited to dinner scene with Marylin Burns as the psycho family's guest.All in all this isn't just another run of the mill Slasher it's a masterpiece in film making.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
136,skepticskeptical,The Utter Horror of It All,8,15 February 2020,"I have been studying screenwriting and so decided to watch some of the horror classics I missed, having renounced the genre long ago. Turns out that there is a thing or two to be learned from movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). Above all: how to keep forward momentum going!The Texas Chainsaw Massacre starts out seeming like some sort of Coen brothers production--set in the South, featuring hicks and ignoramuses of dubious intelligence and morality. It´s the 1970s, so one of the ¨chicks¨ is reading a fat tome on astrology, and everyone is wearing either bell bottoms or micro-shorts. They are traveling in a Ford van and pick up a hitchhiker, who seems to be tripping on acid or else severely unbalanced, it soon emerges, making the group later vow (after expelling him from the van) never to pick up a hitchhiker again. This disturbing fellow makes the two couples and the handicapped brother seem like the most civilized and sophisticated people ever to have graced the planet.About thirty minutes in, the real horror tale begins as the hapless group of road trippers stop to get gasoline. The rest is a non-stop series of scenes of horror, each providing moments of release building up to the next scene of horror, until finally the madness ends with the lowering of the curtain.I am on record for saying that the most horrifying story committed to film is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (about Henry Lee Lucas). However, now I see that a group of psychokillers is much more horrifying than a solitary, completely unpredictable one. The family depicted in Texas Chainsaw Massacre amps up the unsettling sense of atrocity, as it becomes clear that sadistic serial killers may be created by nature or nurture or, as in this case, a combination of both.Unforgettable!!!!!!(Note on rating: I usually bestow a rating of 7 or higher only upon films which I feel would be worthwhile to watch again. I am making an exception in this case, for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is surely exemplary in its genre, though I have no intention of ever watching it again.)",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
137,virek213,Cutting-Edge Cult Horror...LITERALLY,8,27 April 2002,"Few films, horror or otherwise, have ever approached THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in the controversy department.  When it was first released around Halloween in 1974, it caused a furious firestorm over its alleged depravity and exploitational use of blood and gore.  Not surprisingly, of course, CHAINSAW became a huge hit, going on to earn between thirty and forty million dollars on a budget of less than $500,000.Loosely based on the Ed Geinn case, the one that also inspired Hitchcock's PSYCHO, CHAINSAW focuses on a group of Texas teens who fall prey to a family of ghoulish cannibals in rural Texas.  One of the ""family"" is a deranged character known as ""Leatherface"" (Gunnar Hansen), whose tool of trade is not a knife or a hatcher, but a McCulloch chainsaw.  And the teens who find their way to the family's home after they are unsuccessful finding a filling station in the middle of nowhere will find themselves at the mercy of this depraved bunch.  Only one of them (Marilyn Burns) will survive...and even she won't survive in one piece (psychologically speaking).The film remains notorious to this day for its alleged extreme gruesomeness: body parts, buckets of blood, the loud, whirring chainsaw, etc.  But as Hitchcock had done with PSYCHO, in CHAINSAW, director Tobe Hooper, who later went on to make POLTERGEIST, leans more towards suggestion than extreme violence.  Only in a scene in which one of the teens is strung up on a meat hook (shades of A MAN CALLED HORSE) is there any real bloodshed.  Often put in the same place of other cinematic bloodbaths of dread like LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, CHAINSAW seems to me to actually be a more extreme version of films like STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE, two other shocking horror films set in rural back country and dealing with violence and subhuman behavior.The morbid combination of claustrophobia, scathing black comedy, and naturally realistic acting from a cast of rank amateurs helps give CHAINSAW its bleak, almost documentary-like quality.  Horror and suspense fans shouldn't hesitate to pick it up on video, but be warned: the 'R' rating the film received is there for a reason.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Little do they know next door to Sally's grandfather's house there is a family of cannibals. One in particular who is fond of the chainsaw.From here on they get killed one by one in very horrific ways.I can honestly say this is one of the scariest movies I have seen because it doesn't rely on cheap frights to scare the audience. Most of the kills happen in broad daylight and there is no blood, which makes it more terrifying. The supper scene towards the end is extremely claustrophobic in its feel.

This movie was obviously made cheaply, and the acting does leave a bit to be desired. But this movie made a sensation nonetheless, not to mention spawning a brace of sequels and a remake.

146,asda-man,"A truly terrifying, roaring classic!",10,27 February 2012,"""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" really does not need any explanation given to it. It's classic horror and if you are a horror fan, you aren't really a proper one if you haven't seen this one yet. To be fair, it took me a fair long while to get my hands on it, I was waiting for it to come on the telly, but I got fed up of waiting and decided to just buy it to coincide with my ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" (which is completely different, but good in its own way.) The title may be eye-catching, but it has some incredible content to warrant that title.""The Texas Chain saw Massacre"" is just full of so many classic moments, from the hitch hiker scene to Kirk's death, from the dinner scene to leatherface's insane chainsaw ballet, it's incredibly iconic. It's also one of the very few films that has managed to scare me. Some people might laugh at it in places, but to me (and many others it seems) it's just completely terrifying. ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" has this unique raw feeling, which separates it from other films, because it doesn't feel like a film, it feels real and almost documentary-like. It's surreal insanity also makes for unsettling viewing because it feels like a nightmare. There's a choking atmosphere of dread throughout, which probably shines through because the cast actually went crazy in that unbearable baking heat.The lighting and cinematography are both impressive too. The final scene makes excellent use of the piercing morning sun, which gives this horrible edge to the images (a good kind of horrible) and the dinner scene is terrifyingly intense with the sharp sounds and close-ups of Marilyn's eyes. The chainsaw chase sequence is probably one of my favourite scenes in horror movie history. It completely renders that horrific feeling of being chased by someone with a chainsaw. The lack of music in that scene also adds to its stark realism. This film is way ahead of its time.Gunnar Hansen and the rest of the cannibal clan are also uncomfortable actors to watch. Gunnar's movements are brutal and scary, as he sort of stomps around and moves in a very animalistic way unlike Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger who are both slight fellows. Leatherface is very scary villain. Grandad is also pretty disturbing with the unnatural make-up and abnormal behaviour. ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is also responsible for one of the most annoying characters in film history. Franklin. The wheelchair man. His high-pitched texan voice and irritating behaviour are both funny and annoying! But I think that he contributes to the film in a good way.Sound is used effectively as well, with the ambient noises of the abattoir playing in the background, and the piercing stings to highlight the imagery being used. Everything from the sound of the chainsaw to Marilyn's excellent vocal screaming all works perfectly to construct some realistic and scary footage! The ending is also beautifully done, and leaves you thinking, ""what the hell have I just witnessed?"" Some might say ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is slow to build-up but I disagree. There's an atmospheric scene with the hitchhiker and a brilliant build-up to the obscure events that follow. It's a nightmarish and terrifying film that will always stay with you. It also seems to get better with every viewing, and acts as more of an experience than your average horror film. It's genuinely scary and quite simply a classic. If you haven't seen it yet, just go onto ""Amazon"" and click ""Buy"". It's worth your time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

148,elicopperman,The Iconic Slasher Flick that Revolutionized its Genre,7,3 October 2021,"Although the slasher genre is not as fondly looked upon as other horror film categories, there have been some notable gems within it that have left massive impacts on the art of cinema over the years. One of the biggest and most horrific examples is the critically lauded classic, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. While the film left critics unimpressed on its original 1974 release, it blew audiences away to the point of growing from a cult classic into one of the most innovative horror films in terms of kicking off tropes and staples, in addition to its own franchise with sequels, remakes & TV spinoffs. So how does it hold up today?The film follows a young woman named Sally Hardesty, her parapelegic brother and their friends, who intend to visit her grandfather's old homestead in central Texas, but end up falling victim to a family of cannibals. With this concept in mind, the film plays up the suspense by allowing the real threat of danger slowly build itself up while the main characters take their time to get to their destination. Just when it feels that the plot is losing momentum, something suspicious lurks around the Hardesty's journey, be it a strange fellow in the town or the homestead itself having a peculiar presence to it. Even though this film is fairly fictional, the fact that it was inspired by real life Texan murderers adds a rather barren sense of unfamiliarity that makes it feel more real than most slasher films after its time. The third act might have the most unsettling vibe of all though, with so much psychological torment towards Sally that it gives Hitchcock, Powell & Romero a run for their money. After all, only in the vast plains far away from civilization can barely anyone hear you screaming.As for the idea that the film is a commentary on pro-vegetarianism, director Tobe Hooper has gone on record to say that the main theme intact is how far gone the chain of life can be in killing sentient beings. Some films that comment on the dangers of the food chain tend to preach themselves to the choir, but with a film that goes out of its way to show the worst that cannibalism can do to others, there's now a higher possibility to stick towards healthier eating habits than ever before. That being said, the debate of whether or not the feature could be a possible paradigmatic exploitation on violence towards women is unfortunately likely, as Sally does end up being the sole survivor of her otherwise paper thin pack. Considering how aggressive the women in the film are killed and tortured among the men, as well as all the aforementioned psychological torment, it does give the film an unintentional questionable outlook on how horror films portray female victims. Then again, perhaps that's up to the individual viewer's insight on what fascinates them in terms of violence overall.Going in to other notable qualities, the low budget and minimal time that the filmmakers had to work with give the film a lot more personality. When needed, the editing can be appropriately choppy and jarring in order to mess with the audience's senses whenever someone is in life threatening danger. The janky camera moves, repetitive albeit minimal light flickers, and almost impossible to view night time cinematography complete the more gruesome scenes in heightening both the suspense and over concern in whatever is supposed to be going on. Not to mention, the otherwise mute Leatherface, loosely based on Wisconsin convict Ed Gein, plays up a lot of auditory pandemonium through his blood curdling squeals and his bone crunching chainsaw, making the viewer's ears cringe just as much as their eyes. Had this film been made with a higher budget in a major Hollywood studio, its down to earth aesthetic would not have translated well. All of these crude qualities make the film feel more real than the average slasher flick, thus giving it so much personality that can never be messed with.While some horror films love to showcase the fictional supernatural, classics like Texas ChainSaw Massacre stand out by showcasing the freaks and psychos that no sane human being would ever want to come across in the real world. Not only did the late Tobe Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel create a unique slasher flick that has yet to be unmatched, but they debatably refined a whole genre with something brand new that kicked audiences in the gut harder than your standard schlock fest. Gore does not a scary movie make, but one's appetite for meat sure does, and this film ain't fooling around either.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
149,Rickting,Don't watch it before visiting Texas,8,18 December 2014,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good example of a controversial and banned film that's actually really good. Despite the horrid title, it's not as violent as it's made out to be and there's not a lot of blood. Although it was banned until 1999 it looks fairly tame by today's standards, but what horror filmmakers should realize is that gore is not scary. It can actually be rather tedious. This low budget horror film about a group of 5 young adults on a trip to the house of the grandfather of 2 of them who encounter a family of cannibals, including a chainsaw wielding maniac thankfully defies expectations and avoids the red stuff mostly. Mixing subtle social commentary with terrifying, borderline harrowing horror, be warned: Bring the cushions (to hide behind). Tobe Hooper, sadly stuck on B movies presently, uses documentary style camera-work with excruciatingly long takes and an uncanny sense of realism mixed with surreal imagery to create a nightmarish story of terror that feels strangely real.The acting is decent. There are no standouts but none of the actors give bad performances. The script strips the genre right down and keeps things uncomplicated, making the film feel more realistic. Leatherface, the chainsaw wielding maniac, never says a word and isn't even the leader of the grotesque parody of a family that capture the main characters, but certainly leaves the biggest impression. In general, the film is shot brilliantly and thanks to the social commentary isn't just tasteless exploitation. However, the social commentary is a bit too subtle for many who haven't already read analyses of the film to get, so the film may just seem like unpleasant violence for no reason. The characters and plot are paper thin; minimalism works well in this case, but whenever the characters die there's little emotion associated with their exits. The lack of interesting protagonists with distinguishable personalities prevent this from being a truly great film, but it is something of a classic which is a truly scary classic. For once, the jump scares don't ruin the movie.8/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
150,Nightman85,"A relentless, horrifying trip!",10,27 December 2008,"Highly intense, feverish low budget horror classic is simply one of the most nightmarish films of American cinema!!Young travelers in rural Texas keep having run-ins with weirdos that have a very strange taste for certain kinds of barbecue.Director Tobe Hooper is one of the best horror filmmakers of all time and it was this scary, influential masterpiece that brought him to horror fame. Hooper made the most of a low budget with this film, using the raw, gritty locations and even the grainy film stock to make this film seem terrifyingly realistic. From the eerie opening voice over to the sweat-inducing conclusion, Hooper rides the audience through a world of madness, violence, and darkness that is a pure assault upon the senses! Its extreme suspense and unsettling atmosphere make it the most gripping kind of horror film. Yet despite it's reputation, and the implication of the title, this film is a relatively gore-free movie! The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has far more psychological violence than it does physical violence, and that may just be the most effectively terrifying angle of this horror masterpiece. Hooper's direction is top-notch indeed! The music score is also nicely disturbing.The no-names cast works even better for the realism of the film, as they all put on convincing performances. Burns, Danziger, Vail, and McMinn make for familiar, likable teenagers. Partain does comic relief well in his some-what annoying role as Burns's invalid brother. But it's the villains of this film that have the most memorable performances. Neal is truly frightening as a loonie hitchhiker. Siedow is both darkly funny and scary as a seemingly harmless old man. And of course, Hansen is shockingly frightening as this films horror icon, Leatherface.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest low budget horror films of all time, and probably one of the greatest horror films period!

152,destroyerwod,Was surely great in its time... but its been redone better.,6,13 October 2021,"I saw this movie for the first time couple nights ago as #12 on my Halloween Season movie marathon. Sadly like most movies from that era it didn't amaze me. The thing is i know this was surely a big deal in 1974, as movies were not what they are now, and i heard all the stories on how this movie was made on a small budget and the actress had a tough time. So thats why i will try to not be too harsh on it.If i try to put myself in context of that era, it was surely a great movie. But seeing it almost 50 years later, it ain't the same.I know part of the issue is how i feel toward the way movies of that era are filmed. The voices/audio, the colors, the slow moving of the plot. It seem to not catch with me more often than not. There is a few exeptions but in general its the case.The first half of the movie really felt kinda boring to me, and a bit weird. It does serve a purpose to introduce ""The Hitch Hiker"" character, but the dialogues, the behaviors of the characters etc really felt off to me.The movie is also almost goreless and bloodless. Wich is suprising for a movie about a Chainsaw Massacre. I really enjoyed the 2003 remake with Jessica Biel back in the days and even more its prequel. It wasn't especially gory either (the prequel was much more) but the characters were more interesting to follow in my opinion, both the protagonist and the crazy family.I know i am gonna infuriate some peoples, but this is precisely why remakes exist and more often than not, our love for older movies are tied to nostalgia and memories. Thats why i am all for remakes, because they take classic stories and put them in a modernized context so the younger audience can enjoy them.Like i said before, the OG TCM ain't a bad film, it was surely amazing back then, and still is ""watchable"", but i just feel its been redone ...better.

153,Space_Mafune,Deserves its Status as Horror Cult Classic,9,8 December 2003,"[CONTAINS SPOILERS]Following a bizarre cemetery desecration in Murtaugh County, Texas by someone who decided to make art out of the corpses, Sally Hardester (Marilyn Burns), her brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain), her boyfriend Jerry (Allen Danziger) and their friends Kirk (William Vail) and Pam (Teri McMinn) visit the graveyard to make certain their grandfather's grave has not been disturbed. Feeling reassured that it hasn't, they leave in their van. Along the way, they decide to visit the old house nearby that the two of them grew up in when they spot an hitch-hiker (Edwin Neal) near the local slaughterhouse. This hitch-hiker proves to be quite the disturbing character full of tales about the local slaughterhouse, most of which are disturbing and disgusting to normal folks but not this fellow. No he gives to meaning to the word ""weirdo"". Anyways eventually he becomes more and more agitated and finally attacks one of the kids with a knife. Following this, he is soon booted out of the van after which he smears his blood on the side of the van...to leave his mark perhaps? Eventually they make it to the old Hardester place despite the fact that the local gas station had no gas to put into the van. After exploring the old house and finding it not as exciting as hoped, Kirk and Pam decide to investigate the local water hole Franklin had told them about only to find it now dry and dusty when they hear a generator. Going to explore, Kirk eventually discovers an house with the door left open. After going in to explore, Kirk disappears while Pam wonders what's happened to him eventually venturing into the house herself discovering something worst than any nightmare she could ever imagine...and Leatherface. This movie is an onslaught on the senses. It's without any doubt one of the first Horror films to grab the viewer right by the throat and never let go. It manages to make its characters human..flawed beings but human. Even the most disturbing of characters here has human failings and weaknesses. This is especially important to establish in a film that wants its audience to feel for what are in this case its victims...for the film to have full impact we have to empathize with their situation and we certainly do here. The lack of gore leaves much to the imagination and what the imagination dreams up is usually far worse than what generally came to be shown on screen. The sound effects add to this feeling enormously as does the frantic pace of the film. Watching this movie affects the viewer because its events don't seem so impossible as we know that deep down human beings can be the most terrifying of all the Earth's creatures.

157,dfle3,"Not as horrific as by reputation, and has some scenes that will stick",5,19 June 2008,"When I was a teenager, I hired this movie when I was looking for extreme horror, and the title and reputation of this movie seemed to guarantee that (my attitudes have changed in the meantime, as illustrated in my review of ""Hostel"" here).Since it's been so long since I've seen this movie, I'll just recall some impressions of this movie: * Firstly, I was disappointed by the amount of shock value of this movie-nowadays, I suppose that this might be welcome! In other words, if you are after extreme gore, this is not the movie for you.* The story was apparently based on an actual case in America-as was Alfred Hitchcock's movie ""Psycho"". There could not be two more disparate movies in style and substance and they don't really seem to have that much subject overlap. You do have to wonder how much either of those movies owes to an 'actual' case.* There are some moments of shock in this film...e.g. when ""Leatherface"" makes his first appearance.* Not sure whether this was in the movie or not, but I seem to remember having a weird dream which I attributed to a scene from this movie-my dream had a weird looking chicken in a undersized bird-cage. As I've said, some scenes stick out in this movie.* And lastly, the main reason I am posting this review is to mention something which REALLY surprised me...the TV series The Simpsons ripped off a scene from this movie! I can't say that they parodied it or satirised it, as they basically just replay an entire scene from this movie. It's the scene where ""the family"" are eating at the table together and...(I won't spoil it for you). Now, what's strange about all this as that I was STAGGERED that the writers of the Simpsons drew on one of the most notorious horror movies of all time to 'satirise'. When I saw this movie for the first and last time all those years ago, I did find that scene funny...incongruously funny. It's VERY black humour I can understand why The Simpson's writers would want to bring that scene to a new audience.I don't have any philosophical objections to seeing this movie again sometime.

It sparked a genre to create hundreds of copycats, so they must have been doing something right, but I just can't see it. Mindless killing with no motive at all is scary for the people involved, but the extreme unliklihood of it ever occurring makes it very difficult for others to relate. The dialogue made it even more difficult to relate because it was so unnatural. Every line was either abnormally cryptic or just plain nonsensical. So maybe it had something unique for its time, but it doesn't hold up well. In the end, it's just random killings of people we don't care about using methods that others have done much better since its release.

The bones on the set were real-only 10 plastic bones used I believe. There is a realism here that no one has ever been able to recreate. You can almost smell the decay and rot. Couldn't a person actually smell this house before seeing it? Possibly. The acting is slightly over the top but very realistic at the same time. The lighting perfect. What makes this film such a favorite? The realism, the boldness, the editing, the look, the characters. All of it. A chilling film.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
163,emperor_bender,"Great movie, real original, but wasn't my favorite",6,27 September 2007,"I know this is the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I'm usually all about ""Originals being better than sequels"". But I think this movie is somewhat overrated. I like this movie a lot, don't get me wrong. But it shouldn't be praised as the greatest movie ever. I cannot say that the story line is overused and boring because this movie came out long before all the knock off movies did, it even beat Halloween by about 4 years. If There was anything in particular I didn't like about this movie, it would be the pacing. Some scenes were dragged on a little too long. Like Sally sitting in her chair screaming...OK, shes scared, we get it. But it showed her screaming for about 10 minutes, and to be honest, I had to turn the volume down as it was hurting my ears. The chase scene was pretty good, but again dragged on a little bit too long there. Franklin trying to get around and stuff, we get hes handicapped already, leave the poor guy alone, the scene where they were all giggling upstairs while he was crying downstairs was unneeded. And that stupid hippy, Jerry didn't make it much better. Why didn't Sally stop hangin around him? He was rude to her brother yet she stuck to him like a magnet. OK, Im ranting again This movie was great, it was better than the 4th one, but I think the 2nd and 3rd ones beat this one. 6/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
164,Gafke,Vicious and Ingenious.,10,31 March 2004,"Deep in the heart of Texas, during a long, brutally hot summer, locals are stumbling upon the remains of descrated graves and vandalized plots. Bodies have been unearthed and arranged in profane tableaux. There are no suspects. Young Sally Hardesty arrives with her brother and three friends to check on the grave of her grandfather. When they cannot locate his grave, they journey instead to the abandoned farmhouse where he once lived. They pick up a strange hitchhiker, who stabs himself in the hand and then gleefully attacks Franklin, Sally's wheelchair bound brother. They kick the hitchhiker out and drive on until they arrive at the old homestead. As the group wanders around the neglected property, Pam and her boyfriend Kirk decide to go swimming. Discovering that the creek has dried up in the intense heat, Kirk & Pam instead wander to an old house behind the Hardesty farm. Kirk disappears inside and Pam goes looking for him. Upon entering the house, she discovers a horrific scene: a room littered with bones and furniture made from skeletal remains. Disgusted and frightened, she runs from the room, only to be set upon by Leatherface, a huge, hulking man in a bloodstained butchers apron and a mask made from the skinned face of a corpse. One by one, the group disappears into the charnel house until only Sally and Franklin are left. When they set out to find out what's become of their friends, they are attacked by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface, who brutally murders Franklin while Sally watches, horrorstruck. Sally runs screaming for help only to run right into the head of the cannibal family, who stuffs Sally in a bag, beats her black and blue and drags her back to the house for dinner with the family; Leatherface, whose actual face is never seen and who only communicates with piglike sounds, and his brother, the hitchhiker who had terrorized Sally and her friends earlier. The family was once in the butcher business, and have since been replaced by machines. Reluctant to give up their trade, they have turned to grave robbing and murder. Sally is tied to a chair, tormented, tortured and finally bent over an old washtub to be bludgeoned to death by an ancient family member who can barely hold a hammer. Can Sally escape? And even if she does survive, what will be left?The very title of this film ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" still makes people flinch to this day. It is considered one of the most brutal and violent films ever made, which is rather ironic considering that there is actually very little violence to be found in this film at all. Despite the title, there is only one death-by- chainsaw, and it is filmed from the rear so that no actual chainsaw penetration is ever seen. Most of the films' raw power comes from the suggestion of violence, and the psychological terror is much more effective (and plentiful) here than blood. Poor Sally - she really suffers in this film. She's chased by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface through the night time woods, she's beaten up with a broom handle, stuffed into a bag, tied to chair, gagged, mocked and mimicked, bludgeoned by a guy who looks older than God and finally chased and slashed by a knife wielding weirdo in the films climax. This movie puts you in her position for much of the film. You can't help but squirm uncomfortably as three inbred freaks leer at you and squeal like pigs as you scream for mercy. You spend a good long time waiting for the inevitable, and the wait itself is the real horror, wondering what's going to happen to you, how much it will hurt and if you'll end up in a Mason jar as breakfast sausage. It also manages to make you a voyeur as you watch the proceedings through the dead eye of the camera, helpless to stop it or look away. You may even laugh a few times at the absurdity of the cannibal family and their antics...and then feel guilty for your giggle. This is a truly powerful film. It's sick, it's horrifying, it exhausting, but it's never needlessly gory. It doesn't need to be. This is Southern Gothic, psychological horror at its best.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Little can be said about this that hasn't already been said; but it certainly shows how much can be done with sound and noise, soundtrack, decidedly creepy cinematography and suggestion rather than showing. Responsible for and using many classic horror tropes, it's a deeply unnerving portrait of humanity reduced to the animalistic, with the Texas wastes standing for a frontier where nothing is safe and the rules that govern society have broken down. A classic, the influence of which on so much that would follow is apparent watching it from this vantage point. I doubt I'll revisit it, but for anyone serious about understanding film history and horror, in particular, it's essential no matter where you stand on it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
166,skybrick736,Texas Chainsaw Massacre 7/10,7,23 February 2015,"The most weirdly artistic horror film I have seen has got to be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Everything is just a little bit different than the norm here, camera-work, acting and casting. This unique style turned out to be a home-run in the theaters and is widely known as one of the top horror films out there. Texas Chainsaw Massacre provides a couple of the most memorable scenes in horror for at least myself when Leatherface is first introduced into the plot. The first two consecutive death scenes were pretty scary when I first saw the movie when I was a kid. If you don't know what I'm talking about, the scenes involve a hammer, slamming door and a meat hook. Can't forget how classic the dinner scene is too. I do have a huge gripe though with Texas Chainsaw being the extremely annoying character of Franklin. There is no reason for a filmmaker to create a character that unlikable, to the point as a viewer of me clapping when he faces his demise. All the other characters were great however, especially the family of psychos. The family really portrayed the part of crazy lunatics to the next level. Those actors made me wonder if they were actually that crazy in real life. Texas Chainsaw will continue to be a timeless classic that will be looked at as a contributor to different transitions in horror cinema.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

There's something that can be said for realistic, almost feasible horror occurring to regular people. This one hits it out of the park! It's hardly the gore fest that many consider it to be when they avoid it based on the title, or as they recall it from years back. What occurs during this flick is mostly up to the audience member. So much is alluded to, the set design is so top notch, and the shooting style is so raw that one feels they are seeing far more on-screen blood and guts. It's great film-making! This is the psychological horror movie Hitchcock was trying to make when he made ""Frenzy"" two years earlier, as he too went back to ""Psycho"" for inspiration. This is a truly great work of cinematic entertainment.That's not all, however. Interweaved within all of the gruesome nature is a deeper meaning that speaks about the generation this film was born during, and it offers up suggestions as to why filmmakers continue to go back to the horror genre after all of these years.

The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to the Sawyers, a family of cannibals, while on their way to visit an old homestead. Gunnar Hansen plays Leatherface who wears a mask of human flesh. He regarded the character as mentally retarded, and visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke in order to prepare for the role. Robert A. Burns designed the incredible sets, with skeletons of animals transformed into furniture and the floors of the Sawyers farmhouse littered with feathers and teeth.

171,theshadow908,"Good, albeit overrated",6,7 August 2006,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre tells the story of five friends that are driving across Texas on a road trip. When they stop to visit an old house where two of them, a girl and her brother, grew up, their day goes horribly wrong. All of them are quickly dispatched by a chainsaw wielding maniac, and the last survivor is taken hostage by the maniac's family of cannibals. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a the ""classic"" that started the slasher genre, but it is overrated.I have infinite respect for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, because it is a cheesy low budget film that director Tobe Hooper had to struggle to make, dealing with the hot Texas sun and his low budget, and yet he was able to churn out a cult classic that is still loved today. What I like about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is that it paints a very disturbing picture. It's not the bubblegum horror movie you'd see nowadays. It's psychologically disturbing. It blasts your senses with sights and sounds you'll find very disturbing a graphic. The chilling score is made up of various sounds you'll hear in a slaughter house. The whole movie is very claustrophobic, with the camera getting super close-ups of the victim's eye, and the camera cutting to random, disturbing images in the middle of a scene. The movie is very disturbing that way.What I don't like is the way the plot pans out. It is far too simplistic. The people who are killed die too soon into the film, and it all happens too fast. The last half hour or so of the movie is the last survivor screaming non-stop, and it gets annoying. I also didn't like how certain scenes are so dark you can't even see them. This may have been done for effect, but it only ruined the experience for me. Obviously the acting isn't even close to good, but what can you expect from a low budget 70's horror.Overall, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an okay movie to watch, and it deserves respect, but I just don't think it's the cinematic masterpiece everyone says it is.6.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

There was no scene which made any impact except the the scene when we are first introduced to Leatherface. The pace was good and running time was also sufficient.

175,Danny_G13,Sheer carnage but only slightly disturbing,7,10 March 2005,"Classic horror based on true story still manages to perversely entertain but there's perhaps not really an awful lot, strictly speaking, to derive from it at the end of the day. Certainly not any real morals.Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a surreal and apparently disturbing account of a true story which occurred in Texas. Frankly the facts behind the case are decidedly flimsy in terms of their base translation to the movie, but for the purposes of the review I'll focus on the movie as a production in its own right.A rather unknown cast takes up the helm as a group of teenagers on a road trip to visit one of their number's childhood house. They pick up a hitch-hiker on the way who scares them with his manic behaviour before they kick him off and eventually arrive at their destination.However, one by one, they explore another house in the vicinity and discover to their cost that the resident isn't the most welcoming of hosts...At its foundations, it's pretty basic stuff. Young kids see quiet dark house and go in without turning on the lights, before being suckered in and slaughtered by the psycho killer with their weapon of choice, in this case the implement of the movie title.However, dig a little deeper and there's a fairly decent core in here too, because while the surface seems to be pure slasher, the hidden layer reveals a level of twisted sickness at a true cerebral level. The disturbing nature of the crazed family at the centre of the killings is frankly highly imaginative, and just mad enough to almost be believable. Every one of them, while perhaps slightly parodial of crazed killers, are scary enough in what they represent. This enables them to really work effectively on-screen.By today's standards there's little genuinely fearful here, but the truly dark (Literally as well as thematically) visuals and atmosphere are enough to create an undercurrent of true despair and a genuinely hopeless surrealness permeates throughout.The violence is really non-existent, and there is a lack of blood, but that's not where this film was going. This movie smarts thanks to both; fantastic cinematography, which has some superbly ingenious camera shots and a truly convincing encapsulation of the story, plus some exceptional imagery in terms of both how the direction chooses to show the world of the narrative to us, and in the raw 'truth' of the depraved home of the killers.Furthermore, Leatherface's mask and hideous features just *slightly* in view under that mask are enough to show that this movie is not about violence or death, but about the disturbing contents of some minds and what they are capable of.It's a seminal classic, once hard hitting, now a lesson in making a horror movie. Sure, there's a touch of the claustrophobia as seen in Night of the Living Dead, so clearly TCM takes kudos from that previous flick. But even the best are not exempt from deriving inspiration from elsewhere.Certainly worth watching, but don't expect cheery film-making...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

It's like Hooper and crew set out to make the most horrific thing they could think of. It's upsetting and it's unnatural and no matter how many times I watch it, that decrepit farmhouse and that ugly grandfather will still haunt me for days after watching it.It's pretty much the best thing in horror, right up there with Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Friedken's ""The Exorcist.""

⚪
All in all, this ferocious frontrunner of slasher films screams extensively to the brutish sound of a howling chainsaw and while it gleefully slices through human bodies, it still has some major plot issues and suffers from annoying characters, but nevertheless, establishes itself as a tricky, effective Southern freakshow that knows to deliver with the use of techniques, all the while introducing one of the greatest horror icons that have ever hit the big screen, the squealing, chainsaw swinging psychopath, Leatherface. As the film literally takes place on this same date, my brother and I decided to celebrate his birthday by watching one of the most influential genre flicks from the seventies. He has already seen it, and admittedly, isn't much of a fan of it, but for me it was a first time watch and I was in fact excited to find out what makes this film so legendary. To be honest, I can see why he might dislike it, but I for my part cannot say that I am totally disappointed with it. I agree with my brother when he says that for a film that has the unambiguous term ""massacre"" in the title, it simply doesn't feature the desired bloodbath it promises. Actually, the whole production wasn't as bloody and gory as I expected it to be. Furthermore, the acting isn't quite what I would consider to be masterful, and many scenes were ruined by lengthened screaming, calling names (I will never forget that his name is Jerry), repetitive chase sequences and characters I couldn't find any form of connection to, especially to this pill Franklin. What makes me like it, though? The answer: atmosphere. What really stands out in this whole film is the overall design that contributes the most to the effectiveness and horrifying experience. Next to the clever use of eerie sounds, grotesque visuals and intelligent zooms and editing, it was genuinely unsettling in general. The antagonistic, cannibalistic family of lunatics made it even more moody for me. This film has its obvious flaws, but at the same time many factors that make me like and adore it a lot. Influential, ambitious and in the end, a classic I am definitely going to re-watch in the future.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Unforgettable Horror/Cult Classic From Tobe Hooper.",10,11 August 2014,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the greatest Horror film ever made,an excellent,scary and terrifying Horror classic that combines amazing direction,great performances,non-stop terror,an eerie score and stunning photography. All of those elements make The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a great Horror film but also a Cult classic and one of the scariest movies of all-time.Set in Texas,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre tells the story of five youths including Sally Hardesty(Marilyn Burns)her wheelchair bound brother Franklin Hardesty(Paul A. Partain)who along with friends Jerry(Allen Danziger),Kirk(William Vali)and Pam(Teri McMinn) are on a trip visiting Sally and Franklin's Grandfather's grave site because of recent grave robbing going on. While on the trip,Sally,Franklin and their friends cross paths with a Chainsaw welding maniac named Leatherface(Gunner Hanson)and his family of grave-robbing cannibals.Released in 1974,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre while receiving mixed reviews from critics was a Box Office hit grossing 30 million dollars well above it's 300,000$ budget. Over time critical reviews for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre have been much more positive and the movie is now seen as a classic Horror film and one of the all-time great Cult classics and it's reputation is well deserved. While The Texas Chain Saw Massacre later spawn a remake,sequels and reboots none of the latter films have been able to match the raw and gritty greatness of Tobe Hooper's film. Right from it's disturbing and powerful opening,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a brilliant Horror film that pulls you into a nightmare that grabs you by the throat with with frightening and visceral intensity that never stops until the very end. TCM is a film that is scary and horrific as well as dark and brutal and you as viewer are being harmed physically and mentally with no positive outcome. The scares in TCM are amazing and well-done with tons of great build-up and suspense because before and after each scary scene there is a sense of dread and fear that hangs over the film and never stops. TCM can also be seen as a Slasher film because there are some elements(masked killer,final girl,young victims,isolated location)in TCM that can be seen as a precursor to the Slasher genre that dominated the 1970s and 80s so in way TCM was a great foreshadowing. What also make TCM scary is the photography by Daniel Pearl. Pearl's photography gives the movie an atmospheric and realistic look almost like watching a documentary where it feels like you're not watching a movie but something happening in real life while at the same time making the movie look visually stunning. The atmosphere is also incredible because of the hot weather during the day and night where you feel the heat and sweat just come of the screen. TCM while still a Horror movie TCM truly captures the tone and feel of the Nixon-era of the late 1960s and early 70s during that time:Vietnam,Hippies,The Manson Family and The Watergate scandal and while none of those things are mentioned they hang over the movie. While TCM is still a scary film there are also moments of Black Comedy and Humor where some of the characters,moments and dialog are sometimes over the top to the point where you are laughing at the insanity and chaos. TCM often has a reputation of being one of the bloodiest and goriest movies of all-time and while TCM has some blood the film is not very gory or bloody because when you see the violence the blood and gore is inside of your mind and is suggested because of the blood on the walls. TCM is more about terror and fright and it succeeds without gore. The character Leatherface is one of the greatest and most iconic villains is Horror films and in movies in general because Leatherface is a character that is mentally gone and has an uncontrollable rage that is scary. Where as Freddy Kruger uses sharp finger blades,Jason Voorhees uses a Machete and Michael Myers uses a large butcher knife,Leatherface uses a chainsaw as his weapon of choice and when Leatherface uses that chainsaw you feel like he never turns it off and uses on his victims with violent brutality. The fact that Leatherface wears a mask made of skin and the fact that his whole family are cannibals makes Leatherface more disturbing. Leatherface's first appearance is one of the most iconic moments in the history of Horror films and you will be horrified by his appearance. The ending of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the best endings ever caught on film because there is scares,suspense and a surprising way of using a chainsaw which is weird,unforgettable and dramatic. A great ending to a classic film.The cast is great. Marilyn Burns is brilliant as Sally,with Burns bringing a realism,depth and terror to the role. R.I.P Ms Burns,you were one Horror cinemas greatest scream queens. Gunner Hanson is excellent and scary as Leatherface,one of the greatest movie villains of all-time with Gunner,grunting,screaming,shouting and running with the chainsaw. Edwin Neal is wonderful as The Hitchhiker,a person picked up on the road. Jim Siedow is outstanding as Old Man that runs a gas station. Paul A. Partain is funny and memorable as Franklin,Sally's brother. Allen Danziger(Jerry),William Vail(Kirk),Teri McMinn(Pam)and John Dugan(Grandfather)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a voice cameo by John Larroquette who reads the beginning narration.The direction by Tobe Hooper is amazing with Hooper bringing a gritty and atmospheric look to the film with zooms,close ups with high and low angles. Fantastic direction,Hooper.The score by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell is creepy,unsettling, and fits perfectly with the tone of the movie. An intense and experimental score from Hooper and Bell.In final word,if you love Horror Movies or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,an excellent and terrifying Horror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
180,x_manicure_x,Has its moments,5,14 August 2021,"Not to be confused with all its wacky sequels, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is one of the subtlest exploitation films I had the pleasure to watch so far. I expected it to be one of those classic splatter films with guts flying everywhere, but was surprised to find out that all the violence is only suggested and left to the viewer's imagination. All we get to see is the characters' reactions with hysterical closeups, disturbing sound effects, and confused camerawork. Even though the illusion sometimes gets spoiled by the unnatural acting and dialogues, the rough and gritty cinematography conveys a sense of rawness and reality that almost made everything look like a documentary. Even though I have a feeling that most of the film's beauty came out unintentionally, probably as a lucky consequence of its budget limitations, it aged reasonably well and still hasn't lost its unique atmosphere. It might not be enough for new viewers, but its impact on the slasher genre is undeniable.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
181,mlraymond,A Genuine Nightmare Captured on Film,10,24 October 2006,"I avoided seeing this film for years; put off by the title and the gory reputation it had. When sheer curiosity finally got me to watch it a year or two ago, I was stunned by the raw, compelling power of the simple story and believable performances. Various viewers and critics have pointed out that this movie is about terror, not blood and guts for its own sake. We are shown just enough to raise uneasy questions that are never answered. The violence is startling and realistic, but not overdone. One good example is the scene in which SPOILERS AHEAD: Leatherface suddenly looms up out of the darkness, wielding his chainsaw, and kills the wheelchair-bound Franklyn, as Sally runs off screaming into the night. We are horrified by this brutal killing of a victim who has no hope of escape, but the murder is played for shock, not disgust. We are not shown the gruesome details of Franklyn's death; the idea is enough. It may be this down to earth approach to violence that helps make the movie so unnervingly believable. We are not dazzled or amused or grossed out by gory special effects for their own sake, as in so many horror movies made after this one, but just plain scared. One of the most powerful aspects of this movie is the ordinary settings and characters. The victims are all people that most viewers could relate to as being like ourselves or people we know. Their uncomprehending reactions to their fate, or their terrified inability to escape are part of what terrifies the audience. The dinner scene where captive Sally tries to reason with her tormentors, and her go-for-broke escape attempt at the end are totally believable. The weirdness of the cannibal family is offset by their oddly routine behavior; that there is a certain bizarre logic to the way they live, however insane. One of the most often referenced bits is when the older man, presumably the father of the other two, exclaims to Hitchhiker with great indignation, ""Look what your brother did to that door!"", and shortly after, chases Leatherface around with a belt, acting like a typical father irritated by his offspring's dumb behavior. The unexpected and outlandish humor of the movie also contributes to its effectiveness. These incongruous black comedy moments occurthroughout the film, and add to the horror, rather than diminish it. The performances throughout, by both victims and killers, are simply great, especially the tour de force by Marilyn Burns as Sally, the only one to survive. Her whole ordeal and repeated attempts to escape, only to be caught again, until her final successful getaway, are alarmingly convincing. It's hard to remember that what you're seeing is "" only a movie"", due to the acting and Hooper's skillful direction. Finally, the look of the film, and the strange music, both contribute enormously to the eerie spell this movie casts. One can almost feel the heat of that dry, dusty Texas plain, the monotony of driving endlessly down an unfamiliar road, the creepy feeling of walking into a strange house to ask for help. The strange, spooky feeling of the gas station at night, a tiny beacon of light and seeming normalcy in the midst of darkness and madness ,that turns out to be a false refuge, the ghoulish decorations and furniture made from human remains in the outwardly normal looking farmhouse. Watching this film is an uncomfortable experience, but every horror movie fan ought to see it at least once. In its own nightmarish way, it's a triumph of film-making.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
182,PoisonKeyblade,"Can you say ""overrated?""",5,16 February 2007,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, quite possibly, the most overrated film of all time. I've never been so psyched to see a movie, and the fact that I wasn't allowed to watch until my 13th birthday only made me all the more excited. I have to say that, other than the Pulse remake, the When a Stranger Calls remake, The Fog remake, the original Black Christmas, and Hard Candy, this movie is the biggest horror disappointment of my lifetime.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is directed by the ""legendary"" Tobe Hooper, but to be completely honest, I've seen few of his films. The only quality movie I've seen this guy direct is the remake of The Toolbox Murders. He does, however, fill this movie with a few interesting camera angles. Sally (Marilyn Burns), her wheelchair-bound brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), and their three friends are on their way to visit their grandfather's grave in Texas. Along the way, they pick up a psychotic hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) on the side of the road who turns out to be more than they were expecting. The five friends soon wind up at a creepy old, seemingly-abandoned house where each of them exhibits a grizzly encounter with a shadowy menace known only as Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen). Sally flees for her life in a desperate attempt to help her friends as the others are killed off one by one at the hands of Leatherface and his sadistically twisted cannibalistic dysfunctional family.All I knew about this film before watching it was that it was supposedly the 'definitive' horror movie, and it was said to be one of the best of all time. Not only is the remake far better than the overrated original, but the underrated prequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning tops even the remake. For one, I really didn't like the overall ""feel"" of the movie. If this garbage was supposed to be scary, then something is seriously wrong here. I didn't even get chills, and everything scares me! The only scene that I truly found unnerving at best was when Leatherface hit a man on the top of the head with a sledgehammer. I found myself laughing more than screaming in fear. The scariest movie ever? I think not! The acting was trash, although I did like the lead female and Leatherface. The hitchhiker was retarded and dull, and Sally's wheelchair-bound brother was one of the most annoying characters ever to hit the big screen. The movie is outdated and very ineffective compared to some of today's horror movies. I really don't see what everyone finds so spectacular about this film. The ending is a pathetic cop-out, although Leatherface's chainsaw dance is probably the most memorable thing about a mostly forgettable piece of cinema. The infamous dinner table sequence is also one of the better scenes, although it wasn't really anything special; the prequel did the scene much better. I will admit that some of the camera shots show some skill and are quite intriguing, but as a whole, there is nothing too impressive here. Sure, the movie looks like a documentary, but is that what we're really looking for in a horror movie? Not everything about the picture is all bad. The tone and atmosphere were perfectly established in a very subtle manner, and the chase scene through the woods is utterly sensational. Skip this original flick in a well-known series; you're not missing much, trust me. Instead, check out the remake, or some of the quality sequels, or even the sensational prequel.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
183,GeorgeRoots,So Authentic In Tt's Crappy Look It's One Of A Kind.,10,8 August 2014,"Based on the killings of notorious hermit Ed Gein. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a marvel in both it's look and location. Where better to set a movie where you can legally own a shotgun at the age of 12?A bunch of friends driving through the Texas fields pick up a hitch-hiker, whose erratic behaviour gets him kicked out swiftly. They have to make an unexpected pit stop, where they seem to meet the only local in the area (Who is out of gas and forces them to remain stranded for a while). A few of them set off to explore the area whilst waiting to get back on the road, and when they don't return later that evening the remaining group set out to look for them. Unknowingly walking into Hell itself where ""Leatherface"" (Gunnar Hansen) is it's Leviathan.It's gritty low budget cinematography and crappy documentary-drama feel is what makes this movie age so well. Usually I'm against horror movies where the victims are no more developed than helpless butcher meat, but the locations elevate their presence and isolation so well it all seems to speak volumes for itself. Every room of that house is unforgettable and a new kind of disturbing, ranging from the era's rising horror tropes to classic German expressionism. Why no other horror movie house's have captured the spirit of this one is beyond me.What Tobe Hooper has created is nothing short of timeless. For as many actors who have gone on to portray ""Leatherface"", Gunnar Hansen's performance still remains the most iconic. By the time we meet all of the family members, any means of sensibility are removed from the picture. You yourself are stuck with these emotionless psychopaths for a finale so simple, it effectively elevates any expectation you had. In some sick way, it's pretty fantastic to see a chainsaw dance.Final Verdict: I've seen many horror films of the 1970's, and so rarely is anything as good as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Watch it and you'll understand. 10/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

A group of five close friends are heading through the back roads of Texas on the way to their grandfather's vandalised grave. Among them are Sally Hardesty, and her brother Franklin. They encounter an hitchhiker (Neal) who slashes both himself & Franklin with a wicked-looking knife. The others manage to get the hitchhiker out from the vehicle, but shortly afterwards, they are forced to stop & wander over to a small, sinister looking house nearby in hopes for gas. What none of them realise is that this house is the home of Leatherface and his evil, demented family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One at a time, the teens are murdered by the evil Leatherface in horrifying ways. I thought that this was a great film in the end.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
185,jmbwithcats,The Godfather of Horror Gets It's Due,7,16 August 2005,"I'll be 32 on September 12, 2005 and amazingly I just saw the original TCM for the very first time.As a kid I remember my two older brothers talking about the movie, and I understood it was a revered horror film. A cult classic of the genre.Something about the grittiness I guess.Anyways, I did see the remake and though I thought it had some decent elements, and I picked out the scene of the slaughterhouse which Rob Zombie incorporated into House of 1000 Corpses, and I felt Jessica Biel was great especially with the boy over the piano scene... that was really nicely acted... i wasn't overly impressed just because I felt the scenes were set up in a very unrealistic manner.So now watching the original the first thing I note was how it set up the mood. The atmosphere, the interesting camera angles and use of motion with the wind and the grasses. I found that to be very nicely done.The killings of the original are set up just as unrealistically though, what with Kirk walking into the house, tripping right into Leatherface.We could say as a young punk he is the sort that likes to be sneaky, heck i was sneaky growing up too, so it's not completely unrealistic him going into the stranger's house uninvited.Then the girl follows him in, now that IS realistic. It makes sense why she would go in, because now she is wondering where he went.The way he hangs her on the hook, so matteroffact, that was really eloquently done, mainly because it was not overdone, and unassuming, and yet so many movies have been inspired by this movie it's hard not to give this movie credit for how it so unabashedly pushed the envelope for it's day.The movie was definitely not scary though. Leatherface makes such quick work of his victims, so the movie is not gory, or frightening, or tense, just kinda weird.I can imagine seeing this in the theaters back in 74 must've been pretty scary though, these days we have a few thousand more horror movies under our belts that we are more desensitized by horror, since horror has pushed the envelope so far since TCM first came out.In all fairness that is.The scene at the dining table was a bit overdone, the closeup camera angles on the eyes and screams and such kinda went on and on and on and felt a little contrived.Having the dead grandpa hitting her with the hammer was pretty cool.Oh and if Marilyn Burns reads this review you were a cutie in this movie. Wearing those white bell bottoms, like a beacon in the darkness.Poor Sally, running through the woods, arms a flailing, screeching like a banshee from hell, jumping outta windows all over the place, running into dead guys, just not having a great day but such a cutie! .Leatherface dancing around at the end reminded me a lot of how the attorney acted in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas... funny thought.Great ending.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Now I Am A true fan of this film and others similar to it. I Just Wish It Could Have Been More Truly Based on the Real Life Serial Killer Ed Gein. But other than that, I Hope this movie Continues to enter into The Collection of the more ""Younger"" Horror Fans. Horror Movie these Days Don't Really Live up to their Purpose.

The Film Itself Contains Bits and Parts of Gore, though not an Excessive amount. I Think The Film also Tries to Show the Viewer Pure Madness. This was Perfectly Shown towards the end, When the Lone Survivor was Tied to the Table. Her Bloodcurdling Screams only could amount to the Psychotic Laughs of Leatherface and his Family.

187,I_Am_The_Taylrus,"Great Slasher Film, But I Was A Little Disappointed(SPOILERS)",8,13 December 2006,"SPOILERSTexas Chainsaw Massacre was one of the many movies that I was dying to see. I loved the title of it, it sounded so gritty and violent. Finally I got to see it. It was an amazing film. I mean, it was one of the first slasher films. Although it was an awesome film I can not feel but a little disappointed. They talk too much and there is a lot of boring scenes. By the way, this is so not a Holiday film, it can be anything but it can not be a Holiday film.The plot is pretty simple. A group of college students in the middle of Texas are eventually killed by a family of Cannibals. There are five students. Two girls, three boys. Wow, actually more boys than girls. How odd. Anyway, eventually of being impaled on meat hooks and hit by sledgehammers, there are only a brother and a sister left. Then the brother is killed by man in a leather mask with a chainsaw. He is obviously called Leatherface. He captures her. She escapes and gets into a back of a truck and it drives off, saving her life. Leatherface is really mad. She is also very mad, but in a totally different way.Overall, this is a fantastic film. It is a little boring at times and is not as good as I expected, but it is still a great film. If you are a fan of slasher films, you got to have this. There is one thing I would like to point out, the acting in this film is not the best acting I have seen. Anyway, this is a really great slasher film that I know fans of slasher films would like.8/10Recommended Films: Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
188,Jacques98,The best YouTube film of all time. (That doesn't mean what you think.),7,24 February 2009,"What do the words ""Crushing Disappointment"" mean to you personally? Think about that one for a second. Certainly in your long list of disappointments, there is bound to be a new release film you saw that didn't fit the awesome-amazing-godly vision you anticipated in your head. However, reading reviews of older films, I rarely see this term used. If someone dislikes an older film, they say something like: ""It's just the most overrated movie of all time."" But very rarely do I ever see anyone have the audacity to say an older film is completely worthless, then give an intelligent reasoning for their opinion, even if they were completely disappointed with the older film. Maybe this is because we as a society have some sort of ludicrous respect for older films, even when they don't deserve it. Though I was not completely disappointed with The Texas Chain Saw Massacrefar from itI will give intelligent reasoning as to why those blind-eyed by nostalgia need to realize this film has not aged in golden perfection. Also, I'll try to help those who were completely disappointed with this film to understand why it isn't total trash.Because I lived in a semi-sheltered household, I didn't grow up on horror movies. In my recent years, I count this as a blessing, because I can review films without any nostalgic bias whatsoever. Nostalgia is the problem with so many reviews I read of this movie. Someone who saw The Texas Chain Saw Mass cure at the age of 5 and went in their pants is going to grow up proclaiming to the masses that it is ""THE scariest movie of all time!"" While, in opposite, a 20-year-old man viewing the film for the first time is going to say that ""Hostel was more terrifying than this cheesy crap!"" because Hostel is more modern and he can relate to it more. It's all a matter of perspective. Personally, I didn't see anything scary about this movie whatsoever. I can, however, see how someone would think that. Just because something is old and was effective to an older audience does not mean it's effective to a modern audience. If you want to live in absurd denial that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the scariest movie of all time, no exceptions, then may I ask who is being more immature: you, or the ""kids"" you claim no nothing about horror? In the opposite spectrum, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is in the top 5 most important horror films of all time, like it or not. That isn't an opinion. In its time, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was a purely original idea, and to this day there has never been a film like it. While some will argue that it's far ""inferior"" to the ""superior"" remakes, they fail to see that the original was far more groundbreaking. The remakes strayed from the original plot and pumped it full of clichés. The original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre gave built a far more complete atmosphere and refused to explain any of the events that transpired in the film, except in the opening monologue. This is a far more original form of storytelling, and, to me, and most other people, is far more effective. It is inarguably more realistic.But what The Texas Chain Saw Massacre doesn't have is flawless production value. Compared to movies today, this is almost like watching an indie YouTube video. The production value has aged, and it's important to understand that. Hooper's directing is still very technical and well-done, but that just can't blot out the deeply aged edge. For example, it's very obvious that Hooper was trying to shoot for a PG-rating initially. The lack of on-screen gore is very annoying at times, because by today's standards, it's incredibly tame, even if it was on-screen. Also, the acting from the secondary characters is very unbelievable, even laughable, at points. I personally can appreciate all this lack of polish, because it's far more unsealing than the clean-cut politically-correct remakes.Overall, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre may not hold up to the blockbuster status, but it doesn't have to. It wasn't meant to. It was one of the first examples of pure, raw, anti-stylistic intensity captured on film. That's what its legacy is built around. That's why The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was so important in its time.Like it or not, find it cheesy or unnerving, find it scary or laughable, you can't deny that the film still has something that very few other moviesmodern or notdon't have. Intensity. Uncertainty. Confusion. Originality. Even if you find the film purely disappointing, can you name a whole lot of other horror movies that have these characteristics? I can count them on one hand. And The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the granddaddy of them all.7/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Unfortunately the group end up falling pray to a family of cannibals including a hulking chainsaw wielding butcher. Named Leatherface. The Texas chain massacre is argue one of the most important stable to the horror genre, from it's tone to it scenery and production. It a film that for starters you need to have a more opened mind for modern audiences. Many are immediately turned off by the look of the film thinking it's cheap, Silly, boring and not scare. That's just not the case yes it's made with very little money and there are a few silly moments like the broom scene which is more funny then anything. The originals greatest strength come from the fact that it is dated and old looking. It gives more a realistic grainy look. The problem does really comes from the fact most people nowadays are so used to high amounts of blood,brutality and jump scares that this look tame. However the subtlety of some of the dialogue such the talk about cows and sledgehammers and barbecue. To the more macabre imagine of the house and the furniture does add uncomfortable atmosphere. The films only major fault is it's characters Aren't interesting you get the feeling right away they're just disposable characters particular Franklin it's rather annoying given the way he acts. Sally's the closest we got get to a lead she's really not all that interesting, she's just there runs and scream.

These days in order to get a film made, most filmmakers have this mistaken notion that it has to be all polished and ever-so-perfectly crafted. And if possible, have studio backing and at least one name star. But back in the early 70s, Tobe Hooper and his posse chose to go down to Texas and make an unhinged tale of a very bizarre family. And it's the film that introduced the world to Leatherface. Based loosely on the exploits of Ed Gein, we follow a van full of young people who are traveling down a hot, dusty back road. Unlike a lot of movies since then, the filmmakers wisely decide to reveal little about the characters. Normally, that would make them come across as wooden or paper-thin, but not in this case. The shocking revelation of this film is that the aforementioned crazed family kill travelers and turn them into food, clothing and furniture. Several times in the film, we are shown footage from slaughter houses and slowly it dawns on you that we're viewing the characters the same way the killers do: as meat and nothing more. The grisly effects on display aren't nearly as graphic as viewers and critics at the time made it out to be. But what it lacks in full-blown visuals, it heaps on dollops of creepiness and depravity. This film is not for the squeamish in any way. And please don't get me started with the sequels or that god-awful remake.

I'd say this is a very surreal film.

The film unquestionably lives up to its brutal-sounding name, but it's basically just a bunch of friends running around being slashed and slaughtered like any average psycho horror film. The bloody murders are disturbing, but how do so many people find it terrifying? And just how is it even considered one of the best horror classics?If there's any words to describe this violent slasher, it's decent but slow. Even despite the 80-minute runtime, the cheap scares won't hold everyone through. It's very well-made and the effects are amazing for the 70s, but you'd expect all the hype to be because the film is terrifying, which it honestly isn't. It's violent, but not scary. So it's complete rubbish when people call the film a classic masterpiece. Even big horror fans may find the iconic slashing too sickening or nauseating, but they'll stay for the terror. And they'll discover by the end that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre relies on predictable violence for scares like most horror features do.Anyway, the storyline is pretty decent so you can't complain too much. The effects and killings are epic for a classic slasher. Plus, the film's quality is excellent for its time.

I can't remember this movie having so much as a single scary moment, and as far as gore is considered, I've seen much bloodier films too (e.g. ""Braindead""). On the other hands, me and a bunch of friends had a GREAT time watching this movie, laughing at the ridiculous acting and pointing out the never-ending list of completely stupid behaviour by the main characters. Example: If you're being chased by a crazed, chainsaw wielding maniac through a dark wood, the last thing you want to do is scream and give away your position, but the main character in this movie doesn't do anything BUT scream while being chased. It was also hilarious when the chain-saw guy first cut up an entire door with his saw before actually just opening it in the normal way and going through.This movie apparently is a classic, and I wholly agree with that, but instead of a horror classic I'd call it a comedy classic.

200,ryan-10075,Great 70s Terror Mixed With Lots of Craziness,8,7 July 2020,"This mid-70s low budget horror classic is one of Tobe Hooper's best. A group of youths are on a trip in Texas to visit Sally (Marilyn Burns) and Franklin's (Paul A. Partain) grandfather's grave. After doing so the group is also interested in visiting the old homestead. While on this trip they pick up a hitchhiker (Edwin Neal), are warned by a gas station attendant (Jim Siedow) and in turn meet maybe the craziest family in film history. To me this is a pretty scary flick and it does not use extreme violence to do it. In fact it is quite tame to what the name carries in the violence department.I have always enjoyed this film, but after my initial viewing I wasn't the biggest fan. But, when you don't see it on grainy old VHS it does work better. The character of Franklin though is annoying. But, I do believe that is on purpose by Hooper. To me though the introduction to Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) is one of the greatest villain intros in horror history. It is memorable and scary. Written by Kim Henkel and Hooper. To me it is never really mentioned, but the score by Hooper and Wayne Bell is quite effective. Interesting to note Hooper only scored two other films (EATEN ALIVE and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2).So, if you have never seen this one might be a good one to watch with some buddies and enjoy some of the great things this horror film brings. Followed by countless sequels and remakes. None of which can touch the original. Narration at the beginning of the film is actually done by John Larroquette.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
201,Toronto85,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,8,24 June 2011,"Years before I ever watched it, I heard the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a gory, brutal horror film. While it isn't nearly as gory as movies made in the eighties and even movies made in recent years, it is a very grisly brutal film. It's about a young girl Sally, her wheelchair bound brother and their three friends who are on a road trip in Texas. An average weekend on the road quickly turns into a nightmare when a few of the friends decide to entire the infamous Texas Chainsaw house only to be savagely attacked and murdered by Leatherface. Eventually Sally is the only one left and she is forced to battle Leatherface and his crazed cannibalistic family.TCM is a very disturbing movie to watch first time around. It has a feel of Last House on the Left, but much more sophisticated than it. Some of the scenes which include one of the teenagers being flung onto a metal hook, and another being bludgeoned by Leatherface are grisly. They also help to make this the most talked about and scary horror films of all time. The sound of that chainsaw and seeing Leatherface running behind Sally in the woods is one of the most frightening images. I liked the chase scenes in this movie, they were really well done. I also loved the ""twist"" in the movie when the group buy some ""BBQ"" food from the local gas station. I won't tell you what exactly they were eating, I'm sure you can figure it out.The acting was pretty good for this kind of movie. Marilyn Burns gave a very believable performance as Sally during some of the torture and ""dinner table"" scenes. It is a must see movie in my opinion. Don't be fooled by any said level of gore. It isn't a movie for the squeamish, but that is not because any high level of blood and guts. TCM doesn't show much blood at all, it's the level of brutality from Leatherface and his clan that makes it grisly to watch. They are truly psychotic.8/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
202,quaseprovisorio,America's most dysfunctional family...,8,22 January 2013,"The Texas chainsaw massacre is a classic of its own. a well built atmosphere, a nice arid place in the middle of nowhere to do the killings, and the best of it all: a great f*cking weird family. The film is scary, is fun, but mostly it can be dramatic when its asked. The terror starts slowly with the news, the odd guy, the lack of gas that would put them with no chance of escaping. It could be better? for me yes. i would like to see leatherface family more. I LOVED his dad criticizing him for what he done to the door. I loved the grandpa. The family was a great and unique mixing of terror and comedy. i think Texas chainsaw massacre is the best horror film to mix both genres. the problem is the lack of character depth in the victims, and also their dumbness in knocking at the devil's door so many times, one by one. OK there weren't many horror movies back then, and they didn't know what happened to their friends, although doesn't this sound a little far-fetched?overall a great horror film, that could be perfect if the leatherface family appeared sooner at the screen, and if some characters were smarter. Because the last 20 minutes are probably the best terror i've ever seen in a screen.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
203,harrylosborne,Iconic? Yes. Worth the time? Think again,4,4 November 2019,"This is one of those movies that should never have really reached cult status; however, fear-mongering Western audiences have managed to turn The Texas Chainsaw Massacre into an iconic piece of cinema, but not one that deserves recognition based on merit. Through rumours of the depicted imagery being true and people walking out of screenings en masse, a relatively anonymous, low budget film ($300,000 for a $30m worldwide gross) has become cemented in history - if only the end product justified this.The story is basic: five friends driving through backcountry America to visit their grandfather's grave unwittingly disturb a family of cannibals. This plot does't even begin to go anywhere until halfway into the short run time, and by then it feels like you've had something built up that delivers so little. The less said about the acting the better: none of those featured in the film have gone on to star in anything else (you can see why), and the script does nobody any favours. The only genuine acting is from Sally (Marilyn Burns), who apparently was covered in her own blood after running through the bushes filming scenes.The best of the film is no doubt Leatherface, a hulking, mentally ill member of the cannibals who wears a mask presumably made of the skin of previous victims. He doesn't conform to horror cliches - he just wants to kill, and he doesn't have an evil plan or an ulterior motive to make him hesitate before he can take someone's life. Him swinging the chainsaw wildly around his head is powerfully cinematic, and does explain how he spawned a new generation's addiction to gore in films. The imagery in the cannibal house is also strong, but isn't enough to rectify the film's rotten core and genuinely poor script writing.Whilst not a real time investment to watch, I did feel some obligation to see this seminal flick. Unfortunately, it directly conforms with the horror stereotype: none of them are any good. I can only advise that you don't watch any of the multitude of sequels commissioned - they don't even have the excuse of being the product of independent film makers, and have instead been supplemented with as much blood as possible (even if violence wasn't something the original is known for).",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
204,brianberta,One of the scariest films ever made,9,10 August 2016,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is often seen as one of the prime influences of slasher films. It popularized slasher films, and it is often used as a reference point for horror film directors. It's also a really good one at that. Tobe Hooper was able to make one of the scariest films of all time for several reasons. It's one of the biggest must-see films from the genre.After a series of grave robberies, 2 siblings, Sally and Franklin, drive out to Texas to see if their Dad's grave was robbed along with 3 of their friends. Afterwards, they stay at their family Homestead where they get attacked by a family of cannibalistic psychopaths. One of them named ""Leatherface"" has a mask on and is always silent.The camera-work is well-done. The film is shot like a documentary. Several conversations throughout the film feel like a character was being interviewed. Since the film infamously called itself a true story (which it wasn't), the documentary style camera-work made it all the more believable. It gave the film an unsettling sense of realism. Also, there are other shots later in the film which provide feelings of desperation and hopelessness. There are several close-ups on a characters eyeballs where tears can be clearly seen. These shots are just disturbing. Also, there are a few close-ups on the antagonists' faces. If a movie overdoes this, it can be annoying after a while, but since the movie didn't abuse this, I found them to be disturbing as well. Finally, there's the impressive final shot which gives you a dazzling composition of the sun and some great lighting to go out on.The acting is really good. I especially have to hand it to Marilyn Burns (Sally), because she gave the best performance in the film by far. Near the end of the film, there is a lot of screaming and crying. It's really hard to do this well. I bet that most other actresses wouldn't be able to play her part without sounding annoying or over-the-top. However, I can not think of a single time near the climax that I got annoyed with her. Her performance remained solid and convincing. Because her acting remained top notch, the climax continued to engage me. She helped the film to remain terrifying. The other 4 friends accompanying her gave great performances as well. Since Tobe Hooper directed this film to make it feel like a documentary, their acting helped to make the conversations feel like they were borrowed right out of one. Also, Edwin Neal gave a nice performance as the hitchhiker. His performance was really charismatic. Insanity can be a difficult emotion to pull off, because most of the time, actors sound over-the-top when they do it. However, he did a really good job at it.Despite what the film's title might lead you to believe, there's actually a lot less blood and gore in this film than you'd likely expect. I heard that this is the least goriest film from the franchise. That's another reason why it's so scary. It's able to generate terror from the audience without resorting to excessive bloody violence like many other slasher films do. Near the beginning of the film, it relies on suspenseful buildup and unexpected moments which are very shocking. Also, Leatherfaces' house has really good set design. A lot of work clearly went into it. Near the end of the film, it relies on great acting and camera-work and claustrophobia. It feels highly unlikely that the movie will have a happy ending, and it's hard to watch the ending because of this. It disturbs the viewer greatly.If you stop reading and look back at my review, you'd see that so far, just about everything which I've praised this film for all contributes to making it one of the scariest films ever made in one way or another. It masterfully utilized numerous horror techniques, and it combined them to make this film work so well.You likely won't be forgetting your viewing experience with this film anytime soon. However, it takes a while to get to the good parts. This film has pacing issues which painfully slow this film down. These issues come in play for the first half of the film. The audience impatiently waits for the film to pick up as its first half feels very slow-moving. Since the film is barely over 80 minutes, it can be extra tedious for that reason. On my 2nd viewing, I had slightly less of an issue with the pacing, but it still exists for the film.In conclusion, this is a really great film. It masterfully utilizes several horror techniques to make it one of the scariest films ever made. It's not perfect as its first half has pacing issues. However, it has accomplished a whole lot. I can appreciate it for being one of the main influences for slasher films. It set the standards very high, and it gave other slashers very big shoes to fill. I was originally going to add this film to my watchlist months ago. However, I completely forgot about it. It was only recently when I remembered it. Man, I was sure missing out.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

208,Christopher_Reid,Some effective horror scenes but the movie lacks a purpose,7,6 February 2016,"I didn't like the start of this film. It didn't excite or engage me and I started to worry that it was going to be awful. The characters are uninteresting and they don't come across as being very intelligent. They fit into the tired old cliché of horny teenagers casually wandering off in the middle of nowhere basically asking to be kidnapped or killed. They run out of gas and choose to go to an old house some of them grew up in. Never mind the possibility that other people might now be living in or around the house.The movie starts to get more interesting. It uses suspense quite well. We get shots of them from the distance, among the grass, suggesting they might be being watched, that they're vulnerable. There is a loud machine going on a farm, a nice precursor to the constant sound of the chainsaw later on.Once the horror begins, it's very effective. It's abrupt, raw, brutal and shocking. It's not surprising this film was banned in so many countries. But it doesn't show that much blood. It's what it implies and how quickly and casually everything happens that affects the audience. There's no warning, no cat jumping out, no friends bumping into each-other. We don't cut away but we see a person's limp body as they breathe their final breaths.The design of the interior of the house is very interesting and original. Bones, feathers, weird symbolic token things, a chicken, sitting corpses. Filmed in weird angles and as if the rooms were themselves alive.The soundtrack is also very unique and enhances the atmosphere a huge amount. It's not conventional ""music"" but is rather a soundscape of vibrations, animal sounds, echoing tribal instruments, I don't even know. It puts us in a different world, a different mindset, a waking nightmare I suppose.There's something comical about a screaming woman being constantly chased by a madman with a chainsaw. At first you can empathise with her terror but when the pursuit continues for what seems like at least 10 minutes, it begins to feel more like a Benny Hill sketch. When he's on her tail, I understand she's screaming out of desperate fear. But when she gets her chances and buys herself a little bit of time, she doesn't focus and come up with a plan, she just keeps loudly screaming and flailing about, running painfully slowly, nearly falling over every 3 steps.This movie pretends to be based on a real story which is just really lame and dishonest. If you have to manipulate your audience to get a response from them, that's a bad sign.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has some fun scares and dark horror moments. It has a consistent lo-fi style that starts out annoying but works well by the end. The last shot has a visceral energy that seems to pop out of the screen. But the movie lacks humour, social commentary, science fiction, character arcs, any kind of other element to elevate it above being just a horror movie.Some of the last scenes are disturbing (and well-acted). Having weird strangers laugh at you and mock your screams is pretty messed up. Not to mention being powerless and not knowing if you're going to die or not. But do we need to see this? Is this really entertainment?",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
209,PCC0921,Birth of a Sub-Genre is a Slow Start,7,11 January 2021,"This is probably the 4th time I have seen this film and I understand that it is a ""classic"", but I still think it can't hold a candle to ""Halloween"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Evil Dead"" or even ""Friday the 13th"". This is the original slasher film, with all the bells and whistles needed for this kind of film, as well as, the hot chicks. There is a definite stylization and grittiness to the film that helps enhance the experience, but it is too cheap and sloppily put together, as evident in the fact that you can hear cars driving by in the distance, while the chainsaws are flying. It was interesting hearing John Larroquette in the beginning as the narrator.7.2 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
210,Jared_Andrews,One of the best and most influential horror films ever made,7,26 June 2018,"'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is one of the most famous and influential horror films of all time. Its minimal budget and direction can be seen in some way in nearly all horror movies that followed it for decades. The plot is exceptionally simple, a smart choice and another influential one. Five young adults take a trip to a desolate Texas town to honor the death of a friend's grandfather. On what should have been a wonderful, cathartic adventure, they encounter a family of cannibals who slaughter humans with hammers, and yes, chainsaws. All the actors were unknowns at the time, and they worked little in movies afterwards. I must admit I didn't notice that these were amateurs. After all, they really only needed to scream and run, so hiring no-name actors was a smart cost-saving decision.My initial reaction is that the film is not nearly as gory as people think it is-virtually all the blood and violence is shown off screen or is blocked by some clever camera work. If you dare to keep your eyes fixed to the screen during the killing scenes, you'll be surprised to find how little you actually see.The camera work used throughout the film is inspired and clearly inspiring. Countless horror movies that have come after have copied techniques seen here, not only to save money on necessary prosthetics and makeup, but also to let viewers visualize the gore for themselves. In most cases, what we imagine is far worse than anything a movie could actually show us.For the most part, the movie contains very little score. Sound effects and occasional dialogue make up virtually all the sound we here. During the scariest moments, screams replace the music. Another replacement for the creepy music we would normally hear is the sound of maniacal laughter. The cannibal family's incessant laughter is creepy as hell. 'Halloween' has the famous piano music, and 'Texas Chainsaw' has creepy laughter. The chase scene at the end is incredibly terrifying and brilliantly filmed. Making use of wide shots, we see the girl and the cannibals sprinting towards the camera, as carefully selected angles manipulate the viewers' depth perception, causing the chasing cannibals to appear closer than they really are. Also, there's a giant psychopath wielding a roaring chainsaw as he chases a helpless, shrieking girl. Fancy camerawork isn't exactly required to make this scene terrifying. Nevertheless, the chase sequences in this film are some the best and most inventive ever in horror cinema.When all hope seems lost, the girl with the iron will survives, the only one of her group to do so. This popularized the trope of the lone surviving girl. Watch any horror film-there's almost always at least one girl who fights and survives. That's just one more example of this film's influence.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
211,rhinocerosfive-1,"""Mercury in retrograde and all that""",8,23 November 2007,"Chief among ""Chain Saw Massacre's"" many virtues is a marvelously developed sense of mood. It is relentlessly creepy, even when it focuses on the mundane. Every design element vibrates with peril - the awful music on the radio in that Ford van; the voyeuristic camera skulking outside the farmhouse, abetted by the low menace of the generator; the sustained hysteria of the worst dinner party in cinema, are among the most well-executed achievements in the genre.The actual murder and torture are very limited - Tobe Hooper understood that the threat's the thing. He uses editing the way Eli Roth uses fake blood. Maybe Hooper was just limited by his resources, because he certainly went all the way to Spielberg heaven later on in his career. But for my money the expression on Jim Siebold's face, while he pokes the gunny-sacked Marilyn Burns with a stick, is scarier than any number of severed limbs or punctured eyeballs. And Gunnar Hansen's alarmed squeals are the more horrible for their quality of fear and confusion. This is a complex and logical universe that serves a useful purpose: it provides catharsis without indulgence.The difference between this and today's trend in horror is simple. Rob Zombie gets an erection from the naked dead girls in ""Devil's Rejects,"" and he wants me to like it too. But I don't want to like it. In ""Chain Saw,"" I am not titillated by the violence. I am traumatized, galvanized, shocked awake. The Platinum Dunes/Next Entertainment remake cycle simply repulses, substituting bludgeon for nuance.

It is a brilliantly made film on a low budget, The grainy sun-drenched images, the close-ups of skulls and decaying, despicable images on show all add to its effect. It is a nightmare for the girl and that's where the problem was with the banning of it, the torture of her. There isn't much blood shed just the psychological terror of it all.

I beg to differ, in my opinion this movie is just awful, everything about it was bad, people need to start thinking with their own head, not only shout - ''wow', that's a classic, way better than new horror movies'' etc.The whole setup is bad, five incredibly annoying hipster kids you hate from minute 1, an incredibly predictable plot, irrational actions and the list goes on and on. 4 out of 5 hippies died in the lamest ways possible, it was just so boring to see all of them die the same way and still you had to sit through the rest of the movie with only 1 character remaining. The most annoying was the hippie in the wheelchair i have never hear such an obnoxious voice, that alone almost made me stop watching this. Also, the sound effects are dreadful, some tunes are not fitting the actions at all and the worst part were the overlapping sounds throughout the film.Simply bad and not worthwhile, i am disappointed about the fact that people can not write honest reviews and are so easily influenced by other peoples opinions. 2003 remake of this is way better than the original, surprisingly, but this is one of those rare cases, you will be better of watching the remake if you like the idea of this movie.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
215,gilleliath,mad & macabre,10,25 November 2019,"The thing about TCM is not that it's brutally realistic - it isn't. It's not like modern slasher pics, though those are the inevitable result of people with less vision trying to imitate a great film. We all know that you don't actually see much gore on screen - one of several features it shares with Hitchcock's Psycho - and the notes tell you, amusingly, that Hooper was actually hoping for a PG rating (A, I suppose, in those days). The action is in fact not realistic - Leatherface never really looks like he's cutting anyone, he chases the girl cartoon-like for ages without getting any nearer or further, there are lots of abrupt edits where the action changes quite suddenly.Deliberately or not - but I think deliberately - what this film recreates, more effectively than any other, is the experience of having a nightmare: the Death imagery, the looping action, the impossibility of escape - until miraculously, out of nowhere, you wake up and it's over. Its use of these archetypes makes it cathartic and so, paradoxically, far more satisfying than the imitators. It's scary, not because you're afraid this might happen to you, but because you feel on some level that it has already happened.For fans of extras, this version ('original uncut') has a few extra seconds of gory footage and quite a lot of 'making of' stuff if you like that sort of thing. It's quite funny to hear the laconic Texan voice of the props guy - the guy who did all that brilliant work - on the movie: 'Ah thowt it wuz pretty baaad'.

216,lotus_chief,One of the most shocking films I've ever seen....,8,18 August 2003,"Seeing Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time today, I have to say that it ranks up there with The Exorcist as one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen.  This movie represents what a horror movie is all about....this is how it's supposed to be done.  Its straight to the point, it thrusts you right into the thick of the events, and they happen with no warning.  I don't think anything truly 'scares' me nowadays, its more shocking than anything else...and I guess that is how people judge what a 'scary' movie is.  The low-budget look is very  much welcomed in this film, it helps the film get its point across and its a great look.  I was curious as to whether we would get a look into what exactly went on in that house, and boy did we ever!  I came away from TCM truly stunned at what I just saw.  And to think that this film was made almost 30 years ago, and I was affected by it as if I saw it the year it was released, says a lot about the quality of this film....especially one of its genre.  I was actually compelled to see this when I went to see Freddy vs. Jason last night and saw the preview for the remake of TCM, which I have NO INTEREST in seeing and I feel is/will be a disgrace to this original classic.  Don't get fooled by the title of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this is a classic horror film in every sense of the word, and ranks up with The Exorcist and The Shining as the best horror films I've ever seen.

217,fredschaefer-406-623204,A legit contender for the scariest film ever made.,9,24 October 2017,"As a lifelong fan of horror films, I am ashamed to say that it took the death of director Tobe Hooper to finally prompt me to order a DVD copy of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Though this movie has been a horror staple ever since it opened amid enormous controversy in 1974, I'd somehow avoided viewing the film despite it being easily available for decades via videotape, and then DVD. And I must admit, I stayed away because most low budget gore movies from back in the day are just about unwatchablethink Herchell Gordon Lewis. But with the passing of Hooper, and the tremendous praise poured upon CHAINSAW, I decided to finally check out what I had been missing out on all these years, all the while wondering if the movie would still hold up.I can definitely say that TCM more than holds its own and lives up to the hype; in fact it towers over all the remakes, reboots, and the hundreds of rip-offs that have come down the road in the years since. TCM is arguably the most perfect representation of pure terror ever put on a movie screen, and, like Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, one of filmdom's great visual recreations of a nightmare. One of the many genius moves Hooper made was to go heavy on the sensory overload – the jarring metallic clanging noise, the ominous breeze blowing over the hot Texas landscape, insects skittering about, a dead Armadillo in the road, a blazing red sun in a black sky, a full moon revealing itself behind wispy clouds in the night, a quick shot of listless cattle awaiting slaughter, a room filled with furniture made of human bones, the clucking chicken in a birdcage – to create a false face rural America behind which lies dread and horror unimaginable. The plot, what there is of it, concerns a van full of college students traveling through the boondocks of Texas to visit and old family homestead; of course they run out of gas and walk right into the clutches of the cannibalistic Sawyer clan, where one by one, they are butchered like the cattle in the pens they passed earlier. Only Sally manages to escape, but not before enduring one of the most horrific nights of terror any character has ever been through in any movie ever. That was Hooper's other genius move, that there be no buildup of tension before the villains revealed themselves to their victims, they just walk straight into the frame without fear or hesitation and kill their defenseless prey. There had never before been a character quite like Leatherface before TCM, with his hulking frame, mask of human skin, butcher's apron, and a roaring chainsaw that never freezes up. From the moment he steps out of the dark and guts Sally's annoying crippled brother, Franklyn, through the relentless chase in the woods, to the ghastly family ""dinner"" scene with Grandpa, to the final escape on the highway, we are treated to a sequence of pure terror like no other. Yes, it is repetitive, and even today, almost unwatchable in parts, yet the very fact that it plays out like a scratched record is what makes it feel like a nightmare without end. No wonder movie goers at a sneak preview back in 1974 walked out and threatened to beat up the theater manager. Hooper's other genius moves were to make us believe we have seen far more gore than is really on the screen, like when Pam is hung up on the meat hook before Leatherface begins carving up Kirk; his use of dark humor, as when Leatherface looks furtively looks out the window and then sits down an beats his head in frustration, as if these kids who keep wondering into the house were interrupting him from baking a pie in the kitchen. I love the camera work by cinematographer Daniel Pearl, especially the low angle tracking shot of Pam getting up from the swing and walking toward the Sawyer house until it fills the frame, along with Leatherface's pursuit of Sally through the country side, whining chainsaw in hand. And who can forget Leatherface's defiant final dance in the middle of the highway? The film was shot in 16MM and then blown up to 35MM, which helped give it that classic grainy look, which is one of its most memorable aspects. So too is John Larroquette's opening narration, where he does his best Orson Welles.Tobe Hooper never quite got the respect of that some of his contemporaries (John Carpenter, George Romero, William Friedkin) who made great horror films back in the 70's, but his legacy is a solid one. He would go on make a great TV adaptation of Stephen King's SALEM'S LOT, the classic POLTERGEIST, and the unique scifi horror film, LIFEFORCE among others. But it will be THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE that he will most be remembered for, a fierce, uncompromising gift to all of us who love to be scared in the best possible way. And bonus points to anyone who remembers the Mark Harmon 80's comedy, SUMMER SCHOOL and that great joke whose punch line is, ""New film from district, Safe Use of Power Tools."" That's Hooper's legacy too.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
218,Rathko,THE masterclass in low-budget horror,9,22 December 2004,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre can, and will, be reinterpreted by critics and theorists for decades to come. It was shot in the summer of 1973, during the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Munich Olympics massacre, at the height of the Watergate scandal and the legal investigation into the shootings at Kent State. It was an era of plane hijackings, government oppression and dishonesty, racial conflict, terrorism and revolution. As a mirror of a dark period in American history, Chain Saw remains one of the best evocations yet of the era, as a group of young individuals, returning to the nostalgic home of their childhood, stumble into the raw and irrational cruelty of the modern world.The movie has a weak, though functional storyline, one that has since became the staple for slasher movies; a group of teenagers get lost, stumble across evil and get stalked and killed. But Chain Saw isn't about storyline and plot; it's about creating an experience, a sensory overload. The cast and crew work tirelessly to create scenes and images that are raw and powerful and ultimately, against all expectations, beautiful. Leatherface's travesty of motherly domesticity as he prepares dinner, his child-like dance in the dawn light, the open door at the gas station, the van making it's slow turn off the road towards the derelict and ivy clad Hardesty residence are all images that burn themselves into your consciousness after just a single viewing.The cinematography is exceptional. Watching the Special Edition, you'd never know that this was shot on 16mm in poor light. The picture quality is outstanding, the colors rich and vibrant, the blacks inky and menacing. The brilliant azure skies, the jade green of the grass, the bright red generator, the searing sunlight and stifling shadows. Every frame seems saturated in nicotine gold. Beautiful.Though not always likable, the actors are always believable. Performances are universally startling, but special mention has to go to Marilyn Burns. Though she has little more to work with than the clichéd screaming heroine, she works it with remarkable conviction. It was a traumatic shoot, and it shows. Few actresses have so effectively conveyed mind-numbing terror.The soundtrack is exceptional and deserves more recognition. It is a great testimony to the experimentation and risk taking attitude of the era that all melody is destroyed under an industrial ambient soundscape of metallic clangs, scrapes and screams, evoking the atmosphere of the local slaughterhouse and the Family's state of mind. Terrifying.Despite the complete lack of gore or extreme physical violence, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre continues to horrify and holds up the countless, shot-on-video, slasher clones of subsequent years for the puerile crap that they truly are. Whether by accident or design, this one is a classic.9 out of 10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The one with Dennis Hopper and an amusement park cannibal chili holocaust. Extremely, mind-numbingly weird and stupid.Tobe Hooper sort of got lucky with this extremely low-budget anomaly of a film, somehow turning it into gold.There are tense and interesting elements in this first one, but all the screaming and stupid characters are annoying.It isn't really an artsy film or great intellectual achievement---- It is what it is----a really cheap film on grainy 70s print with goofy cheap actors and an old house in the sticks. Not much for him to work with, but at the time, I guess it made a name for itself for simply being different and gritty.I like it, but I think the hype is a bit overblown, especially today, after seeing so many other great works.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
220,FKDZ,A Classic,7,13 October 2021,"I'm a bit late the party with being this late to finally watching the Texas chainsaw massacre. And well, it does not disappoint.First off what I have to mention off the bat is the great directing in this, especially for 1974. It's got great (and by now iconic) shots and overall the visuals and cinematography is good. And with that tiny budget, it outdid itself. The start of the movie did give a bit of found footage/documentary vibes, I think that was because of the introduction the movie starts with. But that feeling fades quickly.Now the story is fine, and sets a creepy/disturbing precedence with the radio and all it's broadcasts about people dying here and there. It's pretty subtle on the background for a long time at the start of the movie. The movie starts a tad slow. But once it picks up it really takes you for a ride. Though at no point did I find the movie scary/disturbing, only one jumps care got me. Also I didn't find the characters decisions weird, it mostly has rational decisions.The acting was fine, with exception to the actor who played Sally, and the Old Man, was pretty damn good. I can't fathom how sore of a throat the actor that played Sally must've had, so many screams of terror. Though I do have to admit the longer it went on, the more annoying it got, and less dramatic/terrifying.The set design is great. Just so much stuff all around. I wish we got to see more. The make up effects that are there are good, like really good.The kills in this are okay at best, most of them are quick and quite blunt. I expected a bit more out of that considering the status this movie has but it excels more at terror than horror.The bad guys here are a bunch of fun to watch, in a terrifying way of course. They gave some life to the somewhat boring group of friends. Except for Franklin, who we spend waaaay too much time with and his whining. The Franklin scenes are pretty awful, and his due is underwhelming. But I love the performance of the Old Man, his innocent sort of happiness seeing all the horror in front of him.The movie does end quite quick surprisingly. I guess a good thing in a way as the time goes by quick. And does end with a incredible scene. But I wish we got to spend more time with the ''family'' and a little less screaming.All around, a good classic still worthy of a watch! And really a must watch for any horror fan.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

222,mgruebel,"Horror, served unadorned",8,21 December 2014,"This film really reduces horror to its essence: a group of young people who get a prophecy of what is to come when a weirdo ends up in their van, ignore it, stop in the wrong place, and get killed gruesomely by a family of redneck degenerates.The plot is almost irrelevant, as the movie is all about atmosphere and the relentlessness of death. Unlike many other horror movies, some of the death scenes are sudden and almost banal, such as the unexpected sledgehammer to a victim's head. It has an eerie feeling of realism and inevitability to it that most horror flicks can only strive for.There are many scenes of sadistic infliction of pain and suffering, from people on meat hangers to people who can't quite get offed by grandpa, to weak to wield a hammer to bash in a skull. It's certainly not for the faint of heart. Also, there's always a (scarier than the movie) contingent of movie theatre patrons who laugh when people get killed at such films, but they will tend to be mostly quiet for this film. (And if not, be sure to avoid them in a dark alley after the film ends.)This film has no pretenses, and is a far superior precursor to the 'reality' films a la ""Blair Witch.' Like other excellent horror films, it aged well and thus is also good as a 70s period piece.

223,NerdBat,The father of slasher films~,6,7 November 2017,"I don't know why, but as a kid, I was obsessed with this movie. It could be because I had an interest in the history and the criminal psychology of serial killers. Many people have claimed that this film is based off of the crimes of the infamous Edward Gein, but in my opinion, it's much more horrific. The best part of the film is that the family of cannibals have been secluded, and exposed to death for so long, they have literally NO sense of remorse. They treat their victims as if they were cattle. The worst scene of course, when the family forces Sally to eat her brothers remains. (This has been widely disputed as to if it actually happened in the film, but I saw what they were talking about). I definitely recommend the film, but I do want to offer a fair warning, this film isn't quite like any other horror film of it's time, so be ready to see things you might not want to see.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
224,imbluzclooby,What's the buzz about? I say it's the imagery.,7,2 June 2007,"TCM is a gloomy, grainy, dark and macabre piece of work. What happens in it is brutal and disturbing enough. But what makes it more disruptive to your sanity is how it's presented. The actors completely let go, mainly the villains, of their social mores and submit to the most deranged and subversive human nature. The imagery and sounds are so nerve-racking that those elements alone are enough to distress you. But it's horridly beautiful and mysterious, because there is no reason for all this to happen other than it's just a freak circumstance and bad fate. We have numerous images that flash before your eyes that set the tone and precurse the horror that follows: The cows in the stables feeding in slow motion and the ominous music background. there's the image of the sun up-close where we can actually see it's flames. We have flashes from a camera taken snapshots of body parts, human fragments, quickly, where you aren't exactly sure what you just saw, but can gather later. And the setting of the slaughterhouse where it is implied that some backward weirdos live in; pots and kitchen utensils strung and hang on tree branches. Sound weird? It looks weird. Then we see a horde of daddy long legged spiders nesting along the wall of a room. Creepy and grotesque it is. There is so much more. But the most brazenly disturbing imagery of all is where the young woman falls into that room loaded with human bones and remains which serve as decor for this house of soulless cretins. It all looks so real, you can only imagine it really happening. The scenes of terror are not subtle and are played with full-throttle fright and screaming. This was absolutely correct. For as we witness terror from another person it can only enhance and promulgate our own. This is not really a celebration of terror and human cruelty. It appears to me as simply a case where man has degenerated hopelessly. So hopeless that they do not even know or comprehend the impact and turpitude of their acts. It's without reason and logic and just unfolds before our eyes. And yet it looks so believable and real.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
225,jay4stein79-1,Stressful,8,29 December 2005,"I have never felt so drained as I did the first time I saw this movie. I spent less than 90 minutes being pummeled and bludgeoned--kinda like how that captive girl must have felt when grandpa impotently beat her with a mallet. Tobe Hooper's masterpiece is not as chilling as Halloween or as intelligent as Dawn of the Dead (or Night of the Living or Day of the Dead for that matter) or as funny as An American Werewolf in London, but it represents one of the finest achievements in American horror cinema. The whole thing exudes amateurism, from the quasi-artistic camera angles (you're trying too hard, Tobe) to the limited range of the actors. The photography is excellent (sun scorched, washed-out, and magnificent--I can taste the dust) and Tobe's control of camera movement are incredible, though--especially from a young filmmaker. I dare Scorsese to make anything as brilliantly disorienting as the chase through the briar patch. The only other filmic moment to which I can compare it is the closing minute of Herzog's Aguirre, as the the camera spirals into madness around the title character. Those points of perfection help us ignore the more immature aspects of the film. So too does Hooper's ability to simply wear down his audience. This film is grueling to watch--and that's the point. Coming at the end of the Vietnam War (I don't think the last plane had yet to leave Saigon), this was a film made by individuals who had watched the horror of My Lai and seen the devastation of Napalm. They had watched their friends come home disturbed when they came home at all. The country had just gone through a ""national nightmare."" The kids at Kent State were dead, as was the idealism that had sparked the Civil Rights Movement, the Moonshot, and the Counterculture. America was in shambles. The Texas Chansaw Massacre takes all the pain and suffering and pukes it back at us. This isn't a stunning film because we see young kids getting sliced and diced; it stuns us because we see ourselves there--what we as a country have been through. I don't know if Tobe intended any of that. Nevertheless, the filmmakers were disaffected, young, angry, and beaten down. It only makes sense that their movie shares a similar sense of weariness and desolation.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

227,tequila101,A Masterpiece of Suspense & Disturbance that will be here Shock,10,30 July 2010,"I think that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the finest Horror films there is. For it's time it was a blood bath, but these days, it's known as a mild-violent like classic. Bloody or not, I'm still very happy Hooper';s work, one way or another.The story starts as Sally and her brother and 3 friends go along on a drive through ol' county Texas to see their loved ones deaths. Too bad for them that they run into a Chainsaw Wielding Maniac called Leatherface who loves to wear the skin of his victims. The thing i really loved about the film was in the first half of the film before Frank gets killed, we are in total shock about what's happening here and there and about why the victims are suddenly not coming back. Then Hooper anti's up the Suspense after Frank has died and we are in total dread and disturbance towards the end. To me, combining those two types of atmospheres really works. Too bad it can't be done in many horror films these days, or remakes for that matter...When I watched the film, I mean yes, I felt in total shock/dread. This is a master piece that Tobe Hooper has created and it will always leave you in total suspense no matter what. If you like suspenseful, shocking, horrific films,then this film is for you.Tobe Hooper also did a good job at this film because he created something new. He wanted Fear to be born and he gave that to us in this film. Tobe Hooper did an excellent job and I also think Gunnar Hansen was excellent as Leatherface. he really put out an disturbing killer. He will always be the true Leatherface.Also the scary close up shots of corpses, cinematography work and sound effects (not music) are excellent and well done. I give that full 5/5I don't mind the remake though Tobe Hooper's classic cult TCM will always remain good as it is.I'd give it a 9.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

229,Idiot-Deluxe,"An inspired horror classic! Disregard the remakes, completely.",7,24 October 2016,"A classic.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the past 42 years has consistently maintained it's lofty reputation as horror classic of high pedigree, despite it's humble origin's. The film is exemplary in several ways, with crazy characters such as ""The Cook"" and ""The Hitchhiker"" TTCM is a tour-de-force of demented and deviant, often quirky acting; plus the level of tension (that slowly builds) is notably intense, particularly in the movies latter half. I only wish I could rate this classic of grind-house horror higher, but for me, it just isn't consistently exciting enough (specifcally the FIRST half of the movie). Does anyone else believe that this film directly inspired the birth of the splatter-film genre? I find TTCM to be paced in such a way, it's as if one stray ember was left alone and slowly it builds itself into a raging fire, of HORROR!After it's simplistic opening credits give way, the opening shot of the movie, taking place at dusk in a cemetery, is one of the most striking shot's in all of cinema, which I won't bother describing any further (the 40th Anniversay Blu-ray FINALLY does that shot justice!). Then the tedious part of the movie begins, five 20-something's all cram into an olive-green Volkswagon bus and a road trip-down in rural Texas commences. Their reason for their trip is in response to a rash of bizarre and unusually ghoulish grave robberies that are occurring in southern Texas, these crimes prompt Sally Hardesty (played by the once gorgeous, now deceased Marilyn Burns) to investigate the status of the graves of some of her relatives in that area. As it will all pan-out later, these 5 kids have the worst luck in the world, by way of a series of tragic events, running low on gas, youthful curiosity and flagrant ill-advised acts of tress-pass all factor in and seals their demise.First Kirk and Pam disappear, then as the sun is getting low Jerry goes looking for them and he soon meets the same fate as the other two, now darkness has fallen and a very tension-filled (and irritating) scene between Sally and wheelchair-bound Franklin begins. Both realizing that their friends haven't returned from their mid-day (mis)adventures, they in a vain attempt to summon the attention of their companion's, turn on the van's headlights (high-beams over Texas) and honk the horn several times. Sally and Frank are both notably uncomfortable throughout this scene and they argue with each other almost constantly, as Frank displays a certain bullish stubbornness over their lone flashlight and ultimately this scene's as effective as it is irritating. They both venture into the dark horizon, which is hilly and wooded, a bad-bad idea... a short while later the CHAINSAW begins to whir and the less-than-charismatic-Franklin is no more. RUN SALLY, RUN!!!Sweet Sally, with her white bellbottoms flashing in the moonlight, is pursued and harried all over the countryside, often getting her beautiful blonde locks entangled in the tree branches. The word is that Marilyn Burns was ""such a slow runner"", that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen, also now deceased) had to resort to intentionally slowing down his pace and exaggerate his movements, such as raising the chainsaw over his head and affecting an odd shuffle of sorts and I think this adds a few ""subtle"" Keystone Cop's-esque moments to the film (the comedy factor was maxed-out, in a BIG way in the first sequel). Ultimately Sally, through an act of betrayal, by a seemingly docile and well-meaning old man is forcibly abducted and brought back to their house of horrors, were a raucous hoedown of deviant, ill-begotten fun is just raring to happen.Finally, over an hour into the movie we're reunited with the Hitchhiker (my favorite of the terrible trio), the boys find themselves with an unexpected guest to entertain and a demonic little party soon starts. This all leads up to my favorite part of the movie: when Sally awakens from her state of trauma-induced unconsciousness and finds herself at the dinner table, with her hands tied to the arm-rest's, she SCREAMS (she's one of cinema's best screaming damsels in distress) and in response, a hilarious bit of crazy hootin' and hollerin' (and howling!) start's up. This whole sequence is a blast and displays the movies best acting from the Hitchhiker (Edwin Neal) and the Cook (Jim Siedow), all told this scene possesses a deliriously high level of energy, a crescendo of demonic glee - if you will, that few movies can match (where all the elements of photography, editing, sound design and the ACTING all come together perfectly) as poor Sally screams and screams. Then a brainstorm (or the next closest thing his low IQ can muster) hits the Hitchhiker, he want's Grandpa to ""have this one"", gramp's is a profoundly ancient specimen and ""the best killer there ever was"". So they fetch him from out of the attic and proceed to play a ""game"" of sort's, where gramp's is the guest of honor, he attempts several times to bash Sally on the head with hammer, but he's too old and too weak do much of anything. Just then, Sally makes a desperate break for it, through yet another window she bounds, running to the near-by road with the crazies in pursuit. First a semi-truck makes it's presence known, which the Hitchhiker really gets up close and personal with, then for Leatherface, well his murderous intent is also foiled and a timely passer-by in a pick-up truck is Sally's ticket home. GO! - GO! she yells, punctuated by loud peels of stressed and disturbed laughter, as Leatherface vents his fury with chainsaw-wielding acrobatics.

For it, its just being the most intense and darkened chaotic terror you can bring, which is exactly what it does.Five friends in Texas, after a terrorizing encounter with a psychotic hitch hiker, arrive at a house belonging to their grandpa. Not too long after they arrive, a chainsaw wielding psycho named Leatherface, kills off the teenagers one at a time, leaving one left to fight for her life, and insanity after she's brought to his home with his younger brother, (the hitchhiker), and their dad, a gas station attendant they met earlier.Not very long, or just doesn't feel very long, it doesn't wait around for the killing to begin at all. Similar to a Friday the 13th sequel, they arrive, and are killed off. Except this movie does it better. The killings aren't too graphic. The main terror comes from the last three- fourths of the movie.Didn't really care for it too much. Wasn't bad, wasn't good either.

I expected this movie to be a typical gore-fest but to my surprise, it wasn't. While there was a fair amount of blood in the film, the movie relied heavily on atmosphere and mood instead.Like ""Blair Witch Project,"" this movie takes the technical limitaions given to it by the immensely low budget and uses them to the film's advantage. The almost toal lack of lighting gives the film a real creepy atmosphere, particularly in the scenes set inside the house. The grainy cinemetography really adds to this as well. The camera work in the movie was done very well also.Special mention should be given to Marylin Burns. In a role that could've easilly become your generic slasher-film screamer, she gave a very convincing performance. She really looked like someone who was genuinely terrified and gradually being driven insane by this nightmare she was living through.This is a horror film that does a great job in overcomming the budgetary and technical limitations presented it and manages to create a truly disturbing and scary film.

234,shaun98,A must-see for horror fans,8,20 May 2002,"Watching ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" makes one realize just how watered down modern horror has become. Much of the recent crop consists of irritating ""teeny-bopper"" flicks, existing solely to market the images of today's hot young stars. In fact, the horror elements are usually a superficial pretext, only successful due to aggressive marketing. Thus, we are faced with the sad fact that many teenagers have not have the chance to experience true horror. In today's conservative political climate, many 1980s horror films could not be financed, much less produced and released.
With that in mind, getting back to the basics provides a much-welcome shock to the senses. TCM refuses to soften its tone to avoid offending anyone. It is pure, unfiltered terror; claustrophobic, gritty, unrelenting. In terms of content, the violence level is not any better or worse than average. What makes it work is the psychological impact upon the viewer. First-time director Tobe Hooper pervades the film with an unsettling, almost documentary realism. Its grainy, low-budget appearance actually contributes to its overall effect; there are times when we forget it's only a movie.
Although the film does take its time in setting things up, the results are worth it. As events progress, the terror grows and grows, never letting up. By the time we get to the climax, we feel trapped in a nightmare, desperately hoping for release. Unlike many other slashers, we do not root for the killer, but share in the young victims' terror. There is little humor to be found in this grim, queasy tale. No comic relief, no compromise. Just horror, plain and simple. The opening crawl claims that it's based on a true story. This is a half-truth, actually. It's inspired by the ghoulish crime spree of the Ed Gein, who earned infamy for dissecting corpses (mostly from grave-robbing) and keeping body parts around the house. The true horror of the film is that people like Leatherface really do exist, and that events such as these depicted in the film have actually happened from time to time. The viewer is acutely aware that there is a chance, however remote, that he could be the next victim of some madman.***1/2 (out of ****)Released by Bryanston Films Ltd.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Review: Checking this film out after having seen all of Tobe Hoopers films I can honestly say that this one is his crowning achievement. It has the raw, unrelenting, dirty feel of horror thats missing from todays modern horror films.Five friends go on a summer drive to visit their grandfathers grave which has apparently been dug up by some local mad man. While they are there they decide to visit his abandoned home which is right smack in the middle of Nowhere Texas. Too bad for them they run into a family of Cannibals.Though Hooper would revisit the themes addressed in Texas Chainsaw Massacre a few times yet again in films like Eaten Alive, The Funhouse and Texas Chainsaw Massacre part II this was the first film in which he ventured into the crazy family of maniacs realm. He would never again achieve the level of realism and rawness seen on this, his first film. It certainly is one of his most focused efforts.I love how the film starts out so normal, so quietly yet ever so slowly goes down into a seemingly never ending nightmare. The intensity of the last half of the film is amazing and you really do feel sometimes like you'd like for Marylin Burns to get away, you cant wait for her to finally break away from this family of raving lunatics. Hooper stretches the scenes in which Sally is tormented making all the more torturous for the viewer. (But if your a horror fan you'll love it!) There's many images that are classic to me, like the first instance when we see Leatherface and that moment when he closes the metal door to his slaughter room. (Shudders!) Or those scenes with Leatherface swinging his chainsaw in the air. Its still horrifying to this day and what I liked most about it was that it achieves this without showing much blood or gore, its all suggested yet it still manages to scare and horrify you.While watching this I couldn't help but think that the whole Chainsaw series is just a series of remakes. Part II was basically Hoopers big budget cartoony version of the first, Part IV is just a rehash of the first one as well. It appears to me that aside from the original the only sequel of this series to travel unchartered territory is part III. Surprisingly though, the remake managed to present us with some new elements which practically make it a whole new film, but its still a remake.Hoopers direction heres is top notch, he makes some shots and some instances really stand out. Like those opening sequences with the shots of the rotting corpses on the grave yard, or the scenes with the camera taking snapshots of the corpses, great stuff! I also like Sallys truly insane moments, specially those were Hooper just does these really great close ups on her eyes.Another standout part of the film was the art direction done by Robert A. Burns. The look and feel of the families house is one of the things about the film that really makes it all the more strange and horrifying. The furniture with the human skeletons, the animal bones hanging around the house just weird freaky things that make the feeling of the film all the more creepier.This flick is Hoopers best film and shouldn't be missed by any self respecting horror fan. It shows us where all of todays new generation of slashers are getting their inspiration. Films like Wrong Turn, House of a Thousand Corpses and Cabin Fever are obvious homages to this one. But the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the first to show us what a real slasher should be like and thanx in no small part to Tobe Hooper it also showed us what a real horror film should feel like.Rating: 5 out of 5",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

240,MooCowMo,Fluffy Pink Bunnies Go Hop Hop Hop...,6,10 July 1999,"Well, no, this is not a film about some pink, fluffy bunnies, but it is a repellent, crude, effective, sadistic shocker from Tobe Hooper about a friendly family from Texas who just likes to bar-b-que.  Not nearly as gory as many modern slasher flicks, which somehow makes it seem even moore unpleasant, TCM is a touchstone modern horror/slasher film.  Effective use of setting, twisted moosic, and casting by some of the ugliest cretins this side of West Texas, TCM is a mixture of 2/3s solid horror and 1/3 thorough unpleasantness.  One especially disturbing scene is the Grandpa finger-suck, a scene which makes this cow want to take about 37 showers.  Pacing and tension are problematic - in fact, the very first time the MooCow tried to watch this film, in a dusty drive-in many mooons ago, he fell asleep in his massively buttered popcorn.  Other problems abound.  When the twisted hicks torture and torment their last victim, Tobe Hooper crosses the line separating true horror from sickening, sadistic voyeurism (much like the repellent, worthless Bloodsucking Freaks).  Victim characters suffer from the ""I Can't Believe They're So Stupid"" Syndrome, and the overall plot is thinner than Calista Flockheart on Herbalife.  Still, TCM gains points from sheer vile, degenerate depravity alone.  Not what the MooCow would call a ""date"" flick.  MooCow says true horror fans should give it a look; others might want to find My Little Pony Visits Lollypop Land. :=8/",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

243,joshi_3592,What weird family dinner.,8,11 January 2010,"This time I'll start with the warnings. This movie is R-rated for a reason. I mean the title alone should give you a hint that this is a scary movie. in my opinion ghosts and monsters aren't scary because they're obviously not real. But the moment a movie show something terrifying that could be real, it's scary.Even though this is a more graphic film, the influences from Psycho and Night of the Living Dead are visible. I believe this movie qualifies as a slasher film.Another thing that makes this such a scary film is it's visuals. The movies low budget makes it looks eerily real. it has an almost documentary feel to it, and therefore are more believable. Also was was surprised to find that the skeleton ornaments in the film, was real. Apparently Tobe Hooper couldn't afford fake skeletons, but found an Indian company that sold real ones for a low price. This definitely freaked me out while watching it.Tobe Hooper definitely made film history with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and he started a phenomenon. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre along with, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, Jaws and Halloween made horror films what it is today. A genre that before had been frowned upon and never really explored, was taken to the next level with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And since horror has been a widely accepted genre.So any films have been inspired by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, heck even a guy at my age who makes amateur movies made a scarily good and similar film to this. Another film which is like an urban version of this is; American Psycho, a film which I also recommend.This movie also set the standards for low-budget films a lot higher. the fact that this brilliant horror masterpiece came out of so little, is all thanks to Tobe Hooper. Many great director took inspiration from Hooper and made some really scary and cheap horror films. Take The Evil Dead (1981) 10 film students, $375,000 and still a great film. The budget for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was only $140,000.I give this movie a 8/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

245,uffe-5,Define terror. For real for once! Yepp! you got TCM!,9,4 April 1999,If i must be honest i didn't think this movie was scary.Oh well maybe in the end-chase ( best chase ever made ) and the scenes after. It more is very disgusting. In most horror movies ( e.g ''Scream'' or ''Halloween'' ) you just watch them and jump a few times and have a great time. But in this movie.... You just feel the terror creeping up in your body. it's just disgusting. Coz nobody has talked about it  ( coz nobody has dared to see it ) so you don't know what to expect.

246,mrush,The greatest horror film of them all,10,9 April 2006,Director Tobe Hooper made an instant classic when he shot this grainy shaky little film.It has spawned a million imitations and continues to influence horror films to this day.This is one that true horror fans have watched over and over.In fact my own fascination with horror films is basically me trying to find one that is as scary and eerie and memorable as TCM.This film concerns a group of young folks and their attempt to survive an encounter with a crazy killer family.The setting is great---an old run down house out in the middle of nowhere in Texas.All the details of the bones and weird objects in that dusty dimly lit old house add to the eerie feeling.This is the film that gave us Leatherface----he has had a ton of imitators but none have even come close to the sheer terror of this pudgy chainsaw wielding madman in the leather apron and leather face running after us.The smoke from the chainsaw and the Texas dust swirled around him and forever that image is imprinted into horror fan's brains.The gnawing buzz of a chainsaw is the soundtrack of horror fan's worst nightmare because of this film.When I first saw Leatherface slide open that metal door and use that hammer I was forever hooked on horror films and have ever since been looking for the great ones.And this one is the greatest of them all.Leatherface dancing in the setting sun accompanied by his chainsaw is one of the most evil images in film history.There have since been much gorier horror films and some horror films have spent millions on special effects and none of them have ever come close to reproducing the horror or terror or the legendary status of this little grainy unevenly lit film.See it for yourself some night with all the lights out and let Leatherface show you how it's done.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Perhaps my expectations were slightly too high, but still, I cannot see why this film is held in the same breath as other horror classics. I can understand that it brought in an era of gory horror films but that wasn't enough for me to praise this movie.It was alright...at best.

249,GroovyDoom,A masterpiece of grim horror.,10,21 August 2002,"""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" could be one of the finest examples of horror film-making, maybe even film-making in general. It does not have much plot, but instead exists solely to put the viewer in a state of distress. I remember watching this for the first time and how utterly freaked out I was.Despite being a grueling experience, the movie really does not have much explicit violence. Some of the murders happen just out of the camera's frame; only once do we actually see a chainsaw penetrate flesh, and it happens to be one of the villains. What earns the film its grisly reputation is the unrelentingly grim tone, and by playing this to the maximum, Tobe Hooper manages to make you think you are seeing something that you are not.Hooper starts the film off at a relatively slow pace with a small group of young people on a road trip in a hot van, and it slowly builds in intensity as one by one they fall victim to a family of psychotic degenerate cannibals inhabiting a rural house that they are unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity of. Some people might expect the most unsettling aspect of the movie to be the violence, but what I found even more upsetting is the way the deaths of the characters come suddenly and unexpectedly (to them, anyway). It went beyond most slasher films, especially the first two deaths, a couple called Kirk and Pam. Happening upon the dreaded house almost by accident, first Kirk goes inside and is immediately murdered with a sledgehammer to the head. Then Pam begins to get suspicious when he doesn't return. The camera finds her sitting on a swing outside, completely unaware that her boyfriend is already dead inside the farmhouse. When she goes into the house looking for him, she is seized, screaming, by the bizarre ""Leatherface"", who hangs her on a meat hook through her back. In agony and shock, she is forced to watch Leatherface dismember Kirk's corpse with a chainsaw, all at once aware that Kirk is dead and that she herself is certainly doomed, when just ten minutes beforehand, they were outside looking for a swimming hole. Later, another character goes looking for them and happens upon the house as well, finding Pam inside a locked freezer. The most horrifying thing is that she is not dead yet, sitting upright in shock but then hopelessly shoved back inside by Leatherface, who has now killed her would-be rescuer.These nihilistic scenes signaled an abrupt shift for the film, which up until this point had been a little boring. The sudden plunge into savagery was like a trap springing on the viewer, and the effect was extremely memorable. The remainder of the film dealt with the plight of the final victim, Sally, who endures what has to be one of the most grueling experiences a horror-movie heroine ever had to face.Grotesque and fever-pitched once it gets going, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was quite a shock for viewers in 1974. In this sense it was a lot like ""Psycho""; before it, there wasn't much to compare it to. Rather, it set the stage for numerous films that came after, and it may not resonate with younger audiences who are more accustomed to the films that have been made since.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
250,manchester_england2004,Tobe Hooper's unmatched masterpiece is a permanent legend...,10,17 August 2007,"THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is Tobe Hooper's unbeatable masterpiece. The film was, is and always will be a legend. Forget the pathetic 2003 remake, the 1974 original is infinitely superior.The disturbing subject matter exemplified by the title of the film is the main reason behind the controversy surrounding the film, particularly in the UK, where it was banned upon release in 1974. Those who have not seen the film would be surprised to hear that it has hardly any blood at all and no explicit violence is shown. More surprisingly, the chainsaw mentioned in the title is only used to kill one person. Virtually all violence in the film is implied (although in a way that makes the scenes look realistic and provoke genuine shock), which is the way that all horror films should be made. Some of the most disturbing scenes of violence ever committed to film are shown in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the best ones being the scene where Pam is hung on the meat-hook and the scene where Franklin is killed with the chainsaw whilst being pushed along in his wheelchair through dark woods by his sister Sally.The film uses an unbelievable level of suspense, shocks, creepy background music and psychological horror to resulting in an atmosphere of genuine fear and uneasiness that leaves a lasting impact on its viewers. Hooper repeated some of these techniques in SALEM'S LOT and POLTERGEIST, although in the latter case it was only to a very limited extent. And Hooper's masterpiece was also the inspiration behind other great works such as HALLOWEEN, which use similar methods to convey a sense of fear, shock and general uneasiness.Most horror films at the time used the age-old techniques of suggestion and psychological horror to create an impact that will remain on the viewer for the rest of his or her life, the best being PEEPING TOM and REPULSION. But, Tobe Hooper came along and took this to a new level with THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE.The documentary style of the film creates a sense of grittiness and realism, and the introduction at the beginning claiming that the film is inspired by actual events serves to reinforce these effects.The acting in the film is top notch, particularly from Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty and Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface. Marilyn Burns does an excellent job at portraying Sally as the innocent helpless victim, whilst Gunnar Hansen makes Leatherface a truly menacing character that will go down in history as one of the most scariest ever shown on film. Sadly, these excellent performances did little to open doors for these stars to display their fine talents in other masterpieces of this or any other genre.Some of the camera angles used in the film are simply superb, most particularly in the scene where Leatherface appears out of nowhere in the woods with his chainsaw raised ready to kill Franklin. Absolutely no explicit violence or gore is shown because the camera is directly behind Franklin, covering what would normally be shown in a standard slasher film. Yet, I found this scene not only to be the most shocking in the whole film but the most shocking I have ever seen in any horror film. Sadly, Hooper's masterstroke has rarely been used in any other film of the genre. Other excellent camera angles used include a continual focus on bones and other similar symbols of death or mutilation in order to create an atmosphere of fear and uneasiness.The soundtrack in the film can only be described as exceptional. As pointed out by another reviewer, the film makes use of metallic clangs, high-pitched scrapes and screams to compliment the superb photography. This is entirely unique as most horror films normally rely on suspenseful music in order to create the necessary suspense.The innocence of the plot line, which involves a group of young people on a holiday trip, sets the standard for the slasher films that were inspired by THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and makes the horror ahead even more shocking. Many seemingly red-herring-style diversions from the innocent plot line are used early on in the film, particularly where the hitchhiker is picked up, that set the tone for the rest of the film and contributes to the fast-paced shocker that the film represents.My only complaint about the film is the prolonged ""dinner scene"" where Sally is being beaten over the head with a hammer. I believe that the act of physical torture used in this part of the scene does not have the same impact as the mental torture used in the earlier part. Further to this, I believe that the film would perhaps have had more impact if there had been less emphasis on the physical torture aspects and slightly more emphasis on the mental torture aspects.Some suggest that Hooper's masterpiece was down to a pure fluke. But, if one looks very carefully at his other works, he or she will find other similar masterpieces, including SALEM'S LOT and TOOLBOX MURDERS.Unlike most forgettable slasher films that were made, particularly the straight-to-video types of the 1980s, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE has a purpose and a place in history. A place in history among other masterpieces such as HALLOWEEN, PEEPING TOM and REPULSION, that will be preserved forever.Overall, my rating for THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is an unconditional 10 out of 10.If only horror films could be made like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE today, I would make the effort of going to the cinema to see them.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
251,thelastblogontheleft,A Classic for a Reason,9,24 November 2017,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre — somehow only Tobe Hooper's second feature film ever — is as notorious as it is brilliant. It has been highly influential on a number of other filmmakers — Wes Craven counts it as one of his five favorite movies, Ridley Scott called it one of ""only a few really, really great movies"", Rob Zombie has sung its praises many times. There's really no other way to say it — it's legendary, and for good reason.It's just one of those movies that could never be truly duplicated — it's a stunning combination of the talent and inspiration of Hooper, the setting, the 1970s aesthetic and film quality, and, in many ways, the circumstances, more bad than good. The iconic dinner table scene, for example, was shot in a marathon 26-hour session, which led to the actors truly — physically and mentally — being on the verge of breaking down.The plot is surprisingly simple. Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) is traveling with her paraplegic brother, Franklin (Paul A. Partain), and three friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Kirk (William Vail), and Pam (Teri McMinn), to visit the gravesite of her grandfather to make sure it hasn't been defaced in a recent spate of grave robbings. SPOILERS!It's as politically and socially relevant now as it was in the 70s. Hooper talks about being influenced by how he felt about the world around him -- it was made in the wake of the Vietnam War, amid the investigation surrounding the Kent State shooting, at the height of the Watergate scandal. The opening text claiming that it was based on a true story (it wasn't) wasn't just done as a marketing ploy — Hooper thought of it as a response to ""being lied to by the government"". The raw, gritty style of the film really makes you believe at times that you're watching IS real. It's visceral. It's unpolished in the best way. You can feel the searing heat, the sharp twigs scratching your face as you run, gasping, through the woods, the chicken feathers brushing against your skin as you lay, horrified and confused, in a room full of animal flesh and dry bones. Leatherface is absolutely terrifying, if for no better reason than he is not some kind of supernatural beast — he's a man. He's strong and powerful and capable of chasing you endlessly while squealing like a stuck pig and wielding a heavy power tool but he's human. It's filthy and gruesome but, surprisingly, there's a shocking lack of gore. The real fear comes from what is implied, and from the relentless mental torture. This was done intentionally by Hooper, and not for the reasons you might think — he kept the amount of blood down in hopes of getting a PG rating so it could reach a wider audience. But it's one of the reasons this movie stands out so much in my mind — it scares the hell out of you on a much deeper, much less knee-jerk level. On top of that, it has some incredibly well thought out and downright beautiful shots. The colors and contrast are vibrant. The cinematography is powerful. The shot of the open gas station door while Sally waits; Leatherface dancing, almost childlike, in the golden light of the setting sun after Sally escapes; the camera panning low while the house, stark against a stunning blue sky, looms over Pam; Leatherface's first kill, punctuated by the slamming of the sliding metal door; the van initially pulling up to the derelict homestead; even the closeup shots of Sally's bloodshot eyes as she desperately scans the room during the infamous dinner scene, unable to believe what she's seeing. All fantastic.Speaking of the dinner scene, the whole thing is just unreal. Again, there's no need for blood or gore — the psychological torment is palpable, both between the brothers' own family drama and their utter disregard for Sally's life (not to mention Grandpa, for which there is no explanation whatsoever). I can't think of another actress who has so convincingly and chillingly screamed in terror, and you get the sense that every single person at that table is going insane, both in the film and in real life. It is madness.Oh, and a special shoutout for the music, which manages to be disturbing in a way that gets under your skin thanks to an almost industrial sounding, discordant array of clanging and chiming.

260,RomanJamesHoffman,Brooding menace infused underground horror classic,7,26 November 2012,"Although not an ""official"" video nasty in the sense of having been on the list drawn up by the Director of Public Prosecutions in England in the early 80s (having already been banned by the BBFC in the mid 70s) the reputation ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" had for those of us growing up in the 80s and 90s was indeed of a film so brutal and violent that to watch it would almost certainly result in traumatisation for life. As such, as an adolescent weaned on extreme horror, I salivated at the lifting of the ban in the UK in the late 90s and the news it would be given a TV screening. And soone fateful evening I sat down and braced myself. Afterwards, I was left with a distinct feeling of ""meh"".Looking back, this was a naïve response owing a lot to having expected a lot of gory Tom Savini-style kills and an inflated body count which I had seen so much of in countless other slashers (which ""Texas"", released the same year as ""Black Christmas"" and ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"", is considered an early example of). However, with subsequent re-watches I came to appreciate that while the film isn't gore heavy (and only one victim is actually off-ed with a chainsaw) instead the strength of the movie is in its ominous sense of lurking dread which builds from portentous stirrings upto its hysterical, frenzied Leatherface-flailing-about-with-a-chainsaw finale. Indeed, so pervasive is this atmosphere that BBFC chief censor James Ferman banned it on the grounds that whichever way he cut the film the stifling claustrophobic terror remained.As such, in combination with being (slightly) less parodied and milked by franchises than other notable slasher entries, this lack of gore in preference to claustrophobia has meant it has aged fairly well (as nothing dates quicker than special effects and fake blood). The film also has quite a strong sense of believability due to its low budget influenced quasi-documentary style, its inspiration from real life serial killer Ed Gein (who also served as the inspiration for ""Psycho""), that the fact that the shooting was characterised by time constraints, searing heat, and the stench of rotting animal flesh which made a lot of the hysteria seen on screen more real than would be expected.All told, I'm sure some will still try to sniffy and say it's dated, rubbish, and not scary etc. but frankly they're missing the point. The movie was and remains an underground horror classic which, along with ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Halloween"", not only has the prestige of having shaped subsequent generations of horror movies, but which can still go toe-to-toe with any of today's offerings when it comes to a crushing sense of primal terror.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I could imagine the crowds watching this in 1974, this type of a movie coming into theaters was unheard of at the time. The scariest part is that it is 100% believable the whole way through, the story of a group of teenagers traveling through Texas when a hitch-hiker joins the crowd and really starts to creep people out, the group eventually kicks him out and they descend to a desolate house/farm and find out one by one that they all are prey to a psychotic killer never before fathomed by any one person alive, that person was Leatherface (played to a 'T' by Gunnar Hansen) Tobe Hooper I give you a perfect rating for a great film. Do not go through your life without watching this!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
262,fletchy-57354,All the action no filler!,8,12 February 2021,This film is so unique because it seems to have had all the fat cut off it. Its only 80 mins long and you actually wish there was an extra 20 mins in there for extra dialogue and explanation of the characters and backstory but it proves that its better to leave the audience wanting more than the other way around. Every minute of it was fun and enjoyable and the low budget of 300k makes it more scary and real. A top 10 horror film all day long.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
263,saint_brett,Exercise In Terror,10,27 October 2021,"Bow down to one of the top 5 kings of horror. Cheaply made, but highly effective. I like to equate this movie to being drunk - once you're on that train ride, and the roof starts rotating, there's no getting off, you just have to ride it out.The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and The Exorcist, are two movies I don't watch regularly because they're offensively so well made that I tend to shy away from both of them in fear. What sane person watches this? You have to be a bit damaged, and disturbed, with sinister urges, to take delight in this.Even the start credits here are creepy. What am I looking at exactly - intestines? The Earth on fire and bleeding? I read somewhere that the darker nature of Halloween's true origins involve farmers sacrificing animals, and in some cases humans, on their land if their crops failed to flourish in a last resort attempt to sweeten the soil for next year. (The shops do sell Blood and Bone.)Is that Jeffrey Dahmer setting up the planks for Franklin at the start here? I hear the actor who played Franklin was a bit fickle to work with? A primadonna of some sorts?So the Partridge Family roll in their hippy mobile, or Scooby Doo van, to check on the progress of their dead loved ones, who deep down are actually nice people.Satisfied that they're not being sold on the black market they take off via the slaughterhouse. (Yer, Buddy sure was a 100 proof Leatherface ripoff-clone-wannabe.)The guy in the glasses and fuzzy hair reminds me of Disco Stu.Repulsed by the stench of death in the air, Franklin seems drawn to it for some reason?The nerve of Dahmer here, ""Hey man, put that knife up.""
The Hitcher has perfect teeth.This scene at the Gulf gas station was a true story. Texas had a gas shortage 'round this era.I have to say that my remastered DVD copy is quite poor. It's very blurry. Wish I had of watched my VHS copy instead.The petulant behavior of Franklin here, before he hurts his hand, you'd think he was Leatherface's son. He carries on like a madman.It's pretty obvious that the Sawyer family's irrigation methods to wash away all the blood from their victims drained the swimming hole out the back through the old sheds?And that's what you get for meddling and trespassing, Kirk.Poor 'ol Pam, hanging 5 on the meathook, used to be the face of the poster in the video stores back in the 80's. It was like she was billed as the star of the movie, not Sally.Speaking of meat hooks, avoid ""3 On a Meathook,"" it's poor.Franklin directed 3 of the victims to Leatherface's lair. He aided & abetted his father. Leathy was his father. Franklin was the real crook.Other than killing strangers, I wonder if Leatherface did choirs, or household duties, around the farm? Did he drive a tractor, or kill weeds with D. D. T? Did he bake apple pie?Whoops, if they took the keys to the van then how are the headlights still running at the 50-minute mark?""Say, he would have done a lot more if the hook and pull gang had of gotten the beeves out of the way a lot faster."" Beeves. There's a word you don't hear too often.I think they went a bit overboard with the torture at the dinner table at the end here, but it blends in well with the satisfaction of Sally's escape as she's greeted by the morning sunrise.The truck driver should have just hit the gas and drove off instead of getting out again.It must have been dangerous twirling the chainsaw around while dancing for this actor at the end? Did Gunner use a stunt double for this scene?Disturbing.Texas Chain Saw Massacre leaves its mark on history unlike that disposable cash grab re-imaged remake.P. S. I won't mention a thing about that despicable sequel to this masterpiece. Shame on you Golan & Globus.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
264,TheAnimalMother,The Greatest Ending In Horror History?,8,4 July 2021,"While a few parts of the film are a little weak execution wise, and in terms of overall believability. The film still overcomes these patchy problems; Mainly because of the drastic feel of strangeness and the all out chaos that the film so amazingly captures in other parts. Usually when a film has such weak parts, it never really works. However this film truly defies the average because the feel of the insanity factor and strangeness is far above most. The film is simply effective overall because of the feelings it can evoke from the viewer. I think the end is among the cinema's most bizarre, chilling and chaotic scenes ever captured. Perhaps because it makes little sense, and is basically just pure insanity on film. In 1974 you can sort of understand how scary this film likely was. Just watch it and see how disorienting and chaotic the ending still sort of feels to this very day. Overall it is a great horror. Strange, flawed for sure in parts, but definitely overall it truly is quite great. To me, the films status as a legend is well deserved.Another interesting note, even Stanley Kubrick's daughter and others close to him have mentioned that he was a pretty big fan of the film. Personally I think you can sort of see Kubrick using some of the insane feeling moments of TCM, and at times injecting a little of that same sort of chaos into his horror masterpiece, The Shining.8/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
265,Foxbarking,Brilliantly Deceptive,10,17 May 2013,"Even though I have been a horror fan all of my life, I did not actually see this movie until I was 27 years old. I had avoided it because I was under the incorrect impression, as so many people are, that this was a plot less and needlessly gory B movie. Although I have no issue with gory movies, I do prefer that they have a story.Amusingly enough, I saw this movie on a first date. That evening consisted of ""Tank Girl,"" ""Day of the Dead,"" and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre."" I liked the guy enough that I was willing to watch his movie, even though I was adamant I wouldn't like it. I am glad I did watch it, because I had been denying myself the viewing of an absolutely brilliant horror film.There are definitely misconceptions surrounding this movie. Like ""Psycho"" and other horror films, parts of this movie are taken from the life of Ed Gein. However, these parts are small and mostly insignificant. The scene in the house will all the bones lying around is really the only thing that comes from this story. Gein was also not a serial killer, as he only murdered two people and was more notorious as a grave robber. And he definitely never cut people up with chain saws.One of the things that shocked me was the lack of blood and gore in this movie. It did, however, have something in common with ""Psycho."" The camera work definitely gives the impression of gore and it is easy to walk away from this movie assuming that there was a lot more blood and guts than there actually was. The horror comes from so many places that actual gore is not necessary. The victims are less expectant than most horror victims and that in itself is disturbing. But Sally's approximately 20 minutes straight horror and scream fest are more unsettling than any amount of blood and violence could ever be. It takes you deeply into the horror she went through and by the time she is in the back of that pickup truck, yelling at Leatherface, you know you have felt it. The silent way the movie ends is reflective of what you must be feeling if this is the first time you have ever seen this movie.If you have avoided seeing this movie for any reason but like horror, watch it. Two movies defined 1970's horror: ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre."" There is little gore in this movie, because it will hit you on a psychological level that no amount of blood and guts can equal. An absolutely amazing and brilliant movie and well worth you time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
266,Stealth-5,Extremelly Disturbing..!,7,29 May 1999,"Texas Chainsaw massacre was really one of the most frightening movies i have ever seen...The realism is spectacular,although the first 30 minutes doesn't seem to gain much attention to the viewer,as Leatherface appears...you get the shivers.The acting wasn't really watchable,you didn't really want to make up for the acting,because if i was in HER situation i would be acting it.The film wasnt really gory,but disturbing.The end scenes where she is being hit on the head with the hammer is so awful,it broke me apart.The sequels of the film were very bad,so bad i didn't review them,anyway a great movie overall..7.5 out of 10 B",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
267,darkjosh,"Tense, Clausterphobic, Unrelenting Terror",8,9 September 2000,"THIS is what a horror movie should be!Texas Chainsaw Massacare is so frightening because the entire premise is extremely realistic: a group of young people decide to go to a rural area of Texas, then are brutally chopped up and murdered by a local serial killer. 
The villains in the film are by no means supernatural, as is usually the trend in horror fodder.  There is suspense throughout the film; we care about each of the characters; the murders are gruesome (though not gratuitously gory), and once again, we feel the tension throughout.SPOILER: Some utterly terrifying and unsettling scenes that will have the viewer feeling uncomfortable are the infamous dinner table scene, which contains so many bizarre cuts that you actually WANT the potential victim to die just so that the scene will end.  Another scene is when the same victim is being chased throughout the forest, in which the only sounds heard are branches breaking, screaming, and the incessantly loud drone of a chainsaw. The film is so striking because it contains no soundtrack, thereby adding to the tension of the film.This film is a must-see for a horror fan buff.  It is one of the few genuinely scary films in the horror genre.8 out of 10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
268,Phantasm01,Horror at its most horrific,10,28 May 2006,"First things first: this is not a true story. There was no cannibalistic serial-killer family in the 1970's Texas, this movie was loosely based on the exploits of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein and the rest is fantasy.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was released in October of 1974, and was an immediate success. All across the nation, people were running out of the theater in shock of what they were seeing. The film cost $100,000 to make, and wound up grossing about $30 million. In other words, 300 times its budget. Not bad for an indie horror flick.Over the years, TCM has garnered a reputation as being extremely gory, perverted, and being a symbol of everything that is wrong in America. The film has been banned in many countries due to its content, and is equally reviled as it is praised.It was with some hesitation that I sat down to watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had avoided it due entirely to its reputation. But what happened as I was watching it was interesting. For the first time since seeing The Exorcist 4 years earlier, I was completely terrified by a movie. On the edge of my seat, squirming, heart racingly TERRIFIED.To start off, there is hardly any blood at all in the movie. Yes, people get butchered by Leatherface, and there is the girl on the meathook, but its all done with sound effects and imaginative camera angles. There's literally only about 2 ounces of blood seen in the entire movie. Secondly, you don't even really see what's happening when the people are slaughtered. Your imagination is forced to take over, which is even scarier than all the blood and guts in the world.Is the movie any good? Yes! The reason I praise The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is its unparallelled ability to horrify the viewer. This film comes as close to a living nightmare as any film could possibly come. This film is absolutely ruthless in its attempt to drive you right out of your mind. The infamous dinner scene is one such example. For 10 solid minutes there's nothing but yelling and screaming and all-out craziness going on. The fantastic camera angles and Marilyn Burns' terrifying screaming is enough to drive anyone mad. You are pulled into whats happening on screen, and you are not even given a second to breathe.Marilyn Burns is extraordinary as the film's heroine. As you watch the movie, you cannot even tell she is acting. Also, she is one hell of a screamer! During the dinner scene, you can tell that she is truly terrified, and cannot believe what is happening around her. You feel for her, and cannot believe what is happening to her, which makes the film even more horrifying. Gunnar Hansen is also fantastic as Leatherface. He adds a human quality to this cannibalistic monster that makes the movie even more unsettling.Tobe Hooper's direction is first rate. He decided to shoot the movie like a documentary which makes the film even more horrifying. You think what is happening on screen is actually happening to the people right at that very moment. The graininess of the picture adds even more to the feel of the film.Simply put, this is one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. Everything is first rate, and I highly suggest that anyone who has an appreciation for true horror see it. It ranks right up there with The Exorcist as one of the scariest films of all time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
269,walken_on_sunshine,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Doc's Review,8,2 November 2006,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a flawed cheesy classic.This film was meant to be terrifying in the 1970's however in this day and age the film is more funny than scary and unfortunately time and age become an issue.People will consider me ignorant when i say age contributes to a films flaws but it's true.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre intended to be scary and disturbing and in 1974 that may have been the case but in 2006 it isn't therefore the film fails to deliver what it was made to do,it doesn't mean it's a bad movie it just means it won't have the same effect it had on adolescents of 2006 that it had on adolescents of 1974.in 1974 I'm sure what was scary in the 1950's (The Creature From The Black Lagoon,The Mummy) weren't scary to young people in 1974,it doesn't mean those were bad films it just meant the new generation didn't find them SCARY.This film is very original at a time when good slashers dominated the horror genre and for that this film is marvelous but as a part of the new generation i unfortunately see flaws that may not have been flaws in 1974.The one character in his mid twenties gets angry at his friends and blows raspberries as a sign of his anger.Who does that nowadays except for six year old?a flaw that takes away from the realism however in 1974 that may not have been an issue.Leatherface looks like a mentally challenged drag queen, I cannot take him seriously as a killer when he is dressed in a bright coloured apron.The kills are way too close together, four of them get offed one after the other leaving us with 40 minutes of the family pursuing one victim.There is a paper thin story as we now nothing about the characters so why do we care???The film doesn't get good until the chase scene and the acting from then on is top notch.The fifth victim is a fantastic actress who brings realism back to the film.She screams for the duration of the last 20 minutes of the film and tough guys can claim they'd be calm in this situation but that is sheer crap.This movie is an instant classic that gave birth to a horror icon and while todays audience may not see it as scary it's still a fantastic and original film that deserves praise.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
270,tenthousandtattoos,why so effective? it is simple...,8,29 March 2007,"I kinda felt I needed to own TXCM because I admired heaps what it did for the horror genre and the fact it was made for virtually no money but still managed to scare the living sh*t out of me (i was like 10 when i first saw it...slept with the lights on that night let me tell you!) but the fact is i just cant bring myself to watch it again, it's sick not so much what you see but what is implied...plus the bad guy was just a retarded thug, not some supernatural thing like Freddy Kruger that was easy to dismiss as pure fantasy. This guy could have existed, could exist NOW, that's what makes it so d*mn freaky!Horror films these days (as with other genres) rely way too heavily on CGI to enhance the effects or ""scariness"" factor...but CGI effects date VERY quickly and VERY poorly...so there's NO WAY they'll ever stand the test of time the way TCM has...what i mean is, Tobe Hooper et al could never have taken a ""soft option"" and chosen CGI effects...they had to come up with ways to scare the beejesus out of people with just camera effects, performances and make up...hard to do...John Carpenter did it with Halloween, Hooper did it here.Thoroughly freaky movie...not ""omg thats gross"" but ""omg that's the creepiest damn thing I ever saw!""",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

273,knightox,Legendary LEATHER FACE!,8,13 November 2019,"I'm not sure why it's taken me all these years to sit down and watch ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" but I am definitely glad I did. I can't remember when I've seen such pure horror in a film so well done. It starts off with five young people traveling in Texas. Two of them, Sally (Marilyn Burns) and Franklin (Paul A. Pertain), are a sister and a wheelchair-bound brother who are searching for their grandfather's possibly vandalized grave. Kirk, Pam and Jerry are their friends who are accompanying them. Some cemeteries in that area have been robbed of their contents recently. After confirming their grandfather's grave has not been disturbed the gang decides to go to their old grandparents' house. Along the way they pick up a hitchhiker who turns out to be a crazed psychopath who cuts Franklin with a shaving blade before they throw him out! They continue on to a gas station where the creepy gas station owner tells them there's no gas. The owner gives them some ""homemade barbecue"" 🍖 and they continue on to the dilapidated grandparents house. After checking out the old place Kirk and Pam decide to go swimming in a creek behind it. Once there Kirk hears a generator and sees another house so he decides to go ask them for gas. He knocks and when no one answers he goes in. He's just barely walked down the hallway when a huge man with a butcher's apron slides open a door and SMASHES a sledgehammer down on his head! ""Leather Face"" quickly grabs Kirk's spasming body, pulls him inside and slams the door. Shortly after this Pam comes to the house looking for Kirk. She goes inside the screen door on the front door and then sees Leather Face inside a cult-like skeleton shrine. She tries to escape but is seized by him and then thrown onto a heavy meat hook while still alive. There she watches Leather Face begin to butcher and chop up poor Kirk. Meanwhile Jerry has decided to come look for Kirk and Pam. He finds Leather Face's farm. He sees some of Pam's clothes out on the porch and goes inside. Jerry enters the house and finds Pam in a freezer when Leather Face jumps out and pulverizes his skull. Back at the van it is nighttime and Sally and Franklin are worried about their three friends. After some fussing they decide to go looking for them. No sooner have they gotten into the woods and Leather Face shows up! He proceeds to fillet Franklin with his chainsaw while Sally runs screaming away in terror. This is a long chase scene. Sally runs into Leather Face's home, into the attic, where we see the remains of his dead grandparents in rocking chairs. She jumps and smashes through a window and manages to escape. She runs and runs till she makes her way back to the gas station where the owner tricks her, knocks her out and takes her back to Leather Face's house. Turns out the station owner was part of the ""family"" along with the psychopath hitchhiker and Leather Face all along. They proceed to torture Sally at the dinner table and have ""grand pa"" (who was actually alive?) try to bash her brain in with a hammer 🔨. Somehow Sally wrestles herself free and smashes through a window again. As she runs down a road the psychopath hitchhiker and Leather Face (with chainsaw) pursue her. Just as the psychopath is about to catch her a semitrailer comes up the hill and flattens him! The truck stops and Sally goes to the driver for help. Leather Face begins to chase both of them around the eighteen wheeler 🚛. Just then a Chevy pickup drives by, turns around and allows bloody Sally to jump in the back before driving away from the slashing Leather Face. Sally begins crying and laughing at the same time as the truck out distances itself from the crazed killer. Leather Face swings his chainsaw in rage in the dawning sunlight as the movie ends. Yes, this movie was one Hell of ride and set the standard for which many horror flicks have followed and still follow. (And I thought the part where poor, fat Franklin was trying to pee in a Folgers coffee can and got blow down the hill by a roaring diesel truck was hilarious! You couldn't do that in today's PC world.)",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

275,eddiez61,Absolutely the Biggest Let Down of Any Movie I've Waited 37 Years to See.,3,9 May 2011,"When it came out in '74 I was 12, too young to get into the theater, and so I swore I'd find a way to see it somehow. The ads in magazines and on the radio, the poster at the theater, the buzz throughout the country; it just had to be awesome. But so many other things occupied my attention - like sports, like dirt bikes, like art, like girls, like other movies - and so it was soon forgotten. There was no On Demand, or Peer-to-Peer, or even VCR rentals back then so it was easy for a flick to disappear into oblivion.But recently I happen to be reading here on IMDb passionate reviews gushing unlimited praise for this forgotten relic, most of which were written at the time of the release of the 2003 remake. So I clicked over to NetFlix, selected it, and moved it to the top of my queue, eager to experience superlative vintage cinematic terror. A few evenings later and I had it loaded into the player, giddy with anticipation. Soon a scroll of text read aloud by a somber voice informs me that what I was about to witness is in fact a movie. That's right, I was not only reading but being told that the movie I am watching actually is a movie. It then explained that what was to follow was a tragedy, a bizarre crime, and - in case I still wasn't computing - a macabre event. OK, I think I get it. This movie isn't a comedy. It isn't a western. It isn't a bio-pict, or a rom-com, or a tear-jerker. It isn't a period costume piece, or a Danish Clog Dancing Instructional. It's a terror fest, 'cause, well, it just told me it is. OK, got it...But almost immediately, I'm doubting it's spastically worded claim. Even though the initial montage of photo style images of a rotted corpse sitting atop a grave is genuinely bizarre and disturbing, any dramatic tension is completely undercut by a voice over news report from an unseen radio. Whatever horror the grisly visuals create is diluted in the tediously obvious, and ultimately irrelevant vocal drone. Why tell me what I'm seeing is ghastly and horrible when I may already be thinking it? That's just stupid. Bad story telling, bad movie making. And it just gets stupider.To read the top viewer comments on IMDb you could only think that this was art of the highest order, that it pulses with a hideous dark force that penetrates the deepest recesses of the human soul. These ardently worded essays extol the film's unparalleled psychological intensity and ultra-shocking realism. Comparisons abound to Night Of The Living Dead, Last House On The Left, and even The Exorcist - films which in fact still haunt me, even at my presumably mature stage in life. Some fans are keyed up on the contemporaneous events that they claim inform the film with grander, deeper philosophical resonance, such as the Vietnam war, or even the Watergate scandal. Really? Really?!...The Deranged Hitchhiker that the un-hip gang picks up is then perhaps meant to embody the dark, irrational forces of nature - a scrawny wild eyed Bogeyman - but he is just way too spastic and goofy to instill terror or even fear. He's just an absurd cartoon character; any decent spoof film would be glad to have him as comic relief. Whatever horrors await the doomed group would probably be equally spastic and anticlimactic. I was actually hoping the comical freak would dispatch the kids right then and there, as a poignant lesson to our nation's tender sweet gentle youth to be more wary of obviously murderous country bumpkin hitchhikers. But to witness their inevitable and deserved demises I was made to wait.The wait isn't justified, as the ensuing scenes are impotent in creating much tension. A possible skinny dipping scene - the pinnacle of slasher film necessity - is inexcusably preempted by a sudden first encounter with the famed masked madman. Much more than shocked at the carnage that was occurring I was p$@#ed off that I'd been robbed of the essential gratuitous nudity. Seriously! Don't tease me like that and then expect me to maintain sympathy. Jeez. ""Oh look, a big weird guy with a big hammer just whacked jean-shirt dude"" I chuckled to myself. OK, that happened... So this is the unconscionable terror that had stricken the nation? Victim #1's girly friend then stumbles into the Masked One's clutches and is treated like a side of beef, made to witness the dissection of her paramour. Serves you right, you silly tease. It's then that we are granted our first audience with the dreaded instrument of mayhem, The Chainsaw. Oooooooh...The film still believes I care what happens to the bra-less blond chick and her whiny chubby brother. I don't, since they have alienated me with their tedious personalities. And since Blondie has been shamelessly taunting me the whole time with her prodigious and thinly concealed mammaries, I am feeling for her a certain amount of contempt. She's not gonna really show 'em, is she? No, she isn't. This isn't a thoughtfully reasoned, emotionally competent story, is it? No, it isn't.There IS a pocket watch with a spike driven through its face that the camera inspects while I think to myself ""Uh, so."" And there ARE a lot of dry, clean, dangling animal skeletons that someone seems to think are spooky. This zombie of a flick doesn't have enough meat on its bones to qualify as either a slasher/thriller or a goofy gross out fest.Oh yeah, then there's the scene where Big Boobed Blondie is chased by the chainsaw fellow, her relentless screaming and the rasp of the power tool blending to make mellifluous magical music. Will he get her? I hope so... For THIS I waited 37 years?!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

278,fathersonholygore,The first movie to rattle my bones,10,26 May 2013,"Between a mix of Tobe Hooper's raw filmmaking style, and my ability to empathize fairly well, I was absolutely shaken when I first saw The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's the reason why horror filmmakers are perpetually fascinated by that same recurring plot of ""murderous cannibal family lives in the woods and kills people off who wander into their home"". It's one of the reasons I love horror films in general.There's something never right even from the very start of TCM, as we get the cringe-worthy sound accompanying the camera flashes while viewing macabre images. Then of course it kicks up a notch after the gang we're going on a trip with along the Texas highway picks up a hitchhiker who turns out to be far beyond stable. Hooper works a lot of suspense, and an air of dread before finally letting Leatherface loose for the first time. I remember first watching this when I was 12 years old (I was only born in 1985, so it would have been around '97 somewhere), surely not supposed to be according to my parents, and when Leatherface first blows through that door, attacking his unsuspecting victim, I was absolutely terrified. Even 20 years or so after first scaring audiences in the mid-seventies, it was still working its magical horror on people. Today, I can still throw it on and be shocked when first meeting Grandpa; the scene where they try to get him to take some of her blood is at once horrifying, and also darkly comic. After all the years of desensitizing myself with horror of all kinds, I can still find a creepy thrill from TCM. I put myself in the shoes of these people- imagine encountering something like Leatherface. You'd be petrified. The whole family are disturbing characters in their own right, and they bring some black comedy to such a wild horror film. Hooper's raw way of filming TCM brought a whole new element to the idea of horror, and people for years to come (and still continuing on into the foreseeable future) would try emulating its feel, but nothing can ever top it for the gritty terror it induces.You can pretend all you want, but if Leatherface burst out from some shut-up door in an old house where you were looking around, you'd not only be terrified, you would most likely die. Isn't that terrifying enough? Hooper didn't have to add much to make this terrifying for me except the script itself, and the performances that came out of it. I feel a lot of it, if not all, was very natural, and very much how I would imagine people might really react.All in all, this movie gets a 10. Hands down. One of the best, and continually most frightening horror films I have yet to see.

In some scenes you see what the victim sees as if you are the victim.  I give credit to actress Marilyn Burns who had to constantly scream and act terrified.  The moral of this story is never pick up a hitch hiker or drifter and never walk on someone else's property and enter their house when you know you are not suppose to.

282,MWNiese,A True Horror Masterpiece,10,23 January 2009,"Ten out of ten stars The original ""Texas Chainsaw"" is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word masterpiece. It's turned into a benchmark of excellence that few other horror based film makers have been able to achieve. The recent remakes based of the original are border line insults and go to show just how brilliant the original ""TCM"" truly was. Of course 1974 was a different time; audiences had never experienced anything like ""TCM"", and while I wasn't in existence in 1974, I can only imagine how shocking this film was for audiences to view.The film is based on the real life Wisconsin grave robber and murderer Ed Gein who only murdered two people, but gained more notoriety by constructing household items and furniture out of human remains. Gein is also legend to have practiced cannibalism on the two victims he did murder. If you're not familiar with the Gein story, and you're into this ""type"" of thing, I strongly recommend you Google Gein and check into his story. ""TCM"", however, takes Gein's story to a whole new level of perversion, violence, and terror. ""TCM"" is unrelenting once the the terrifying chain of events begins. Five friends fall off course looking for their grandfather's abandoned house, and walk into into a nightmarish trap perpetuated by a family of insane fanatics. Believe me, once the action starts it doesn't let up and shows no mercy for the wandering friends, or the audience. I can only feel sorry for the younger generation of film goers, that have been numbed by Hollywood, who just don't appreciate or see the importance of this film.""TCM"" is a somewhat culturally outdated film but is extremely well produced, considering that it was shot in about a month for very little money. The recent ""TCM"" remakes, with huge budgets and lengthy shooting periods, can't even hold a candle to the original. What does that tell you? It should tell you that big budgets and studio involvement mean nothing when it comes to producing quality films. What matters is that the film is, at it's core, a good story; and that the producer and director care more about the film than any form of monetary gain. The cinematography, however grainy it may be, is stunning at times and has the tendency to in itself evoke dark emotions on the part of viewers. All the actors put so much effort into this film and it shows, the acting IS above average on all counts. The sound score is evil, I couldn't imagine the film without it. All things considered, ""TCM"" is a very well made film. I know it's easy for ignorant film goers to pick ""TCM"" apart because of it's age and it's budget, but IT IS a quality film in every respect. ""TCM"" is Tobe Hooper's greatest achievement as a director and should be seen by anyone that considers themselves to be a fan of the horror genre.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

285,Krug Stillo,The Best Horror Movie Ever!!!,10,31 May 2003,"THE all time horror classic of the last generation, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the best example of suggested brutal violence. Not once does one see the saw come into contact with flesh on screen, but we all get the image in our mind. The film was banned in Britain until 1998 and when eventually released still managed to scare the spectator.The story, loosely based around the Ed Gein incidents, concerns a vanload of kids who unwisely venture into the Texan wilderness to an empty dilapidated house. Unknown to them, an insane family of cannibals live across the field and one by one they're picked off until only Sally (Burns, who also features in Hooper's other horror, Death Trap) remains. For its period the films was extremely shocking and marked Hooper's debut as horror icon to be reckoned with. Even though the budgets escalated The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the best film of his career. Hansen's Leatherface is also a nightmarish creation. Never before or since has a single character jangled the nerves ashe chases his prey, screaming and wielding a chainsaw around his head.This recently released extra loaded DVD features a great commentary by Hooper, Hansen and Daniel (cinematographer). They seem quite sadistic in a jolly sort of way, especially as they all laugh gleefully whenever someone is being tortured or harmed on screen. Other features include trailers for all the sequels and an interesting blooper reel and a making of documentary.Made for little money, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre still has the capacity to frighten without graphic violence, proving that sometimes less is definitely more",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
286,EdYerkeRobins,"Disturbing, Intense, and Original - One of the Greatest Horror Films of all Time",10,23 December 2001,"Amongst the classic chain saw-wielding psychotics of cinema, none is more famous and dangerous than Leatherface (Jason who?).  How can I call myself a horror fan (which, for the record, I don't) having seen only bits and pieces of ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", one of the most demented movies of all time? I have wanted to see ""TCM"" for a very long time, and the saw that split the camel's back was the film's original trailer, which I recently saw as part of the ""Boogeymen"" DVD collection.  I was in awe of the 2 minutes of film presented in said trailer and rushed to the video store to rent this horror masterpiece.  If anyone has actually read my reviews and recognizes this intro, I picked up the right box this time, and I sure am glad.""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is such a great movie because of its peculiarity.  Filmed on low-quality, grainy film, there is a real feeling of being there, and seeing the twisted sights and experiencing the fear in person; most horror films (such as ""TCM 3: Leatherface"") are simply too polished to give this feeling (such films may be startling, but are never truly scary), which is essential to the mood.  Just as essential is excellent acting on behalf of the film's resident psychopaths, Leatherface and his brother ""Hitchhiker"".  Gunnar Hansen is unforgettable as the menacing, seemingly unstoppable, barely human (his squeals of pleasure send shivers down my spine) juggernaut that is Leatherface, but ""Hitchhiker"" isn't given enough credit, as he is just as imposing, perhaps even a little more so than Leatherface, since the audience can actually see his crazed look of pleasure at cutting his own hand open and (later in the film) mentally torturing Sally.  Add to this a delightfully twisted script that works off of a fairly basic plot (albeit with 2 shocking twists surrounding the family that I wouldn't dare give away) of gruesome, fairly random killings that reminds us why we never go into abandoned houses in the middle of nowhere, and you have a bizarre masterpiece of horror dementia.Tobe Hooper's direction is as unique as the film he is directing.  His decision on what to focus on in close-up shots (a nest of spiders or the revelation, piece by piece, that the room's crudely constructed furniture is made of bone), like the aspect of unpolished film, gives a true impression of not watching a movie but seeing through one's own eyes.  This is most effective in the close-ups of Sally's terrified eyes of the infamous ""dinner table scene"".  There is a disturbingly surreal nature to scenes such as this and the aforementioned ""bone furniture"" (which are some chillingly realistic props in their own right - and Hooper's direction makes it all the more horrifying when all that can be seen for a few minutes looking around a room is these props) which I have yet to see in any other film since.Another thing unique to this film is the controversy it causes that has led to it being constantly censored and banned for violence, when there isn't any gore directly presented in the film.  Hooper implies most of the violence, mainly through the ""bone furniture"" and other disturbing props, and Leatherface's wardrobe of a butcher's apron and use of a relatively silent (but effective) butcher's mallet for most of his early killings, giving off a distinct impression of knowing what sick things this family is capable of, but not knowing which sick thing the family is doing right now. Showing more evidence of his excellent direction, Hooper cuts away at just the right moment (usually just after capture) and shows only one victim's corpse to leave one hanging with such thoughts - is the victim dead, and if so, what could possibly be in stake for his/her remains? This is why the film works on a different level than a simple horror film, and why all the other chain saw-wielding maniacs that have attempted to imitate this film have never succeeded.  Yet, while working on a different level, the film also has an unrelenting pace that creates suspense on the simple level of knowing that the victims have two options - escape or death.""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" does so many things right, building something truly disturbing off basic fears of survival and what lies in the middle of nowhere, all through the distinct impression of it all being a first-hand experience, rather than a film.  Now I truly understand why it is a true masterpiece of low-budget film-making and horror.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

291,myboigie,The One That Almost Started-it-All,10,4 March 2006,"You don't truly love horror if there isn't-a-glimmer of affection for this film in your heart-of-hearts. If George Romero hadn't made ""Night of the Living Dead"", this would be the baby that kicked-it-all-off, the start of ""modern-horror"" in film and culture. The 1960s horror-film consisted-mainly of ""Gothic-tale"" films like Roger Corman's ""Fall of the House of Usher"", where a family declines, and the manor burns at-the-end. It got predictable, and it got boring by the tail-end (sound-familiar?). What the horror-world needed was something new, and Romero inspired-the-likes of David Cronenberg, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and many-many others to try-their-hands at the genre. It became a great-way to enter the industry, and still is in some-quarters.Indeed, by-the-late-1960s, Gothic-horror simply couldn't-compete with the daily-nightmares of racial-violence, rioting, the war in Vietnam, Police-brutality, the standoff at Wounded Knee by AIM, domestic-surveillance, the kidnapping-of Patty Hearst by the SLA, Charles Manson, Altamont, the Wethermen bombings, Kent State, Chile in 1973, the illegal-bombing of North Vietnam, Cambodia, or even the nightmare of Watergate. Out of this bloody-fray came a film that reflected all this extreme-violence, and that film was ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The 1970s is a lost-time in movie-making when a small-film could rocket out-of-nowhere and floor-everyone, and floor-it-did. Horror will never-be-the-same again, thank-God. Wes Craven's classic, ""Last House on the Left"" (1972) had also-emerged, and the films complemented-each other in a one-two punch that re-energized American horror film-making--and created more-space for indie-productions on micro-budgets. In a visionary-stroke, director Peter Bogdanovich related how impotent the ""old-horror"" had really-become in his excellent ""Targets"" (1968), essaying the decline of an aging horror-star (played-by the dying Boris Karloff) and young-man who decides to become an urban-sniper. The climax has the sniper shooting-at drive-in moviegoers while a cheesy ""Gothic-horror"" plays on-the-screen, a great-contrast. No, if horror was to survive as a genre, it had to emulate and go-beyond what people were seeing-everyday on their television-sets (Americans saw more graphic-violence from Vietnam and urban-rioting than we do today, as media-ownership was less-concentrated then). The irony is that there is very-little blood in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The film had more of a reputation, than a reality to it, a reputation that even overshadowed the actual-film itself. But it's still plenty-scary, as one could imagine these things happening--because they do. Add-to-that the claim (false) that it was a ""true story"" in the movie's prologue-voice-over (by John Laroquette of ""Night Court"" fame, an early-gig), and many-people even saw the film as being a ""snuff"". There are no snuff-films, incidentally, only torture-videos created by Latin American death-squads (funded-by us), and other repressive-regimes, and are political-byproducts. But if Tobe Hooper is saying-anything with Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is that murder and violence ""begin-in-the-home"", and what a home it is! Ostensibly-based on details of Ed Gein's years before his discovery-and-capture, Hooper created a creepy-scenario that was believable after Manson. It is simply a unique-film, from a unique-moment in American history, yet it is so basic and primal. I haven't seen the remake, so I cannot say if the updating is relevant to our times, but I have heard that Tobe has said good-things about-it. What made this film so great was how small it was, and how the limitations only added-to the hysteria of the film. The final-sequences were shot in a farmhouse in 100-degree+ temperatures, the hysteria is REAL. Daniel Pearl's photography is great, but since they only had the budget for 16mm, it resembles a documentary. I believe this is over-half of the power of the film-itself, as it appears someone went-along and just filmed ""what-happened"", but there's some of the genius of Hooper's directorial-style--""style"" is invisible, it seems very plausible and real. Granted, it is difficult to make original-statements in the genre today, but the creators of the future-additions should ask-themselves this: ""Where is the line, and how do I get-away-with crossing-it?"" The new-innovators won't be doing remakes, and they'll innovate on-accident, you can-bank-on-it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

293,LagerLagerLagerShouting,A Work Of Art.,8,30 April 2008,"The ultimate exercise in the power of suggestion, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a brilliantly shot and excellent handled work, a great example of how to make a horror film on a low budget. Evoking the Post-Vietnam fears of American society at the time, such as the energy crisis and fear of the unknown, Hooper sets up the perennial horror film aesthetic of the 1970's, that of the deconstruction of the nuclear family. In this case, the cannibal family, comprising of a group of disturbed ex-slaughterhouse workers feed off the fear of the travelling new age young make-shift hippie family of the time. Where they represent the old values of society that has lost much after the Vietnam war, the travelling new-age family represent a more liberal approach to a desperate economy and they are struck down by an everyday fear of the unknown and a villain that is representative of a new terror in society - the serial killer in this case, Leatherface - a personification of 1950's Wisconsin killer Ed Gein. Hooper uses this context to scare the crap out of audiences living in paranoia of the time, and he handles the scenario with detailed precision, directing with an uneasy, nerve-jangling, documentary style. Shot on 16mm the film has a dark, grainy effect and brilliant, immaculately shot compositions and this only adds to the films raw power and makes it all the more disturbing. If your looking for a mindless, entertaining gore flick look elsewhere, this a masterful, intelligent, socially conscience and historically significant work of art and terror.9/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
294,lucianomarzo92,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...,6,4 October 2009,"I saw this movie last night, it started off very good. The first thirty minutes or so were great, and formed a classic intro for a horror movie. TCM takes the first thirty minutes or so, to create memorable, and individual characters. The beginning also has humor in it, which is very important, (if not essential) for a great horror film. Without humor horror movies can come across as too stark, in my opinion...This isn't just true for horror movies, but just about every genre. If a movie doesn't have any humor, you just start to think, Why so Serious? This was not the case with TCM though, the beginning of the movie was pretty funny, and realistic. The problem with this movie was, once the group of kids visited the grandfathers house, and all of them were kidnapped, the plot starting falling apart. I've noticed that this is a typical problem in slasher films. Like, its good for a slasher film to have memorable characters, but they are always killed off early in the movie. At this point the plot is between the protagonist, and the crazy killer. This killer often is a very silent one. So, what you have towards the end of the general slasher movie is long, drawn out scenes of the killer chasing the victim, with the victim screaming at the top of her lungs, helplessly.Now, these scenes can be very good, if they are filmed well, and/or are scary. But for some reason, the scenes in Chainsaw were not that scary, especially the chase scenes. There were a few moderately scary scenes (i.e. the kids going into the deserted house), though these could have been a lot scarier if they had used more of a suspenseful soundtrack. (This may not be essential in the chase scenes actually, as the wailing of the chainsaw is not only intimidating enough, though I don't believe any music could be heard over it) Overall, I thought TCM was a important but somewhat marginal horror film. The movie was influential to the developing of the slasher genre. I had wanted to see it for a long time. But I'm still glad I saw it. The movie actually functioned very well until the last 30 minutes. (The Dinner scenes, and the Gas Station scenes) At the point of this part of the movie, it had lost nearly all of its appeal. These scenes were also incredibly weird, and didn't mix well with the rest of the movie. The scenes toward the end were supposed to be terrifying I guess but they were really dated. The last five or so minutes were very good though. It has some great scenes, and is entertaining, but is overall a little disappointing. But slasher fans might like it. I'm not a huge fan of the slasher genre, as a whole, but there are a couple of them I enjoyed. (I really liked Psycho, and loved Halloween)",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

296,eytand94,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Bizarre, Disturbing, Terrifying, Classic!",10,9 October 2009,"Tobe Hooper is one of the most respected directors of the horror genre. He has created many classics, including ""Poltergeist,"" and the hip slasher/monster movie ""The Funhouse."" But Hooper began his career with a low-budget film that many had called gruesome, obscene, and unwatchable. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" may not be the most fun movie to watch, but it most certainly is a classic horror film.The plot is extremely simple. Five teens are traveling through Texas. The teens are Sally Hardesty, her wheelchair-bound bro Franklin, Kirk, Pam and Jerry. After picking up one wacko hitchhiker, it's pretty clear that the worst is yet to come for Sally and her friends. After their van runs out of gas, Kirk and Pam go looking for help and stumble upon a backwoods house. They don't come back, so Kirk goes looking for them. Kirk doesn't come back either. Now Sally and Franklin are left all alone with no sign of help. Tonight, Sally will be put through hell and back as she is brutally terrorized by a depraved group of cannibals, led by the iconic Leatherface, who uses a chainsaw to kill his victims.Tobe Hooper's non-stop fright-fest was released in a time where horror directors were considered insane. Films like ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" were two of those kind. But ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is where it was done best. So, what makes TCM a piece of essential horror? First off, the movie is extremely eerie and filled with tension and scares. It felt like you were watching some twisted documentary on some of the most brutal crimes in history. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is known for being the goriest movie of its kind. That is not all true. While the movie sure has its violent moments, a lot of the kills are off-screen, which just makes it scarier.Second of all, the acting feels so incredibly real. Marilyn Burns, Sally, was put through so much torture with TCM. All that running and getting hurt. I feel sorry for her just thinking about it. The rest of the teens are also very good. But the movie's demented clan of butchers are pretty damn believable. I thought they were actual criminals. You also gotta give props to Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neal as Leatherface and The Hitchhiker. They are very good actors.Third of all, the movie's main villain, Leatherface, is so enormously scary. But he also is interesting to watch when he's not killing. Leatherface is not very intelligent, and he is pretty shocked when Sally and company appear at his house. But when he's on the job, he's a brilliant villain. The fact that this guy ran after his victims and you couldn't get away from him makes him creepy.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" will always be the most gruesome and claustrophobic horror film of the 70s. This one isn't for the faint of heart and if you get nightmares easily, TCM's definitely not for you. You'll feel like taking a shower after this movie.

300,Milo-Jeeder,Brutal and yet not filled with gore,10,17 November 2013,"In ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", Sally Hardesty, her crippled brother Franklin and three friends, go on a trip to Texas, to visit the grave of the Hardestys' grandfather to investigate reports of vandalism and grave robbing. After making sure that nothing happened to the grave, the five friends continue with their trip and they visit the Hardesty's old and abandoned house in the middle of the country. Near the house, there's a family of sadistic cannibals who will encounter the five friends and chase them, to torture them, kill them and keep them as trophies.What strikes me the most about this film is the fact that the amount of gore cannot even be compared to nowadays' standards and still manages to be extremely brutal and disturbing. While I appreciate subtle horror, I don't stubbornly defend subtlety as a rule for quality horror. Certainly, I can highly enjoy films that don't have a drop of blood, like ""The Others"" or ""The Blair Witch Project"" to name a few, but that doesn't mean that I want all my horror films to be gore-less. Now, saying that ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" doesn't have any gore would be a bit of a stretch, but it's certainly not the reason why I would consider this film disturbing and brutal. The reason why this film was so controversial (to the point of being banned in several countries) may have to do with the fact that, even though it's clearly a movie, there's something oddly realistic about it. While it's not a ""found footage"" or ""real footage"" type of film, I felt like I was watching a documentary or a snuff film. It's strange, because the acting is not particularly realistic, but somehow, Tobe Hooper successfully creates a very realistic and unsettling atmosphere that makes it look like everything is real. The fact that the actors were unknown and are not particularly famous nowadays either, also contributes to this strange feeling of realism. The film opens with a voice narrating the story, as if it was based upon actual events, which clearly contributes to the realistic sensation. Needless to say, this is all fiction and not really based upon actual events. If anything, it is loosely based on the American killer Ed Gein, a man from Wisconsin who became notorious because he had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies from their body parts. The point is: even though the audience is aware that this is not real, it still feels real anyway and that's what makes the film so unsettling, in my humble opinion.The acting in this film is also very good. Marilyn Burns, who plays Sally Hardesty, the main character, is one of the most iconic horror girls for a reason. Her transformation all throughout the film is outstanding, and her acting skills can be appreciated mostly by the end of the film, when her character starts going insane, as a result of all the horrible situations that she has to suffer. Edwin Neal, who plays the eccentric and gross hitchhiker, does a very good job too. I still cringe every time his character appears for the first time. While it's not particularly disturbing or certainly not the most disturbing part of the film by a long shot, the scene where the group of friends decide to pick up the hitchhiker makes me feel really uncomfortable, and I think it's mostly due to the good acting.Honestly, there's little to say about a film like ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" that hasn't been said before, but I have been a great fan of this film for about 10 years and I think it's time I leave my review as a way to pay my respects.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

What gives you the right to say what is better than something else. With that in mind, I HAVE to say that this movie is the greatest teen slasher movie ever. Eerie and moody. It defined a genre, that of a maniac with a thirst for blood and gore, and transcended it at the same time. Loosely, and I do mean loosely, based on a real serial killer back in the fifties, this movie has a grainy real feeling that was cheaply and ineptly imitated by the Blair Witch Project. I have seen this movie repeatedly and it really only gets better. The unfortunate train wreck that is the second movie only makes the movie that much better. A great peace of art that I cannot recommend highly enough. 9/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I personally think Leatherface is one of the best horror icons in cinematic history. His gruesome face and wielding chainsaw is nothing short of great.

I don't think that it could be described any other way.  This movie is considered by some to be the original slasher movie, but I think that there's more to it than that. Sure, there's an insane, chain-saw wielding, human-skin masked, cannibalistic killer chasing an innocent teen girl, but the movie actually has a point.  There is a lot in this movie that has to do with cows, and the cattle industry.  I think this movie is turning the tables on humans and making us the prey.  It obviously an anti-beef industry movie.  This movie is weird though, and I think that it really is one of the strangest movie I've ever seen.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Is this what years of inbreeding will produce, or was this behavior a creation of socialization?  What works the best for me is that there is no aspect in the movie that was totally beyond belief.  I can see all of that around me and I don't even live in Texas.  Some folks are very serious about their privacy for a reason.  And those of you that smirk and think otherwise need to get out more - See the country - scratch the surface.

305,glyptoteque,None above!!,10,10 August 2005,"This is simply put THE masterpiece of horror, and naturally one feels quite the bit of reverence when about to review it. Many films have tried to emulate it, to follow it in it's wonderfully psychotic and rotten footsteps(most notably the absolute shitty, completely unnecessary and melodramatic Follywood-remake.),but alas,none has even come close. From the very first frame one knows one is in for quite the special ride; a black frame, the sound of shovel, the occasional blink of light revealing part by part dead flesh. Poor Pam finding herself in the midst of necrotic, bone-hell, gasping in a state of shock, for her sanity and the slightest bit of fresh air, in a place where Death has taken residence. Her boyfriend looking for the friendly face, instead encountering the blow of the sledgehammer, now lying there bleeding like a pig in death-spasms. Pam again, forced to caress the hook, and being stored in a meat-locker for later consumption. Sally being chased by the charming Leatherface, thinking that finally help is at hand when she runs into a gas-station, only to find herself properly bound and gagged, like some hog or fowl. Sally is invited to (become)dinner at the mansion, and you just know that torture has gotten a new name. The atmosphere in this masterpiece is so sinister, so full of filth and death, so absolutely twisted and eerie, and features such an excellent, psychotic and minimalistic soundtrack, that not one single horror film could ever be able to top it. The most brutal experience you will ever have, period, and to think that from the outset Mr Hooper was intentionally going for a PG-certificate! And the result being that several people actually vomited on first viewing, thinking that they had seen much more than was actually shown on screen!!

306,Sorpse,Grittier than the norm,9,3 January 2013,"great movie, i love how its always thrown in conversations with the greats like halloween and hellraiser and nightmare on elm street but sets itself apart from all the others because of its low budget nature. Its not your typical, glossed over Hollywood horror. Some of the characters were truly awesome while others were unfortunately garbage. The iconic leatherface is one of the scariest horror villains ever created, wearing other peoples skin as a mask, wielding a chainsaw, and apparently severely handicapped. Also the grandfather character was creepy as hell, barely having the strength to suck the blood from one of the victims fingers. Unfortunately none of the other characters back up these two freaks but luckily they are creepy enough to carry the movie. The hitchhiker was annoying but the scene of him cutting himself and the fat guy in the wheelchair is a scene that stuck with me long after watching the movie and was one of the only scenes i remembered before watching it again recently. Speaking of the fatty, he was also another character i hated, after watching the tcm documentary i was informed that this was intentional but i would have preferred to leave him out of it. Back to the good stuff though was the ending, loved the ending, the dinner scene leading to the outside chase with leatherface running with his iconic chainsaw while wearing a suit a tie has become one of my most favourite picturesque horror moments. Awesome horror, bring on the sequels!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

308,badfeelinganger,Bleak masterpiece of horror cinema.The documentary-style approach is what pushes this flick over the top; it's a grim and glorious classic of modern horror.,10,20 September 2014,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a bona fide genre classic, a one-of-a-kind film that will be remembered in the annals of Horror until the end of time. Its reputation is partially built on the name and the imagery it convokes in a popular culture sense, but the film is so much more, a dark, moody, extraordinarily well made, and deeply frightening experience that relies far less on gore and far more on suggestion and atmosphere and purely evil characters to scare its audience. It's the pinnacle of the Horror genre and a film not to be missed.Chainsaw-wielding Leatherface remains one of the most disturbing characters in horror. Artfully documentary like and shot under conditions that produced genuinely traumatized performances, the original Massacre eschews cheap thrills and attacks the psyche.A profoundly sensitive look at social prejudices and the toll said prejudices take on the human social organism. It is not that the movie is particularly graphic, with very little blood actually being spilled on screen. Rather, it's a very disturbing film.based on the life and ""career"" of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
309,SteveResin,Look what you did to the damn door!!!!!!,10,8 December 2001,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. Along with ""Psycho"", ""The silence of the lambs"" and ""Henry: portrait of a serial killer"" it's strength lies in that it's impact is due to it's psychological affect. Tobe Hooper masterfully steers away from typical slasher tactics so prevalent in the 1970's and instead leads the viewer into a world of insanity, which is far more threatening and unsettling. We all know it borrows heavily from the true story of Wisconsin killer cannibal Ed Gein, but Hooper takes it one step further. Instead of a solitary loner we get an entire family of lunatics. The beauty of this film though is Hooper avoids over the top scenarios and basically washes his hands of any special effects, and instead cleverly plays on subtle glimpses into the disturbing rituals and lifestyle of Leatherface and his clan. The scene where the camera pans around the front parlour, littered with macabre and deeply unsettling artefacts is a touch of pure genius. In fact, the film is overflowing with these subtle but very effective touches which all add up to create an atmosphere of high anxiety and dread : Leatherface grunting like a sow, the stifling heat, assorted automobiles hidden under netting and the constant throb of a generator, not to mention the worrying contents of the cook's ovens. It also has the greatest ending to a movie I have ever seen, with Leatherface swinging his chainsaw in the morning light and then a black screen. The music, the characters, the location and the documentary feel of this movie all add up to make it quite simply essential viewing for all horror fans. Watch and marvel...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
310,PaulyC,gritty and effective,9,30 May 2008,"The one and only classic, loosely based on the life of Ed Gein who used to scalp his victims. Five young friends visiting an old house owned by one of their grandparents, are terrorized by a depraved Texas family. The gritty look and feel of the film is unmatched and the total lack of a blaring Hollywood score only adds to its effect. Horror films in my opinion work best when there's some subtly. The twisted Texas clan are a total riot to watch in the later scenes of the movie. Marilyn Burns, who plays the lead, takes fear and terror to a new level. The look in her eyes while being manipulated is something you can't fake. She clearly tapped into something real for her character. Things got so crazy during the famous dinner scene that Gunner Hanson, who played leatherface, really cut Marilyn's finger with a knife when fake blood wouldn't come out of the tube behind the blade. It was over 100 degrees and there really was rotting meat on the dinner table. Actors would do a take, go throw up, and go back to work. Edwin Neal who played the hitch-hiker stated ""Filming that scene was the worst time of my life... and I had been in Vietnam, with people trying to kill me, so I guess that shows how bad it was.""

311,CWP-,"Overrated horror ""masterpiece""",4,13 April 2001,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", made in 1974, has influenced numerous people and established itself as a classic of its genre.  While watching it, I could not figure out why.  All that I saw was a poor excuse for blood to be shed.  Director Tobe Hooper can direct a good movie, as he proved 8 years later with ""Poltergeist"".  But with this, his first film, he faltered and faltered badly.  Basically, he has taken an hilariously bad plot (based on a true story!), combined it with some terrible acting, and the end result is almost despisable.  Yes, I'm aware that the low budget couldn't call upon big name performers, but I found myself laughing at some of this film.  And it's reputation of being one of the most gory films ever made is sorely misguided.  Check out another, far better low budget film called ""The Evil Dead"" if gore is what you're looking for.  ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is realistic, but that alone does not make it a good movie.  In fact, this one aspect is the only positive thing that I could fathom from this entire motion picture.

313,benowen-91207,Legitimately terrifying,9,20 December 2020,"It surprises me how many famous and well-known horror are, well, not scary. Atleast not in the execution of the horror, getting scared by a jump scare is basically an immune response. No, to make a good horror, it has to stay with you and terrify you beyond a primal instinct. The scariest scene in jaws for example is the swim at the beginning because, I cannot stress this enough, the best way to scare someone is THE UNKNOWN.This leads us to Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What I thought was going to to B-horror movie that just happened to be influential turned out to be one of the best cases for this form of horror. The film gives us enough information to be scared in the moment, but also refrains enough information to make it stick with youFor example, one of the smartest ways they do this is in foreshadowing. When the mad hitchhiker comes in, your more focused on his weird ticks and odd behaviour. But if you listen to what he says, he actually points out his family's love of using hammers as a killing method, and even shows his victims (I.e. the BARBECUE)But the stuff it doesn't show is really why this is a classic. Specifically, the brilliant Leatherface. We don't know a thing about what he looks like or how he works.

314,BlackBalloon,The most grim film in memory,8,28 August 2001,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre may not be the bloodiest movie ever, but is so unrelentingly downbeat (and well-made) it will not be ignored in film histories for years to come.  From the opening narration (who would have thought John Laroquette could be so creepy?) to the final credits, every note is played with vulgar disonance.  Everything is so WRONG about this movie-  young people going somewhere in a van smacks of misdeeds in itself. Even the parts you may laugh at or think are goofy are also uneasily weird. There is something about travelling in rural areas (especially those as flat as Texas) that is frightening-  it's like being in a wasteland of sorts- and for the young this is even more alien.  The camera work and editing is very effective (the scene where the girl falls on the floor in the ""chicken room"" comes to mind), the production design is chilling (the sliding metal door and red wall behind it). You feel little to no sympathy for any of the victims- there is even something about some of their demises that is frighteningly humorous.  But the last person alive at the end has gone through so much, you will find yourself cheering for her as she gives 100% to get away from these freaks.  Not much else you can say about this movie.

315,mrrockey,Screw Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity! This is Real Horror!,7,27 September 2013,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of the most important films in the genre. It was one of the first slasher films ever made and it created a lot of clichés within that sub-genre such as the killer wearing a mask and teenagers being the prime victims. But other than how groundbreaking it was, is it still a good movie? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. The story here is very simple. It's about a group of teenagers who travel to Texas in a roadtrip to visit their grandpa's old house until... surprise! They all get murdered one by one by a family of serial killers! While it's certainly not a plot to brag about, it's the way it's told that makes it so memorable.The film starts with a screen of text scrolling down with a stock narrator reading it to you that that what you are about to watch is real. In reality, this film is only loosely based off real-life serial killer, Ed Gein but it's an effective way to open the movie because it makes you believe that this COULD be real.The rest of the film has this gritty, grimy look to it that makes it look like a documentary. Unlike most big-budget horror movies where all the dismembered body parts are all bloody and grotesque, they instead have this old, rusty look to them that looks like they've been sitting here for ages and to quote Mark Borchardt, it reminds you of something you see in science class. It actually works much better than if they were all bloody and grotesque because again, they feel real.The sets aren't super dark and creepy looking like the remake. Instead, the lighting is very natural with a realistic amount of light and darkness in each scene. Technically, this is cheap but stylistically, it adds a sense of reality to the film. The acting in this film is very believable. While the teenagers mostly lack personality and are pretty disposable, you believe what they are going through because they aren't the stereotypical teens who smoke weed and have sex every night. They are just normal people who are on a roadtrip. They also aren't super colorful either. In most slasher films, you could easily identify who's the responsible one, the funny one, the douchebag one, the chatty one etc but here, like real people, their personalities are very down to earth. And because of this, you believe that these are real people trapped in a real situation.But the showstealers here are the serial killers and boy, are they terrifying! They are possibly the most accurate depiction of serial killers on film. They are despicable, ugly men who make irrational decisions. They aren't these super geniuses who are always ahead of the hero like Hannibal Lecter, they are just fwcked up people!So with these brilliant stylistic decisions, comes a grisly, terrifying film that perfectly captures the experience of being hunted down by serial killers in deserted Texas. I only recommend seeing it if you are up for some sick sh!t.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Toby Hooper did a good job of getting you to feel pretty creeped out at times. this movie reminds me of house of a thousand corpses. so if you liked that you will like this movie. The end of this movie made me laugh a little bit but i will not spoil it for you. the story is like many others in the genre.

318,The_Triad,The pornography of terror.,8,23 November 2006,"The bad news is The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has a plot that is completely unoriginal and has undeveloped characters. The good news is that it doesn't need these things to work.Plot? - A group of teenagers are driving to an old house in the country that belongs to one of their fathers, terror ensues.Why does The Texas Chain Saw Massacre work, where so many others have failed?The Texas Chain Saw Massacre does not barrage you with dull chit chat between idiotic characters and pitiful attempts at comedy in between gory murders for one. The execution of the film is the key to its success - A slow build up before the carnage, weird camera angles, macabre set designs, spooky, realistic cinematography, a genuine masterclass in film editing and a bizarre, down-right effective soundtrack. It is these elements that separate The Texas Chain Saw Massacre from it's imitators creating an onslaught of unrelenting, fear inducing images and sounds.Another reason why for myself in particular, 32 years after the film was made, is the fact that it is a 32 year old film. With modern horror movies, it is easy to disassociate from the on screen characters, usually down to too stylised cinematography and improved production techniques. With the older films, grainer and less stylised, the realism is enhanced, and thus easier to believe.On the film's release in the UK, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) banned it citing ""The pornography of terror.""

Yes, she saw her disabled brother butchered by a chainsaw but even when trying to escape she constantly screams giving her chaser her exact location. OK she is terrified but the screaming is so bad you almost want her captors to shut her up permanently. It got so bad my better half wanted me to turn the movie off.

Being a student of film these days led me to give it another viewing when I'd recently had the chance, and I have to recant my earlier opinion for sure.First off, this isn't any Hollywood glitzy, glam flick.  It comes from an era just more recently visited in independent cinema, in which at least some effort was made to ""be real.""  This is not to short the fantastic hundred million dollar productions the industry puts out on occasion.  They have their place and some technically intense works could not be done without a lot of money (outrageous salaries notwithstanding).Not only are the characters ""real"" in this, they are just plain screwed up, and scary.  While people like these are few and far between (thankfully) they do exist and are more readily found than those we find in Mission Impossible, for example.Some viewers have faulted the characters as bombastic and I'd have to disagree in that they were totally believable, though fantastic for sure. I don't feel it's a realistic expectation to believe the female lead should have hidden in the underbrush as someone suggested.  That's something a person who is cool and collected under pressure might do, but not anyone crapping their pants, not anyone I'm sure any of us might know when being chased by a freak with a chainsaw.This won't go down as my favorite flick for sure, but it's better than the dung heap I thought it was.

It doesn't need blood or gore to become truly terrifying, but psychological madness, which pulled me to the movie like a magnet. It is amusing how a 90's horror movie, soaked with blood and gore, can't even come close to the disturbingly terrifying and excellent horror in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was surprisingly made in 1974. It's all the more terrifying that it is inspired by a true killer named Ed Gein, who did all the horrifying things that the notorious Leatherface did. A+",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
329,medic249a2,One of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen!,8,19 August 2004,"I first saw this about 13 years ago at age 20. Prior to that I had only seen little bits & pieces of it (pun not intended). It wasn't until it was part of the shockumentary 'Terror in the Aisles' that I heard about its connection to real events and Ed Gein - who inspired it. The real Gein was known to be a cannibal, transvestite, and necrophile - all of which is largely implied here save for the last part - there is plenty of gore, but a lot is left to the imagination, such as when Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) revs up his chainsaw in preparation for cutting up the girl he impaled on the meat hook.While the photography kind of reminded me of the style in which 'The Blair Witch Project' was shot, one has to take it in context considering this was a fairly low-budget film. If anything, it adds to the film because it gives the impression of being shot by someone who is actually caught up in the events. The acting is also fairly convincing, especially Marilyn Burns as Sally and Edwin Neal as the demented hitchhiker. Neal's character is one that makes your skin crawl. Burns is highly effective as the heroine Sally, the sole survivor of the group the film follows. Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface), while he doesn't seem to have a single line in the movie, makes up for it with his bulky appearance and squealing sounds when he catches his victims, not to mention his hideous appearance in the human-skin mask and blood-splattered butcher's apron.The fact that some of the things we see in the film were actually done by Gein (human-skin lampshades, human-bone armrests mounted to chairs) made it even more chilling. No doubt one of the most horrific films ever created. The remake is respectable but not quite like the original. **** out of *****",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
330,LBarlane24,Dated at best,5,12 May 2019,"Directed By Tobe Hooper, the film tells the (supposed) story about a group of five young adults who go on a road trip to Texas (as the title makes it clear), only to soon find themselves in a sticky (or should I say deadly) situation, as each and every one of the youths are eventually attacked by a masked killer.The film (supposedly) stars Marilyn Burns as Sally, one of the five youths, and introduces us to Gunnar Hansen as the chainsaw wielding maniac, Leatherface.
I just watched the film last night, and it was my second or third time having seen it. The first time I ever watched it was about seven-and-a-half-years ago. And all I can say it, it did not scare me as much as I wanted it to; and as for the (first two) sequels , they were really no better.I've heard a lot of the mass majority regard this film as a horror masterpiece, so I decided to get it one last viewing. All that being said, I respect this film as a horror, I even respect it as a classic. But does that mean it holds up? To be perfectly honest, not really.Let me continue by saying that the cinematography in this film is absolutely outstanding, and that can also be said for the production design. Everything else about the film is (there I say) incredibly dated. While the film is mildly unsettling in some areas, it contains quite a few boring and unintentionally goofy moments as well.Now, onto the characters ... yeah, about that, the only one out of the five victims with the most (if not, actual) development was the guy in the wheelchair, Franklin. Now, I've read many say that they found his character to be annoying, but that's where I somewhat disagree. I couldn't help but pity him as the other four (including Sally, his sister) virtually disregarded him when arriving to that old cabin. I also admired that one scene with him having a brief conversation with Sally. He technically came off as the smartest one out of the five; and, compared to everyone else, he had the most screen-time. With that said, I virtually couldn't care less about the other three.All in all, this movie is, without a doubt, a cult classic, but that doesn't excuse it from being dated as a '70s exploitation horror-slasher. The film did not technically start the slasher formula (that would go to A Bay of Blood), but it did take said formula to the next level (specifically with the final girl trope), and that's best credit I give to it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Create a bunch of metaphors and expect the audience to buy it.... by trying to glorify violence and make the events of the film out to be based on a real life event when it flat out was not....A bunch of characters no one cares about (the cattle no one cares about).Characters ending up at the cannibals dinner table (again the cattle that's been slaughtered and wound up as someone's dinner).The hot blonde surviving at the end (the cute little calf that gets spared the slaughterhouse).I can't believe trash like this actually gets the green light to be made... I know this film is approaching its 50th birthday in just a few short years but god damn, if I was an actor in this movie looking back on it 50 years later i'd be flat out embarassed that I was ever a part of such an awfully made film.....",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
332,Celluloid_Fiend,"More ""Hype,"" Than Horror!",6,31 October 2019,"This film is often touted as one of the progenitors of the slasher sub-genre of horror films, as well as the magnum opus of writer/director Tobe Hooper. While I certainly can't dispute either of those things, those points also do not mean that this film is everything it is hyped up to be. Nor does it seem worthy of the many sequels that would follow in it's wake.I found many spots in the film, especially within the first half, that simply drag on way too long. Scenes where nothing really happens. By the time we reach the first kill of the film, you are already about 40 minutes into the film (which has a total run time of about 90 minutes). This glacial pacing in the early part of the film, while perhaps trying to build a mood, simply inspired boredom for me.Also, while this film is steeped in much controversy, including being banned in other countries for it's ""graphic content,"" and being known as one of the earliest slasher films, it is extremely light on blood and gore. Many later films of this sub-genre would be much more noted for their bloodiness and ""graphic content."" What Hooper looks to strive for is creating horror through a macabre atmosphere, as the eerie score and odd camera angles and settings would seem to bear out. But these are only effective to a point and some of the strange camera shots quickly become repetitive and owe more to directorial excesses, than to any attempts at psychological horror.Since none of the actors create any characters you really come to care about, nor does the script often give you any clarity on just what is happening and why, the film hampers itself in making you truly care about anything that happens to these people. And when you are trying to scare someone, if you don't make them feel for either the characters or the situation, that is extremely hard, if not impossible, to do. The only scene that was even remotely scary was the chase scene, at just over halfway through the film. The terror of that scene (which was quite long) is visceral, but it alone cannot make up for so much wasted time earlier in the film, nor for the over-use of specialized camera shots, which make the film seem to drag on way too often.Is ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" a macabre film? Yes. Is it a bizarre film? Certainly. Is it even a little bit creepy in some spots? Sure enough. But it is not one of the scariest films ever made, as it often gets billed as. It may be one of the original slashers of cinema history, but later films would do a much better job of defining that sub-genre, which this film may have helped to originate. If you are a fan of this franchise, or a die-hard slasher fanatic, then this is a film you probably should see, if only for the historical significance alone. Everyone else can give it a pass, as there are much better slasher films, which are truly much scarier than this one could ever hope to be. In short, ""don't believe the hype!""",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
333,Ore-Sama,Ah the buzzing of a chainsaw,9,14 October 2006,"I feared the hype going into this film may have disappointed me but it didn't. The atmosphere, the tension, paralleled only by other horror classics like Alien and Halloween. The simplistic plot and characters are easily overlooked for the unrelenting and merciless tension. This film feels so real. Unlike Jason and Freddy, Leatherface is real. He's the guy you see at mental institutions, he's Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, etc.The way he murders and captures people is realistic. He won't just suddenly appear from the corner after falling miles behind. Describing the effect this film had on me is very difficult. This one has to be seen to be believed. Even now I still have the shivers from watching this. Very few films have ever effected me in this way, if any at all. This film is not like Halloween. This film disturbs, and does it in some ways subtle, not to say you have to pay extra close attention, it's just that you won't notice likely at first. On the downside the girl's screaming CAN get a tad annoying and if it fails to scare you then you probably won't find it paticuarly entertaining.Trust me though, you should definitely give this one a chance at least.10/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
334,TheFinalAlias,What REAL art-house horror should be like.,9,23 June 2009,"The Indie film community's head is so far up it's own ass with delusions of grandeur that they actually fail to see, at times, the area where their own films succeed. And is it any wonder? When Tobe Hooper's 1974 opus was released, it quickly became a mainstream hit. I specifically remember it becoming 'The film to sneak into' for kids. This automatically robbed it of any following it had with indie film fans despite being one of their own circuit's films. They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings. A shame they could not see that Hooper had crafted perhaps the ultimate statement on post '60's America, and one that remains unmatched in it's power.The film makes no doubt about what state the country was in: Decay. Everything in the film reeks of death. From the prologue with the corpse 'art'(not as much a stretch considering the kind of art produced in this era), the Dead Armadillo in the film's opening; a Texas national landmark, it would seem, to the dried up 'Ol swimming hole, to the heroine's once-thriving home now populated with spiders and rats. It doesn't take sides, either. The 'Good 'ol ways' represented by the homicidal Sawyer clan as a nightmare parody of the American bible-belt family are obviously the villains, but the 'new' generation, itself dying out since '68, isn't presented as any more desirable. Both are mercilessly ridiculed. Even the heroine survives only by sheer luck. She's not the intelligent, feminist heroine(despite being of the 'free love'generation)that Laurie Strode of 'Halloween' is, she survives because of the killer's(s) incompetence. It's almost as if the film is saying that the ignorant, rebellious youth have emerged scarred from the real world they ran off unprepared for(The doomed protagonists are all jaded ex-hippies), and are all limping back home(Sally does visit her old house as a form of shelter)to the comforting arms of the 'old folks' who warned them; who react violently and vehemently, telling them 'I told you so!', but still give them relief: Death.Speaking of the 'heroes', isn't it bizarre how the heroine's crippled brother Franklyn is treated like a nuisance by them? Even though we don't see it; it's obvious that they have frequently ridiculed him(His reaction in the abandoned house to their laughter best reveals this, as he can't stand to hear their mocking laughter even if it is not directed at him and he knows it). Yet, in contrast to the lead's treatment of the childish invalid Franklyn, the Sawyer family treats the two characters most similar to Franklyn(mentally and physically); Leatherface and Grandpa; as valued kinfolk, they are accommodated and appreciated in their family unit. Although the older brother heaps much verbal abuse on the Hitchhiker & Leatherface, it is no more than your usual stereotypically portrayed hick family on 'Hee-Haw'. They're close-knit, and as Franklyn says after the Hitchhiker slits himself and endures it: 'Gotta admire that"".Add to the fact that Franklyn is the the only character in the film to come close to communicating with, and in a sense, relating to, one of the Sawyers(Who starts up a genial, at first, conversation about knives and killing with the Hitchhiker); and it becomes more disturbing. Almost as if, under different circumstances, Franklyn would occupy the same position as Leatherface(If he could walk)or Grandpa if he were a member of the Sawyer clan, as if the hitchhiker recognizes this. It's also strange considering this take, that Franklyn is the last of the leads to die. I'm not saying Leatherface spared him for last out of mercy(He had just met Franklyn when he kills him), but because they are similar symbolically. Even Hooper has called Leatherface a 'big baby', and that seems to apply to Franklyn as well.Bizarre, the cannibals accept the handicapped(in their own way), and the 'heroes' see the handicapped as a burden, much like how former hippies who were drafted and returned maimed or crippled were rejected by their former friends for 'killin' babies' in 'Nam. Even more strange is that it's Franklyn who inadvertently causes their deaths when he gives them the faulty directions to the swimming hole, as if he's unknowingly getting his revenge.Obviously, I see the film as a social commentary. But I would not simply call it another entry in the cycle of other post '60's downbeat dramas, but a hybrid of that mentality with the 'Old Dark House' genre of years past. Compare the film with Whale's 1932 film of the same name; you'll see what I mean. Even that film's macabre humor and invalid patriarch character are referenced. TCM is an update on that genre with post '60's cynicism. As that stands, it may not be the first slasher film, as it's often called, but the last, and best 'Old Dark House with a homicidal but oddly funny family' type of film ever made.~",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
335,jeffman52001,An excellent horror movie!! A classic.,10,31 October 2005,"""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in my book is a film that is a total classic, the movie will scare you all to death,,lol, no pun intended. Tobe Hooper did a super job directing the movie and the cast made the movie great also. The late Jim Siedow as Drayton Sawyer, Edwin Neal as the Hitchhiker, and Gunnar Hanson as Leatherface. The movie and the character ""Leatherface"" is based on the real life serial killer Ed Gein.Five teenagers are on a drive in Texas, they stop at a graveyard cause they heard some graves have been dug up. Sally Hardesty and her invalid brother, Franklin,have a grandfather buried there and wanted to see if he was dug up, but he was not. They and their friends are driving and pick up a hitchhiker, who was the grave robber, they thought he was alright till he cuts himself, than cuts Franklin, they get rid of him.They get to a gas station, but they don't have any gas,Drayton Sawyer,is the owner of the gas station told the kids the transport won't be her till later on. The teens are on their way to Sally and Frankin's old house. They arrive and have a little fun. Kirk and Pam want to go swimming, they go to a creek,and the creek is dried up. They see a farm house and think they could get some gas from them. Kirk and Pam go to the house. Kirk knocks on the door, and hears a noise, he walks in the house and Leatherface hits him over the head with a little sledgehammer, and drags Kirk's body in the kitchen. Pam is waiting outside and decides to go in and see why Kirk is taking too long, so goes in and goes in a room to see some horrid things, a live chicken in a cage, bones, skeletons everywhere. Pam is horrified and tries to run out of the house and Leatherface catches her and takes her into the kitchen and is hung on a meat hook. Leatherface takes out a chainsaw and begins cutting up Kirk.Jerry goes to look for Kirk and Pam and sees the farm, he goes there, up to the door. Jerry thinks that Kirk and Pam are goofing around, he goes in the house and into the kitchen and hears a noise. The cooler in the kitchen is opened up by Jerry and sees the body of Pam. Leatherface hits Jerry on the head with the hammer and kills him.Later that night, Sally and Frankiln go to look for Jerry, Kirk, and Pam, they run into Leatherface and he kills Franklin with the chainsaw and chases Sally to the farm house and she gets to the gas station only to find Drayton, he gets his truck and ends up tying Sally up and takes her to the house. Sally's night is filled with terror, will she make it out alive, or will she end up like her brother and friends? This movie really does show the terror out there.In the beginning of the movie, the narrator was John Laroquette, who is well known for his roll in the 1980's TV series ""Night Court"".I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 4 for gore.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
336,brainofj72,The Most Horrific Cinematic Experience of All Time,9,27 August 2005,"With all the cheesy slasher movies Hollywood has cranked out over the last twenty or so years, it's easy for the masses to forget a certain gem of terror that was unleashed upon the world in 1974. A brutal, gritty, unrelenting masterpiece that spawned the genre. A film that remains the most horrifying cinematic experience ever made to this day. A film known as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".The film begins with a sequence of brief, unsettling images of a decomposing corpse while a distant, ghostly voice informs us that someone has been making a macabre form of ""art"" out of long-buried human bodies. We are then introduced to a group of happy-go-lucky teens on their way to a remote, run-down mansion. On their way, they pick up a hitchhiker, who, after a rather awkward conversation, proceeds to cut himself and one of the teens. The teens quickly throw him out of their van and continue on their way. Once at the mansion, two of the teens begin to explore out back. They come across a house. And with the quick smack of a hammer to a forehead, the film turns into a non-stop ride of murder, dismemberment, cannibalism, and every form of horror you can imagine.Unlike the sleek, glossy ""horror"" films of today, ""Massacre"" has a gritty documentary feel to it, which just adds to the realism of the terror all the more. Another thing ""Massacre"" does differently than most horror films is how it approaches the violence. Throughout the film, you don't actually see a large amount of it. Don't get me wrong, this film contains some of most horrific, disturbingly violent content ever conveyed through cinema, but the fact that most of it occurs just off camera gives the film something of a surreal feeling, reminiscent of ""Psycho"".From the eerie opening to the rip-roaring last frame, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is an experience unlike any other. It may not be pleasant, I'm not even sure if you could call it entertaining, but it is undeniably horrific and it is something everyone should experience at least once in their lives, whether they like it or not.8.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

338,nmp381,Packed Terror Ride,10,10 June 2001,"Texas Chainsaw Massacre is another movie of the long lines of classics from its decade.

What they don't realize is that a family of cannibalistic psychos live there, and are terrorized one by one by the ""leader"" of the pack, Leatherface.That said, TCM ranks as one of the scariest movies ever. There is almost no soundtrack or budget for the film, which makes it seem extremely real. One scene especially(*spoilers up ahead*) which illustrates that is when one of the characters steps into a room full of bones, animal skins and a grotesque animal. It is absolutely horrifying to say the least. The suspense of the movie moves at a very quick rate, giving you(and the characters) no time to breath. Not much gore, but plenty of scares and thrills the whole way through(similar to ""Psycho"", ""Halloween"" exc..) Acting is standard for this type of film. Also, I found it amazing that the heroine of the film(Sally) made it through that torture inside the house. She had almost everything thrown and used against her(chainsaw, switchblade, broomstick, branches exc..) Not to mention the fact she had to jump through two windows and almost got hit by 2 trucks!!

339,Hysteria28,Classic disturbing Horror,7,22 November 2010,"I had heard that this movie had been banned in many countries outside the States due to it's raw depiction of torture and terror. Upon my viewing 9 years ago I could understand why censor boards in other countries had to adopt a harsh and strict attitude towards the movie. In this present day a movie such as this would not be considered violent or brutal at all due to many laws that have been amended and altered over the past few years. The average movie goers attitudes towards perceiving movies has changed considerably. This can be one reason for why many movies that are disturbing as this are released with only a few minor cuts.Tobe Hooper the director had managed to create a new trend in the horror genre which led to characters like Freddy Kruger and Micheal myers to come on screen. This is one of Hooper's best works to date. Despite the low budget he has managed to make a movie that cuts to the core of the movie watcher's mind. 'The Poltergeist' and 'The Mangler' I consider also to be movies of his that are worth watching too. Unfortunately Hooper's career has been left to nothing but producing franchise movies and giving rights to remakes. He had a lot of potential to sustain a good directing career.I had a terrifying experience the first time I watched the movie. The only other two movies that I feel would match up to the level as this would be 'The last house on the left' and 'The exorcist'. These movies too grind to the nerve. The frightening factor of TCM roots from continuous non stop screaming that the female character of Marilyn Burns evokes. Her display of terror and struggle was very convincing and contributes heavily towards making the movie a cult classic. If her acting was not so realistic maybe the movie would not have been so successful. The movie was shot in a grainy documentary style to give the viewer the feeling of realism. The low production value does not deter the movie from generating so much fear on a small scale. Special mention has to be given to the cinematography department. Many wide angle shots at a slow rate are a delight to watch. This helped to bring a feeling of suspense and was very stylish. The background score which is simple as can be, was suited to the relevant scenes helped create the correct atmosphere. My only complaint with the movie was the lack of face value. Casting some established actors would have made the movie enjoyable to watch.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
340,Shinwa,Overwhelming terror,10,7 November 1998,"A sadly neglected element of the terror film is the sense of identification with the victims. The tendency toward over-subjectification of the killer arguably destroyed the horror film in the 1980's, as with the disastrous Friday the 13th series. No film realized the need to present the threat of violent death as a thing to be feared rather than a thing to be relished more than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This is not a film to watch if you're looking for a good time. There is no real secret to the sense of identification with the victims; they are not fully-fleshed characters any more than necessary. Simply put, the threat of torture and murder presented by the family of maniacs is so overwhelming, so incompatible with subjectification with the killer, that one cannot help but sympathize with the victims (at least, if one is not totally warped). And what the lead character is put through (not to mention the questionably less fortunate other characters) is so grueling, lasts for so long, that the overall experience is one of a nightmare from which the viewer cannot escape. No other film I can think of does this so effectively; the film delves so deeply into latent fears (not only of violent death, but socially based ones as well), that it becomes as close an experience with evil as one can conceivably experience behind the safety of a television screen. Oddly enough, what sticks out in my mind is the field of sunflowers the first victims walk through on their way to the house where their worst fears are realized. Others might consider my comments hyperbole, but I was shaken by this movie long after I viewed it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

342,jaysilentbob37,I'm officially a vegetarian.,10,7 February 2006,"Just kidding. But I'm sure this movie is totally capable of doing that to people. I've never felt more uncomfortable watching a horror movie. Frightening scenes and images (especially images) pile up, and make for a movie that is so horrifying, that it actually can make people vegetarian.The plot is barely there. It's about 5 teenagers, who run out of gas in rural Texas, shortly after a creepy encounter with a crazy hitchhiker. They stop at one of their childhood homes, and go exploring. One by one, they wander into the farmhouse next door, which is home to three psychotic cannibal brothers, who are led by the chainsaw wielding maniac, Leatherface. Soon, only Sally (Marilyn Burns) is left, and is frantically on the run from the family.The title is somewhat misleading. The chainsaw is used, that's for sure. But there are only four deaths, and only one of them is with the chainsaw. Also, this movie has no gory scenes. What you see is Leatherface hit someone with a sledgehammer, and you never hear from them again (one of them is put on a meat hook, ends up in the freezer, and that's it). What Leatherface does to his victims is whatever your gruesome imagination wants it to be. The main actress, Marilyn Burns, is very good in her role. Her expression of fear wasn't accurate. It was REAL. She was actually terrified during the filming. The film's most disturbing scene is when she thinks she's going to be helped by the store clerk, but then she sees the meat that's cooking in the barbecue pit. Her face in that scene is perfect for causing discomfort. And the brothers give good performances. They sure know crazy, and their facial expressions are among the most disturbing images you'll ever see. I recommend this terrifying, sweat-inducing film, and give it 8/10.It is rated R for Intense Sequences of Terror/Violence, and Disturbing Images.

344,ntj-film,The Greatest Horror Movie Ever.,10,6 September 2020,"Since the dawn of time, man has entertained one another by telling chilling tales of the mad and macabre. In the beginning merely illuminated by the flickering lights of a campfire, later the stories of horror was put on to paper and the theater stage as the institution of man grew more sophisticated, through the annals of time.
When the magic of motion pictures first dawned upon us in the early 20th century, that grand tradition naturally continued in this new medium and now, almost a hundred years later, an extensive catalogue of titles have been responsible for generations upon generations of nightmares, chronicled and passed down through the ages to invoke joy and wonderment in the hungry masses of scare crazed fans.
In the 21st century however, one of the ultimate truths in the way of fright flicks is that something changed back in the smoldering summer heat of 1974 (just as it did when George A. Romero created the modernized version of the zombie in 1968). The change? From them on out, all roads traveled in the ways of horror would inevitably lead to Texas.After hearing rumors about grave robbing and ritualistic desecration of the corpses at various rural graveyards in and around Texas, five youths, consisting of Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her invalided brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) accompanied by three of their friends are subsequently en route to examine the condition of their grandfather's resting place and afterwards spend a few days crashing at an old family heirloom - an abandoned farmhouse, that's as desolated as it is sheltered - for a bit of relaxation under the blistering hot summer sun. As the group ventures though the bucolic landscape, they pass a depleted and crumbling old slaughterhouse, where they decide pick up a dense looking hitch-hiker (Edwin Neal) standing at the side of the road, but this benevolent act backfires horribly as the mood turns increasingly sinister, culminating in the ominous stranger attacking the wheelchair bound Franklin and cutting his arm with a filthy straight razor before the group can managed to push him out of the van.
As the party reaches the confides of the old family home, the mood is understandably a bit tense, with Franklin in particular, distressed by the preceding events, getting on everyone's nerves with his excessive whining about the matter.
As the mood starts to settle and the group begins to unwind, the faction soon separate and while some stay at the house to get settled, others turns to exploring the area - an initiative that will prove highly ill-advised as a certain part of the region's residents doesn't take too kindly to strangers. Soon the kids plunge into a seemingly never-ending nightmare as they are attacked by the monstrous Leatherface (Gunner Hansen) and his nefarious family of cannibals who proves that you don't need much in the way of etiquettes or social skills, when equipped with a bloody big chainsaw and a full-size supply of meat hooks.You might wonder why I chose to incorporate the little intro on the history of horror, preceding the synopsis. Well, you see, I was going for that epic feel - a touch of grandeur, if you will, as I not only regard The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the greatest horror film of all time but quite possibly the greatest motion picture ever produced, period!
Just like it pertains to most examples of great filmmaking, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is utterly unique - a movie that completely obliterates genre conventions and transcends the boundaries of its form. I cited Night of the Living Dead (George A. Romero, 1968) earlier, which is the film that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre undoubtedly shears most of its attributes.
Both were conjured up during times of great turmoil, globally as well as within the United States. Both movies also reflects an alarming distrust in authorities and societies' appointed leaders and their escalating lies and deception, while simultaneously operating as a stake through the heart of the American myth concerning the altruistic good guys sporting white hats while forever prevailing against the deficient elements. In these films man as a whole, was the deficient element. Another funny coincidence is that both films have also been added to the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art, thus validating their claim as legitimate, unconventional art. Not bad for a film originally entitled Headcheese.
Co-written by Kim Henkel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, just as Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960) and Deranged (Alan Ormsby, Jeff Gillen, 1974), inspired by the heinous crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, and introduces gritty Texas-atmosphere in a sizzling heat with discomfort, disgust and death along with the now almost mythical chainsaw and one of the most iconic masks in horror cinema history. But the film is not just cruel and horrifying. It's also a kind of social satire (without being funny), which turns and twists 'the American dream' and the gloss image of the perfect American family.
Daniel Pearl's secure sense of eerie cinematography is one of this film's many strengths. Shot on 16mm using a Bolex and Eclair NPR camera, the visuals and the compositions are a work of pure incontrovertible art (you could hang any frame on the wall) and Pearl's handheld, free-wheeling, pseudo-documentary cinema-vérité style with almost panic-like zooms on skulls, bones, rusty birdcages and dilated eyes, is an ideal fit for the frantic and unsettling narrative, palpable throughout the piece. But that doesn't mean that there isn't room for some sly and rather sophisticated set-ups along the way. Check out the scene where Teri McInnis' Pam walks from her previous position by a swing set, towards the ominous looking farmhouse, for further proof of this.
A grainy and nicotine yellow color pattern seems to be all pervading in the scenes depicting daytime activities, capturing the desolated landscape of the lone star state flawlessly, with its desiccated dirt roads and untamed vegetation, whereas nighttime as a fusion of shadowy black and steely blues invokes similar awe and astonishment at the capacity of the film and the people behind it.
The score by Wayne Bell and Hooper himself is another triumph. This experimental soundtrack is reminiscent of twisted uncontrolled metal sounds and squeals, and is highly unorthodox in its chaotic sound design, tailor-made for evoking anguish and discomfort.
Last I want to mention the film's brilliant set-design courtesy of art director Robert A. Burns, which truly act as a benchmark for the genre and has acted as inspiration for every ""Hillbilly Horror"" following.
The acting performances are also incredibly effective. Especially Marilyn Burns and Paul A. Pertain are extremely valuable in bestowing the film with an almost impenetrable sense of tension and despair, throughout its 90 minute of run time. The rest of the fresh faced cast seems to act primarily as fodder, but personally I enjoyed the fact that they are portrayed with an air of naive innocence about them.
But let's face it, you came here for the family and boy do they deliver, as this is quite possible the baddest bunch of hombres ever depicted on film. Edwin Neal is absolutely radiant as the psychotic Hitch-Hiker, attacking each scene with a manic energy befitting a true berserker; he doesn't so much draw you in as pull you violently face to face with his epic performance.
Equally impressive is the character of the cook, the irascibly family patriarch, who is brilliantly brought to life by veteran character actor Jim Siedow. Sadly he passed away in 2003 but left us this immaculate part to enjoy. Leatherface meanwhile is a full-fletched horror-icon, celebrated by all as the true face of the franchise and it's not difficult to see why. Gunner Hansen embodies this monstrosity with all his might and he truly is Leatherface, reducing all others who have subsequently donned the human skin mask to a mere afterthought.
Tobe Hooper's almost apocalyptic landscape is a deserted wasteland of dissolution where vibrant colors and hope for a future is all but desiccated. The lone star state has metamorphosized into a hellish bone yard of dying cattle, rusted gas stations and desecrated cadavers, and now functions as home base for a pack of psychotic killers whose hunt for rations is the standard when it comes to challenging the established American experience in movie terminology.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is without a doubt Tobe Hooper's masterpiece and an utterly flawless motion picture experience and its impact on the unsuspecting viewer, neither can nor will be replicated, ever again. Hooper has never since managed, or even gotten close, to reaching the majestic heights of his debut feature. Much like a young Orson Wells, Hooper hit the ground running, only to gradually run out of steam throughout his subsequent career. Never the less, I have lived this film like few others, through the times of VHS and Laserdiscs up until DVDs and Blu-ray and a viewing of this magnum opus have come to constitute a homecoming. To me, the saw is family!The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has more releases then there exists jokes about pedophilia in the Catholic Church, but for true TCM aficionados there is only one real choice, that being the pricey yet absolutely beautiful Japanese 5-disc box set from DEX Entertainment.
Not only do you get the discs housed in a fantastic digi-pack confined in a sturdy hard cover box but the film's iconographic artwork is gorgeously recreated on the package for maximum effect.
Furthermore you get the film's Japanese lobby cards, two booklets (one of which has a hardback spine) with lots of great pictures, the Japanese movie poster and some sort of certificate.
Disc one is home to the main feature presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and the picture quality is absolutely flawless, the same goes for the audio track available in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0, and mono",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

349,mister_pig,The one... the only... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!,10,16 May 2003,"Let me begin by saying that there are precious few movies that can actually scare the crap out of you, and this is one of them. The tension that this movie generates is overwhelming at times, and if you watch it with someone who's never seen it before, be sure to keep your eye on them. You'll probably notice a look of disbelief on their unsuspecting face.
Anyone who doesn't like being scared will end up being unable to finish this movie. People who have a taste for the brutally bizarre will probably hit play again after the credits roll. In light of all this, I must also say that in some respects, TCM's bark is much worse than it's bite. Being banned in so many countries for so long, and having a title that includes the phrase 'Chainsaw Massacre', has seemingly led many people to believe that there is an undue amount of gore in it. However, there simply isn't. Gore is not where the scares are in this one. The scares come from the absolutely brutal and bizarre scenarios that befall poor Sally Hardesty.In closing, I'd also like to go out on a limb and make the following grandiose statement:  TCM is the greatest horror film of all time! Not bad for Tobe Hoopers' first effort.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
350,fewald139,Utter madness,8,30 October 2019,"At 31, I just watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for the first time despite years of wanting to see it. You see, as a little girl I was obsessed with true crime; by the time I was twelve, I'd read as many books on serial killers and cannibals as I could. Where were my parents, you ask? I have no idea.Regardless, it's well-documented that despite his low kill count (2), Ed Gein's crimes of grave-robbing, corpse mutilation, and craftsmanship of furniture made with human leather and bone struck the populace as so demented that they inspired a whole host of films. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of them. It opens up with some text describing an event by the film's title (a made-up affair for this movie), but Ed Gein's crimes are sprinkled through the film like seasoning on the perfectly cooked human meat. News reports of grave-robbing and corpse mutilations are followed by depictions of butchering people like animals (a possible reference to Gein's dressing a woman like a deer), human leather furniture and masks (hence the birth of Leatherface), and crazy backwards families.The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is more than just an homage to Gein's sickening crimes, of course. After being disappointed repeatedly by watching classic horror movies for the first time after they've been hyped up, this is the first ""classic"" I've actually enjoyed. It manages to create its own identity, adding details and flair to the real-life crimes that inspired it while maintaining most of its realism. The true horror of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre isn't gore (there is very little) or shock value (this is arguable depending on the person, but nothing shocked me here), but the absolute senseless slaughter of people who are more than just common caricatures. Unlike most horror films, the characters here are introduced adequately. They have their flaws, of course, but the viewer doesn't HATE them like in many films. Instead, I quite liked a few of the characters and found myself dreading their senseless deaths. Much like the most horrific true crimes happening daily, sometimes horrible things happen to good people. And when it happens in this film, it happens quickly and without much flair. This isn't a complaint, by the way: I liked that the deaths here happened with no build up, blunt force to the head was often used because it is an easy way to kill something you're preparing to slaughter, and death doesn't tend to be flashy or drawn out in real life. Some of the deaths actually managed to surprise me (particularly the first), because the movie rightly relies on no audio cues or over-dramatic build-up. They just HAPPEN.There are clear parallels between the slaughter of people and the slaughterhouse industry in this film--for good reason. The methods with which Leatherface kills his victims mirror common industry tactics. I researched whether vegetarians were involved in the film and found that director Tobe Hooper confirmed it's ""a film about meat"", though he didn't give up meat until mid-shoot. Stories abound on the internet about people going vegetarian after seeing the film, yet it never preaches to you, just presents the parallels and allows your mind to make the connection on its own. Did I give up meat after watching this film? No, but I haven't eaten meat in twenty years, so I'm not a good subject to test the theory on. Perhaps this is why the film failed to shock me: knowing the crimes of serial killers and the slaughterhouse industry beforehand prepared me for anything. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre never scared me, either, but it does provide undeniable tension as you wait for the inevitable demises of average, everyday people.Here are some final pros and cons for the film: the actors here are surprisingly good for a horror film. Edwin Neal was particularly noteworthy as the ""Hitchhiker"", giving an aptly kooky and memorable performance. Marilyn Burns starts out as just another part of the initial group, but her screams in the latter half of the film are startlingly real and terrifying and will stick in my mind. Contrarily, Paul Partain's portrayal of the wheelchair-bound Franklin is laughable and at times egregious. His character is annoying and immature, and the actor's insistence on over-dramatic wide-eyed stares and throwing tantrums align him more with the crazies than his peers. The film has a grimy feel to it that only adds to its snuff film-esque quality, but there are some sound clips that plague the latter half (at one point, Sally's screams overlap). The last fifteen minutes of the film are absolute chaos. Screams, insane laughter, torture, running, escape, etc. This is all wonderfully handled save for one thing: Marilyn Burns has stunning green eyes, but the 100 zoom-ins on them looking terrified in the span of five minutes were unnecessary and counter-productive; rather than make me dwell in her pain, they annoyed me. Maybe this was to pad the already short run-time? Who knows?Oh--and yeah. What happened to the first truck driver who comes to the rescue at the end? Did he escape? We demand answers!Lastly, if you'd like to visit the famous house from the film itself, you're in luck. It's now known as the Grand Central Cafe and it's located in Kingsland, TX. Look it up for yourself and I'm sure you'll see the building has kept its shape, though it's prettied up for business. And if you visit, I'm sure you'll find the food is local, fresh, and delectable. ;)",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The premise is simple, the story to the point. Five teenagers make their way across Texas one summer day to check on the grave of their grandfather due to recent grave-robbing occurring in the area. Along the way they pick up a hitcher, who, crazed as he is, decides to cut the arm of one of the teens and bails out. Thinking this to be nothing they find themselves now at the abandoned childhood home of their family, which is where the horror begins. Out of gas, alone and scared, Leatherface finally makes his appearance on the one lone surviving hapless heroine. The chase which ensues is awesome, scary and pulse-pounding all the way to its climax.Given the simplicity of the budget the writers and director decided to instead focus on tension, suspense and visuals to aid in frightening the audience. Watching it now I can honestly say its one of the best movies ever made, and as such deserves to be a cult classic as long as movies play a part of our lives.From start to finish I was gripping my seat, near misses and everything else you could want in a horror film, and not that bad of a story line either.10 out of 10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The Texas summer skies are Technicolor blue, the grass is bright green, and blood is red as can be. It presents this world as it is. It's so unnerving because of how normal and real everything looks.

One of these demented cannibals is a chainsaw wielding psychopath named Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), who wears a mask made of human skin!One of the most brilliant films I have ever seen, horror or otherwise. It's perfect in every way. The atmosphere, the tone, the grittiness, and just about every other aspect add to why it's so effective. Flawless film making. What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said countless times before? Aside from being one of the most influential horror films ever made and introducing one of the most iconic villains in movie history, everything here is done extremely well. You can tell that director Tobe Hooper and the others had their stuff well researched and knew what they were doing. The effect this movie had on people when it first came out has yet to be outdone. It feels like a real crime caught on film and the amateurish way it was shot further works to its advantage.When I first watched this film I felt like I was actually there and could feel the pain and misery Sally was going through. Add to that the psychological ride her character endures and how realistically she reacts to what is happening around her. The fear factor is communicated so perfectly in the final twenty minutes. A lot of the actual horror is suggested and you really have to use your imagination, which ups the disturbing factor. Unfortunately most of this generation lacks said imagination and needs everything to be spelled out in front of them and spoon fed, like in the terrible remake which upped the gore and action but completely lacked substance.

It is scary every single time you watch it, and I have seen it dozens of times.  I've even had nightmares from time to time, dreaming that Leatherface is running after me with that chainsaw.  Credit must go to director Tobe Hooper for making such an unforgettable movie with a low budget and minimal blood and gore.  What is amazing is that people continue to contend that the movie is violent and gory beyond belief, even though some of these people have never even seen the film.  It is the extreme suspense we feel before someone is killed that is actually more scary than the killing itself.  The use of music and sound effects is outstanding.  The movie maintains an incredible fever pitch during its final half hour that never lets up for a second.  There are funny moments throughout, many coming from the paraplegic and the hitchhiker.  I think the most memorable character in the film is the hitchhiker because he has more screen time than Leatherface and he contributes much of the film's hilarious dialogue.

If Tobe Hooper had never made any more films after this (wouldn't that have been a shame), I would still be a huge fan of his just because of this film.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
357,ultimatenexus,The Greatest Pro-Vegan Film Ever Made!,7,10 June 2015,"Probably a prime example of 'style over substance.' This movie's got some serious technical skill, even for today. That's not to say it doesn't have substance. A theme seems to be an ironic swap, evidenced further by a character's rant about cattle in a slaughter house early in the film. For the rest of the film, we see people in a sort of slaughter house, and frankly, they're not treated much better than the cattle.Intensity builds from mildly unsettling to outright disturbing. Ever have nightmares where you're watching a horrifying scene unfold before your eyes as if you were an invisible third person, unable to turn away or retreat from the craziness that's going on? That's this movie. It's like a nightmare you can't wake up from.It achieves this with some brilliant camera-work and spends a good portion of the movie setting the tone. It prepares you for what's coming next, while telling you that you'll never truly be prepared for what's coming next. It looks cheaply made (well, I guess it looks that way because it WAS), which doesn't take away from this movie like it takes away from most movies--in fact, it adds to the realism. Everything in this movie, in theory, COULD have occurred back then. I'm not saying it did and we just didn't know about it-- I'm just saying it would have been possible for such a situation to occur. And just sitting back and thinking that all of this could have been possible just makes it even creepier.After reading up some trivia on this movie, I was surprised to find how much of this movie was actually real. No, psychopaths didn't wear masks made of human faces and chase screaming girls in classic 70's jeans with an actual intent to murder them. But the working conditions were terrible. They were filming long hours to save on equipment rental costs during a heatwave in a house full of film crew members with no air conditioning. In Texas. Due to budget restrictions, one guy actually had to lie completely still while they pretended to behead him by holding a running chainsaw three inches from his face. The stench in the farm house got so bad crew members were stepping outside to vomit between shoots. That's what I call dedication! No wonder everyone was hysterical by the time the film wrapped.Aside from its technical execution and genuinely disturbing atmosphere and intensity, the movie itself really isn't anything special. It's a major influence on the slasher genre, and rightfully so, if only because it was the first of a handful of slashers that just happened to introduce many of the genre's classic tropes. Surprisingly, for a movie with this kind of reputation, it's very low in the gore department. Not much is actually seen on screen. A lot is left to your imagination, and for a movie like this, that's definitely something worth bragging about.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

359,Brandon Hall,Great Horror Film,10,13 June 2002,"A masterpiece for director Tobe Hooper. The film deals with a cannibalistic family in the backwoods of Texas who torment people that get in their way. At the beginning of the film we meet the teenage characters, probably most importantly Sally Hardesty and her wheelchair bound brother, Franklin. As in most horror films they are warned by locals not to go to the old house because they're all nuts up there, but as in most horror films they don't listen to what the locals have to say and make their way up there. Now, it wouldn't be a horror movie if they didn't go up there and get murdered-- that's exactly what happens. We meet the backwoods family such as the oldman and the chainsaw using Leatherface. This is a great film with a horror climax, it gets very scary at times and never lets you down. There's always something happening and it's full of suspense and very realistic. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the horror genre, this is a film that is meant to be taken seriously and that's the thought that you should have when you go into watch it.

The editing and direction in this film can get really annoying, there's weird close ups and super fast cuts that were there for really no reason. The reveal at the end of the film all comes together based on elements from the beginning, but it doesn't feel necessary nor does it feel like it mattered. I wish the film could've bettered this aspect. Other than that, there's some really good stuff in the film, especially the last shot.

Here you have a group of buddies who run out of gas somewhere in Texas and who go check out the childhood home of two of them while waiting for the gas station to get refueled. One-by-one, they stumble onto a house where Leatherface proceeds to take care of them.A lot of people praise this film for its technique of not actually showing anything, making it that much more powerful. The thing is this was not due to artistic choice, but rather lack of budget. I'm not at all an advocate of ""more gore is better"" but I can't say I appreciated the demonstration of terror in this movie, which basically consisted in a whole lot of screaming and extreme close-ups of the actors' faces. So if you're looking for actual cool scenes, the remake is the way to go.That being said, Tobe Hooper's film is also more realistic and believable than Marcus Nispel's, from the reason the teens are stranded to Leatherface's house (it actually looks normal from the outside, somewhere you actually would go knock at the door to ask a question). Also the 70s teens in this movie are obviously much better at playing teens from the 70s than Jessica Biel and her buddies (the remake could easily have been set in the present day, you wouldn't know the difference).It's pretty amazing that the same cinematographer worked on both films considering how different they look. Obviously 30 years separate the two films and the remake had a much bigger budget, but still... All in all, while the remake is better looking, cooler and a more pleasant viewing experience (at least for me), the original is more believable and has a better storyline and better characters.I guess it's good for what it is, but I feel it's quite overrated.

On their way back, they stop by their family home. Their neighbors, however, are a family of murderous cannibals who can't resist a free meal.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" doesn't tell a narrative story so much as it depicts a singular event with documentarian verisimilitude. The film expounds a great deal of effort creating an illusion of reality: opening with a dryly narrated title card assuring the audience of the coming events' authenticity, followed by camera flashes illuminating decayed corpses. Character comments, which extend beyond of the immediate socioeconomics of the plot, further grant a sense of realism to the film (such as the hitchhiker's comments about modernized slaughterhouse equipment putting workers out of jobs).For all of its positive qualities, however, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has not aged terribly well. It ultimately comes off as a better ""film"" than a ""horror film."" Despite its violent action and gritty realism, the film just isn't frightening to contemporary audiences (in much the same way that Tourneur's horror films are considered tame). The shocks aren't quite as shocking as they used to be and the suspense is essentially nonexistent. Most of the terror scenes are shot in brightly-lit daytime, often against a background of sunflowers. While this definitely serves the purpose of juxtaposing with the action of the film (in much the same way that having the killers be a close-knit family), it doesn't succeed in eliciting terror in the minds of the audience.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a notably important and influential horror film, one which certainly defined a decade of radical socioeconomic change.

The iconic screeches that are heard at the beginning are used throughout the film, and they are just so off-putting, so blood-curdling that it gives you goosebumps every time you hear it. And there is some factor to the dinner scene that just makes it so unbearable to watch. I believe it's, again, the lack of anything. There isn't much dialogue, music, or coherent sounds. You hear screaming, laughing, and weird human made animal noises. These along with Hooper's PHENOMENAL shots culminate to make a scene that I won't soon forget.

The first Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to create something in a style that is a masterpiece, the cinema « realistic / documentary » style, the creepy atmosphere, set design & performances... all of which created a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience. I had the chance to see the film in theaters in 2017, ans it was really great, even if I had already seen it dozens of times. And I saw it at 12 for the first time (I watched it secretly on Halloween night), and it was very intense and traumatic, my best childhood trauma since Jaws and Scream. Unbelievable, one of the best moments in my film buff life.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
368,Jack Smith - The King Of Horror,The best horror movie ever made,10,31 August 2000,"This legendary exploitation shocker until very recently was totally banned in the UK. So when it came out on video I must admit that I expected it to have lost all of its impact. As it turned out if anything The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has gained even more power to terrify and disturb over the past 25+ years. This film is just 80 minutes of pure terror! While there is very little blood and guts the movie creates such a realistic atmosphere and that is what creates the terror. The film manages to tap into our most deep seated fears of death and then plays upon them without mercy making what little violence there is very hard to watch. The film also succeeds in making you jump out of your seat on more than one occasion and contains the most rivetting chase sequence in the history of cinema. It is hard to see anyone not being scared by this movie and I strongly believe that it is the best horror film that has ever been made. Essential viewing for everyone, just dont let the kiddies see it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
369,callaway76,Damn Disturbing,7,1 August 2003,"Many people agree, one of our biggest fears is clowns. Mine is Rednecks... Ghastly re-creations of your worst Redneck nightmares come to life in this chilling portrayal of inbreeding against God's will. Be afraid!Plot: There is a sadistic cannibalistic inbred family somewhere in Texas (around Ft. Worth). Solution: Avoid Texas!!!When I was young I was told by friends to see this movie and told by parents to avoid it. And now here I am representing IMDb's highest profile, a male, age 26. Seeing as there is a remake of the classic '74 flick in production, I felt I should contact the source. My mama was right, this movie is quite disturbing, not for the faint of heart. Now ranks in my top three horror movies - 'Night of the Living Dead' 'Halloween' included.
I expected cheesy acting and I got inbred family values to extreme, I expected gore, and I got suspense and quick willed slaughters. I expected closure and I got expanded horrors from within Texas. This movie disturbs brothers on death row. Beyond the reach of God we see how humans can go astray.Obviously, we see inspirations for modern thrillers throughout (Blair Witch) but more importantly we see a peak monument in horror film genre, where the villain is not a zombie, or the undead - rather a deranged human being. There is no 'cut & paste' gore violence in this, only aesthetic serial killer violence. With much of the blood shed to be imagined in in-digestible ways. (The body twitching from the first kill is blood-curdling). Must see for murder enthusiast. Not a 'First Date' movie.Bottom Line: Three words draw thoughts of horror and dread in my mind, ""Massacre"" ""Chainsaw"" & ""Texas"". Ed Gein never had it like this. But goddamn if he wouldn't enjoy it a a cent less.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
370,danielnunez-81518,Absolute (Art) Madness,10,1 June 2019,I've heard all about this franchise and have actually seen the 2003 remake and the 2006 prequel (haven't seen the 2003 one in a while though and don't plan on rewatching the 2006 one).You'd think that with the reputation and name of this franchise that this inaugural film would be a blood splatter massacre (no pun intended) with a high body count. That's not at all what you get here. I was extremely enlightened and pleasantly surprised that this was just as much atmospheric and beautiful as it was gritty and maniacal. The cinematography in particular was a highlight and I don't mind the claustrophobic shots of faces (because this is a horror film) and the fast paced editing in parts because they knew exactly what they were going for and nailed it in my opinion. The plot wasn't too ridiculous everything about the final sequence/dinner scene was plausible if you ask me. LOVED IT 10/10Films like these are the reason I love cinema.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
371,valfrae,wtf did I just watch,1,12 June 2020,"I thought i would find it comical since it's a 70s horror movie but it's more wtf is happening than comical. Kinda shocked, it's as bizarre as a movie can be.
It's as if a group of kids made their first ever movie.And yes, all the actors deserved Oscars, especially that lady at the end and the gas station guy. Their freaky expressions earned it",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
372,Stroheim-3,Soylent Green is Made Out of People!!!!!,5,26 August 1999,"After reading Entertainment Weekly's list of the top 25 horror movies, I had to see this movie as it was posted at number 2.  After searching through video store after video store, I found the movie.  After all this, I saw the movie, and I must say, I wasn't too impressed with it.Don't get me wrong, I give it props for being wholly original for its day. On the flip side, we were also forced to endure its bastard children including the Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street movies.The potential greatness of the movie was ruined by its script (or lack thereof).  It's a movie in which nothing really happens.  We're given a great set-up of grave robbers making sculptures out of rotting corpses in the cemetary.  We're given the five kids driving through (a staple of many slasher movies to come), and a great set of locals straight out of Deliverance.  You think: What could go wrong?Well, here's what goes wrong.  The ""scary killer"" is not scary.  He looks and acts like a retarded, middle-aged woman with a chain saw.  It's about as frightening as a 100 ft Stay Puft Marshmellow Man traversing through Manhattan.The next problem is that there is no middle.  Four out of the five kids get killed within fifteen minutes of each other.  At first I thought, ""well maybe this is good because all other slasher-fests drag out all of the killings.""  But at least, the kids demises have an entertainment value. Not here.  It happens too quickly to invoke any fear.  This coupled with the ridiculousness of Leatherface bolsters the stupidity.Third.  The grandfather who looks as if he should, by all rights, be long dead and apparently lives off of the blood of human victims.  Frightening? No.  Funny? No.  Stupid?  Ah, yes.  This cheap, Troma-esque addition makes the film lose credibility.  I could believe that a family of rednecks are killing people just to eat them, just as I could believe Mrs. Vorhees wants revenge on the camp where her son died.  This old guy is the resurrection of the dead that kills many horror franchises.Finally, there is no end to the movie  (Potential SPOILER in case you really care).  Yes, our heroine (I guess) finally escapes.  But then what?  The movie ends with Leatherface flipping out with his chainsaw.  That's it! Does she call the police?  What happens to the redneck family?  Are they still out there?  Does she go back with Morgan Freeman?  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS!!!???  I don't really care if a movie ends with some unanswered questions like Boogie Nights, The Blair Witch Project, or even Casablanca, but at least there is some closure to those movies.  This had nothing.Nevertheless, I still credit this movie for reinventing the horror genre, and for all the crap wrong with it, I would rather watch this any Jason or Freddy movie.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
373,Movieman-133,Disturbing and degrading! A classic.,8,23 July 1999,"Well,  the movie is very gripping from the beginning to the end.   The story focuses on an innocent group of friends that drive and fall upon a human slaughter house run by Leatherface.  The movie has a horrible picture and it seems really cheap but this cheapness in the film made me feel uncomfortable and degrading. This movie's picture makes Halloween look like a fortune.   The murders are not graphic and this movie's is surprisingly bloodless as it's reputed to be(by the smart critics).  This movie is stuck on the idea of being frightened and the quick murders happen without the gory images.  There are five characters so they are not really well developed (unlike Jamie Lee Curtis) and I thought I wouldn't care about the girl in the final chase.  But Burns went through so much with the torture and the overlong chainsaw chase that I really felt for her.  The movie is disturbing and they do a really cool filming with Marilyn Burns eyes. The movie was overall good and much more disturbing(but not as enjoyable) than halloween. However,  the movie is so cheap that it brings you down to it's level, where as Halloween I sat with excitement watching the actions.  I admitely did not enjoy watching the film but i had to give it a good rating because it bothered me like no horror film ever made.

376,afdiazr,Experience it. This will test your taste in movies and your senses,10,15 June 2005,"TCM is not an art film. It's not a character driven film with plausible acting and smart, long lines. It's merely 90 minutes of pure horror and style, and yeah... no blood. ""¿No blood?"", you might say. ""So, ¿how is it scary then?"". Terror is not about how much blood or intestines you put on screen. Peter Jackson's Braindead has a lot of blood and gore and it's a comedy. Terror is about atmosphere and what you know a living nightmare would be like. You could be kidnapped and get strapped in a chair and totally feel terrified, even when your captors won't hit you or cut you. This movie is pure style genius. The gritty look makes you feel this is actually real. Yeah, it has some make up problems, but you won't notice it because you'll be biting your nails in terror and desperation. The moment that meat hook appears on screen, get ready, you're set on your way to watch a classic scene of pure disgust and ¡no blood!

377,znowhite01,Pure horror. 100% pure horror.,10,22 July 2001,"One of the best and most influential horror movies ever made.  One hit wonder Tobe Hooper captured sheer genius on film.  The moment the retarded hitchhiker climbs into the van and then self mutilates himself, this film just grabs you by the balls and refuses to let go.  The suspense is unbearable at times.  I heard that when Hitchcock saw this movie he was taking notes!  The direction is outstanding.  The extreme closeups, the chase scenes and murders are all done with flair and come off realistic without showing any blood and guts.  The constant screaming, crazed laughter and chainsaw buzz fill the soundtrack so well and with such terror that there's no need for any music.  OK so there's no plot, but you won't even care because there's so much action and horror going on, any stabs at character development would just kill the frenetic pace and overall insanity of it all.It's unfortunate that Hooper never directed anything close to the brilliance of this.  Poltergeist had potential, but it's obvious Speilberg got his grubby hands on that one and turned it into a special effects extravaganza for the whole family.  I would have liked to see what that clown and those spirits really would of done if Hooper had control.  Little Carol Anne would have died of fright.4 out of 4 stars",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
378,Saturnfly,A weak horror film.,5,24 May 2010,"I was really disappointed at the end of this movie. I felt as though the director was trying to make a movie, but failed to in an interesting way. None of the characters were interesting, well I do admit the only character I found interesting was the hitchhiker. I loved the way he was portrayed, and the way the actor was confident in his role enough to come out as a genuine loon. The rest of the cast, although they were good actors, the characters were poorly written, we didn't get to know them enough to form a temporary bond with them, therefore the movie fell flat around the 70 minute mark when I realized the director was only trying to fill his film with enough minutes to be classified as a movie. Having let loose the bad foundation this movie has been built over, I can honestly say there are some terrific elements that has been a blueprint for the future horror genre. Not only was the chase scene between Leatherface and Sally terrifying, it was exhausting to watch and exhilarating to experience. This particular scene will be glued to my mind for a while, and for the first time in 10 years I woke up in the middle of the night after watching this movie, due to a nightmare about this one scene. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in my honest opinion, would have done just fine as a short film. It was okay as a full length movie, but the story was a terrible fault of which the horror had to make up for. A great horror movie has not only gore, violence and horror, a great horror movie has a captivating plot and likable characters with some thrills thrown into the blender. This unfortunately, was only half of what makes a great horror film.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
379,Uwontlikemyopinion,Fond Childhood Memories,8,3 April 2018,"At six-years-old, I watched ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and I'm still allured back into watching this film every once in a while.Sally with three of her friends, and her wheelchair bound brother Franklin, travel to her grandfather's grave, but along the way they meet an insane hitchhiker. Problems continue to surmount.This influential film takes no prisoners; it's a sweat-inducing, relentless scream fest that leaves the gruesomeness up to the viewer. It's influences are unmistakeable. The concept (five or more regular individuals get mass murdered by a lethal killer) continues to inspire the horror genre especially slasher movies. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" introduces the audience to the first unstoppable masked killer Leatherface. The opening sound effect is truly spine-tingling (I believe it's the sound of a flash bulb from a camera). Additionally, the scenes inside the farmhouse, where Leatherface and his family lives, are masterpieces of terror and dread. Even though this film is effectively made for a movie in the 1970s, it's still an extreme oddity.An oddity because it's a low quality cult movie that resembles a snuff film. By snuff film, the movie requires a woman to run around screaming her head off for the final third act of the movie. There's minimal characterization, plot and no context. Although ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" suffers by focusing on grisly violence (mostly left up to the viewer's imagination), the film manages to convey palpable terror.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Too much screaming and yelling of ""Jerry!!"" and ""Sally!!"" and not enough story or character development, and to be honest, not enough blood or gore for a scary movie, which could have been forgiven if it had good dialogue and acting, but that was non-existent. Near the end of the movie I was just wishing that the character played by Marilyn Burns would hurry up and die so that I wouldn't have to hear her annoying screams anymore. I also thought that it lacked in atmosphere, which is essential to any horror flick, at least IMHO.Definitely on the bottom of my list of horror movies that I would recommend.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

At this time, other films, such as ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown"" and ""Small Town in Texas"" were depicting Texas as a breeding ground for America's most wanted killers.  The stereotype was not deserved, but killers have to come from somewhere! The film was horrifying and graphic!

But honestly, the acting is horrible, there's too much screaming, so much that it's actually annoying...too many close up shots to the final girl's eyes and teeth. The dinner scene is actually so disturbing and annoying that I don't even care to watch it, and that's the climax of the movie.

The characters are annoying, unlikeable and underdeveloped, and their deaths aren't all that satisfying either (apart from one or two...one reallllllllly isn't bad at all and is one of the best kills in slasher films). The villains are a cool concept but in the end I couldn't tell you how many they are, what their names are (apart from the obvious leatherface) or what made them different. Sequences are often drawn out and repetitive (seriously, there's a moment where someone escapes by throwing themselves out a window TWICE), and overall I wouldn't say this film is worth its classic status.

388,Egg_MacGuffin,The film which you are about to see is not true...but very amazing.,10,9 May 2005,"For all those who think this film was based on a true story, that's false. Hooper's idea was to make a whole family of Ed Gein-like characters, but all the events are completely fictitious.---==BIG SPOILERS AHEAD==--- I'll have to be honest...the first time I saw this movie, I was disappointed. Maybe because it was not what I expected, but each time seeing it since, I have grown to love it twice as much as the last time. I'd personally rank it in my top 5 favorite horror movies, and top 10 favorite films of all time.This movie is a success in many ways. One is that nobody can duplicate it and it's desired effect. This film was made on a tiny budget with totally inexperienced actors and many of the crew as well. But that never stopped it from influencing practically every horror film that came after it.The directing...excellent. Especially when considering what they had to work with and the conditions they were working in. Several beautiful shots, like the under-the-swing tracking shot, and Leatherface pulling Pam into the house from the front porch IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. As you can tell, this movie is made without remorse. Nobody is safe and no place is safe. Not even a beautiful and innocent young girl in the bright Texas sun. Not even a helpless cripple in a wheelchair. Not even the audience.There's a very extended sequence in the final third of the film in which the character Sally is kidnapped and strapped to a chair made from human bones and forced to eat dinner with this completely psychotic family. During this scene, we almost literally see her go insane. And speaking of characters, special mention must be given to Franklin, who is the most believably annoying character I have ever seen. He's also crippled, and confined to a wheelchair. Near the end of the film, he gets attacked by Leatherface and sawed to death. Would ANYBODY have the balls to film a scene like that today? Never.Another thing that I must mention is how Tobe Hooper slowly brings the movie from a seemingly peaceful yet questionably strange setting to one of complete and total insanity...and make it work. You'd think Hooper himself wasn't playing with a full deck. But when watching a movie with the title The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what else would you expect? One thing you wouldn't have guessed is that this movie is essentially free of gore, sex, nudity, and strong profanity. The title is actually very misleading.The movie starts with a decaying body being photographed (along with the most un-nerving sound effect EVER), two other corpses tied to a tombstone, a dead animal on the side of the road, etc. So right from the start, you kind of know what you're in for. But who could have ever expected to see an ending like the one in the movie? The grandfather, who can barely move, is trying to bludgeon Sally to death while the rest of the family watches. Sally escapes and runs away during sunrise while the hitchhiker follows closely from behind, cutting her with a straight razor. Sally reaches a road and the hitchhiker is crushed by a truck in a very brutal scene. Sally, now covered in blood, runs from Leatherface (as does the truckdriver). Sally hops into the back of a pick-up truck and is driven away, laughing with hysterical insanity. And what makes it believable apart from the great acting, is that from the start, she's the least likely character you'd see like that. So before the movie ends, Leatherface is dancing in the middle of the road wearing a suit and tie and twirling his chainsaw around in circles, first thing in the morning. Who the hell thought of that? I'd also like to make special mention of the excellent audio commentary on the DVD (I have the Pioneer special edition with the original cover art, not sure if the commentary is different on subsequent releases). Very informative, especially about the working conditions and how much everyone really suffered, Marylin Burns in particular...jumping off a house, getting cut for real, falling on concrete repeatedly, filthy rag in her mouth, broom stick beatdowns, etc. But the commentary is also very funny, believe it or not.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
389,bbretall-1,A seminal slasher film that gets credit for trendsetting and not much else.,6,30 May 2019,"I never saw this seminal slasher film before and decided to catch it when it was shown at a local art house theater.
I give it a LOT of credit for being a genre defining film setting up tropes we have seen beat into the ground by other movies for over 40 years. As a standalone movie it was not that good, IMO. The acting was poor. The writing was weak (I cannot call it cliche since it really defined what would later be the cliche). This is a movie where a LOT of movies that came after did it better (and a lot just as poorly, without the trendsetting nod).
It was one of the earliest ""Final Girl"" movies, so a trendsetter there.
It set up the trope of ""Hey, don't go into that creepy house uninvited."" Heck, 3 kids get killed because they willingly just walk into Leatherface's house uninvited. I don't think he even committed a crime killing them... this is Texas, can't you kill people who trespass in your house there? I don't think they anticipated the actual method of killing used, but regardless, until he actually chased someone off his property I think he was good with Texas law...
And Marilyn Burns as Sally.... OH MY! What an annoying scream. When she was running (in the dark) from Leatherface SCREAMING continually, all I could think was ""For God's sake, shut the heck up and he'll never find you in the dark"" or alternately ""I hope he catches her and shuts her up!""

393,ashturner-79373,A masterpiece of grindhouse horror!,9,29 January 2019,"Though it establishes the classic horror movie formula of a group of teens driving out into unknown territory and being killed, one of the weaker aspects of this film is its plot, which is no more than what I just described. Here's a film that's really about two groups of characters - four vapid teens who are on a road trip with their cynical wheelchair-bound friend Franklin, and the completely insane Sawyer family.Franklin is the only good protagonist - he's talkative and confident, thus actually likeable, and his use of a wheelchair makes him surprisingly progressive. The Sawyers, on the other hand, are all very charismatic. Gunnar Hansen does an excellent job as Leatherface, who is mentally handicapped, with touches like cowering from his imposing family members or panicking after the murders build up. The hitchhiker, while annoying later in the film, is subtly unnerving as that first scene with him escalates.One of my favourite things about the film, though, is the production. Score is limited to isolated noises like the rumbling of a piano chord or the tapping of a drum, while the soundscape is immensely detailed, full of scuttling, scraping, clattering and rumbling noises - the stinging camera noise is terrifying (though overused a little). It's also a visual masterpiece, showcasing lots of grainy and atmospheric shots of rural and industrial scenery, as well as uncomfortable close-ups of animal carcasses, taxidermy, Sally's eyeball and a spider nest. Heavy sunlight makes the environment warm and oppressive.My other favourite thing is the thematic depth of it all. Most obviously, it treats our human protagonists like meat as they're bashed on the head, hung from hooks, refrigerated and eaten. But there's also the opening narration, followed by forensic photography and news reports, creating the illusion that these are real events - a reaction by the screenwriters to contemporary politics and news in America. Further, the Sawyers' situation represents the dead end of American industrialisation, as technology marches on and leaves behind a stagnating world of unemployment. There's even ritualistic imagery behind the hitchhiker encounter - burning the photo, cutting himself then Franklin.It's admittedly a little slow sometimes, but ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is a descent into madness that's two-thirds shockingly brutal and one-third dementedly funny.9/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This movie was filmed in Texas, and growing up in San Antonio and visiting everywhere around the state, I am in Texas when I see this movie. I have seen farmhouses and weeds and flowers just like the ones in the movie- I have even heard the same drone of summer insects- you can practically feel the heat!-- so I can say it is authentic. :) There is a wonderful view inside an old abandoned farmhouse when the kids first stop. It appears to be a real abandoned house, not a prop. One of the girls mentions she stayed there when she was 8 years old, and talks about her fascination with the zebras on the wallpaper, which is now a dirty grey and peeling off. Franklin mentions in the van his family working in the slaughterhouse, while the girls take a more vegetarian attitude. It's what makes this movie all the more entertaining. All the characters are believable, and likable, except for the bad ones, of course. After they pick up that really weird hitch hiker dude things get weirder and weirder, and they get killed off one by one in very horrible fashion. It's hard to watch, the actors and actresses were flawless. The film is very dated, but this is only because of the clothes and vehicles. Thirty years on, it's now deliciously retro, and has become the stuff of legend. It's just one of those movies that everyone has seen, or at the very least heard about. I have seen all of the sequels and the new remake, and this one is still my favorite. It is the original idea, in all it's boldness. So bold it was banned in several countries for being too graphic. It is very graphic, disturbing, which is why it's such a great movie. Defineately recommended.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
395,The3Extremes,Tobe Hooper - the king,10,8 October 2005,"Never have i seen a film that builds up such an incredible atmosphere and such a chilling finale that scares the socks off 'audition'. TCM is the most eerie, creepy and chilling film ever made! That scene where we first meet Leatherface as he batters Kirk with a hammer, the way it is shot, the way he drags Kirks body up the step and slams the door in our face violently. The way Leatherface grunts and gnaws like a pig. Any horror freak should have already seen this and if you haven't then you're not a horror freak, you're just a freak! The film is about a group of five teenagers who go to spend a week or two in an abandoned house owned by one of the group(the eldest one in a wheelchair)'s father. They are not prepared for the macabre, sadism of the family of cannibals (Leatherface,the Hitch-hiker,the Cook,Grandpa) awaiting them. The screaming finale is so realistic it makes you worry. Don't be a fool and pick up the remake as it is an insult to Tobe Hooper. 10 out of 10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
396,Collins,CLASSIC HORROR AT ITS BEST,8,6 December 1998,"I have to be honest and say right off the bat that I didn't get into this movie from the start.  I was actually rather disappointed until I stepped back and realized what a great achievement this was. Tobe Hooper made a wonderfully real and scary classic out of this movie.  I thought it would be disgusting and graphic from all I heard about it.  I dreaded watching it. Then, after it was over, I was shocked that so many critics had misled me with all that too-graphic-to-be-seen crap.  There's hardly any blood seen in the film which, in my opinion, is a plus.  Still, the sudden and unexpected jolts the film springs on the viewers are well placed. (And get me everytime.)  Anyone who likes to be scared will enjoy this low-budget masterpiece.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

398,ANCHINN,re-union,10,29 December 2005,"I watched this a lot of times, maybe 30 times but still never got tired of it. All in this movie, especially the actors are special. I can remember when I rented this movie about 15years from now, because Spielberg blows about Tobe Hooper on the VHS cover that he is a genius. He's right. Hooper is a genius. He can create such original, one and only EVIL atmosphere. No one can do exactly the same as Hooper. By the way, I think every people will start considering small things about any Movie which you've been watched a lot. Me, about Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I am considering these days that I guess Sally, Franklin and Leather Face brothers must be a neighbor and must be knew each other once even if they are forgotten, because they are living so close. It makes me think. Sudden, I knew why Franklin is handicapped and why their family has HAVE TO move from there a long time ago.... ha ha Sorry, I'm just imagine.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
399,bigboybhatia,Insane and horrifying beyond belief.,9,9 November 2003,"******POSSIBLE SPOILERS ************************I had heard a lot of things about this movie, how scary it was and such.   I had never really gotten around to seeing it until they released the 2003 version (which I haven't seen yet).  I thought the movie could be that brutal, I've sat through countless incarnations of Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street.  Boy was I wrong.I have just watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and it was more horrifying than anything I could have expected.  When people speak of how ""scary"" a movie is, most talk of either the amount of gore present, or the number of jump scares.  This movie has very little of either. However there is a haunting score, and tremendous suspense.  Not to mention the last bit where the heroine Sally (Marilyn Burns) is tortured by the three insane Cannibals (one of which is Leatherface).  That was the most intense 15 minutes or so of film I have ever watched, and the only time I have ever considered fast-forwarding a movie.  I now see they say people left the theatre during the screen of this movie in the 70's.   With the advent of slasher films, the victims are killed instantly, and that is the case with Sally's friends. But repeated hammer blows, broomstick and knife handle beatings are almost never seen nowadays.Marilyn Burns played the part of the heroine so well I'm surprised she didn't go insane after filming.  I have seen Jamie Lee Curtis and a host of other horror heroines over the years, but none equal the performance put on by Ms. Burns.  A note about the level of gore present.  It is low, but I have to qualify that.  Only once do we see a chainsaw cutting flesh.  There are also knife blade cuts which produce blood.  I would say these are no more than what you would see in a Die Hard or Schwarzenegger movie.  The body count is less than an action flick or typical slasher flick. However, there is an extreme amount of torture, and abuse in this movie. Lack of gore does not mean the movie is for everyone.Only watch this movie if you're a horror fan or have a strong stomach. If you don't find this movie disturbing, or I'm you find it amusing, then you should probably check yourself into the nearest psychiatric hospital.9/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
400,wmennisny-617-254276,The Best Of The Best,10,8 November 2015,"I'm going to get right into it - this film is the GOLD STANDARD when it comes to creepy/freaky/scary movies, period. It is the best of it's kind and even after having seen it many times there are still scenes that I have to look away from (meat hooks anyone?). The way it's shot and the dialogue and the actors all come together to create a memorable movie experience. It's the most fun possible why having the hell scared out of you and not through tricks and gore but sheer terror (with a bit of the blackest humor thrown in too). Remakes don't come close. The fact is that it's precisely because of the limited budget that the film has the effect that it does. It's near impossible to duplicate this - when there's too much money thrown at a film it's going to show even whey people try to make it look ""rough"". The original is the real deal, folks, a genuine masterpiece.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
401,Punter_Hunter,"It offers no thrills , chills or horror",4,12 March 2013,"The Texas Chainsaw massacre (1974) - I like the feel of the movie; it seems like documentary, the radio commentary (news) going on, the music give the movie a great start. But the movie overall is not at all thrilling let alone scary. The murder happens so quickly The only thrill (to an extent) one can get is in last 20-30 minutes with only one single person actually giving fight.. Maybe they wanted the leather head to be unconquerable but when he can do it with so much ease it doesn't give the movie enough thrilling moments .The story is nothing. I know most horror doesn't have any story but they have those chilling moments and thrill to keep one hooked it fails on that account for most part of the movie.. Acting wise though over the top I like the actor who played hitchhiker – he appeared complete maniac, insane .. Other characters were neither developed nor did anything to actually speak of. The leather face's first appearance was good and intriguing but overall disappointed with his character as well . here I would like to appreciate the art director he has done credible job though there are some inconsistencies . The scene where the girl is tied up - screaming and her face(eye ball close up as well) close up was being shot again n again to show the terror and scare but it was irritating as it was repeated for a minute or so . Overall It's a below average movie . I would rate the movie 4.5/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
402,TomC-5,A horror classic,9,17 November 1999,"Tobe Hooper's independent classic is one of the finest horror movies ever made. From early on, as the young protagonists find themselves being terrorized by the slaughterhouse geek, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE presents us with a bleak tone of foreboding; we sense that they are fated to meet a violent end. The climactic ending, featuring the cannibal family terrorizing the one survivor who, just barely, gets away, masterfully brings the movie to closure. Throughout, the grainy cinematography and somber tone, along with the imagery of leatherface and his chainsaw, all add to the film's overall effectiveness. One thing about the period of the early 1970s, when this movie was made, which the van scene made me think of was that of youthful, naive student-types stumbling coming upon forces beyond their control. This was also the period in which hitchhiking came to be seen as a high risk behavior. I also think, at the risk of overanalysis, that the film's dark, rural location and depiction of nastily backward country folk suggest a kind of poetic take on the burgeoning political/cultural reactionary direction the U.S.A. was heading toward, i.e., the end of the ""Age of Aquarius.""",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

From the locations of the film to the props and sets to the cast to the grainy quality of the film, almost like a documentary, it just all flows so well.  On repeated viewings of both the entire movie and specific scenes, I am always enchanted.  The DVD of this film is excellent, the restoration of picture and the audio commentary from Tobe Hooper, Gunnar Hansen and David, as well as many of the other features, they're all awesome.  However, the house interior shots on the restored version are a bit dark, they lose the VHS masters quality of weirdness a bit, so check that out if you haven't seen it.

405,dandyc-73537,Factory Farming and Leatherface,10,12 February 2020,"One of the most notorious horror films ever made, and for good reason. But my eyes and brain allowed me to see so much more upon multiple viewings. The first time, I was horrified and disgusted. After my second viewing, a theme developed: this film is about factory farming, the kill-ables are cattle, and the direction is masterful to convey this double narrative; which is imperative for good horror. A few notes to consider for your consideration:Note the background noises, use headphones to pick it up, but it's not really a score. The score is intended to resemble the sounds that an animal would hear in a slaughterhouse, which it nails.Note the focus on the heroine/calf that escaped's eyes, as she is being tortured prior to grandpa's hammer. The eyes of an animal trying to escape, veins popping in darting eyes.Note the conversation with the hitchhiker at the beginning, the ""head cheese"" dialogue. Later we figure out that he might be taking about humans, but the script shows little distinction.Note the search for Jerry and how Franklin calls his name, similar to a howling animal, a scared one.In conclusion, my theory is that this film is about the dangers of consumption, specifically mass quantities of meat. If we treat animals like this family treats humans, we are no better than madmen with chainsaws.This is not political, it's just there in the movie.Number 7 on my top 69.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I was so distracted by the ""victim's"" non-stop screaming, that it took the edge off the movie and made me cheer for the baddies to get her.  Then maybe she'd shut up.Also, what stupid-ass runs away from someone in the dark and repeatedly screams to make sure the bad guy doesn't loose them.Anyway, besides that, I thought the props and look and feel of the movie was excellent.

408,cwkenreich,Scariest movie I've ever watched!,9,30 October 2021,"CAUTION: MATURE CONTENTI just finished this film and I'm absolutely terrified. This makes The Exorcist, The Shining and the Evil Dead feel like nothing! I wasn't expecting much from this film given its age and premise, but wow! I'm still recovering. The plausibility of the story makes it grounded in reality more than any horror film I've ever watched. The horror movie tropes are evident (group of youth in isolation, female survivor) but the execution is beyond thrill, it's pure TERROR! The early deaths are frightening enough with a brief inside look at the inner-workings of the chainsaw-slaughterhouse. But when the Leatherface chase scene begins, you're in for an uninterrupted ride for the next half hour. Especially in the final scenes, the grueling torture the girl undergoes is nightmare fuel. It's not so much the cannibals themselves but rather being witness to the girl screaming in terror and panicking for hours. The ending may have been predictable given the investment put into the girl, but it was no less than a satisfying sigh of relief.Setting aside the rush of emotions, the story seems to be critiquing the mass slaughter of domesticated animals for food (the meat industry). The character Franklin alludes to this similarity early in the film. The plot is meant to immerse us in the brutal life of these animals, revealing that humanity embodies Leatherface from their perspective. The cinematography is overwhelmingly macabre even before the slaughtering begins. The quick edits during the torture scenes zooming in on the eyes deeply conveyed panic and vulnerability.But what really made this the scare of my life was the ACTING! All around the board, the acting was fantastic and made me forget I was watching a movie. Again, the prolonged screaming and panic of the victims was Way, Way too realistic. Even the cannibals all had a Buffalo Bill personality to them.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I was expecting more story, there is essentially non -- there's a cannibalistic family...that's literally the story. They don't explain who Leatherface is, why he wears the ""leather-face"", why he doesn't talk....And should we talk about how it isn't scary!? Not even a single jump scare, which could have been done so easy. Also what the heck was going on with the grandparents. Were they dead or not? I was super confused there. This is for sure a movie I would never re-watch. If I have to listen to Marilyn Burns scream for one more second I'm going to stick a chainsaw in my own ears. Maybe if she would have shut up and stopped screaming the entire movie 1. she would have gotten away the first time and 2. this movie would have been bearable.
I promise I am usually not this cruel or harsh with my movie reviews but I was highly disappointed with this movie.

410,adam_pittavino,Hooper's horror!,10,12 June 2018,"Terrifying. Disturbing. Violent. Those three words symbolize Tobe Hoopers 1974's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, his fearsome horror entry setting the tone for what the 1980's became familiar with, the slasher. Hell awaits a group of young sightseer's as they venture into a remote texan township, the barebones plot revealing a primal, grotesque nature thats instantly identifiable and unsettling. Little is known about the chainsaw weilding maniac that awaits them, and thats what makes the film more alluring. Horror movies have a knack of making the heroes dull and less interesting than their attackers, and Hooper has produced a crude enigma surrounding Leatherface and his hick family of murderous cannibals. The nervous disposition that this movie puts you in isnt to dissimiliar to how the road trippers feel when first enter the fateful house of horrors. From the outside, the homestead looks like any other in the area, but its whats inside thats truly terrifying as we see rooms resembeling an abbotoir. 
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that thrives from experimentation and voyeurism, delivering a style of movie with villians completely devoid from human civilisation. As the victims are slaughtered or tortured one by one, Hooper creates an isolation rarely seen in any horror film before or since.

Phew! What it doesn't have is a bucketful of blood, despite some older reviews mentioning it. Instead it relies upon a feeling of hopelessness, aided by the stifling heat and the unfriendly surroundings, not to mention some really dark humor.Hooper never came close to unleashing the same brand of horror again though he has some good films on his resume like Poltergeist and The Funhouse.For that matter, no movie in the original series or even the remake came even remotely close to matching this one's power.Do yourself a favor and watch this classic!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

In the opening scene when the short synopsis explaining about the ""real events"", that's when you know that this is serious business. Some people say that it is very gory, but it really isn't. You see Leatherface murder people in ways that you would expect to be gory, but there really is no exposure of blood or guts or intestines. It's probably like Psycho: The shower scene was very violent, although you never actually see the knife stab Marion, which makes it gorier in our innermost minds.

421,the dude-3,A Masterpiece of Editing,9,9 February 2000,"There's only one film this can really be compared to and that is the original version of the story of Ed Gein, Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Psycho.""  Much like ""Psycho,"" ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is edited to perfection, providing utmost horror and suspense with little gore and actual violence.  The stories in both movies are amazingly similar, so much that Hooper's version could almost be considered a remake or at least retelling. Just like in ""Psycho,"" characters travel one by one to a place they just shouldn't be.  After one disappears, a few more go to find out what happened and disappear themselves.  Like Norman Bates underwater automobile-graveyard, the deranged family in ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" have their own hidden yard full of vehicles that once belonged to their victims. Also like ""Psycho"" the quick-cut editing and use of music give the film much of its edge.  The main difference between the two films lies in their intent.  While ""Psycho"" shows the hidden horror behind an all-American, normal looking boy, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" deals with a disillusioned family, stuck in the middle of an America that has no use for them anymore and just want a piece of humanity(literally).  Both movies are multi-layered with various interpretations.  Tobe Hooper meant the film to be a commentary on the psycho-schizophrenic Watergate era.  Most people have a hard time seeing it that way, myself included.One parallel that for me is undeniable is that between Leatherface and Mrs. Bates.  Most notably they are both men wearing women's clothes and makeup. Also, the first scene in ""Psycho"" where Mrs. Bates is seen in action as a private detective walks up the stairs towards her room and Leatherface's first onscreen appearance in ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" both gave me two of the biggest frights I've ever had, as the psycho in each film commits with cold, calculated precision an act of utter horror.

423,letrias,What's the point of movies with a point?,10,26 August 2002,"Lets get real, people, there is no good reason for a filmmaker to force some kind of point on someone.  Do you watch films to get lectured for 2 hours, or because you enjoy films?  When you look at a bed of roses, do you try to figure out what they mean?  No, you enjoy them for what they are.  Why should it be any different for any other visual or aural experience?  If you want a lecture, go watch an episode of 7th Heaven.With that said, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is a film without much of a point, and rightfully so.  It is shocking not because of graphic violence, but because how the violence is handled - we are left unaware of the full extent of the murders, forcing us to use that wonderful thing called imagination. These days many films have forgotten that lost art of giving the audience the credit it deserves by allowing the viewer to imagine what may or may not be.  As Fritz Lang once said ""It is best not to show acts of violence on screen because the viewers will imagine the worst"".  ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" had an interesting approach to this method: the violence was implied, sometimes vaguely shown, and its after-affect celebrated in its full and splendid glory.  The result is an unfinished painting, yet enough evidence is provided so that anyone with some imaginative sense can paint in the missing parts.  Of course, it's an unfortunate fact that not all of us are blessed with this gift of imagination, and those poor individuals are unlikely to appreciate what they see here.  So, if you like horror and gore, but lack imagination, please feel free to check out those lame Scream movies, or the 945867987 episodes of Friday The 13th, or EvilDead.

Think about the first Friday the 13th movie, Evil Dead, or more recently Jeepers Creepers.  Jeepers Creepers incorporates pretty much every element, every archetype seen in the Texas Chain Saw Massacre: from collecting your victims' body parts, to wearing them.  Or how about nosy teens insisting on looking where they have no business looking, and then being stalked and murdered.

426,ian_bell,If Carlsberg made horror films . . .,10,5 June 2010,"Apologies for the tag line, but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, quite probably, the best horror film in the world.Forget the script on this one, forget the camper van that's out of petrol, forget even the crazy old man in the opening ten minutes, and just concentrate on the growing sense of menace which Tope Hooper brings to the screen, under the veneer of a blazing hot Texan sky.Van Gogh said orange was the colour of insanity. Well I think the soundtrack to this film is very possibly the SOUND of insanity. The screeches, the claustrophobic wailing, the sense that somebody is doing something nasty just off camera . . . it's almost like being in an abattoir (or what I imagine being in an abattoir is like).This is one of the few films I've seen where you almost feel you can touch the picture, or even smell it. There is something palpable about what is being shown up on the screen. Tobe Hooper manages to convey a sense of realism which has rarely been reached before.When one of the boys opens the screen door of the farm and calls out Hello . . . There is an utter silence. The only thing I think you can hear are the flies. Insects are shown in huge close-up, the hum of wasps sounds fleetingly like a blast of stereo. Even the long dry grass out in the back yard has a faintly eerie look to it as Sally and her friends stop off to look for petrol.To be bluntly honest there is nothing new about the storyline. Five kids lost in a strange place has been a staple of horror for as far back as anyone can remember. What lifts this film above just about every other picture in the genre is the sheer presence of the film.For those reared on a diet of modern-day horror (ie Scream, I know What You Did Last Summer, Cabin Fever etc) do yourselves a favour when you've an hour or so to spare and watch what happened when Tope Hooper and his crew turned up in Texas back in 1974. This is the finest horror I have ever seen. It's got a minimal script and the characterisation may seem sparse to non-existent. It's worth noting though, the performance of Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty. It is hard to portray terror convincingly on screen. Very hard, in fact. Yet Burns at times seems almost to be losing her mind. Was that really acting we were watching, or was she just absolutely s@#* scared at what was happening to her?Such is the visceral power of this film it is not hard to see why Tobe Hooper clearly found it such a hard act to follow. Having seen his Poltergeist film which followed in the 1980s, you can only speculate that his producers reined in the huge talent which was on display here in order to make Poltergesit more acceptable for a family audience.Making films like this must be exhausting. After watching it for the first time on television I was numb for several hours afterwards. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre isn't simply a horror film, it is THE horror film.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
427,poisonrock29,Skip this part,6,18 August 2003,"Well i don't see what's so terrifying about this movie but that's just me. I didn't watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for chills but i did watch it for excitement and it delivers BIG TIME.  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was banned in the UK for 25 years so i expected something really shocking.  It's not, there is very little blood and gore but the idea was shocking.  I mean a maniac running around wielding a chainsaw is shocking but your not going to see any gruesome injuries caused by the chainsaw so if your looking for that, then avoid this one and watch horror movies like The Burning and The Prowler.  There is quite a long dull gap in the middle of this movie with not much happening but the movie itself only lasts for around 75 minutes so it doesn't get that boring.  If The Texas Chainsaw Massacre lasted 120 minutes then it would be hard to stay awake so i'm glad it is a short movie. The finale is very thrilling and turn up the volume on your TV to get the full effect.  The sound of the chainsaw mixed in with the constant screaming of the leading lady is unparalled in any movie and will always be remembered by me.  On the whole The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is better than most other slasher movies even without the blood but for the life of me i can't think why those awful sequels were made.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Earlier this evening I watched Texas Chainsaw 3D 2013. I enjoy these movies. I want to give you my review of the 1974 version when I first saw it. For that time in the 70's I was very young of course. This was a very graphic and horrific film at the time. Even though it was scary to me, and almost too bloody for me to watch I couldn't take my eyes away from the movie. To be honest some of it was disgusting to watch at that time. I think this movie was one of the first of it's kind. You either love or hate a movie like this. There is no in between. Leather face at this time was the most scariest and evil persona to date. So if you like these kinds of movies I recommend watching this one or revisiting it sometime.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
431,alex_moerke,Lives up to the cult!,9,4 February 2020,"I started watching this movie while working out so I only paid like half attention to it at first. But I couldn't help but slowly getting drawn into its gritty atmosphere and soon sat down on the couch being mesmerized and staring at the screen. And I gotta say: Tobe Hooper's original TCM lives up to the cult surrounding it. It's masterfully shot right from the start, the sound design is intensely unnerving. The way camera angles and lighting are used makes it feel not like watching a nightmare, but HAVING a nightmare itself. The mostly really enthusiastic actors do their part, especially the final girl who is acting (and screaming) like her life depends on it. Only reason I subtract one star from my rating is the fact that, of course, plot-wise TCM is very dull - and because the aforementioned non-stop screaming becomes quite annoying after a while.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
432,rmwilliams-18922,Had to put in way too much effort to not zone out,2,26 June 2018,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Right off the bat the acting made me go crazy. Not a single actor in this movie gave an even remotely good performance. 
The first hour of this movie is incredibly boring, and the only reason I didn't die of boredom is because the acting performances were so bad that I almost had to watch attentively because I was in shock of how bad the actors were. I had to keep watching because I couldn't believe my eyes, I had to see if it was actually THAT bad (it was). 
The last 20 minutes is the only reason I did not give this movie 1 star. It was somewhat interesting and it at least grabbed my attention and I didn't have to focus ON focusing like I did for the first hour. 
As a horror movie geek, I was hyped to see this movie because I had never gotten around to seeing it. It makes me wonder if people say a movie is good simply for the fact that it's a ""classic."" This movie just further proves that just because a movie is a classic, does not mean it is good. I am genuinely concerned about how this movie got such high ratings, and it is more proof that I should never ever decide to watch or not watch a movie because of how many stars it got.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
433,Nick_Milligan,A classic film?,6,31 January 2002,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a shocking film and although the special effects may be considered primitive, the subject matter will always remain disturbing and perverse. This film has a reputation, even amongst those who've never seen it. The title itself is emotive and instills an uneasy feeling in those who hear it. Perhaps because it's set in Texas? : ) After watching it, I realised that it's not a particuarly enjoyable film. It's macarbe nature seems completely gratuitous and uncomfortable. The screenplay is painfully simple and the characters are arguably the stupidest in cinema history. (For example, there is a big old house with skeletons hanging off the walls and each kid feels the necessity to step inside and have a look around, one after the other. Franklin, the fat kid in the wheelchair, is so annoying, you literally count down the minutes until he's drawn and quartered.) The last twenty minutes of the movie consists of a girl running from a man with a chainsaw. I seriously question the mental health of anyone who would set out to write and create something so sadistic.
Tobe Hooper is a talented director and it is the direction in this film, which is its saving grace. There are some electrifying shots of the victims eyes in an extreme close up, which captures terror and at the same time brings a frightening reality to movie. Hooper's greatest achievement is arguably 1982's 'Poltergeist', which is one of the few enjoyable films which Steven Speilberg has had his grubby paws on. After this film, Hooper mainly went on to direct TV series, Tele-movies and B-grade horror movies, the best of which, being 'Dark Skies' in 1996, starring the gorgeous Megan Ward.In conclusion, this is not a film that is over-rated nor is it under-rated. It probably won't be as graphic as you're expecting but, after 'The Exorcist' it's one of the most shocking films of all time. It serves a purpose in cinema history as being one of the earliest slasher films, involving a group of teenagers running from a psychopath in a remote area. The characters are all unbearingly dim-witted and when they each meet their grisly end, you find it hard to feel sympathy. It's well directed and if you're a budding director perhaps it's worth seeing. It's also worth seeing if you want something scary and trashy to watch at a slumber party, or if you simply want to be able to boast about seeing it. It's not a film that every movie buff will stomach, however it sits rightfully on its shelf in cinema history.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

It's pure 70s style: 16mm, a lot of zoom and a morbid atmosphere. What I like most is the lack of splatter effects: everything is done thanks to a great use of the camera and the editing. The first double-murder scene is a proof. That's one of my favourite horror sequences of all time. The story is linear, as a real horror movie should be: the most important thing is the style used. The idea of not using music, but just sound effects is great! It's very sad that Hooper has not done a movie like this again!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
437,Micheal_Williams,The longest hour and half in a horror movie experience.,10,30 July 2015,"Jack Torrance + Frankestein = LeatherfaceThe opening alone, with the fading documentary type text that reads as if it was found in old newspaper, makes the terrorizing idea of it being real (it was based on a serial killer, but not chainsaw wielding lunatic and his family). The prologue sets you into the most unique, originally dark slasher of grotesque horror ""in the annals of American history, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In case you were not already tensing yourself in first few minutes for what will be the most raw-meaty chunks you've ever tasted in the petrifying mold your sinking into, it sounds off Polaroid shutters of snippets of your next nightmare of decaying bodies. The first frame of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" I saw at a young age by some forgotten circumstance (I think maybe my uncle had it VHS and got my hands on it); when played, it was in the middle of the movie, when the disabled character in the wheel chair get's chainsawed by Leatherface. It was only a few seconds of one or two frames. The after effect on me was so strong, it took me long enough to watch all the other horror movie monsters, Freddy, Michael Myers, Ghostface, Pinhead. Before my subconscious felt I was ready for a horror fueled, heart pounding experience that this movie is. It still is one of the few guaranteed horrors to still give me goosebumps, with every watch. 5 young, dumb and full of cum college aged friends are on route through the colorful county of Texas to check on a relatives grave sight, after some gruesome ""macabre"" reports, that the bodies were being exhumed and put on display as corpse art. Right after finding the grave was undisturbed, the group pick up a greasy-green hitchhiker who give them a freak-show like they ain't ever seen. When he starts to cut his palm bloody and then lunatically cut the forearm of Franklin, the disabled member of the lot. After the run-in with Charles Manson, that would question anybodies further intention of heading further into this land of madness, they head to their old, abandoned family home. Where their worst nightmare lives just next door. The family of cannibalistic, inbred, crazed killers whom treat outside people like cattle of food and meat. They witness terror in its most animalistic - broken - taboo - tribal - mechanistic - bloodthirsty - fiendishly sweet - rotten flesh of decaying puke - uncensored - ripping - inhuman, form in the Sawyer family. The first few minutes is a slow descend into ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" world, to let the psychology changing motion picture do something that wont ever be achieved again with a talented, mainly lucky capture of a screenplay in the most rough style and actuation with pin point attention to detail & with the help of a screeching, heart stabbing soundtrack; they all create something that can only be done with an endangered horror breed, that seems almost extinct since the 80's with copying, un-original evolved version that seem to never reach it's own style, like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" conveys every phobia imaginable: spiders, sharp noises, blood & guts, death, disability, CHAINSAWS, isolation, being chased, everything.""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" Evil Dead, I Spit on Your Grave; have made the chainsaw the most elegant, terror invoking weapon in horror films. Conclusion; I really need to start watching Tobe Hooper's (the director & co-writer) filmography - all I have seen of his is this and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. I am sure I am missing out on some great films. One of the surest reason this film is great is Marilyn Burns performance in the final act. Where she, at multiple times releases a frighten state of hysteria you only feel when your in a bad dream and the watcher's relation to the film is with her survival, if she dies, so do we. Watching this now, after a long time, I can see how great it is. Easily in the top 10 greatest horror movies ever made. Where Stanley Kubrick's, The Shining's horror is driven by pure genius, Tobe Hooper gives it to you raw, border crossing, angry and your face.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
438,stereoplaysjunk,The Stuff of Nightmares.,9,14 February 2006,"Made more than three decades ago there was uproar when Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released to an unwitting public and brazenly re-wrote horror movie clichés as we know them.Where it wasn't severely cut, it was banned and for the do-gooding moral crusaders who fought against its vulgar corruption of decency and ethical-boundary pushing, their plan backfired, making Texas Chain Saw Massacre one of the most infamous, sought-after and well acclaimed horror films of all time. Still as unsettling today as I'm sure it was back in 1973, Texas Chain Saw Massacre's brilliantly original plot still shines just as boldly, brazenly and bloody as ever. Chain Saw Massacre single-handedly changed horror for a generation, and I can safely say that there's not one film out there that hasn't be influenced by Tobe Hooper's shoe-string masterpiece. It's surprising to know that it was started for little over $60,000 - a task which would be impossible to accomplish in this day and age. This low budget classic has a true gritty quality to it, it's presumably unintentionally grainy filming and shaky camera work, just adds to the white-knuckle tension and its pretty basic sets are perfectly suited to what this film is all about. As most will know this film follows a group of young kids on their way to visit their grandfather's grave. They soon run in to trouble when they pick up a deranged hitchhiker, played awesomely by Edwin Neal and consequently stumble across the original House of 1000 Corpses. What follows it sure to be a delight to any true horror fan and is certainly the stuff of nightmares. The fantastic Gunnar Hansen is superbly suited to the role of Leatherface, and a truly terrifying villain. He's no Freddie Krueger who gets up after being killed, he's a real guy with a real determination and his relentlessness is what makes the film so horrifying. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a brilliant visual feast of all that is right about the horror genre, but perhaps more famously remembered for its audio gross-outs. No doubt the most 'gore-free' horror film which cleverly has you thinking you've just witnessed a bloodbath of flesh and guts. In fact you see barely any blood, but it's fantastic sound FX, just go to show how sound can trigger that all uncomfortable memory deep within you. Which is always more terrifying than anything seen on screen. Also, ultimate praise for possibly the most awkward dinner scene ever put onto film and for its truly unique and brilliant characters that were invented before they became your staple horror movie cast. All in all, Texas Chain Saw Massacre is still the undisputed King of all that is Sick and Disturbing; a little gem that still shines thirty years after is unintentionally well-publicised release and a well renowned story-line that radiates originality, terror and stunning balls-out fear.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
439,mrloughrie,There is no movie like this one.,10,13 December 2015,"This horror classic, or just a masterpiece itself, is the reason chainsaws have the reputation they have today. Even though in the movie only one person is actually killed with a chainsaw. The unrelenting horror of the movie makes it seem like the chainsaw is the main part. Even if this movie was called, ""The Texas Spoon Massacre"" and involved a spoon. It will still be a masterpiece. It was scary in nineteen seventy four. And some scenes from the movie are still disturbing today.Who cares about the rewards this movie got? One win and one nomination? Critics reward to Tobe Hooper and in 2014 it won best selling DVD.

440,resetzero,"""...some damn creepy dudes"".",9,17 May 2017,"The movie that doesn't age. OK, that might not be true, it has aged. Especially the acting. What I like about it though is the simplicity, that lends to an everlasting life. If it had been a gore film, it would've aged a lot faster, because special effects make up of the time was not good.I like how the movie starts really quickly. You're thrown right into the narrative with news coverage, and there is no messing around when it finally comes to seeing the characters for the first time.The 3 and a half antagonists are some damn creepy dudes, each in their own way. I think though, none of the characters are more scary than the grandfather. I know Leatherface is supposed to be this all menacing beast, but those ballerina dance moves he does at the end with his chainsaw, really kill his scariness, because it gives him a life outside of killing. It leaves me wondering, ""what does he do in his spare time?"". The creepiest part of the entire movie for me is the finger suck. When that old grandfather sucks her finger, and you finally realise hes not dead, he just looks f*cked, its a massive shudder moment.The soundscape is this movies biggest winner, and also its biggest flaw. The movie is scary, if just for the ambient tones and stingers alone. A good, dark ambient sound helps set the mood for how you should be feeling. There have been tests done, where playing videogames/watching movies on mute can drastically change the scare factor, compared to with sound. Sound sparks your imagination, because you don't know whats coming, you just know that something is coming. The most scary thing a film maker can ever do, is play with your imagination, because there is nothing more frightening to you than your own imagination. On the other hand, there are a lot of mistakes in the sound. Most notably is the chase scene, following the death of Franklin. When Leatherface is chasing the main girl to the house, and then inside the house, her screams seem to cut and chop all over the place. Its evident that the sound you're hearing, is the sound of that footage. So when they record multiple angles, they use the audio from their respective shot, rather than just using either the audio from one shot, or just an over dubbed scream. Some dialogue scenes also show this, such as when the first person enters the house. He is yelling ""Hello?"", and on one camera cut, the end of one of his ""hello""s gets cut off. But for 1974, you absolutely cannot fault the movie based on that.All around, this movie does well to make you feel like you just need to take a shower afterwards. Its creepy, its loud, its scary, but most importantly, its memorable.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

To me, the slaughterhouse conversation had in the van with the hitchhiker essentially sets the 'moral' ground for all of the following action. That said, TCM literally took my breath away. The setting is so terrifyingly insular and the antagonists so matter-of-fact in their evil doings that you can't help but feel suffocated. There is enough comic relief, too, to keep us afloat in a sea of mindless sadism. In fact, despite the warnings, TCM is not gratuitous. It is simply horrifying.

I went in knowing almost nothing about the film.This film deserves its position at the very top of the horror genre. I was totally entranced and creeped out, this was truly a scary movie. And as I believe Hitchcock stated, you can often terrorize an audience by showing less. This film isn't actually that violent or gory, but the film does an excellent job not showing you things and allowing your mind's imagination to run wild. It's all about pacing and setup here. The very first brutal act is actually barely shown and over in a split second but there is a huge impact.Everything in the film was done so well, from the sinister interiors of the brothers' home, their bizarre family rituals, the look of rural Texas. Compared to modern films, it has a wonderful organic quality.The film, shot on 16MM, looks simply stunning. The level of grittiness is perfect for this type of film.The story starts off slow, but the ""Hitchhiker"" (a wonderful performance that steals the show) gets it going and once we're introduced to Leatherface things really heat up.People were hollering and screaming in the theater. 10/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Yet, Tobe Hooper was intelligent enough not to put fascist stereotypes in it like the sheriff in the 2003 remake. Instead, he preferred to stress down on a group of working class dead-beat, that is probably one key to the critical success of the film , a horror film in the service of social issues, a horror film paying attention to the dark side of the American dream. Cannibalism may, in this line of thought, be interpreted as a means of survival, who knows, maybe it could become ours providing the economic cataclysm keeps on growing ! ""When savage capitalism brings savage measures"" could have been TCM's aka. ""Texas"", this indication of place reveals its importance when compared, for example, with its French translation ; simply ""Chainsaw Massacre"". Indeed, the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is evocative of a crime file, which it is in the film, and maybe is actually, considering Ed Gein really did exist. Whereas the ""Chainsaw Massacre"" in French only suggests a cheap horror film, which it definitely isn't. That is why, I think, the film still suffers from a bad reputation to non-horror fans. They would probably think of it as a good film in general if they had the will to overcome this botchy translation deterrent. Another thing disturbs me when hearing non fans not even wanting to watch or even know it, they all know about Hitchcock and Psycho, but are not even aware of the same source of inspiration. Hitchcock earned his reputation as a renowned director. Tobe Hooper, well, can you know him when your're not a movie-buff yourself ? What would make the history of Norman Bates and his stuffed mother more sacred than that of a poor Texan family feeding on a bunch of rich youths ? In 1995, I was 16 when I first discovered TCM on French television after two decades of censorship. I had seen all of the series of slasher films, but none of them had given me a single true moment of cinema as TCM, quite an impression at a time I was no longer particularly craving for visual sensations. A few years later, I discovered Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left, but even if they contain the same share of realism and classes struggle (plus the presence of a chainsaw), I still don't get to like it. My interest in other horror films has vanished over the years, not in TCM. Maybe because this picture is not only about a killer with a gimmick and an ugly face, maybe it is because it is one of the most constructed of its kind, formally (the documentary point of view) and analytically (the social implications).Simply a masterpiece, fashion and time-proof.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

It actually made me appreciate the remake even more because of what story it added to it and developed further. In the original,the kids travel, the kids die; and what was with that grandpa?!

Everyone's heard the stories about ""the scariest film ever made"" and how many countries had to censor and ban the movie for DECADES. Needless to say, I was incredibly excited (and also scared) to watch this movie.And HOOOOOOO BOY, what a disappointment.This movie was honestly really bad. The main cast of characters were all incredibly boring and one-note, almost as much as the members of Mystery Incorporated. None of them are interesting, none of them are even likeable, and Tobe Hopper thinks that sticking the most annoying one in a wheelchair will make the audience care about him.Also the scares, which I had been told were some of the best in the history of film, were so uninteresting. Sure, Leatherface's first appearance is rather startling, and the speed at which the first encounter ends is honestly really haunting. But after this, he has no impact. Shooting scenes at night so the audience thinks ""oh it'd be really scary if the bad guy showed up right now"" is pointless when the bad guy runs around with an incredibly loud chainsaw, meaning you always know how far away he is.There's also one scene where the main girl runs to a gas station to get help from the owner, only to find out that he too is evil. This is initially a pretty tense scene, but becomes hilarious when he starts hitting her with a broom in what is the most poorly staged attack I have ever seen.And then after everything that happens in the film, it just ends. There's a really disappointing get away scene... and then it's just over.So yeah, needless to say, this horror ""classic"" didn't impress me at all. But if you liked it, all power to you, maybe horror just isn't my thing.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

There are some really great ones out there - Seven Samuri, Gone with the Wind etc. But in the vane of horror films, it ranks with the best. These kids, like most, were out for some fun; being in college in the 60's the old van fit the bill. Gunnar Hansen was all too believable as 'Leather face'. The sets, the stark fear, the madness, the insanity, the fact that it looks like it was made with a home video camera makes it look almost like a documentary.

Instead of watching it with my girlfriend on a friday flick night.Back then in 2011 I wasn't matture enough to understand and appreciate how well put togheter this horror film is and it's crudness.The photography is something that really caught me by surprise this second time, I certainly didn't recall those amazing, shots and pans since the very first title screen, nor did I rembered how well played by the actors this was even though they weren't big names at the time the 5 young actors deliver a great work.The script is as organic as it comes, and it really just feels like a 1974 roadtrip with friends that goes horribly wrong.Besides that, the story it self it's just so relatable that it had me. Tensing my toes in more than one ocation, it is really the best of all Texas Chain Saw Massacre movies as far as I know.Our beloved brutal monster Leather Face it's just absolutley horrifying and whoever says the opposite, has definetly not watch the 1974 take from Tobe Hooper, it's not surprising at all that people found this movie obscene back in the day and a legal storm arrised from it.It is with out a doubt one of the scariest horror films I've seen, and even though it doesn't have the greatest visual effects, practically it has all the main components that make this not only a great slasher movie but a great movie period.1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre, will make you not want to ever knock on a stranger's door ever again.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

For me the most terrifying scene had to be where franklin and sally are looking for their friends and then good old Leatherface comes out and takes care of franklin with the chainsaw. another scene that got to me the first time I watched this was the hitchhiker cutting his hand up. I think the actors did a great job. Gunnar Hansen made a great leather face. Like I said once this is my favorite film of all time.t c m the Texas chain saw(1974). A few other things I like about this movie is. Its a solid horror film. Its 1970's horror which means down and nasty.

Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however, the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.Great Film, its fantastic and remarkable what Tobe Hopper managed to do with such shoestring budget, Very graphic and chilling film, but above all quite realistic and a landmark in bout horror genre and independent movie making.

459,tannisroot-91341,Brilliant Tobe hooper directed and written story of descent into psychedelic cannibal hades. Great cinematography by Daniel pearl asc,10,6 August 2021,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Under the Microscope. By Roman Sokal. (Copyright 1999-2020 Roman Sokal.)
Many events can occur as a result of running out of gasoline whilst being in a strange place. You can find instant help from another driver, or perhaps walk to the nearest gas station and obtain help from there; or...you can find yourself in the most unbelievable of dangerous situations. This happens in the ultra-classic legendary and influential horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. (Perhaps the title should have tipped you off already.)
In 1974, a low budget 16mm film tainted the white screens of movie theatres with an experience that few viewers would ever forget.Essentially they were presented with a highly deliberate and calculated film of which the visual and aural content could only best be described as 'the ultimate nightmare' - the victims in the film probably couldn't believe what was happening to them, but closer examination shows that the events are all very plausible. Those unaware of sparsely populated rural communities do not know that its isolated inhabitants can lead a 'different' way of life than those in major urban centers. In such small communities, one is generally influenced only by their immediate surroundings, with little intervention by objects and concepts such as television or libraries and other things that major cities take for granted. In these conditions one is usually reliant upon one major activity, that of which is the source of maintaining their existence a simpleton 'way of life'.In TCM, the antagonists, the 'family', had based their monetary existence for years and years on the only local 'job' out there - working at a slaughterhouse. If this is the only thing that they were exposed to, then by osmosis they were pre-assimilated into what they did for a living. Unfortunately for the victims, their assailant killed cows for aliving. Being from an isolated environment they lacked the influx of cognitive variables that city dwellers were subjected to. 'Leatherface' knew no different - strange people in his home were like cows, and subsequently were treated like cattle- bashed with a sledgehammer, which is what he did for a living. In a sense, their rural living can be compared to that of an isolated African tribe, only doing what they know and were raised to do in order to survive. It may be savage, but it is perfectly 'normal' to them. An acute degree of underdevelopment exists in these sheltered inhabitants. The concept of identity can be minimalized in such environments - one is left to oneself and does not have a variable of examples by which to base maturity upon. In the case of 'Leatherface', he had not progressed but remained a child. In the confrontation with his much older brother, he reacts like a child, making strange noises, acting nervously.Identity was a problem for 'Leatherface'. Taking true inspiration from Ed Gein, the director envisioned Leatherface to wear masks of other
people's faces (especially of the opposite gender) on his own face. These masks, of course, in the nightmare horror tradition, were human faces skinned from their sources. This concept however extends to the more civilized, as exhibited by Franklin, the wheel-chair bound invalid. His pathetic sense of self-debasing behaviour was depicted by his childish noise-making in order to suggest discontent at times. In turn, he is never taken seriously - the others in the film treat him more as a child, and prey upon his weaknesses. The 'family' hunt animals, and humans prey upon humans. They, and we, are all guilty - one way or another.And that is what TCM plays on - the viewer's malleable perception.Are the events merely coincidental or were they doomed from the start? As calculated as the film is, it still presents an open-interpretation aspect. If you pay attention, you will notice the references toastrological events that were taking place that day, as stated by one of the female victims in the van, reading from her astrology book. Also throughout the film we are shown insert shots of a mysterious hot blazing sun that a character keep looking up at, not to mention bizarre solar flares in the brilliant artsy psychedelic title sequence, which could have some kind of physiological effect upon humans bombarded by its rays. In conjunction with the slaughter-type mentality that the family possessed, TCM also depicts the possibility of some kind of dark 'ritualism' being practiced by the 'family'. And by design of the actor (as verified to mr by the film's cinematographer) Paul Partain, who played Franklin, gets ""jumped into"" by the hitchhiker when he was in his grandfather's vacant house making noises with his mouth whilst tilting his head up...something the hitchhiker did earlier. The burning of the picture of Franklin the invalid by the hitchhiker/family member was indeed bizarre enough to invoke questioning, not to mention him smearing his blood on the side of the van in a symbolic-looking pattern. The shrine of skeletal matter in the farmhouse invokes such theories as well.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre portrays the ultimate dreary middle finger message towards Americanization. It somewhat laughs at the true quest of North American civilization - to 'keep the machine going'. And what is the symbol of such an ideology in this film?Gasoline! All plans the victims had were thwarted by the notion of obtaining the precious fuel. The family's fuel-run generator was the physical perpetrator for the fateful nightmare that took place - they were attracted to it by hearing it purring and whirring just as a pioneer did at the turn of the century by being attracted to glittering gold in a riverbed. One small step of deviance away from the 'norm' and everything can easily fail based on the everyday schematics of relying on technology. TCM may be an extreme portrayal of this idea, but itreally is no different than being in a foreign country with a different mother tongue. We are automatically re-set and must deal with primal instincts in order to get by. For the remaining protagonist, Sally Hardesty, it is survival - to innovate methods on how to sustain her own life. For the family, it is kill.The film seems to accurately channel and extract from the subconscious. There are moments of feeling trapped -as when Sally is in the farmhouse, she has nowhere to hide but upstairs, which is the last place where one wants to be when one is being stalked, as escape is more difficult. One feels safe when 'grounded'. This fear also applies to those who fear flying in aircraft, because if they were in a vehicle that breaks down, they can get out and walk. In an airplane, there is nowhere to go but down - and rather quick. A manipulative element also occurs on two occasions in the film - the 'near getaway'. The narrative in the film boils the viewer's and characters blood intensely. It never lets up. Freedom is hard to come by in TCM. They are teased with it only to be pulled back into hades. And what holds this all together is the subliminal use of radio broadcasts throughout the film in which reporters mention the time, weather, and events. It is a metronome of sorts, we are constantly being made aware of the 'moment'. And in moments of fear, a second are not important, millseconds are.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is considered a monumental high concept art film for its primal fear emissions, its relentless modus
operandi, its violent graphic shocking nature, it's simple yet intellectual approach and its mystery and sociological questions it raises. Not only does it portray a sense of doom, but it also projects a struggle. It enforces the notion that during early tough times, one might have to take large risks to survive. The more one pays attention to a moment, the more one may avoid a situation altogether.Many beacons exist in the film that take the shape of a warning. Thehitchhiker scene alone should have been enough to just keep going. Reading into a situation is like playing chess- I consider it preventative thinking for self-preservation. Watch TCM again. You may be surprised. It rests preserved in New York's Museum Of Modern Art. Its that much of a masterpiece, and, remember, its slightly based on real-life events...some things cannot be made up...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
460,thelegendarywd,The single best and scariest horror film EVER!!!,10,23 June 2003,"A group of teenagers on a road trip... OH BOY!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN... the typical horror movie set up. But wait.... something sets this one apart... IT'S SCARY... to be more precise, IT'S TERRIFYING!!! And I'm not just talking about the horrible 70's clothing and hairstyles. This film is one of the very few films I consider scary. Let me list a few reasons:1) The gritty documentary feel the film has.2) The excellent performances by Edwin Neil (the Hitch-Hiker), Jim Seidow (The Old Man), and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) as the psychos (in a film this low budget and grainy, performances this real feel all the more scary) and Marilyn Burns (Sally) and Paul A. Partain (Franklin) as the victims (we truly believe and feel their fear).3)The atmosphere (the skeleton bone art... the freaky metal door in the farmhouse... Leatherface's mask and demeanor... even the way the sun sets in this film is spooky along with the sound of the farmhouse generator).4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only ""gory"" scene is when Leatherface accidently cuts his thigh with the chainsaw). The scares lie within the performances and atmosphere and pacing.In closing... this is truly the greatest horror film (and one of the greatest films period) ever made. 15 out of 10!!!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
461,TheHig,Mostly Screaming,2,5 June 2003,"If anyone would like to claim that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the greatest horror film ever, you really need your head examined.  This is not scary, just sick.  And when your heroine spends over a third of the film screaming, you don't care whether she survives or not come the end. Anyone stupid enough to draw attention to themselves by yelling at the top of their voices whilst their running away from a madman deserves to be chainsawed.This is not amusing, not well made and not very good.  The principle is scary, but the execution (pardon the pun) sucks.  And besides, I would class a massacre as several thousand dying in a war, not a couple of teenagers dumb enough to knock on the door of a group of country throwbacks in the middle of nowhere.When is she going to shut up?My rating: 2/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
462,captain_bungle,'Cutting Edge' horror,10,14 April 2005,"I was 11 years old. I'd given an older kid 50p to borrow his copy of Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I took it home and put it in the top-loader. It took me a fair while to press down on that chunky silver 'play' button, recollecting the stories I'd heard about the film. Rumours were flying around the school - the filmmakers had gone mad whilst making the film and killed each other - Leatherface was real - it was a documentary and the killings are all real. Chain Saw was a snuff movie. So, I pressed down the hefty button and braced myself for what was to come, eyes peeled, resisting the need to look away as if I were looking at a traffic accident. When the film was over I felt disturbed. I hadn't witnessed real human killings, I hadn't just seen a snuff movie, but Chain Saw had reached deep down inside of me and planted a seed of unease, I felt cold to my very core but I didn't know why. As the years passed my recollections of the film became more and more distorted. Most notably my memories of the killings within the film - bloody, gore-filled scenes. Blood. Lots of blood.The reason I have rambled on about these events is that, until re-watching the film, I appeared to share the same memories as those that had seen it around the same time as me. This is a testament to Chain Saw's masterful construction, a film powered by the age-old technique of suggestion. There is hardly a drop of blood shown within the film, yet people will remember it in bucket-loads. In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).Okay, the story: A mini-bus carrying five teenagers drives through Texas. Pre-emptively they drive past a slaughterhouse as cows await their death. The tone, and their fate, is set, and it is only a matter of time before the teenagers will become meat to a local cannibal family. Their ordeal begins when they enter a sinister old house (don't they always?) and start to snoop around. Before you know it one of the teens, who you're expecting to be the lead, is struck over the head with a mallet by Leatherface (Gunar Hansen), an obese retard with a skin mask. As he falls to the floor, his body twitching, Leatherface closes a sliding metal door and finishes the job where we cannot see it. From here on in it's basically a matter of picking off teens one by one with the use of the mallet, a meat hook and, of course, the chain saw.What is essentially a by-the-numbers plot is raised above par by the style and atmosphere of the film. From bizarre shots of solar flares to the hot, sun soaked imagery of Texas, Chain Saw seems to be sweating horror out of every pore. The locations are macabre beyond belief, in particular a room with hanging animal bones and bone constructed furniture, and the whole film has a hot, musty orange glow about it that almost makes you smell the dead human meat in the cannibal house.The performances are relatively functionary from the cast, although Marilyn Burns puts in a good turn as the tortured 'final girl', making us feel that her life is truly at risk. Even though all she does is scream and plead for her life, she does so with such energy and realism that it is difficult to watch her. Most disturbing of all is a scene where the grandfather of the family, a man so old he can barely move, is given a hammer to deliver a deathblow to her head. The family holds her over a bucket as the old man raises the hammer to strike her, but he is barely able to hold it, let alone hit her with it.Chain Saw is full of images that will horrify and disturb, but unlike many other films that do the same, Chain Saw will leave you breathless with its unrelenting assault on the senses; from the images on display to the ear-shattering sound design that allows Leatherface's saw to intrude your living room and slice at your nerves. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those few horror films that will unnerve you to a degree of unrest because it hits home where it hurts. Its savage, raw power and its total lack of reason give the impression you are watching something you shouldn't be. A bit like the traffic accident I mentioned earlier. In fact, you never really have time to think about what you are seeing until after the film has ended, which leaves an indelible image of a skin-masked madman waving a chain saw around his head in anger.So, if you watched Chain Saw a good few years ago and remember it being a standard slasher flick with lots of gore, revisit it and see just how effective suggestion can be. If you've never seen it - what are you waiting for? This is low-budget film-making at its best and a lot can be gained from repeat viewings. If you can watch it more than once that is",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

A brilliant opening with the corpses set up like a piece of morbid art in a cemetery.Then one is introduced to lead characters involved in the discovery one of the most macabre crimes in the annals of American history. But whom none have a lick of sense from the git go. Sally Hardesty, her invalid brother Franklin, her boyfriend Kirk, and their friends Pam and Jerry.Who would pick up a hitchhiker that resembled greasy nappy haired white trash unless one thought they might score some good weed or something? But this dude does not look like good company. Bad choice number 1.When Franklin meets the hitchhiker's deadly straightedge steel maybe a waiting room visit to a local clinic or hospital is in order to get properly stitched up and get a tetanus shot. And taken the opportunity to put a police report on the culprit. And also refill the gas tank d'oh. Bad choice number 2.In rural areas especially during a national gas crisis of the 70s, wouldn't it be a great idea to refill the tank when the best opportunity arises? Kirk's lament he wished that they had ""stopped back there for gas"" is quite correct. Bad choice number 3.When Franklin asks about his granddaddies place, the cook gives sound advice for Franklin, Jerry, and Kirk to follow especially in gun happy rural Texas. Messing around in old houses is dangerous and liable to get people hurt. And yes, some folks don't like fooling around on their private property and they certainly don't mind showing you. Bad choice number 4.Yes, a lot could have been avoided had these kids used their heads.But despite a whole load of dumb the film has it's brilliant touches like the opening and a creepy villain that has made his home a hellish replica of Dante's Inferno has an affinity for sledgehammers and chainsaws and wants to eat you and wear your face.If anything Karma rules in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre just like Pam's horoscope readings.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
467,friskysman,"Hasn't aged well, evidently",4,19 April 2003,"APOILERS ABOUNDSaw this film for the first time last night and I was dissapointed. We start off with five terrible actors. None of these kids make you like them. Wheelchair boy is the biggest whiner I've ever seen in my life. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when he starting sticking his tongue out and spitting at the ceiling for an extended period of time. That was pathetic. None of the other actors are any better. Once they start getting killed off, you don't really care. In fact, I was rooting for Leatherface to put them out of their misery. And therein lies problem number two: this is one of the slowest-moving films I've seen in a long time. We wait forever for anything of any value to happen. So many scenes and specific shots spend a prolonged period of time focusing on something that doesn't matter. It makes for a very frustrating experience waiting for the first victim. When it does come, the three follow so quickly that you don't really have much time to appreciate what just happened. Maybe the best scene of the movie is when one of the chicks is hanging on a hook watching her boyfriend get sawed into pieces. But even that isn't all that great. Before too long, all but one of the teens is dead and she spends, what, about half an hour running around in circles while some fatso with a chainsaw chases her. And this is supposed to be scary or entertaining? I think not. All the screaming and not watching where you're going just got on my nerves. We get to see Leatherface's family and next to no time is spent on them. Why are they so screwed up? What role has the father (or grandfather, for that matter) played in making the two boys the way they are? There are subtle hints but nothing conclusive. Once the chick finally escapes their clutches, we come to maybe the most retarded part of the entire movie. A truck runs over one brother, Leatherface then chases chick and truck driver around the semi with chainsaw wailing, chick jumps in the back of a passing pickup, and Leatherface flails his weapon around, evidently in anguish that the chick escaped. We never see who the driver of the pickup is, we never see what happens to the truck driver, the movie just ends with Leatherface whipping that chainsaw around in the morning sun. A neat ending might have found the pickup the chick jumped into belonging to....oh my goodness, Leatherface's father!! That's what I thought when I first saw the truck. But instead it just kind of ends. We don't really know what to think. I mean, what was the point of this movie? It wasn't scary, we didn't care when the teens got killed because they were all whiny, spoiled brats, we didn't care about Leatherface and his family because we really learn nothing about them...it's an exercise in the pointless, if you ask me.Many consider this a classic but I consider it trash. Perhaps it was more disturbing back in the days of its original release on the big screen but today it does nothing for me.

468,Our_Feature_Presentation,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: First you'll see it; then you'll talk about it.,10,17 January 2014,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). This movie is apparently based off a true story, I'm going to say it right now it's not based off a true story, however it is based of real life events of serial killer Ed Gein he also inspired Silence of the Lambs and Psycho (you can look up his crimes if you want but a word of warning they are incredibly disturbing). To start off this movie is set in a weird documentary like style of filming, I really like this because it makes it feel very real. The movie's performances from the Sawyer family, they're all incredibly crazy and the actors did a great job of showing off the insanity and of course we have Leatherface the most disturbing movie serial killer for the fact that he wares human skin as masks and that his family eats their victims. Gunnar Hansen does a great job portraying Leatherface and fun fact: Gunnar came up with the idea that Leatherface should be retarded. For a low budget grindhouse movie (cheap horror movies from the 70s using gore as their main selling point) the cinematography is great, all the interesting shots are top notch. The movie is also just so disturbingly frighting, the whole entire Sawyer house is filled with the dead skulls, bones, and skins of dead humans (very similar to the Ed Gein crimes) all of it makes you just very disturbed what also helps for the disturbing atmosphere with the cast and other things. Last thing to touch up on the movie has one of the most thrilling climaxes I've seen in any movie EVER! The last 15 minutes just never let up stuff keeps getting thrown at you, its just great! Final thoughts are that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre deserves the title of most disturbing movie ever made, it has great cinematography, acting, and atmosphere all lead by the amazing direction of Tobe Hooper, I will give Texas Chainsaw Massacre a 9.7 out of 10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

From the moment the scroll came down narrating the chilling beginning of the tale, we looked at each other like 'What have we gotten ourselves into'.Me being a horror fan and haven't seen anything really scary in years, I was at the edge of my seat watching this thing. It was that disturbing. Everything from the eery sounds and the deserted Texas environment set the tone for this morbid tale. And from the moment when Leatherface makes his great entrance, the action never stops. Every scene got more and more intense until I couldn't wait for it to be over.Surprisingly, this movie is not very gory and I don't remember much blood at all, but the entire movie plays like a very, long nightmare.A true classic, it was scarier than anything I'd seen in years and shows that you don't need high-tech special effects to achieve true horror.Rent this one today and turn off all the lights!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

476,notarepublican,A Classic...,9,21 October 2004,"The first time I caught this film, it was actually playing on TV one Halloween weekend in Southern California, probably sometime in the late 80s, early 90s. I was shocked, as I never anticipated I would be able to watch the film as it rarely played anywhere. The title alone was enough to initially keep me away as I couldn't imagine anything as gruesome as a killer wielding a chainsaw against his unsuspecting victims. What surprised me most was the realism added by the grainy footage and the quasi-Method performances. I should note that at this time I still clung to the belief that this film was in fact based on a true story (a belief to which many who watched it still adhere).This film has everything that was right about American horror cinema in the 1970s. Marilyn Burns is absolutely brilliant, I don't think I've ever seen a female protagonist in this or any film since that conveyed her sense of absolute terror and dread. Before the horror cliché of the empowered female victim became widespread, Burns plays an infinitely more realistic variant, fighting and running not so much to defeat Leatherface and his kin as to simply escape with her life. And I can't remember any scene in any film as dreadful as the one in which the family assists Grandpa in attempting to brain her. That so little actual graphic violence is ever actually depicted speaks volumes of the films successfully twisted mood and direction.Having lived in Texas for some time now, there is an added dimension of realism. Some isolated highways in this state (of which there are several) have several houses and service stations that resemble the ones featured in this movie. In particular, the drive between Houston and Austin via the 21 and 290 and the drive from Waco to Houston via the 6 and 290 are all too eerily familiar. Having made that drive many a night, I always made certain I had enough gas to drive through without stopping.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I guess you could classify this film as a ""slasher"" flick however, unlike so many other ""slasher"" films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has top notch acting. It also has a feel of believability to it that is usually hard to pull off. Every character, large and small, gives a great acting performance. The movie really is shocking. Even 30 years after it's release, it still shocks most people. I can only imagine the shock and terror that this movie created when it first came out! Besides the good story, great acting, and shock value of this classic, this movie is also important because this movie introduces horror fans to one of the most notorious bad guys ever, Leatherface!!

478,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn...and a little chainsaw,10,6 August 2017,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is all about the evil that lurks. The weird house deep down off the Texas mainroads, or the odd looks from a strange local at the barbecue gas station unearthed. It is a certain energy of irreconcilable insanity and feral madness at the very core of being an animal. The characters don't matter, and this movie is all about the death. ""Who will survive and what will become of them?"" The madness of the killers have no order, yet they have a sense of regularity and chilling animalism to their killing. Rape would be easy, rape would be a normal human tendency. But they do not do this, as they are complete animals absorbed in the killing and the meat itself. This family, absorbed in the madness of their Texas isolation, has made it so killing is simply an order of business: there is a butcher, head of the house, a businessman and a scout/helper. However, due to their environment, all are incredibly stupid, a part of what lets her get away at the end. The fact that this movie was marketed as a true story (and people believed it) further cements the reality of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - a reality simply composed of killing.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

It took me a second to process the way this film ended...The plot isn't complex, but it works fantastically for the film. The cinematography is top notch; this is peak low-budget horror, that gets scares without unnecessary gore and torture. The acting is fantastic as well, with main characters Sally and Leatherface being highlights. We get so much character out of so little with these two! The special effects are amazing too- again, this film is a great example of getting a lot out of a little. I highly recommend this great classic!To address the most popular negative review, which frustrated me a bit to read... Yes, there's a lot of noise in the final act of the film. But what did you expect? This is a film about a man who violently murders people with an *actual* chainsaw. If you went through what Sally did in this film, are you telling me you wouldn't be screaming too? Furthermore, just because a chainsaw can't break a door on the first go doesn't mean it won't break it on the second. Be charitable. That's almost definitely what the director was going for.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
480,starry-2,Legendary psychedelic relentless influential scariest horror art film .,10,21 October 2019,"Many events can occur as a result of running out of gasoline whilst being in a strange place. You can find instant help from another driver, or perhaps walk to the nearest gas station and obtain help from there; or...you can find yourself in the most unbelievable of dangerous situations. This happens in the ultra-classic legendary and influential horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. (Perhaps the title should have tipped you off already.)
In 1974, a low budget 16mm film tainted the white screens of movie theatres with an experience that few viewers would ever forget. Essentially they were presented with a highly deliberate and calculated film of which the visual and aural content could only best be described as 'the ultimate nightmare' - the victims in the film probably couldn't believe what was happening to them, but closer examination shows that the events are all very plausible. Those unaware of sparsely populated rural communities do not know that its isolated inhabitants can lead a 'different' way of life than those in major urban centers. In such small communities, one is generally influenced only by their immediate surroundings, with little intervention by objects and concepts such as television or libraries and other things that major cities take for granted. In these conditions one is usually reliant upon one major activity, that of which is the source of maintaining their existence a simpleton 'way of life'.
In TCM, the antagonists, the 'family', had based their monetary existence for years and years on the only local 'job' out there - working at a slaughterhouse. If this is the only thing that they were exposed to, then by osmosis they were pre-assimilated into what they did for a living. Unfortunately for the victims, their assailant killed cows for a living. Being from an isolated environment they lacked the influx of cognitive variables that city dwellers were subjected to. 'Leatherface' knew no different - strange people in his home were like cows, and subsequently were treated like cattle- bashed with a sledgehammer, which is what he did for a living. In a sense, their rural living can be compared to that of an isolated African tribe, only doing what they know and were raised to do in order to survive. It may be savage, but it is perfectly 'normal' to them. An acute degree of underdevelopment exists in these sheltered inhabitants. The concept of identity can be minimalized in such environments - one is left to oneself and does not have a variable of examples by which to base maturity upon. In the case of 'Leatherface', he had not progressed but remained a child. In the confrontation with his much older brother, he reacts like a child, making strange noises, acting nervously.
Identity was a problem for 'Leatherface'. Taking true inspiration from Ed Gein, the director envisioned Leatherface to wear masks of other people's faces (especially of the opposite gender) on his own face. These masks, of course, in the nightmare horror tradition, were human faces skinned from their sources. This concept however extends to the more civilized, as exhibited by Franklin, the wheel-chair bound invalid. His pathetic sense of self-debasing behaviour was depicted by his childish noise-making in order to suggest discontent at times. In turn, he is never taken seriously - the others in the film treat him more as a child, and prey upon his weaknesses. The 'family' hunt animals, and humans prey upon humans. They, and we, are all guilty - one way or another.
And that is what TCM plays on - the viewer's malleable perception. Are the events merely coincidental or were they doomed from the start? As calculated as the film is, it still presents an open-interpretation aspect. If you pay attention, you will notice the references to astrological events that were taking place that day, as stated by one of the female victims in the van, reading from her astrology book. Also throughout the film we are shown insert shots of a mysterious hot blazing sun that a character keep looking up at, not to mention bizarre solar flares in the brilliant artsy psychedelic title sequence, which could have some kind of physiological effect upon humans bombarded by its rays. In conjunction with the slaughter-type mentality that the family possessed, TCM also depicts the possibility of some kind of dark 'ritualism' being practiced by the 'family'. The burning of the picture of Franklin the invalid by the hitchhiker/family member was indeed bizarre enough to invoke questioning, not to mention him smearing his blood on the side of the van in a symbolic-looking pattern. The shrine of skeletal matter in the farmhouse invokes such theories as well.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre portrays the ultimate dreary middle finger 'fuck you' message towards Americanization. It somewhat laughs at the true quest of North American civilization - to 'keep the machine going'. And what is the symbol of such an ideology in this film? Gasoline! All plans the victims had were thwarted by the notion of obtaining the precious fuel. The family's fuel-run generator was the physical perpetrator for the fateful nightmare that took place - they were attracted to it by hearing it purring and whirring just as a pioneer did at the turn of the century by being attracted to glittering gold in a riverbed. One small step of deviance away from the 'norm' and everything can easily fail based on the everyday schematics of relying on technology. TCM may be an extreme portrayal of this idea, but it really is no different than being in a foreign country with a different mother tongue. We are automatically re-set and must deal with primal instincts in order to get by. For the remaining protagonist, Sally Hardesty, it is survival - to innovate methods on how to sustain her own life. For the family, it is kill.
The film seems to accurately channel and extract from the subconscious. There are moments of feeling trapped -as when Sally is in the farmhouse, she has nowhere to hide but upstairs, which is the last place where one wants to be when one is being stalked, as escape is more difficult. One feels safe when 'grounded'. This fear also applies to those who fear flying in aircraft, because if they were in a vehicle that breaks down, they can get out and walk. In an airplane, there is nowhere to go but down - and rather quick. A manipulative element also occurs on two occasions in the film - the 'near getaway'. The narrative in the film boils the viewer's and characters blood intensely. It never lets up. Freedom is hard to come by in TCM. They are teased with it only to be pulled back into hades. And what holds this all together is the subliminal use of radio broadcasts throughout the film in which reporters mention the time, weather, and events. It is a metronome of sorts, we are constantly being made aware of the 'moment'. And in moments of fear, a second are not important, millseconds are.
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is considered a monumental high concept art film for its primal fear emissions, its relentless modus operandi, its violent graphic shocking nature, it's simple yet intellectual approach and its mystery and sociological questions it raises.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

But it does have some extremely good moments: Sally being pulled into the house, the swinging chainsaw at the end, etc, etc, etc.  The overall atmosphere of the movie is great, and what is really (I think) the biggest achievement of the film is that many of the most frightening sequences occur in the middle of the day--not the dead of night.

483,Robbie-21,All the remakes and imitators are just swimming in its wake...,10,10 November 2003,"With the recent box-office success achieved by the latest remake of 1974's `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' it's worth looking back at Tobe Hooper's original horror classic.	The movie tells a fairly simple tale at heart. A group of five teenagers driving through rural Texas happen upon a deranged, cannibalistic family. Psychological terror and chainsaws ensue.	Yet despite this simplicity, what is it about `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' that continues to succeed so with its audience? Outside of one memorial scene involving a meet hook; the movie is not particularly gory by today's standards. The film's characters and actual scares are not that remarkable.	The power of `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' lies in its atmosphere and in what H.P. Lovecraft called `the oldest and strongest kind of fear': the fear of the unknown. The later of these two staples of great horror is often cast aside in modern horror movies-especially in those churned out by the great Hollywood engine. Instead, every mystery must be explained away, every mask ultimately pulled from a monster's face, and not a moment of exposition is spared. It is interesting to note that the filmmakers behind the latest `Chainsaw' film chose to implement all three of these stylistic vices in their remake.	In the original, the feeling of dread and mounting paranoia creeps over the viewer in slow but steady waves. The first scene in the film depicts a desecrated grave with a voiceover of radio newscast, immediately followed by an opening credits sequence set against a backdrop of roaring solar flares. This, along with some idle astrological chatter on the part of one of the teenagers early on, leads to a feeling of cosmic disarray in the lonely Texas hills they traverse.	Questions about the villain's mask or the field of cars under camouflage netting are left for the viewer to answer on his or her own. At worst, in the loss of any acceptable answer, they are forced to ponder that terrible and limitless gulf of the imagination: the unknown.	In it's later stages, the film becomes a cacophonous world of throat-peeling screaming, blood-shot eyes, laughter, and grinding machinery. One is forced to recall the solar flares in the film's opening credits. In the climax of famous dinner scene, there is a feeling of cosmic forces pressing in on reality and warping it into some crude mockery of order, as if the world were but a TV or radio signal distorted into madness by flares on the surface of the sun.         In the 29 years since `The Texas chainsaw Massacre' hit theaters, there have been countless imitators and four additional films in the franchise, three of them remakes. Yet as loved and influential as the original classic has been, many who would seek to emulate its vision seem to overlook its true strengths.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

And what a great ending it is!!  The film ends out with Marilyn Burns (Sally) screaming and laughing her head off as she is taken away from the saw-wielding maniac in the back of the pick-up.  The scariest scene is when Leatherface comes out of the darkness in the woods and saws up Sally's invalid brother. And even though nobody REALLY knows who Marilyn Burns is, I would rate her scream about a 15 out of 10.  She screamed louder than Jamie Lee Curtis and made it sound far more relentless. Overall this movie is extremely disturbing and at the same time classical.   It deserves far more credit than it gets and that is only because it is almost too close to home for most of its viewers.

486,Postal_Dude_Paradise_AZ,The best horror movie of all times.,10,18 January 2009,"The Texas chainsaw massacre is, in my opinion, the best horror movie ever and I'd like to see if I can tell why in few words and a foreign language. What did Tobe Hooper do to achieve such a perfect movie it's what i often wonder. I'm sure the realistic look the film has it's the base of it all, the photography is truly natural, no lights are positioned to give an image of threat nor there are creepy sound-tracks warning you that something bad is going to happen. The day, afternoon and night are not stormy, there are not eerie lightning , the house of the Sawyer family it's quite a regular country house ,of course inside they already redecorated it whit them particular taste, but that's totally believable because it is the doing of mad men. In fact there is a reason on why the house decoration and the character of Leather-face strike as totally original and believable and that is because they where conceived by maybe one of the most deranged man of all times, the psycho supreme, the Plainfield Wisconsin butcher, Mr. Ed Gein. For those unfamiliar whit the name he was the famous serial killer whose ""work"" inspired Robert Bloch writer of the novel ""Psycho"" and Tomas Harris creator of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy ""Red Dragon"" ""Silence of the lambs"" and of course ""Hannibal"". Yes ,one man alone. So even the most horrible facts of the movie are based on true events. Plus the actors that played the young victims did an outstanding job in the movie. The academy owes actress Marilyn Burns an Oscar for her performance, she screams and cry in such a way that the horror she is feeling is contagious. She makes you feel the madness she witness whit those screams, she and the other victims where surely a big part in making the movie as realistic as possible. The movie in resume was filmed in a way that showed pretty much how would it look if any of us had the dubious honor of being invited at dinner by the Sawyer family. The unreal it's a factor that may seem ideal to help a movie being scary but it has to be carefully dosed or the thing would seem unlikely to actually happen. That is something that Hooper knew by instinct. He mastered those limits. Well i think it's enough since i am having a headache trying to express my feelings in a language i do not know to well, so I'll try not to give you one by reading more of this pour English.

The feelings of anxiety, curiosity, horror, empathy, and outright terror are extremely strong typically with first-time viewers.  --and while the film can be a bit gross at times, it does not use much gore.  Rather, it relies on the actual horror-aspects of multiple situations. (i.e., we get to see Leatherface impale a perfectly-healthy girl on a meathook-- but it doesn't stop there-- oh, no.  Between her screams of agony behind clenched eyes-- her only reward for opening her eyes while enduring that pain is watching this enormous madman chopping-up her boyfriend's corpse-- and realizing that she is next.) All-in-all, the memorable quality behind TCM is its ability to chill one to the bone with the horrible situations.  (and the remarkable facial-acting by Marilyn Burns (Sally Hardesty) is so believable that one tends to forget they're watching a movie, and are living this madness along with her.)This movie far surpasses the sequels-- which, to me, didn't even seem to care about the importance of the story to the people who loved it.  I, personally, wanted to see what had happened to Sally Hardesty in TCM 2-- and have her heavily involved in the story line.  But instead of following with a plausible story (like the original)-- TCM 2, 3, & 4 went with humor factors, stupid plot lines, and bad acting.TCM was Tobe Hooper's ""baby"".

As they split up and look for a house that might have some fuel, they meet the cannibalistic villain: Leather-Face and terror and unfathomable fear ensues from there on out!There is nothing more disturbing about this modern horror classic than what these teens experienced during the young stage of their lives. They were hit in the skull with mallets, impaled on meathooks, hacked up with a chainsaw, stuffed alive into refrigerators, cooked up for dinner, and saw the most horrifying things, ever the would see in their entire lives! And the sadest part is: they all were only around 17 to 18 years old!!!!This is a movie that is often misunderstood and should be taken more seriously. There is absolutly nothing more tragic and horrific than what these kids went through. Sure, for the first 30 to 45 minutes of the movie, they babble about nothing, but so what?

498,Daly_Reviews,It is masterful and genre defining but not the most enjoyable watch.,7,24 February 2017,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the story of the horrific crimes that befall four unsuspecting teenagers on their way out into the country to visit the grave of one of their grandparents.For such a brutally terrifying and gritty slasher it is surprisingly lacking on explicit gore or sex which became staples of the genre. While the reason for this toning down was to try and get a non-R rating it was handled masterfully. By hiding the gruesome parts just outside of direct eye view we become the voyeurs of the hideous crimes. Tobe skillfully has us step foot into the position of the terrorized victim.The relatively tame first half builds a sense of dread that beautifully accents the second which is an absolute assault on the senses trying to elicit the sense of terror that the main protagonist felt.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is remarkably sparse on music and did not rely on it to build suspense, rather we get blasts of sound after moments of silence as if to emphasize the shock in scenes such as Letherface's first reveal. There was fantastic use of diegetic sound in building a nightmarish sense of realism. One particular scene was very striking with its use of sound when one of the female characters stumbles into the sitting room where bits of human bone and skin are strewn on the floor and attached to the furniture and a hen is inside a cage. The cackling of the hen transformed into sadistic laughter at the horror of the girl which is mirrored later on in the film in the dining scene. There are problems in the film with its immoderate attack on the senses. The bombardment of audio visuals in the latter half of the film is jarring at first but becomes excessive to a point of annoying. For what seems like an hour we are presented with images of a terrified woman and just ear splitting screams meshed with the roar of a chainsaw which creates a very un-enjoyable sensory experience.The characters of the family and particularly Leatherface stalked the imagination of generations to come. The frenzied hulking monstrosity chasing the hapless victim which became iconic was matched by the unrelenting second half of the film. The genre's villain has always evolved from monster movies to man being the monster. But since the advent of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre we are presented with a new icon of horror - the silent hidden faced maniac. This spawned a plethora of like minded movies to come but the originality of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre will cement it in the annuals of B-Movie film history.Texas chainsaw massacre changed the name of the game in horror. Once the reveal of the main antagonist the director did not try to hide his monster in the shadow, there was no haunting or stalking. It was a pure frantic chase with not much pause dementing the viewer. A beautiful moment was the apparent ray of light from the gas station owner, this faux end of the tunnel was merely the conduit to the deeper level of this nightmare. With the hope of escape that flight provided now quashed you are forced into a chair bound in bone to be driven mad by the helpless realisation that this is the time you will die, tormented by a sadistic family and completely alone.Interestingly this film is very light on character elements. While we are introduced to the story and the some-what hippy characters we are not presented with people we should care about or fully fleshed out identities. This does detract away somewhat from the horrific violence that is about to befall these unfortunate holiday makers. What the film is successful at is allowing us to set foot into the position of the victims. We become the unwilling participants in this massacre, getting lost in the dark, chased by a maniac and tormented in the house of Gein.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
499,mikejpg,Not what I was expecting!,2,18 January 2020,"So of course I grew up knowing all about the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre yet I had never actually seen the film! I had seen bits of it and I had seen the remakes and I liked them (especially the 2003 version) so I figured I would love this movie as you simply can't beat the classics!
So I finally sat down to watch the ""1974 Classic"" that I had been meaning to watch for years and it actually shocked me how BORED I WAS!
Don't read this and think I just didn't understand it because I did and I do believe that the concept and the idea Tobe Hooper was going for is brilliant especially for its time and it clearly added something new to the horror genre that is still around today!But none of that changes the fact that this movie is nonsensical and boring! I'm not sure if that's how Texans spoke to each other in the 70's but I honestly didn't understand a word the friends were saying to each other!
The script made no sense, the dialogue was just off and it just felt strange to watch.
Now I understand the family being strange and not making any sense when communicating with each other because they're killer cannibals but if anything I think they made more sense than the group of friends.
The chase scenes and the ending scene were probably the best parts of the whole movie as Sally is not the worst final girl I have ever seen but all those scenes combined only come to about 10 minutes!I feel so saddened to be writing such a bad review on this movie as i always thought of it as an instant classic but it just wasn't enjoyable! I wanted to give the whole franchise a go and watch them back to back but if the original sucks then what chance do the others have?
I think sometimes just because a movie is the ""original"" you feel obliged to like it or to at least respect it and not hate on it (which in most cases it's because the original is superior) but with this movie I don't feel the obligation to ever want to watch it again.
It's not often I say this but if you do ever want to watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and you want to actually enjoy it? Watch the 2003 remake! It's not Oscar worthy but unlike the original it won't make you fall asleep halfway through it!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

That was made clear to me whilst watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time and the message has stayed with me ever since.In Tobe Hooper's one great film he tortures the characters and the audience equally, making it uncomfortable to sit through. The suspense is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock and is so unbearable that I found myself wanting Sally (Marilyn Burns) to die so that she would be put out of her misery.Horror films are supposed to horrify and this one utterly succeeds.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
501,COB-3,Just as good as the first time,8,20 April 2004,"I have just seen this film again, actually I've acquired it and it is still immensely powerful. I was also incredibly surprised at how short the film is but is engrossing from the very first minute. The film makes me realise how bad many of the atrocious movies the film spawned really are. Its power is in the mind of the watcher. It is certainly not gory but there is an element of menace throughout that is accentuated by your own mind's ability to imagine how thing felt or what was actually being done while the chainsaw buzzed. On top of this is the finest screaming I have heard in many a year and some very effective camera work. Watch it with lights off and alone !!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
502,whiplash,Not too macabre after all..,5,8 September 2001,"So, I finally got to see the infamous Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I got heavily disappointed.Initially, I thought this was going to be a roller coaster of the macabre..and scary (at least!). It was not.   Five young vacationing kids are savagely haunted and killed by a small Texas slaughter-family. Period. The intensity and mood was created with failure. In the sense that it did not push your adrenaline over the edge. Which it should. Which supposedly was its purpose. I cannot complain TOO much of the gore though, because there were rather few sequences of blood and slashing in the movie. As a fresh breath, however, comes Gunnar Hansen as 'Leatherface'. He is an entertaining killer. More than most nutcases on the screen in modern cinema. Daniel Stern's cinematography is not the worst either. Unluckily, this is not enough to make TCM a good movie.
NB: one of the best sequences in the movie, is when Leatherface is assisting Grandpa of hitting Sally in the head with a sledgehammer.(5/10)",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
503,nicovdk-54575,Blood chilling terror in sweaty Texas,7,5 October 2019,"This is a brutal and in your face gruesome film and yet is less bloody than similar modern horrors which tends to show gratuitous violence just for shock value. This film actually scares you by using its remote Texas setting very well and using imagery to effectively scare the viewer as much or even more than the victims in the story.The villains (or monsters) are used very effectively for the viewers to actively feel disgusted, horrified and freaked out by them, especially the Leatherface masked character. The film created characters that will be used, copied and talked about for as long as the horror genre exists. The characterizations of the young individuals who we follow throughout the film are not fleshed out a lot which could have added more sympathy and emotion to their situation.There are solid performances by the cast, a good production value and good film making for a film made on a limited budget.Recommend this film to everyone who enjoy horror films and anyone who likes to see a good horror film that stands the test of time.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
504,kitsuyuutsu,Maybe I'm missing something...,3,21 September 2017,"I've watched this movie a few times, now, hoping that maybe I'll see what other people do in this movie. So far, I've had no luck... Is there gore? Sure, and I'll give kudos for the gore. But in all honesty, I think that was the only redeeming quality of this movie. Although I'm not a fan of movies that only consist of gore or overdo it. The story line is weak and one of those typical of low budget (or pretty much any) horror film. ""Don't go on the big, creepy, seemingly empty house in the middle of nowhere where no one will here you scream."" ""Omg, there's a lot of horrifying things in this house that warn you psychos live here, why the hell are you taking time to look around instead of getting the hell out of dodge?!"" I found myself talking to the characters and asking them things like this through the whole movie. It was rather predictable, some parts were confusing to the point that you have no idea what things are or what's going on, and none of it scared me or even made me jump in shock or surprise. And the end left you hanging but not in a good way. I didn't care for this movie, but I recommend everyone see it at least once. Not only just so you can judge for yourself, but also so people won't look at you like you have two heads as they shout, ""You've NEVER seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?!?"" as if it's some sort of crime against humanity that you haven't seen it.

505,Hernán,A horror master piece,10,22 October 1999,"Its crude, scary, exciting, sick, its the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This is not only a great horror movie but an impartial mirror of the mad society were living in.  And its almost documentary style only makes it cruder. Its a must seen by any horror fan, and well if you're looking for a movie to get scared see this one.  The importance of the movie is that it's based on something real so that makes it scarier.  The photography on the film is pretty good and challenging and the scene of the eyes of sally crying injected in blood is just shocking. Tobe Hooper, as any horror fan may know is one of the best directors of this style, but this is really his master piece. The gore in this movie is not graphic, you  know it is there but you never see it. And the atmosphere created by the sound editing, its excellent to create a tension state all along the movie.  In resume this is an excellent horror movie that actually crossed the line between reality and fantasy.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
506,King Wal,Disapointing,6,4 November 2000,"**SPOILERS**   **SPOILERS** Shame. I'd heard a lot about this film, and when I saw it I was almost inevitably disapointed. Reasons why (SPOILERS)? 1) It's just not scary. Sorry but it isn't. Marilyn Burns (Sally) does little apart from talk to her borther and scream a lot, and thats not how I like my heroines. 2) The table scene when Grampa comes out. This is not scary just sick and disturbing with the poor girl just screaming whilst everyone else is mocking her. And quite honestly, the human corpse is just horrible. 3) There is almost no explanation of what is going on. The hitch-hiker and the garage worker were underused. Plus are they family? Workers at the abatoir? Random people? 4) There is little script. Just ""I'll look in the house oops I've been murdered"" Sally screaming and a chainsaw whiring. 5) Leatherface survives. 6) Leatherface gets played by Dennis Hopper in the sequal. The film has good points however. It is shocking. It does have good effects. Although I bitched about this earlier, it does have a good ending with leatherface whiring his chainsaw furiously.So it is worth watching. Just don't expect a masterpiece.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
507,MI$ gUy,The most demented movie of all time?,8,6 December 1999,"I just saw this movie for the first time.  This movie is sick, twisted, and demented.  Because of the way they filmed movies back then, this movie seems very realistic.  The movie takes many unexpected turns, and you will ask yourself many questions throughout the movie such as:  1.  Who is gonna die (next)?  2.  Who is the main character?and the most common question: 3.  What the hell?This movie is not for the faint of heart.  Showing this to children could severely mess them up.  I would compare this movie to Natural Born Killers, in that these are the two weirdest movies I have ever seen.  However, I will say that I enjoyed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre more. Ok, well maybe I didn't ""enjoy"" it.  I don't want people to think I'm demented.  However, I will say this is a very good movie. My only regret is that this movie is so short.  However, can anyone handle any more than an hour and a half of this?  I think not.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
508,TravisD-2,Frightening and exhausting,10,2 June 2000,"A classic from the 1970s, Texas Chainsaw Massacre offers more grit, realism, and, oddly enough, substance than most horror films that followed. While the beginning can be somewhat comical, at least the parts where the teen costars go into the Family's house one by one, the last thirty or so minutes are both terrifying and breathtaking.  Even the film's slightly ambiguous and abrupt ending doesn't let you off the hook.  It's a great film to watch and, surprisingly, a great film to think about too.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
509,BackFire83,The Ultimate Modern Horror Film,10,24 August 2006,"The 70's was a decade full of cinematic classics across all genres. This is especially true in the horror genre which enjoyed huge success during this decade, which is where the modern horror film was born.No film is more important to the modern horror film industry then the 1974 pseudo-gore classic - ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The first shot is of a sizzling, rotting corpse sitting under the hot Texas sun. You'd think with a start like that you'd know what to expect from this film. And there in lies it's brilliance. You know it's a horror film, you know what it's about, yet as the film progresses you are still shocked and terrified by the raw and honest manner in which the story is carried out.The film starts with a quiet tone and atmosphere which almost immediately gives off a foreboding silence that gives the impression of a calm before the storm. You know something bad is going to happen, you can tell...but the film is so unique, and so strikingly different from other horror films you can't predict how or what exactly is going to happen.The story is of 5 young hippies on a road trip in Texas, they run out of gas and go to a secluded house to try and find help and gas. What they find is TERROR! and lots of it.It's done in such a way that you never know what's going to happen next. There is no pounding music to build the suspense and let the viewer know to expect something, there is no coherent reason behind the gruesome acts of carnage we see, and as a result they come out of no where and completely blind side you.The scene that best exemplifies this is the scene where we first get a glimpse of leatherface. When he pops out with that mallet and smacks Kurt right in the head it leaves the viewer shocked and confused. We had no way of expecting that, and that feelings stays during the entire film.It's raw in every sense of the word, it's brilliance lies in it's anti cinematic feel...giving it a grainy plausible atmosphere that doesn't accept the idea of ""it's only a movie"". It's to real, it feels like what you're seeing is not just a movie but simply peering into the world of an absolute maniac who kills for no apparent reason other then not knowing any better.This brings me to the star of the film, and my favorite horror villain of all time - Leatherface. His animalistic yet childlike behavior makes him so much creepier and interesting then other slashers. He wears a mask of human flesh, he eats his victims, he kills without remorse...yet he feels innocent, like a child who doesn't know he shouldn't pull the cat's tail. He's scolded by his older brother and whimpers and cowards, he IS a child, mentally at least, and that's what makes him so disturbing. The idea that he doesn't know what he's doing is wrong. He's doing all he's even known, what HE thinks he needs to do to survive. He's vicious, yet innocent. This is insanity at it's best. Never once do you feel bored or let down by the film. You are never able to tell what is going to happen next. With each passing scene you think you've seen the worst the film has to offer. And yet the next scene you find yourself more shocked and confused then you were the scene prior. This is truly a testament to Tobe Hooper's brilliance that seems to have been lost immediately after making this film.In my opinion this is the pinnacle of horror films. It's the one that got me into the genre in hopes of finding another film that left me feeling as exhausted and drained as this did. While I never did find a film that affected me in a comparable way, I still can watch this film, after over a hundred times, and still get those chills I got the first time I saw it.If you're aching for some Halloween viewing, then do yourself a favor and go rediscover this gem.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
510,johnathaandoe,A horror classic!,7,17 June 2021,"Probably the hardest film I've ever had to watch, and with good reason! TSM is by far the most disturbing and gross film ever presented. Leatherface and Drayton are of course played wonderfully, and the cinematography is outstanding! It's camera angles, it's presentation of the scenario. Tobe Hooper does a wonderful job directing this piece.Sally is played wonderfully too, however at times her screaming gets slightly repetitive. She seems like the stereotypical scream queen before, well, the stereotype. But can you blame her? Honestly.But the overall protagonist cast of teens is a bit sucky. Outside of Franklin, who is hilariously annoying, and Sally herself, the rest suck. Same thing with the Hitchhiker, he was overly insane. To the point of annoyance.But overall, this film isn't really about the teens. It's about the house itself and the family that lives there.

It's one of a very small handful of films that present a unique, completely radical view of the world; it's harsh, unforgiving and totally memorable, and by God, once it sets its teeth in you, you stay bit.

512,sankhaonline,Most overrated movie I ever watched,5,27 April 2011,"I read numerous good rating about this movie. Horror is my favorite genre and I do watch a lot of horror movies. American, European, Korean, Japanese, you name it. I am very sorry to say, this one might be big hit in its own golden time, it looks not only poor but I am afraid to say ""ugly"" most of the time, specifically in 2nd half.I liked the first part, the character build up, the natural 70s American youth life. The mad hitch hiker was bizarre enough, the lone convenient store, lone house etc etc. The first lapse in tight editing was the first two murders. I don't want to reveal much, as I have no intension to spoil anything. But from the name you will guess that there has to be couple of murders. Tension could have been built much there. But all the characters were being told just to scream or call each other's name. In 2nd half, in my opinion, the dialogs are worst and cheap. The screams were excessive and unnecessary. Which could have produced some nail biting moments, because of poor acting and lame editing, created some pathetic funny sequences.Honestly speaking, you may give this a try, but then, don't set your expectation too high. When I saw the rating over 7, I was expecting something more than 6-6.5 (for old movies I always deduct 1-1.5 sentimental over rating, old is always gold, isn't it? Not to me, sorry). But I couldn't push it over 5. Only good thing is, it was short (1:20 hrs) and stops suddenly(thanks God!). Also, no body tried to throw any morals which is a breeze.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Let's cut to the real point!Nowadays (as everyone knows) whenever you look up for a good horror movie to watch, there's always blood, gore, violence, the same old routine with a couple of teenagers winding up to get killed in various of different ways (after all the sex of course) and really acting stupid when it comes to escaping...But this is something else! A wholly original movie that just comes out of nowhere and grabs your attention and never lets go until the very end that leaves you in a shock which believe me... stays for quite a while! In other words....this is what REAL horror movies are all about! OK first of all. Given the fact that this is a low-budget 70's movie (where apparently the special effects weren't nearly as good as now) I'd say that it is amazing just how the film manages to be so shocking and terrifying...some of the scenes are very tense and can grab your attention almost too well....(my favorite scene is with the hitch-hiker, done so perfectly by Edwin Neal) The actors do a pretty good job (most notable are Marilyn Burns ,truly believable screaming, Jim Siedow and Edwin Niel). The storyline grabs you easily into the heart of the movie, despite of being very simple, and the directing is really good...(The beautiful environments and color's of the landscape in Texas don't hurt either) In the end I hope that people who watch this film will accept it for what it is....A movie that is able to scare one without any big amount of blood, gore or special effectsNo wonder it's a cult classic!

514,tylermoore,Doesn't comepletely hold up,6,18 January 2013,"PROS: The film's cinematography is amazing, especially with it's low budget. The imagery is fantastic and sets up a very nice atmosphere. Some of the scenes, mostly the chase scenes, are sort of intense. The premise is great because we are diving in to this insane world we don't understand with the people that get stuck in this situation. CONS: I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THESE PEOPLE! I say the chase scenes are sort of intense because I don't really care if this dumb bimbo makes it away. You'd think with this premise they would try to make us care about these characters but they are such cut outs and acted so woodenly that I wouldn't care. I would just take it as a regular splatter flick but the beginning is practically repeating itself beat for beat. I did sort of enjoy the last 20 minutes because it sort of became a bizarre black comedy. I believe that back in 1974, this would have been terrifying, but I just don't think it holds up these days as it sort of becomes a laughable incoherent mess.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
515,Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre,One of my favourite Horror movies...,10,28 January 2006,"And I love it! The Texas Chainsaw Masscare, directed by Tobe Hooper is just amazing. I loved the whole atmosphere of the film and it's eerie grim tone that it has to it. Five teenagers on a normal trip out, when, in a nice sunny day, they run into a hitchhiker and they decide to give him a lift. From the first glance of this guy, anyone could tell, he isn't a normal person and far from it. He has what appears to be, a blood stained type scar on around his right cheek. Anyway, the reason he was on the road is because he was visiting the slaughter house..arrgghh. After a bit of a struggle with the Hitchhiker they throw him out of the truck, but that isn't there only worries. After stopping off at an old house, Kirk and Pam run into another house, thinking they maybe could get fuel for the van. And this is were there evening trip turns into a nightmare.On entering this old house, Kirk is confronted by a man with a mask, probably made from human skin. Yes, you have just seen Leatherface! Once Kirk don't come back out, Pam enters the house. And we get to see what type of place this is, Decorations includes, Bones, teeth, feathers, and a general feeling of death in the house. The family consists of ""The Cook"", ""Hitchiker"" and ""Leatherface"" oh, and ""Grandpa!"". ""The Cook"" has split personality's, most of the time he is in killing mood, but then his patterns change and he feels guilt in what he has done, and shame. He is conflicted in between, whether he should kill or not. And, He is actually my favourite character out of the film, because his madness is purely evident!. After the other teens be's dealt with, this crew of mad people capture Sally. And in the last 20mins or so of the film, we find out what these screw ups are and what have they lived on, over the past years. There diet appears to be, dead body pieces, fingers as sausages and all sorts. And Sally is the invited guest! The ""dinner table scene"" is the most memorable scene out of the film. This is were we see, ""The Cooks"" personalty disorder take effect, cuz, one minute he is laughing at the girl suffer and the next he is shouting ""No need to torture the poor girl!"", and the most infamous line what he utters ""Our old Grandpas the best killer there ever was!"". You'll probably want to know does she escape? Well, your gonna have to see it. I think this is the definitive horror movie ever, period. Why? It's so atmospheric, chilling, disturbing, thrilling...everything that a horror movie fan could ask for, if not more. In saying that, the film isn't a real gore hounds film, far from it actually.In fact, there is very little gore at all! And I am being serious, just watch it. And this is the good bit, cuz, when you see it the first time you probably think all sorts happened. But, no, it is the films lack of gore, what made it so good, well, in my opinion anyway. Most of the violence is implied, but it is implied very effectively. And the reason for this is because, Tobe, actually wanted this film to get a 'PG' rating! What was he thinking?!. If your after the best horror out of the 70's, then you have found it! I loved it, and if your an old horror nut (like me), you will too.

When the teens are introduced in the van, their are two females and three males, and one of the males is in a wheelchair, now in real life imagine what these teens when through, especially the teen in the wheelchair, being hacked to death by a chainsaw ""very painful as you can tell"" and discovering they aren't the only victims as the film comes to an end. you have to feel sorry for them, even though they are ""your typical teens"" this film touched me because every time something happened in the movie, i kept thinking what really happened to them in real life! and when something did happen it saw shocking.

And it doesn't need gore, either!",10,23 July 1999,"When I was little, this film, like many others, intimidated me greatly, aided by all the warnings from my mother. So it took me a while to get my nerve up and rent the damn thing. I mean, I had been watching gory horror flicks since I was six, but this one just stood out. I had heard rumors that a girl gets her head cut off, a bunch of kids get brutally killed, cut up, and hung on hooks, and that other weird atrocities are committed, so I strayed away for awhile. Then, when I was in the sixth grade, my brother rented it against my will and I was forced to face my fears. After I was finished viewing it, I soon realized that there was absolutely NO large amounts of blood in the picture and that all the hype was b.s. I was actually kinda disappointed, but something pulled me in and I soon got the urge to rent it several more times. I then grew older and wiser, until ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" got better with each viewing. It still does till this very day.I love this movie. I truly do. It is one of the ONLY horror films I've seen that actually provides genuine scares, in the same ballpark as ""Carrie"" and ""The Shining"". Most horror is just a bunch of self-conscious and senseless gore and special effects, with no scares, no talent, and little shock value. Personally, I don't think a film has to be gory to be scary. In fact, I think the gore actually removes some of the calaustrophobic elements that truly make a film horrifying. I mean, look at the ""Friday the 13th"" series and see what I mean. TCM is practically goreless and is ten times scarier.The plot to this film is a basic one. A group of kids take a trip to the graves of their relatives to make sure they haven't been caught up in the current graverobbings and soon get caught up with a family of sadistic cannibals who proceed to terrorize them and . . . I think you get the message. Truly horrifying. The climax is one that is sure to freak anybody out, even if you think you've seen everything. It is extremely intense and enclosed, making it nightmare worthy. This film is disturbing me right at this very moment just thinking about it! I feel like I should watch it tonight or something.So make a point to view this picture and ignore all the hype about gore and crap. Everyone THINKS they're seeing blood, which makes this film so effective. The only blood that stood out in my mind was when Franklin got cut on the razor. That's it. But it doesn't mean that this isn't the most hardcore horror picture ever made. It just means that the filmmakers are accomplishing their goals, and that horror has gone straight to hell in the '90s. Just look at the meat hook scene and at its effectiveness. It always stands out in everybody's mind.#8 on my Top 200 List and GUARANTEED to freak you out.      **** out of **** on my personal scale.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Maybe if I had seen this film in 1974 I would have liked it, but as of now it just seems cheap. People say it is psychological but after watching it twice I don't see how they could think that. This movie is about being brutal, and it does a very poor job, even for low budget.If you want to see a good low budget horror film, I recommend Evil Dead.

520,dgilmer,Great Horror Film,8,27 October 2000,"I have seen the Texas Chain Saw Massacre before and believe that it is truly one of the best horror movies of all time. This movie had a very small budget, unknown actors, no soundtrack, a first time director and a cinematographer fresh out of college. I believe that all of this helped make this movie great, give it that low-budget, realistic feel. I don't think it would have been as effective or scary if you took the same script and had a large budget. Anyway, last night it came on IFC and I decided to watch it and discovered that the movie had almost no sound but rather commentary from director Tobe Hooper, cinematographer Daniel Pearl and Gunnar Hansen who played Leatherface. It was very interesting and very informative. I'm not sure when they shot this but supposedly it was the first time the 3 of them had been together since they shot the movie in '73. SPOILER: The best part was when they described the diner scene. The grandfather was actually a thin 18 year old kid who spent 10 hours in makeup and decided this was it, shoot it all now b/c he wasn't doing this again. Thus, they shot for like 27 hours straight in this room which they said was in excess of 100 degrees. The whole movie was shot in extremely hot temperatures and Gunnar or Leatherface only had one shirt, so he basically had to wear the same shirt for 4 weeks, thus he really smelled. It was so hot during the diner scene that many of them were vomiting and they had to take numerous breaks to get fresh air. Gunnar said that he and the rest of the cast basically got so hot and tired that they went a little crazy and he actually believed he was Leatherface. There is a scene where he cuts Sally's finger and puts it in the old man's mouth. They did this shot over and over b/c the pump attached to the knife kept getting stuck and wouldn't squirt any blood so Gunnar said he finally just took the tape off the knife and actually cut her finger b/c he was basically nuts by this point and wanted the scene to end. Tobe said Sally was excellent and really took a lot of abuse physically but was really committed to the part. So if you go back and watch this movie check out this particular scene b/c they said there wasn't a whole lot of acting go on in there, these ""actors"" were literally going insane and it really makes for a strong, disturbing, climatic performance.
They also went into detail about a lot of the shots Daniel and Tobe experimented with such as the shot of the character Pam who is in the swing outside the brother's house and as she gets up to go into the house the camera comes up behind her from under the swing. This particular shot was not in the original script so Daniel and Tobe really had to put their feet down and threaten to walk out if it wasn't included. They really did an excellent job, I mean both of these guys were young and had never done anything like this before and their experimentation really payed off.
If you really like this movie, I highly recommend checking this out although I'm not real sure where you could find it, maybe contact IFC - Independent Film Channel. If you don't think much of this movie, then you might also like this b/c it really gives you feel for the whole movie making process and what these people had to go through to get what you finally see on the big screen. I rank this movie up there with the Exorcist, The Shining, Halloween, Psycho, Scream and The Event Horizon as my favorite scary movies.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
521,Scarybear31,Greatest horror movie ever made!,10,1 July 2019,"Needless to say Tobe Hooper's classic is and always will be my favorite horror movie EVER! Between the unknown actors, the low budget and the tight shooting schedule one would think this is going to be a disaster. Far from it, in fact all those factors added up to make the most real, gritty horror flick of the 70's. Gunnar Hansen was amazing as the lumbering psychopath Leatherface. Over the 45 years of it's release I have seen the full movie at least 600 times and I still pop it in at least 4 times a year.

""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" that I watched cannot possibly be the cult film that everyone rants and raves about. I must have just had a hallucination in which I watched one of the worst ""horror"" movies ever.Okay, so, in all seriousness, what do people like about this film?It's not suspenseful. It's not scary. It's not entertaining. The acting isn't bad, but that doesn't make a movie.It starts nowhere, and goes nowhere. The characters are boring, the story is boring. They walk around and talk for an hour, then they die. No suspense whatsoever. There are three good things about this movie: 1) The title. Very awesome. 2) Some of the scenes in the house. The bones, the hook scene, all okay. 3) The dinner scene at the end. Props for that, it's the best part of the film.I like old horror movies. I really do. But this piece of junk?

524,prehensel,"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of...Death)",9,24 June 2007,"It's impressive just how foundational this film has been for later slasher flicks and later horror filmmakers in general. (Ridley Scott gave it props and cited it as an influence in the filming of *Alien*: now that's a feather in your hat!) Both of Rob Zombie's films, *House of 1000 Corpses* and *Devil's Rejects*, could arguably be considered direct homages to *TCM*. The similarities are interesting. The crazy family with the creepy grandfather and the huge, lumbering brother (Leatherface/Tiny) in the out-of-the-way dilapidated house decorated with creepy junk is half the setting and cast of *House of 1000 Corpses*. The other half of that cast is the group of young people on a road trip (one of whom is annoying (Franklin/Jerry)) who get themselves in trouble with said crazy family--though the latter part of this element might be traced even further back to *2000 Maniacs*. Characters wearing someone else's face on their own (Leatherface/Otis/Wendy) is a connection to both of Zombie's flicks, as is depicting someone getting nailed by a semi (the Hitchhiker/Wendy). Lastly, there's the creepy dinner scene in *House of 1000 Corpses* that is a direct homage to *TCM*. It's not just Zombie's films that have relied on Hooper's masterwork: elements from this film pop up in many later ones like *Motel Hell*, *Madman*, and *Friday the 13th* just to name the first few off the top of my head. This film, like *Last House on the Left*, does a terrific job of depicting the isolation that is only believable when set in the 70s and early 80s (and this is why I don't think the re-made *TCMs* can ever be successful; it's just no longer believable for characters to be cut off like that or for a family to live in such an isolated way that no one would figure out they're bumping off travelers. But to return from my little tangent, the whole film is creepy--from the moment they decide to pick up the crazy hitchhiker, to the now-classic scene of Kirk being smacked in the face and Leatherface slamming that metal door (Blaaagh! that still freaks me out), to the scene in which Sally runs upstairs into Grandpa's room (I've always wondered if mummified grandma was an homage to Psycho), to Grandpa sucking the blood off Sally's finger, to that dinner scene when they're all screaming along with Sally. It's all just wrong and messed up, confirming the sneaking suspicion everyone has that someone you'll run across in your life is so screwed up that they are operating by an entirely different set of rules than everyone else--rules that you won't understand.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
525,Eli_Cash,Who's the victim here?,9,14 June 2003,"To be fair when I voted for this film (and I gave it a 9) I wasn't comparing it to _Schindler's List_, or _Metropolis_, or _Casablanca_.  I was judging it within its genre, a dangerous tactic to be sure seeing that there a more than a few movies in the category that i haven't bothered with, but one that left me with a notable conclusion.  I've never viewed a better horror film. Hooper's _Massacre_ makes one so uncomfortable, so physically and mentally upset with the treatment of both its unfortunate juvenile protagonists as well as the bizarre rural meat-working family, that one is left completely unhinged.  Leatherface out-psychopaths (to coin a new verb) Freddie, Jason, and Michael Myers partially because one reads his torment so clearly. He's not some supernaturally horrific ghoul from beyond the grave, but an ordinary Joe down on his luck, the runt of the litter, picked on even by his own family.  Okay so not ordinary.  The man's lineage has been struck down to the wayside by technological advancement in the field they specialized in (livestock slaughtering) leaving them out of work.  The world spins by them rapidly leaving them archaically useless, old-fashioned, and on a steady path toward perversion and hate.  Then some annoying sexually precocious hooligans show up at your door all whiny and half-naked?  Who wouldn't bury a sledge in a cranium or make use of that old meathook just collecting dust in the back room?Oh and besides all this psychological critique babble, its scary as all get out.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
526,BeccaLeo,Does Not Live Up To Its Reputation,1,29 October 2005,"Texas chainsaw massacre(1974) does not live up to its reputation as being a horror classic. i was disappointed in the cinematography, acting, directing, and the handling of the plot line. a group of Texas kids are on their way to check out the grave site of a deceased relative and after head to an out of town rock concert. the kids come across a hitchhiker while heading to the concert and decide to pick him up. the young man has blood on his hands/shirt and is mumbling the same thing over and over. the kids decide to help him out by taking a dirt road back to where the young man came from. the young man gets nervous and either runs off or kills himself i can't recall exactly. this plot advancement doesn't do much to pull the storyline along. the kids end up at a run down house where a creepy disabled man lives with his family. a couple of the kids have already been killed at this point and the viewer is supposed to be scared. scared of ""what is out there"" and of the creepy old man. the old guy does not have a telephone but tells the kids where to find a phone booth. the main male character heads off to the telephone booth while the others explore the house and its barn. I'm probably missing a few plot points but you get the basic premise. all the kids get killed, except for a pretty young girl, by leather face. leather face's mask is a joke as are the ones his family members are wearing. all leather face does in this film is wave a chainsaw around wildly while the camera cuts away just when the slashing begins. the lone surviving girl spends the last 20 minutes of the film screaming her fool head off over and over again. i wanted leather face to kill her. i'd rather have heard that obnoxious chainsaw then listen to anymore screaming. my friend and i eventually muted the TV we lost our patience. however, the stupid girl gets away and though the TV was muted we could tell she was still screaming. she flags down a trucker while standing along the side of the highway. we thought she would've shut up by then but that was not the case. this film is a piece of trash that does not deserve its cult status. the 2003 remake of this film is superior to the original. the acting, cinematography, directing, adding more detail to the plot line, and the intensity level are excellent! its a very well crafted horror film remake that keeps you on the edge.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those movies.For some reason, I decided to watch this movie at midnight. It has been a month and a half since I saw it, and it still remains one of the most sickening, disturbing, shocking, terrifying movies I have ever seen. Put simply: it did everything it was supposed to. It was violent without being graphic. The music (if you could call it that) has nudged out the Halloween theme as my most terrifying movie score (sorry, John). Leatherface is one of the most horrific antagonists I've ever seen in a movie (and I've seen The Thing and The Evil Dead). Quite simply, as a horror film, this one works. With stuff like The Toolbox Murders, The Mangler, and Crocodile under his belt, Tobe Hooper should be grateful to this movie for making him more than a horror footnote.All right, I've conquered TCM.

Okay the acting isn't great, the story is a bit lacking and some of the chase scenes could have been done a little better, but I still love this movie! It's the only horror movie ever in my opinion that sucks the viewer into a living hell and will not give you a break. No pointless cuts to police stations and cops looking for the killers, no deviations over to peripheral characters to let you catch your breath. Once the tension and terror in this movie starts it simply does not let up. You're right there with poor Sally through the entire grisly ordeal but you never for a second get numb to the situation. Other films have taken us right up to the abyss, maybe even given us a taste, but then like clockwork they all sell out. Well not this one. Tobe Hooper stuck to the basics and delivered and it's a shame that no one has really stepped up to the plate since then. A few though have made valiant efforts that I feel are worth mentioning: Haneke's FUNNY GAMES was definitely disturbing and grueling but it was a little too existentialist and experimental to truly terrify (I know that was the point). Aja's HAUTE TENSION got too splatter happy and blew it in the end with a bogus 11th hour twist. Back to TCM. The tone of dread and madness never breaks once. No comic book style killings, no slow motion action, no overdone blood effects or gore, and for the love of God no mood-stifling pop soundtrack complete with the latest top 10 single by Nickelback or Limp Bizkit at precisely the wrong time (this one infuriates me to no end). Just terror and panic in a dire situation. See this movie if you have ever wondered about the random things that can happen in this world and the darkness that hides in actual people. See this movie for a lesson in simplicity. Long live the saw.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Quite possibly the most verbally creepy movie of all time. The Hitchhiker talking about how to make ""Headcheese"", good God Almighty, sikkkkkkkkk. The very first appearance of Leatherface scared the living crap out of me. He was pretty damn deadly with that sledgehammer. His true origins kept me in mystery as well, I kept wondering if the Hitchhiker and leatherface were the same person, or if the old gas station man was him. The I find its a whole FAMILY of pshycos, WOW! Hooper kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through with masterful directing. The acting is topnotch, although the characters did not really develop, it really didn't matter considering how quick leatherface killed them off. The only ones who we needed to care about were Sally, Franklin, Leatherface Hitchhiker, and Father phsyco. The father got to me as someone who killed solely for food, he talked about how he just cant stomach killin. Hitchhiker was just....well, i'm not really sure. Leatherface was just plain CREEPY. LOVE to see him and Michael Myers duke it out. All in all, This is the second greatest movie ever made and it is certainly a classic.

I understand it was low budget so that explains the lack of any actual gore for the plot of the movie, however I simply cannot get past how dumb these characters are. We are supposed to sympathise and feel bad for these characters when they are murdered and hunted but it's very hard to do that when they make so many dumb decisions. The characters decide to pick up a sketchy hitchhiker and then decide to explore a creepy abandoned house, followed by breaking in to another house (and yes they break in because they simply enter without permission) and we are supposed to act surprised that these actions get them killed? Not to mention that sequence where Sally is running from Leatherface and continously screams when he loses her location, therein alerting him to where she is. It was honestly painful to watch, this movie would have been great if the characters had been even slightly clever, or average, not dumb. I know loads of people adore this movie so I went in, as an avid horror fan, hoping that this would be great but I am solely disappointed.

534,Bond 29,"Favorite Line ""Coon $#its",10,8 March 1999,"This movie is underrated. Most people see it do not understand it and say it sucks. Or they compare it to gorefest movies. Most people believe a movie shouldn't make you try to understand it. This movie does have a lot of gore, depending which version you get. Most people rent it and most rental places have the censored version. That version cuts out a great deal so when you try to understand it you can't because someone cut those parts out. This movie shows what could really happen. Most people who say it sucked for one did not understand it, didn't really watch it completely, or are people who compare it to what it is not. What I mean by that is someone compared it to Night of the Living Dead. That movie is in a whole other area of horror. Night of the Living Dead is about the dead returning to life by a virus carried in a meteor and eating people to keep the virus alive. TCM is about a crazed cannibalistic family with a chainsaw wielding maniac. People believed there was nothing to leather face. Well they are right. They believed this is not scary. Leather face had no sense of identity so he wore people's faces, he knew nothing else than killing. That is a lot more scary than anyother movie. A living person who shows no pity, only knows how to kill and cook food. What is worst of all there is one reason behind it he wants food. I can't believe people have the nerve to compare this to The newest TCM movie. That one leather face is a perverted transvestite. The original Leather face didn't take crap from anyone who was not his family. In the new one someone told leather face to sit down and shutup what did ""it"" (as I refer to that thing) do? It sat down. You got some woman who just sits there, and a guy with a robotic leg controlled by a tv remote, and a idiot with a tazer. Not one person was killed by a chainsaw.

535,PrinceMishkin,Very definitely not Room with a View and all the better for it.,8,27 March 1999,"Well goodness me, this film is now an art movie. If you haven't got the patience for Pi - 'a study of...cabalistic mysticism' apparently - then rush along to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a study of cannibalistic mysticism, without the mysticism. If you can't face hours of watching French Children getting lost in the snow, prepare to watch American college kids being cut up with chainsaws and made into sausages. All right ! This is what films are actually for.Well OK, but is it any good ? Unreservedly, yes. T.C.M. (as I'm sure we call it) lives in the same infamy as The Exorcist , both films are so bad for us that we shouldn't be permitted even to say their names out loud. Like The Exorcist however, most people will not have seen this picture because we're just not allowed. This correspondent remembers the film coming out in his native Limerick and all the hysterical hoo-ha in the papers. People were being carried out in fits, grown men were fainting, ladies were swooning. The implication was clear - see this film and you will become an evil, disturbed person and you'll probably go mad as well. Living in Limerick, the events portrayed in the film sounded rather common place to us, (a joke, don't write in) but be that as it may, I was too young and failed to see it. Seeing it now, one is blown away by the visual and aural invention. Large swathes of it look like an Art Film, the sound design is also smashing - a nervy collection of clicks and rustling cymbals. After a hilariously portentous narration, the title sequence consists of a series of arresting ruby images of the sun, followed by a shot of a dead aardvark, all very Wild Bunch. We then join the Scooby Doo like gang of youths in their Mystery Mobile on the way to oblivion. The acting is, of course, ropey, the quality of the stock ghastly and the dialogue often inaudible but this all adds to the creepy harshness of the atmosphere. One is, of course terribly familiar now with this scenario, but it is a relief to see an original version of the old machine, free of self-reference and irony.One's first sight of the chainsaw wielding Leatherface is a wonderfully icy moment, but also one rich with association. It's like seeing Rhett Butler or George Bailey for the first time, icons in their proper place and time - eternally young. Of course Leatherface is not exactly like George Bailey, the Baileys didn't chop up Clarence the angel, eat him and make furniture out of his bones...but I'm getting off the point. What follows is still pretty damn scary, although not as grisly as we have been led to believe - it is the degradation of humanity that is really frightening. The comically absurd behaviour of the cannibal family could be straight out of the Theatre of Cruelty. In particular, the scene where they encourage their decrepit Grandfather to bash one of the victims over the head whilst they hold her over a bucket, would have done Antonin Artaud proud.Of course all this was done on a minuscule budget and it is every bit as impressive in logistic terms  as the contemporaneous work of Cassavetes, more so, because it was competing directly with other films in its genre made for ten times the amount. Of course like Romero before him, Hooper never really fitted in to Hollywood afterwards. He made one huge hit - Poltergeist - and then didn't really know what to do with himself. Since then, there's been the average Life Force and numerous misjudged failures. T.C.M. showed him in his natural milieu as a gorilla film maker.

This is one of the few horror movies to ever do that. When I first watched it years ago, it DID actually scare me. After rewatching it so many times, that effect wears off, and I don't really get scared by it, but I still find it disconcerting.
This movie is atmospheric and unrelenting. This is a horror movie lover's horror movie. Maybe not the best.... but this is my personal favorite horror flick of all time. I've seen it several times already and will continue watching it through out my life.

As a avid horror fan, I can easily say this is one of the best horror films ever made. Everything from the opening narration and the first image we see in the movie to the brilliant unexpected ending, this movie is a horror gem.We follow Sally, her 'invalid brother Franklin', and their three friends as they go on a road trip through Texas. After picking up a crazy hitch-hiker and ditching him, they finally come across their grandpa's old farm. There, we are introduced to Leatherface and his cannibalistic family.Leatherface is the chainsaw wielding psycho that has changed the horror genre for the last 40 years. His iconic chainsaw and human skin mask has terrified audiences for decades. Gunner Hansen's portrayal of the ultimate villain has impacted the slasher and horror genre for so long and thanks to the many audiences who have sat through his terror and admired his performance.This movie has spawned many sequels and remakes, none of which have matched the intensity and pure genius of the original Tobe Hooper masterpiece.Overall I would recommend this movie for any horror fanatic who can accept that it was made in the 70s and isn't really that scary by today's standards.

Camera bulb flashes, chainsaw whirring, tin cans rustling in the wind are what make up the soundtrack, a welcoming to the seemingly post-apocalyptic world, left behind by America, while so ironically encapsulated by it. Leatherface, the hitchhiker and the old man are trapped within the outside world, and when the outside world intrudes on their territory, they wreak havoc on it.I would also like to mention that while other exploitation movies often depicted the killer from a POV angle, TCM never does, and that's another aspect of this movie that makes it a(n ironical) deviation from exploitations.My friend has a copy of this on blu ray that I've been meaning to watch with her sometime, but for this viewing I opted to watch a VHS rip of it. I'll defend this because I feel the grainy-ness of the VHS only adds to the overall atmosphere of the movie. Like what Mark Borchardt said, it's akin to one of those videos which you'd see in a dingy science classroom back in grade school, and I agree. If I were you, I'd get this movie on VHS, or at least torrent a low-quality copy of it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

544,morris22,Classic,10,30 September 1999,"Along with Psycho and Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the big classics from horrors' true golden age.  As most know it follows the story of a group of teens/twentysomethings who stumble upon a deranged family in rural Texas.  Like most older horror films I saw this one as a kid.  Back then it was scary but like most movies from that time it has lost some of its' impact over the years.  Nonetheless, it's a classic and is routinely listed as just that on many a critics list.  ET Weekly named it #2 on an all-time best horror movies list and Premiere has listed it as one of the most influential movies ever made. I'm shocked to see a 6.4 IMDB average rating here.

545,quentinwharton-70401,A Misunderstood Classic,7,22 December 2019,"(Rating as a movie) Personally, I believe that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the greatest, and often misunderstood slasher films ever made. Despite what people often perpetuate this film to be, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not about the gore or the killings. In fact, most of the kills in the movie are offscreen. The film, rather than showing you what happens to each of the unfortunate victims, cuts away before you see their true fate. This is a tactic used in many horror movies to effectively create suspense. This film has a very gritty feel, utilizing grainy film to make the movie feel all the more uncomfortable. This film also uses a lot of vibrant colors, giving it a unique style not often seen in other horror films, which often favor more grey and saturated color palettes. The disturbing set pieces and props add to the macabre theme of the film. The film also showcases some amazing practical effects and make up that made the whole movie feel all the more real. The antagonist of the film is genuinely terrifying, and is one of the best slasher icons to exist in media. The only issue I have with the film are that the main characters feel underdeveloped, and they just felt like meat puppets that existed to be killed by Leatherface. I really love this film. It's one of my favorite slasher movies and one of the best examples of what makes this genre so great. With all things considered, I'll be giving it a 7/10, I think it's closer to an 8 than it is a 6.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This macabre masterpiece, loosely based on real events, remains to this day one of the single greatest movie accomplishments showing that blood and gore isn't the formula to a genuinely scary film.It's hard to put a finger on one particular strong point of the movie. It excels in so many areas. From it's direction to it's sound to it's atmosphere, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre leaves a chilling, disturbing mark on the viewer. Some see the excruciating camera angles and spine tingling ambiance as the real scare while others are disturbed by the fact that this is based on real events.The movie let's your mind do the scaring while the visuals set you up. And the absence of any real gore shows the amazing ability of Hooper to relay his desires to the audience by sheer horror movie talent.There is a reason that this is called a classic.

548,janemason100,a cut above the rest!!!,10,12 October 2006,How brilliant is this film? it is basically the epitome of all horror movies because it builds suspense and atmosphere in which most horror movies could think of.Add this to a genuine and believable serial killer like Leatherface (and his Macabre and malevolent family) and a camper van full of teenagers then you should have a decent serial killer Flick. Most modern films rely too much on Blood and gore and a motive(WHY IS THIS?) for a serial killer too have. But in my opinion a decent weapon for a serial killer(Chainsaw was probably the one I ad to look away from when watching this film) and a motiveless serial killer then I believe that makes a genuine scary movie that will live on and on,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
549,rschwieb,"Very scary, great movie, only very minor flaws",8,31 March 2002,"Well, I may as well start out with the minor flaws.  First of all, make sure you have your TV all the way bright, and the contrast way up.  If you don't, you're sure to be annoyed by the film being 95% inky black.  This 'dark' convention works excellently for the movie, but it seems slightly overused. Secondly, you run into a sort of mindless plot, although this is the most gripping mindless plot I've seen.  And as for the victims, well, I'm sure hippies would chase them with chainsaws too, because man, the victims give hippies a bad name. On the upside, TCSM is filled with truly great horror scenes.

The actors all bounced great off each other, and the seen with the hitchhiker is great overall. Leatherface is great too. Loved every minute of him, and man that dinner scene was great. Murders were nothing special, but for a low budget slasher from the 70s, I gotta give it a 8.Overall: 8/10.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
551,Cartoonyloonie,Psycho budget was only 700k above this?,4,23 August 2021,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is regarded by many horror enthusiasts to be a huge inspiration to slasher films such as the Halloween franchise or Black Christmas. However regardless of its influence, the film is frustrating to watch because of the writing, characters and lack of tension from start to finish. The story follows Sally, her wheel chaired brother and their group of friends on a trip to her Grandfather graveyard which from what she and her brother heard, as been vandalized. During their trip, they stop at a farm with the intention of acquiring gasoline for their van, but unfortunately they wouldn't be able to get out so easily as they have now crossed a family of cannibal psychos now awaiting for all of them to get picked off one by one. This film most likely received a lot of praises from setting the standard premise for many slasher movies to come, but being the ""original"" doesn't mean that its great.The biggest flaws with this film is in its characters and execution of the premise, and there have been a lot of defences for this movie being good or can't be greater because of its $140,000 budget. This is an understandable defence, but when taking Psycho into consideration, a movie that had a budget of $800,000, was able to tell a more captivating and satisfying story. What Psycho had over Texas is tension, from its score. Psycho soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann helps to evoke the sense of doubt and suspense, which that film consistently used during its runtime. This film lacked that suspence for the first 20-30 minutes, which is a long time for an hour and 23 minutes runtime. The first 20-30 minutes takes place on their way to the farm on the Van, which was at times obvious that they had shot the driving part in side a room with green screen, which can be seen by the windows being completely filled with white from time to time. Once the characters make it to the farm, instead of settling down together, they decide to split up, with two going for gasoline, and from then on they get picked off one by one. The main protagonists are very dull, all they do is scream, and every time one of them dies, they go out running alone screaming for the other name.In conclusion this film is only worth your time, if you are interested in film history, and would like to look at a film shot in low budget during the mid 70s because at its peak, its no different from what other horror movies have accomplished over the years.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Was honestly not much of a fan of the first maybe 50-60 minutes given the characters seemed rather bland and often made questionable decisions. However, the last 30 minutes or so with all the chase scenes were very tense and suspenseful. Even if some of the decisions in the chases were quite stupid, it was still a tense and thrilling segment of the movie to watch.What I Liked
70s aestheticthe lack of gratuitous violencethe really tense chase scenes (intensified by the chainsaw)What I Didn't Like

Most films get hung-up on pointless storytelling and plot devices that feel so unreal that they inhibit any resulting thrills - but not this movie!  In the documentary now available with some copies, one of the crew says ""THIS MOVIE HAS HOMOCIDE ON THE BRAIN!"" and that about sums it up.  And it's so refreshing not to see the creepy, fetishistic, unconvincing high-IQ killers that we get in Silence of the Lambs et al.  Equally, we don't suffer here from the drive to humanise/explain murderers that we get in Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer etc.  The fun of this movie in particular stems from the sheer inadequacy of the victims to escape the simplistic rage of the killers (if the police got involved, the murderers would be rounded up easily!) - plus, the proximity of a slaughterhouse to the murders gives a message of humans literally being like cattle to the slaughter (a message that secretly amuses animal liberation guys like me!).",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Director Tobe Hooper deconstructs a road movie into a non stopping horror thriller and an absolutely must-see classic, taking the film experience to the next level. He manages to create a strong and savage atmosphere with a series of elements that converge perfectly. From the title and the opening sequence of flashes we know we are dealing with a movie not to be taken lightly. The viewer can't never help felling helpless for the characters and that is probably due to the fact that the script does not ever need to rely on the classic horror script type. Here the characters decisions are completely believable. After all, once they know they are in trouble they hardly make any. And here is the strongest side to this film. The anguish and tension will NEVER stop. Not for a second. In fact, the viewer will be expecting it to drop down a bit, as any other film. No. Tension is hardly matchable, for as long as there is image projected on the screen. Camera work is very effective finding the right angle and height to create a disturbing image. Art direction is flawless, delivering one of the most macabre sets ever made on film. It is true that this is a low budget production and may seem annoying if one's not use to the photography of the genre. Not to worry, most likely you'll get the code quickly and jump in to a real bizarre, macabre and thrilling ride that really pushes the edge.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

As far as horror films go, this one wasn't detailed enough to keep the viewer interested or scary enough for horror buffs. The film has a greater focus on the chase scene then the deaths of 4 teenagers. The one thing I'm thankful for is that there wasn't a sequel. Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen.

I did admire the film's craftsmanship, pacing and the unique way it develops and executes its scares and sense of dread. One scene in particular was the film's high-point.

It's too bad that its reputation tends to precede it. Personally, although I'm a huge fan of horror, I'm not much of a fan of ""slasher"" movies.  TCM is what I'd call horror... not necessarily ""slasher."" In fact, I'm consistently surprised by the LACK of explicit violence in this film.  It's a testament to Hooper's directorial skill, and even more to the cinematographer's, that the fear TCM instills is more the result of technical artistry than explicitness.  And of course, the outright weirdness of the story and the characters helps too.  Another thing I love about TCM that rarely seems to be mentioned is the soundtrack--atmospherically speaking, it's first rate.  Chilling in its minimalism.  Words that describe TCM: Claustrophobic.  Sweaty.  Relentless.  In my opinion, the best of horror breaks down something like this:  TCM.  Night of the Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead.  Dracula (1931).  Psycho.

Very loosely based on Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein, the story sees five teenagers visiting Texas in order to check on a family grave after news reports of graves being desecrated. Unsuspectingly, they infringe the territory of a family of twisted cannibals, and once separated, they meet grisly deaths one by one at the hands of Leatherface, excellently acted by Gunnar Hansen.

The characters a feebly drawn out; one in particular is so annoying you will actually cheer when he gets sliced up, which, unfortunately, is not until near the end.However, the moment this character disappears, the film picks up. The last ten minutes are truly disturbing, with a fantastically done 'family dinner' scene, and the final chase.Its sad when a classic horror film is outdone by its remake, but the truth is TCM 2003 was a far superior film.

This movie scared me when I was eighteen. The first night I watched it, I could hardly sleep. It was and is quite unlike other horror films in that it has a very realistic almost documentary style to it.Now I consider myself to be somewhat of a horror movie buff. Before I had seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I had seen all the classics. Friday The 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead. Other horror movies I had seen were not necessarily scary in the lose sleep sense, they were scary in the intense feeling in the pit of your stomach sense.You may be asking, if the movie bothered you so much why such a high rating? Well, quite simply it set out to shock and disturb and it succeeded brilliantly. Comedies are suppose to make you laugh, sad movies are suppose to make you cry and horror movies are suppose to scare you. Texas Chainsaw Massacre did what it was suppose to do therefore it receives the rating it's getting.On final note. Last year I saw this movie at midnight screening.

The last 10 minutes if the movie is pretty much one of the characters screaming literally (in the original sense of the word) non-stop with at times almost nothing else going on but close ups of her as she screams. I just didn't find it scary and was slightly bored.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
580,Colm22,"A raw stomach-churning masterpiece, still arguably the most unsettling film ever made! At least better than House Of Wax!!",9,8 December 2005,"This is the type of masterpiece that modern films, horror and otherwise, struggle to live up to. The film creates a tone that is at times darkly comic as well as a creepy sense of inevitable terror from the very early scenes of grave-robbing, which are reminiscent of the unsettling open graveyard scene from George A. Romeros' Night Of The Living Dead. However there is something abut Hoopers' film that truly gets under the skin in the way many other films have achieved only fleetingly or generally not at all. One film that owes a great deal to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is The Silence Of The Lambs, in particular the scene where the kidnapped girl, Cathreine Martin sees the remains of a previous victims' fingernails on the wall of the well where they had probably tried to escape. Indeed both films are known to be influenced by real life serial killer Ed Gein and perhaps it is because of the fact that they are based on something as horrifying yet factual as those events which enables both films with the power to unsettle. In relation to Chainsaw, the barely adequate remake fails to capture the wonderfully sickening tone of the original which seemed to be able almost to make you smell the abattoir that the characters smell and really put you in there with them, making the violence which ensues all the more shocking. The lack of any musical score is also effective in creating a sense of reality, in contrast to the (excellent) music in John Carpenters' Halloween which though it is a great film, you never get the feeling that it is anything more than a film. With The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, thanks in part to the final image of 'Leatherface' waving the titular weapon against the backdrop of the Texas sun, there is no sense of closure. We are reminded that events as gruesome as those in the film do and will continue to happen and that out there somewhere in the realm of cinema, that family is still alive, doing what they do. This is a much more terrifying thought if it is left in the viewers' mind, without any consideration given to the rubbish sequels and vastly inferior remake.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I don't CARE, he's killing people because he wants to wear their frickin' SKIN! Turn all the lights out and watch this by yerself.

582,Milkybarkid104,Chilling to the core!,8,29 December 2014,"It is often said that what makes a horror movie truly terrifying is one simple phrase to accompany all the bloodshed, ' Based on a true story'. Never has this been more true for a movie than in 'Texas chainsaw massacre'! As we see the scenes of brutality on our screen, and acts of cannibalism and body dismemberment we think that surely it can only be a thing of imagination, the creation of a writer, only before we will grimly remember that ominous message that we saw at the beginning. It is for this reason, and many others, that this goes down as one of the all time greats of the horror genres. Leather face is among the most iconic of all film characters. From his barely human grunts for communication to his foul acts, he will be remembered with other classics like Michael Myers and Hannibal Lecter. In an ideal world, I would have liked a slightly longer movie but I am aware that is a sort of cap on how long a film of this genre can be before it gets boring and repetitive so I don't hold this against the movie.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Most of the scenes cut away from the violence immediately, and it's back to riveting ""where did our friends go?"" waiting around scenes. Also, the backwoods hick nature of the family makes them more comical than scary, so the last thirty minutes of the film is just sort of silly, like a weird Beverly Hillbillies/Addams family hybrid. My questions are: what happens to the trucker who initially stops to save Sally? She gets away, but he's stuck there with Leatherface and all he did was help her out. Also, could the wheelchair guy be more whiny and useless? Lastly, were the teens and their van based on ""Scooby-doo?""

Sure it's a little dated (it was made in 1974 and shot on 16mm film), but it's got the heart of a lion. The reason this film is considered an absolute classic is because regardless of the story not being 100% true, it FEELS so real. It's VERY believable that something like that can actually happen in real life. The fact that it's virtually bloodless/goreless, contradictory to what so many people have claimed over the years, shows just how much of an effect it has on the viewer. Also, notice there is NO musical score in the entire movie. Just odd sounds, screaming and a chainsaw buzzing, which only helps to create a terrifying atmosphere that seems so real. All of this and more is the reason why the slickly produced soul-less Hollywood remake can't touch the original.

Despite all the praise i thought it was a waste of time. The film is about a bunch of kids who have no brains so they trespass onto someone elses property. Were they expecting the owners to be pleased? One of the stand out scenes is where a girl is hung on a meathook. Though its not graphic the idea is still rather unpleseant. However there is no reason to flinch because its so hammy. Seeing as you would stay away from Leatherfaces smelly house you should stay away from the DVD as it carries the same unpleseant oders.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
592,d-madar,The only film to ever scare me,10,12 May 2007,"Gripping, terrifying and devastatingly upfront. There is nothing that quite compares to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even though several sequels, a remake and a prequel have since been made. Not to mention countless other slasher films that have no doubt been influenced by this incredible film. So what makes this better than the rest? There are many reasons. The story is allowed to build up and the plot is actually realistic and believable, unlike so many modern horror films. Leatherface is huge, brutal and merciless - he's simply terrifying. The sound effects fit the movie and the setting and horror house (filled with bones and skin masks etc) substantially adds to the realism and fright of the movie.There is a huge sense of mystery within this film and the tension builds up unbearably. We are kept guessing the outcome right till the end. The dinner scene is possibly the most harrowing moment of film ever. There is no sense of the supernatural here; It feels horribly real.Please Ignore all the bad ratings of this film! Of course if you don't enjoy horror movies you're definitely not going to like this. What makes this film greater is that the killer's background and motives aren't explained. The unknown is one of the most frightening thoughts. Not every little detail has to be revealed.Definitely not for the faint hearted. Be prepared to be shocked and scared in the extreme without barely witnessing a drop of blood. A true classic; Something that you must see at least once in your life. Forget the remake, this is the real deal. The film was always meant to be twisted and horrible and this is very much achieved",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
593,paul_draper2001,Disturbing! (contains spoilers),7,12 June 2002,"This film really did take my breath away.  Being 17 when i saw it last year on channel4 in Britain, and also being male doesn't seem to make it easier telling your friends you were scared by a movie.  But when one of those friends agrees with you and you realise you're not the only one to think it, it does help.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is truly THE most frightening film i have ever seen.  I usually tend to be a fan of the horror genre, in fact The Shining is my favourite film of all time, but no film i have seen since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre has ever been good enough in creating the same impact and shock upon me.  When discussing it with people of a similar age what they thought of the film, most responses thought it was a lousy film and was funny in parts.  As a generalisation (and i know this isnt always the case) it seems a lot of people who think that the film isnt anywhere scary at all, do not know it was actually based on fact.  When i told some of my friends this (they didn't know) they changed their minds slightly about the film.This is the main feature when watching this movie is that knowing its based on fact, you can't help but feel for the characters.  Sure, you know they are being played by actors and aren't actually being brutally murdered, however you can't help being reminded in your mind that most of the gruesome scenes which are shown has actually happened to someone.There truly are disturbing murders shown and what becomes of the corpses, but this film's title shouldn't be taken too literally! - there is only one person shown that is actually killed by a chainsaw, however not every film is true to the title and you do also get the hint the main murderer - Leatherface (who wears a mask of human skin) does kill regularly with his chainsaw.  Probably one of the worst scenes that i remember in this film is of the murder of the first girl; having attempted to run away from leatherface, she is grabbed by him and dragged into the slaughter room, where her live body is hung on a meat hook, while in front of her we see Leatherface working on the dead body of her boyfriend - mutilating it with the chainsaw.  This is just one example of many in the film where in breaks through the boundary's of conventional horror.Marilyn Burns cannot be corrected for her brilliant acting and realism, when she plays the tortured survivor Sally Hardesty.  Having had her four other friends murdered by the disturbingly psychotic Leatherface, she becomes the only one to survive but has to endure an unbelievable torture by Leatherface's family of psychopaths.This, is another part of the film in which you really feel for the character.  Having been chased a long distance by Leatherface and his chainsaw, she finally comes to a man who appears she is safe with, only to find out he is part of the disturbing family and captures her, where she is being skinned at the dinner table.  Marilyn Burns plays on your emotions even more by the constant screaming, to which no one can hear (thus needing the tagline from Aliens - In Texas, no one can hear you scream).  An effective use of the camera also helps to sink more fear into you.  A close-up of her eye, which is moving all the time and staring completely helps to show us how she feels, in a way it puts us in her situation, feeling her fear.  A point-of-view shot in the same scene also does this, showing us the table with the family around and the youngest member mimicking her cries as he goes on to torture her.  It is only by a careless moment by this person that lets her escape, but even then it isn't over. When she runs out of the house, Leatherface is soon to follow her, chasing with the chainsaw again.  What perhaps is also disturbing in this outside shot, is that we can tell it is now daylight, having been captured in the dark night before.  So we can only imagine just how long she has been in there, being tortured.From the moment the horror starts, it never stops in this film until the end.  This was a low-budget film, but was a high budget required? the answer is no.  This film is a slasher-movie being propelled to its most potential in shocking you...and it works.If you think this film is rubbish, that is your choice.  I recommend this film to all die-hard horror fans, like myself (as i mentioned) but dont expect it to be similar to horror films you have already seen.  If you have seen similar movies - they are most likely made after 1974.Great film, shocking, powerful and disturbing but a great film.

Of course the formula was there before Texas Chainsaw Massacre existed but never utilised in such a nightmarish way as this. I first watched it on a bad VHS on an equally bad TV set and ever since I have been a fan. The violence and gore do seem tame in comparison to films like Martyrs, Srpski Film e.t.c. but the atmosphere is unique and daring even still. There are sequences where the essence of a nightmare is obtained effortlessly, it seems, with no famous actors, high budget set, orchestra score or extensive special effects. The most charming aspect of this film for me is the pure artistic endeavour. A tree with hundreds of watches nailed to it, a horn through a sheep skull, a leather mask.

Many people might think that this film is just a trash because of the crappy remakes but trust me, this film is so well made, probably the best horror film after 1973s The Sisters (At least to me). Making you surprised by the loud sound effects are NOT scary. For example, your friend surprises you by pushing you suddenly or something like that doesn't mean that the friend is scary. Many modern films are like that. Just making you surprise by appearing suddenly. But in this film it's different. It creeps you out just by pure director's talent. See, Tobe Hooper truly has a talent. He is like a man born to make horror film which is the opposite of modern director who makes shitty horrors. It really will creep you out, not by surprising scenes but really scary scenes. How scary is it? A LOT. Actually this is the first film that I thought that it is scary enough. The last scene when the girl escapes from the creepy family, it feels like we had escaped from the nightmare which is very remarkable.If you want to see something scary, and you really want to taste the true taste of horror, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE 1973 IS WAITING FOR YOU!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
601,street_trash,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974),10,2 June 2016,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the universally recognised shocking films in horror cinema and it has stunned audiences since its release in 1974. Upon release, TCM faced a total storm of outcry, censorship and controversy for its exploitative nature. It's a fiercely effective film that successfully manages to massively disturb viewers with them barely witnessing a single drop of blood. Using an unbelievable level of suspense, insane background music and psychological horror results in an atmospheric film that leaves a lasting impact of genuine fear and uneasiness upon whoever watches.The film tells a fairly simple tale - sweet natured Sally Hardesty, her wheelchair bound brother Franklin and their friends Pam, Kirk and Jerry take a road trip to rural Texas to investigate reports that have suggested grave-robbings have been occurring - so the group make a brief stop at her grandfather's grave to check it is still intact. Little do the five unsuspecting friends realise the real terror of what is hiding beyond the graves is a certain chainsaw- wielding, skin-wearing maniac and his deranged family. Marilyn Burns steals the show as our ""final girl"" and definitely gives it her absolute all to gain the scream queen title in what must have been an exhausting and traumatising role. Gunnar Hansen's exceptional portrayal of the iconic villain Leatherface offers glimpses behind the mask into the character's tortured and crazed soul.Despite the incredibly low budget of the film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is certainly startling and impressive looking. Director Tobe Hooper clearly had a sharp eye for effective and breathtaking shots in such an early stage of his career. Extreme close up shots of Sally's petrified eyes help you understand her absolute terror in the most personal way. Hooper creates such an unbearable atmosphere and descends the viewer into the sheer madness of the situation - especially throughout the hypnotic climatic scene. The gritty cinematography is so effective and efficient - conveying perfectly the impending doom of the cast.Astonishingly, despite the gruesome title, there is very little blood spilled in the entire run time - probably making this one of the most misleading names of a horror film in history. Audiences will never see a meat hook impaling human skin, a hammer slamming against anyone's head, or even a chainsaw touching anyone's skin. The chainsaw itself mentioned in the title is only used once. The film relies on the viewer's ability to use their imagination and fills in the gaps themselves. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was refused a certificate for theatrical release and remained banned for a remarkable 25 years in the UK. In 1999 the film was finally given an 18 certificate which is rather interesting when you consider that the film is tremendously tame by today's standards, especially in terms of graphic content.The raw and grainy quality of the film topped with the striking production design gives it such a dirty realism that hasn't been matched in a horror film since. It completely immerses the viewer into the sheer filth and decay of the town. The heat of the blazing summer sun paired with the rotting stench of the town almost oozes through the screen. The soundtrack contributes massively to the film's overall tone of terror and insanity. The score is minimal and consists mostly of noisy, bizarre tones resembling metallic scrapes, screams and occasional percussion - showing proof of experimentation that speaks the language and evokes the atmosphere of the slaughterhouse and the state of mind of the demented family.Some modern filmmakers should go back to the roots of where it all begun and take note - cheap jump scares and buckets of blood is not entirely necessary to provoke genuine shock from your viewer. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a perfect example that heavily uses the reliance of suggestion and implication rather than off the wall and in your face gore to make the film all the more terrifying. This is an incredibly rare tactic and one that, even 40 years after release is still horrifying and shall continue to unnerve audiences for years to come.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
602,MoLetalis,The Texas Brain Cell Massacre,4,20 April 2019,"This movie gave me the wrong idea to start with. It spends an enormous amount of time on the Franklin character in the wheelchair: how he is obsessed with blood and killing animals, his continuing interest in a violent/crazy hitchhiker with a knife, his growing grudge against his friends that neglect him and don't really want him to be there due to his immobility, how his dad owns a deserted house somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Texas. I was honestly convinced either one of the following plot twists was about to happen: 1) Franklin is just faking his disability and is actually Leatherface (who has the same build, interests for killing living beings and it would explain the mask); 2) Franklin has been bringing strangers/roadtrippers to his father's house for his deranged family to murder and barbecue. But this didn't happen. What's the point then in spending so much time on this character? He gets killed in 10 seconds out of nowhere by some guy with a chainsaw. From there on the movie is just nothing but recycled chase scenes, featuring an incredibly dumb and non-stop screaming woman (it was horror to my ears) and some crazy people laughing. I know it's an old, low-budget movie, but that doesn't mean that it's anything remotely close to being special or good. Did I really miss out on something here? I don't understand the positive reputation and why it's widely acknowledged as a horror ""masterpiece"".

603,jp80-552-991433,Homicide on it's brain...,10,11 December 2012,"I have to start by saying that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not just one of the greatest horror movies of all time but one of the greatest movies of all time. Intriguing but uncomfortable viewing from the off, it is genuinely one of the most admirable pieces of cinema ever made. Of course for some present day first time viewers it may seem a little dated but for any movie connoisseur it is a treat (or nightmare) of a film with very few peers.I will forever remember the first time I watched TTCM and whilst it scared the pants off of me, I immediately fell in love with it. Quite simply TTCM succeeds in doing exactly what it was made to do. To make you feel nauseous, claustrophobic, stressed, upset, hot, sweaty, scared and in the end, mentally exhausted.A low budget production and shot in sweltering conditions in the Texan dessert (100 deg +), even the infamous dinner scene which gives the impression of night, was shot during the day with black curtains used throughout the house to give the effect of darkness. It's details like this which give TTCM the kind of character and unique ID that generally only low budget or old, classic movies can provide.The score for the film is unsettling (pots and pans being bashed) but ultimately just adds to the terrifying and almost unbearable atmosphere throughout. Having watched it the first time one of the main things that I couldn't get my head around was, why the BBFC had banned TTCM from British viewing after its initial release? A decision which is just as ridiculous today as it must have been back then. Because whilst TTCM is infamous in part for it's brutality, there is hardly any bloody moments and no lavish graphic violence, it is all in the mind and psychological. Which is something that many modern day movies (especially horrors) lack the intelligence to succeed in doing.I don't want to spoil any of the film content itself, I just wanted to give people who haven't seen the film, hopefully a slightly different insight to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Many films will try and be TTCM but ultimately, they will fail and there will always only be one. Enjoy.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This is a review in 2016 and I can say that it has a few good actors, and some awesome atmosphere. However a low budget is very apparent. I also am not a fan of the way the movie was filmed and edited. Every single scene when something is actually happening there is a cut to a different angle and then back to the same one at least 2-3 times and I find it distracting. It's not completely damning but it is annoying. With the awkward editing mostly poor acting, low budget, and a protagonist who's scream sounds like he's stuck in puberty is a much better film enjoyed as a comedy.

I have watched this movie countless times and it still makes the hairs on my skin stand up.

In fact the narrator informs us of it. Then as the small company of five proceed they (and we) sense that something REALLY BAD is going on in this little part of Texas.YES the performances are not exactly Oscar worthy. YES, the female protagonist does not hit a spot with her ""lines"" (it is almost completely screams to be honest), but the atmosphere, the beautiful, macabre (and sometimes innovative) violence of the movie and the constant, - as worst as it gets- escalating horror make Texas Chainsaw Massacre a thrilling ride to enjoy.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The fodder (sorry, _characters_) are zero-dimensional (with the possible exception of the disabled brother). Tension is non-existent. The chainsaw scenes are risible.In mitigation, it is not _completely_ without merit. There are occasional flashes of black humour, and the girl-on-a-meathook scene is the one part which I found genuinely disturbing. That said, I spent about 90% of the film thinking ""get on with it"".It is supposed to be shocking and disturbing. Unfortunately that is about all that it is. I wasn't shocked and was rarely disturbed so I'm afraid it was just a waste of 83 minutes of my life.

613,tommyinferno,A classic that defined a genre...,10,9 May 2019,"Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is not only one of the best horror movies of all time but it's one of the most influential and successful, giving us one of the most recognisable slashers in horror...Leatherface, the chainsaw wielding psychopath who will haunt anyone who watched this movie. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre follows a group of teens including Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) and her brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain), along with their supporting cast of teens. After a series of grave robbings, they are heading out to their grandfather's grave in Texas to see if it has been vandalized. After they visit their family's old farmhouse, they stumble across a family of psychopaths living next door. The cast of killers include Drayton Sawyer played by Jim Siedow, as the head of the family, Bubbins Sawyer played by Edwin Neal, Grandpa Sawyer played by John Dugan and of course Leatherface played by Gunnar Hansen. Each member of the cast really stands out in their role and plays their role to perfection the stand outs are Marilyn Burns, Jim Siedow, Edwin Neal and Gunnar Hansen, all making their characters so believable. The clever thing about The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is that despite the name the movies kill count is surprisingly low, it's the eerie setting and the notorious music and sound effects that really make the movie unsettling and fools you into thinking it was gorier than it really was.

617,CMManiac,"Unsurpassed, a true mark in the true Horror",10,19 March 2009,"In a few words, first: raw, sick, filthy, shocking, and perverse to the core.The original TCM is an unparalleled achievement and a priceless contribution for the classic, gory horror cult genre. This movie is all about revisiting torture, in many forms, over and over again.Make no mistakes. This is one of those movies that you either have to say you love or hate. There is no way of standing in the middle. ""Normal"" people will probably tend to reject and ostracize it, making use of the argument that it has no plot, no fundament, no substance. That this is just free violence for the sake of shock and controversy. Trend freaks will probably tend to say they loved it just because nowadays it seems hip and fun and fashionable to appreciate explicit gore and violence and torture through movies, especially in the so called classic ones. These too have no idea what this movie is about. Most likely, a great number of them hasn't even seen it yet. Intelectuals or pseudo-intelectuals will probably tend to regard it as a low budget groundbreaking, avant-garde movie, although deep down inside, it's unlikely that there is any part in them capable of feeling something other than disgust by its essence.I could go on for hours.Then, there are others, whose irrational morbid fascination for the ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre lacks a proper explanation. Better yet, lacks a need to be explained. Those people relate to the movie simply because its true core appeals to them, and despite the fact that most of them will actually try to verbalize an explanation, I feel there is no need for it. Some people are just more connected to some things than others. Watch American Psycho, watch the scene where he is exercizing, and look at the movie playing in the background. It's just something you feel. Not something you think.And for me, this movie is perfect in every way.""I was just standing in Montgomery Ward's, in front of an upright display of chainsaws, thinking of a way to get through the crowd.

621,tatra-man,"Indisbutably a classic of cinema, and not just horror cinema",10,16 January 2006,"Those who have posted here comparing Tobe Hooper's (one and only) masterpiece with the dreadful remake are presumably young children with no real understanding of cinema. The 1974 film is the antithesis of the slick, MTV-influenced, cynical cash-in mentality that informed the later remake. The fact that the remake's target teen audience (well, at least some of them) appeared to lap it up is just a sad reflection of how far standards have fallen since the heyday of the horror film in the 70's. But Hooper's CHAINSAW is more than just a classic horror film. With its print in the permanent collection at the NY Museum of Modern Art, it truly is a classic of cinema. I've shown this to Bergman fans, Tarkovsky fans and, yes, horror fans too - none of them have been prepared for its power, its inventiveness, its willingness to push the envelope of what cinema can do. And, with its simple story and powerhouse, unstoppable delivery, it is as open to interpretation as any piece of ""modern art"" - whether it be from the ""vegetarian treatise"" angle, or the post-Vietnam traumatised America school of thought. But, as I was on my first (of several) viewings, those I have introduced to this movie have been bowled over by the quality of the film-making, and the filmic techniques (soundtrack, editing, startling images) used by Hooper to capture his ""waking nightmare"" on screen. It is something I really don't think any other film has quite achieved, though many have tried.Now, of course, there is a fluke element at work here. Hooper never came close to achieving anything like this again, and many, though not all, of the film's fascinating resonances are a product of the era and the filmmaker's unconscious sensibilities. What he obviously had as a director was the kind of daring to take the visceral power that cinema can deliver so well to the limit, to the the edge of acceptability, skirting on exploitation. That the film is so unrelentingly dark and so unbelievably sadistic in its second half, and yet fascinates even as it traumatises, is a definite testimony to the skill of its director. What could have been sleaze is instead a horrible nightmare experience, sure enough, but one that borders on the transcendental.

What makes the film so exceptional is contrary to the films reputation there is the minimal amount of actual on screen gore or cheesy dramatic ""horror music."" Instead the film barrages you with raw psychological fear. The lack of over the top music leaves you with the terrified screams of the main characters as they confront their antagonists, as does the grainy looking film which makes it appear to be more of a home-movie gone wrong than a film at all.The appearance of Leatherface for the first time, for example is handled as casually as the appearance of any other lead character, but then of course we know the result of his appearance and cannot help but be shocked by what follows within the space of about 20 seconds afterwards.Make no mistake this film is a test in psychological strength and questions us what we would do in the situations as poor Marilyn Burns.While the film may look dated in this age of extreme gore and ""jump scares"" their is no denying the craft that has gone into this. There are some beautiful bits of camera-work and the little music that does occur is chilling and well used.The only real complaint is maybe the acting could have been tidied up in some parts, as could the character development so we truly feel for the other characters other than Sally.

Now i had seen the remake first so i was thinking well this has to be immortal and well i was wrong. The story starts off with a group of hippies consisting of Sally Hardesty ,her brother Franklin, boyfriend Jerry, and other friends kirk and pam. They are travelling through Texas when they check up to see if there grandparents (sally and franklins grandparents) graves had been robbed . then they pick up a strange hitchhiker who cuts his hand and franklin, they throw him out of the van. They soon need to get gas but after trying at a gas station there is none left so then franklin suggests they go to the house where there old grandparents live so they do. Kirk and Pam go to where they think is a waterhole but on the way there they here a generator and believe that at another old house they may have gas for their van. they dont no this is leatherfaces house. Kirk goes into this house and see's many bones of animals and humans runs up to them and leatherface ambushes him with a mallet which leaves kirk's body in spasm. Leatherface hits him again pulls him in then slams that metal door. Pam then goes into the house looking for kirk she finds a room full of human bones and animal bones goes out of the room where leatherface comes crashing through that door chases her and takes her into his layer where he hangs pam on a meat hook and chainsaws kirk into pieces in front of pams on eyes. Later jerry decides to go look for them alone finds the house goes inside sees the meat hook drenched in blood then heres banging from a closet opens it and see's the twitching body of Pam. Leatherface then hits Jerry over the head with a mallet. Sally and Franklin go searching for the group before finally leatherface kills franklin with a chainsaw, then chases Sally to the gas station they had been to earlier this is where the cook takes her back to leatherfaces house because he's pure evil. sally watches the hitchhiker the cook and leatherface consume flesh. and she also meets the old man who sucks fingers strangely. soon she escapes and is chased by Leatherface and the hitchhiker before he is ran over by a lorry. sally then escapes from leatherface and if you ask me shes insane.Well my opinion was this was boring the deaths happened to quick acting was poor the remake beat this by far but still this film was impressive go see if you like horror not good for the weak hearted5 out of 10 joe swed",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

635,Doktormanden,Deep cultural horror disguised as conventional slasher,9,17 June 2014,"Stating that Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) is disguised as a conventional slasher is a bit of stretch in itself as the movie was released before the slasher genre made its way into the mainstream with movies such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). However TCM acted as a trailblazer for the genre and laid out the ""rules"" that the following movies would utilize and manipulate. The style of TCM differs from the typical Gothic horror of earlier Hollywood horror films as well as the suspense horror that was made popular by Alfred Hitchcock in the middle of the 20th century. TCM focuses on our own cultural anxieties in the build-up and the completion of the victim's journey. By drawing upon these shared fears and anxieties the film is able to touch the audience on a very personal level and by creating characters that are relatable it all becomes much more real and frightening.In TCM we can quickly establish that the band of friends who are driving through the remote Texas landscape (which is actually 30 minutes from Austin – The capital of Texas) are "" attractive, energetic actors who radiate good health and normality"" (Dika 1987:89). Except for maybe the most peculiar character of the group, Franklin, the paraplegic brother to the film's heroine Sally. Franklin's dependency and helplessness acts as a slow burning catalyst for our excitement in the narrative build-up. We are left speculating how he is going to survive what is coming (or how he will be killed). It is no secret that some running will be required on behalf of our victims at some point sooner or later; the movie is called Texas Chainsaw Massacre after all. The introduction of the films legendary bad guy, Leatherface stands as one of horror cinemas finest bad guy introductions. It doesn't over compensate or tease the audience in any way, he shows up, does his thing and then disappears (the sound of that door closing will stay with you forever). What makes Leatherface who he is is the mask he wears made out of human stitched together human faces. The face that he wears a mask is a very important tool from the filmmaker's side in order to dehumanize him. They control the amount of information the audience are able to decode in relation to the killer by making him wear a mask. The access we get to the look and personality of Leatherface is extremely limited and by dehumanizing him in this fashion it is left to the audience to use their imagination in order to give him form. Because of this the audience is left unable to identify with the killer in any way (hopefully), which serves to make him all the more horrifying. To sum it all up, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a groundbreaking, low budget, horror movie that alters all the previous rules in the genre while comfortably establishing a new set of guidelines for subsequent movies in the genre to follow. If you feel like taking a break from the modern gore-dependent slasher horror films being spat out by Hollywood then take a trip back to the early dawn of the low-budget slasher genre with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

People usually say that the original was the best but in my opinion that's not the case with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
638,colossu5,One of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life.,1,15 January 2006,"Too bad there's no 0 out of 10 rating or this movie would easily get that. The only reason you should ever watch this movie is if you are planning on shooting your own horror picture and want a good idea of what NOT to do. Here's a list of reasons why this movie is so bad: 1) The first half of the movie. Nothing happens in the first half. Basically it's a bunch of idiots in their van talking about random stuff without a point. There was so much potential for character development and make the viewer actually care about the characters, but no. This renders the first half of the movie a complete waste of film.2) The second half of the movie! (surprise surprise) FINALLY the first half is over and maybe some interesting stuff will happen. Right? WRONG! The beginning of the second half consists of what I like to call ""negative character development"" (meaning the characters keep complaining and acting like jerks so I actually DISLIKE them even more than before). Afterwards when somebody goes missing, these idiots go one at a time to investigate (which is actually a good thing because seeing as I actually wanted the characters to die, it would increase the chances that my wish would be granted). And then when leatherface is chasing the last remaining character around, that is laughable because in one shot he is close and in the next he is far away and the next he is close again. The last remaining character acts really dumb as well. And then the ending (i.e. the stuff that happens after the night ends) is a complete joke. As a result, the film becomes funny in a pathetic sort of way rather than scary.3) The cinematography wasn't done well (i.e. I know nothing about film but I could've done a better job shooting the movie).4) There was no explanation for anything. This in combined with the ridiculous appearance and actions of the whole cannibal family makes it all the more silly (the grandfather character was especially silly and should not have even been in the script - he looked like some kid dressed up in some goofy halloween outfit that's not creepy at all).5) The acting, for the most part, was terrible.6) Too clichéd. (i.e. the main character running from the bad guy, tripping, falling, getting back up, and running more).Final verdict: 0/10. Everything about this movie is all either laughable (in a mocking sort of way) or just plain stupid, and not scary at all. The only good thing about this movie is that many of the characters (who you grow to hate during the movie) die. So unless you feel like wasting your money buying/renting this, never see it. You'll just find yourself checking your watch every 2-3 minutes. If you're looking for a scary classic movie, go see Halloween.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Well, I was very wrong about that.  TCM really scared me.  It seemed so real, thanks to the terrific directing and excellent cast.  This movie is definitely not a Hollywood-type of film.The director was very creative with the camera angles.  My favorite angle was the close, close-ups of the victim's eyes.

Instead of the usual horror movie build-up, with suspense music and the like, Chain Saw springs the violence on you without warning.  The deaths are startling for their realism.  The horror builds in some subtle ways--shots of road-killed animals unsettle you early on, and a little blood is used suggestively to make you imagine you've seen a lot of gore.  The film looks cheap, but Hooper's direction makes sophisticated use of motifs, focus changes, and other innovative techniques.  An early scene involving flash photography is incredibly disturbing.  Much of the story is implied rather than explained, so the movie gets better with repeat viewings.This may be too weird and intense for some viewers, but if you're open to that sort of thing, give this one a chance.

646,dvdWarrior,Night-time Visions of Very Bad Things... (may contain spoilers),7,19 June 2002,"Some people say this film is the greatest horror film ever made.  I don't believe I can agree with that, but it is without question a trend setter in the field.  While the plot itself leaves a lot to be desired, and the characters aren't developed very well, this film brings a lot to the table. Without an enormous budget, and with very few special effects at their disposal, Toby Hooper and his crew were left to their own devices.  They did very well with what they had, believe me.  This movie explodes out of the gates, and it never lets up.  It's as intense as they come, and it was genuinely frightening.I've heard it said that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is almost like a documentary, and that much is certainly true.  This film is a certifiable trip into a deranged and macabre surreality that lingers even after the credits have rolled.  This film really plays with the mind, relying on creative psychological film making to provides its chills.  So much of the action takes place in almost tangible darkness; the woods through which Marilyn Burns flees her demented pursuer Leatherface were thick and tangled. At times, the only light came from the full moon above.  Even the name, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has an impact, drawing disturbing ideas to mind that, combined with the sounds and camera angles convince you to see things the film makers weren't able to put on camera.  Because of the name, most people believe this film to be much more violent than it actually was. Here's to making what you've got work for you.The film itself was a bit grainy, a little dated by time, but I think that makes it seem all the more real, and the dvd contains one of the best commentary tracks currently available.  This film is definately worth owning, especially if your a fan of horror, but visit the sequels at your own risk. I don't think this is the greatest horror movie of all time, but it is definately a cornerstone of the genre, and without our good buddy Leatherface, there may never have been a Jason or a Freddy.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
647,heavybloozer,T for Texas,10,16 July 2007,"TCM(short for Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is without a doubt one of the greatest and (together with ""The LastHouse on the left"" and ""Halloween"") influential horror films of all time. But horror isn't nearly enough to describe what's going on in this twisted tale of incestuous rednecks torturing young stoners in the sticky heat of Texas.------------------------------------------------ -Terror is quite appropriate i think. The film is downright nasty and gruesome in every way. It's gritty realism and innovative camera technique still fasciantes and shocks today. Tobe Hooper's film is atmospheric and you can feel the heat and dirt literally crawlin up on you. The influence of TCM can be felt even today(just look at Hoistel or High Tension for which i also wrote reviews).

648,das_r,Simply the best horror movie I've ever seen,10,12 June 2007,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of 1974 is a masterpiece in the horror genre and simply the best horror movie I've ever seen. Only the name says it all: On the one hand it sounds hard, cruel and dramatic, on the other hand, it might be the title of a documentation as well. And that's why I love this movie so much: It has this factual atmosphere, which I think is far more realistic that if it would have been dramatized; because in this documentation style, everything that happens seems to be so real. For sure this is a question of taste whether you rather like it realistic or bloody, but I think it is good the movie is so factual.The figures in this movie are worked out really good, for example the crazy hitch-hiker, the emotionless-seeming Kirk, (sexy) Pam with her bad presentiments (as the movie shows, she was perfectly right), and not to forget, the filling station attendant with his rough attitude and his mixture of sympathy and lust for kill. The actors are all really good and you can identify with the group of teenagers.Tobe Hooper is very good in building up excitemtent. For more than an hour, there is nothing cruel or scaring, just a few bad signs (the hitch-hiker of course, or the drunken guy telling them sinnister things), everything seems to be so happy, but then Kirk gets careless, and at one go, the whole day turns into a massacre.There is a lot of brutality in this movie, but Tobe Hooper isn't in need of bloody slasher scenes like in Hostel or in the remake. All brutality is rather in the viewer's fantasy than on the screen. It's the atmosphere (for example this legendary starting scene) and the insinuated sequences that make this movie so scaring.It is thrilling till the end. Sally, who will be the only one to survive, is not personated as the hero of the movie (like Jessica Biel in the remake), and she is captured in the house and nearly killed. Even in the last sequence of the movie is is not clear until the end whether Leatherfae gets her or not.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This is the best of the best and it shall never be matched. Its impact is eternal, it inspired the intensity of Alien and all other subtle yet intense horror films, it of course inspired a lot of horrible knock offs, sequels and remakes, but more importantly it inspired me to love fear and to love all things grotesque.

650,mini_productions-2008,Warning Contains Spoilers!,10,23 April 2008,Warning Contains Spoilers! Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an awesome 70's film that started the slasher film genre. The plot for this film is basically four teens are heading to a certain house to explore and while there two of the four go into another house over by the first and Kirk the gets hooked by Leatherface(Gunnar Hansen) then Pamela his girlfriend goes in to search for him and she too gets hooked by Leatherface. Sally and her brother Franklin who is a wheelchair bound guy and Jerry start to wonder where are Pamela and Kirk. Soon Jerry goes in the house to search for the two teens and Jerry finds Pamela barely alive and soon too is attacked and killed by Leatherface. Now with only Sally and Franklin left they both go looking for their friends when they discover horrors all around the house soon being chased by Leatherface outside the house. Sooner Franklin gets killed and Sally finds a gas station unknown to her that Leatherface's uncle(Jim Siedow) works there he soon knocks Sally out and takes her to the house. When she wakes up shes sitting at a dinner table with Drayton and Leatherface's brother the hitchhiker the guy Sally and her friends picked up on the way to the house. Drayton soon brings Grandpa down(John Dugan)where they tell grandpa to kill Sally by hitting her over the head with a hammer when this fails Sally finds a way out of the house where she is chased by Leatherface and the hitchhiker. She soon comes across a street where the hitchhiker is run over by a truck the truck driver offers to help Sally that is until he sees Leatherface Sally hops in quickly while Leatherface tries to chainsaw the door down soon he comes around the other side where Sally jumps out and climbs into an oncoming truck. As the truck drives away she laughs as if shes been driven insane by the whole ordeal while Leatherface angrily swings his chainsaw in the air.

The most believable acting is by the killer.

The story tells of five teens who are going to one of theirs grandpas home when they run out of gas and wonder off to the territory of leatherface a evil killer and his family. The camera was a nice touch that really hooked me up on the film. The two females in the film are very good looking.The character in the wheelchair gave the film a nice touch it gave a real sense. The killings aren't that creative but they are filmed really nice. This is another thing i enjoyed from the film Sallys chase scene her screaming and the chainsaw really scared me like a lot.

658,jesusatan2001,The Best Horror Film,10,28 October 2003,"The (original) Texas Chainsaw Massacre, is without a doubt in my mind, the most impressive horror film to date. No other horror film stays with you in the same way. You feel not only fearful for the characters, but at times feel afraid for your own safety. The natural lighting and loose, improvised acting style creates a strong sense of reality that no other horror film can possibly achieve. Under a thin layer of dated aesthetics (1973 style of dress) lies the most dangerous, horrifying and psychotic world ever committed to script or screen. As the first of its kind, this movie set the mold for the modern horror film, though none were ever to realize any comparable distinction. It gave birth to the ""slasher"" genre (for better or for worse) . It is also one of few timeless films that has managed to combine horror and avant-garde styles, successfully. Unlike its remake, this one is more of an exercise in minimalism and simplicity (think even Dogme). The expert subtlety of the filmmakers; Tobe Hooper (writer/director), Kim Henkel (co-writer) and Daniel Pearl (cinematographer) results more inpsychological terror than in gore. The air-tight script, jarring realism and attention to detail are unparalleled in practically any film, horror or otherwise. And last, but by far not the least Marylin Burns PHENOMENAL performance is the only in cinematic history (a close second by that of Shelly Duvall in The Shining) that evokes such a nature of desperate and primal fear.

Jessica Biel is terrible. good looking but terrible. anyway, then Leatherface shows up. and the audience gets a look around the house. its starting to get a little better.

663,noah-isaac-levin,"Cheap gore, exploitation in place of mood, feeling and anxiety.",4,11 June 2014,"Where to start. The villains are stupid idjit rednecks that I found to be annoying and harmless as kittens. The main character of the second half only has about ten lines in the first half, I didn't even know here name for the first 45 minutes. The only character that I cared about, the guy in the wheelchair, the only character where the filmmakers showed any subsidence is killed off so fast he may just have been a red shirt. I laughed out loud so many times during this movie, at how idiotic and silly that it seemed to me, that this is just not horror. It only gets scares from gore and revulsion. That is not good horror to me, that is a cheep out. Plus Leatherface, chasing a girl with a horrible ineffective weapon, that they show is horribly ineffective in the movie, for that matter. And another thing I could not get over about this movie is that when Leatherface is chain sawing this door (very slowly) that they showed less than a minute ago was unlocked. I know he is not bright, like a giant man child, but I assume he could try to open a door. The ending is absolutely, unbelievably a clusterfug. The entire soundtrack is just this girl screaming. Nothing truly scary, creepy or terrifying is happening, the idjit villains are just being idjits, and the noise is just unbearably loud. There is no complexity, no plot, nothing. They got a few simple scares in the beginning, very simple scares that directors and writers use only to get people to stay. During one scene the blonde, I forgot her name, Sam I think, is getting into a fight. She is obviously overpowered. There is no suspense, no nothing; just some bigger, stronger guy tying her up. He doesn't even hit her on the screen, and the sound the hits make is a very generic sound bit. The night chase scene is really where it disintegrated into a mess. For am I to be scared with an annoying as hell soundtrack, and a killer with no stealth and an ineffective weapon, plus a girl who I thought was only there to be a pretty face. When they literally introduce the villains in the beginning of the film she doesn't even talk. She does nothing, just has a but shot of her getting a Coke. The walkers in The Walking Dead (and I really don't like that show) are more scary than Leatherface. They show up out of nowhere with unnerving stealth at any time, and don't stop until disposed of, but Leatherface is a big, bumbling simpleton. I did not enjoy or like this movie, plain and simple. Horror should be about your fears. About the other among us (The Thing 1982), the very wrong and alien (Alien 1979), and good old unadulterated evil and sadism (Hellraiser 1987). This may have been original at its time, but in the end it is uncomplex, gory exploitation. No exploration of your feelings of anxiety or dread, just gore-porn. I have seen crap (Movie 43, I hate you), and this is not crap. So I give it a good four stars. Not one of the best, but not terrible.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
664,halcyonsummer,Gets my vote for best horror film of the 70s--no small feat!,10,2 June 2014,"The 70s was really a golden age for horror cinema as the 1980s slasher craze was obviously still in the future. Most horror films made in this decade were actually about something--there was subtext and a social commentary running beneath the murders, making us question our values and, in the case of American films, the dark undercurrents of the modern American family. It was a daring time to be a filmmaker and the best of the genre took advantage of a decade that wasn't hampered by strict moral codes forced on productions and used the changing attitudes to become pioneers of a new type of horror film, one far removed from the conservative 1960s, where only names like Polanski were breaking any new ground.So, in a decade filled with such new ""blood"" so to speak, to stand out as the cream of the crop even 40 years later is no small feat, but that's exactly what I think this film is--the best representation of where horror cinema was going in the 70s and still the best genre fare that innovative decade has to offer.This isn't just a proto-slasher film about a bunch of stranded kids being chainsawed to death on the back roads of Texas. Filmed when the national gas crisis was making headlines at the time, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre runs deep with subtext. The fact it manages to be a profound commentary on the time it was made without becoming overtly obvious while still managing to be scary and mainstream enough to not qualify as an art house film says something about the many levels the film works on. This isn't a one-dimensional horror tale about cannibalism--an easy topic to promote tasteless horror and mined to death in lesser films.As a native of Texas, the cinematography perfectly captures the landscape I've grown accustomed to seeing and highlights the more sinister aspects just below the surface that is genuinely felt when on those deserted highways on a hot summer afternoon in August. It's not easy to capture beauty and a sense of unease at the same time--this film does it.The remarkably innovative sound effects go a long way to increase tension in key moments of the film, with the opening credits in particular being an exercise in fear themselves. For a film to unnerve you during the credits is a testament to the talent involved here.Even more remarkable is how nothing in the film feels exploitative. In a film called ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", who would expect the film to not utilize buckets of gore like some Herschell Gordon Lewis film? Because the fact is, despite the film's notorious reputation as a splatter film, like Hitchcock's shower scene in ""Psycho"", there is very little violence actually seen on screen. Most of it is implied or imagined due to Hooper's inventive use of camera angles and visual manipulation. Did you actually just SEE a woman impaled on a meat hook? Look again.What the film does best is evoke a prolonged feeling of dread. From the very first moments, nothing quite feels right here. We've got kids out on a typical summer afternoon drive, but one can't shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen. Hooper uses many techniques to evoke a feeling of constant paranoia and anxiety in the audience, from his use of long panoramic visuals to the oppressive heat the characters are experiencing that the audience can almost feel. The scenes in a hot van make one feel claustrophobic as if they're actually sitting there with these characters sweating it out. Good horror films know atmosphere, and this one has it in spades. It's also a perfect example of how to pace yourself. There are no gory murders to be had every ten minutes--this is not a ""Friday the 13th"" film.By the time the murders actually begin, it's almost a relief, as the culmination of all that tension offers some temporary relief...at least until the next horrific situation.Beautiful to look at, masterful in its use of location and its manipulation of audience fear, ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" is a landmark horror film that fully deserves it's re-release this summer (2014), if only to remind theatergoers what a true classic is and wash the taste of the over-produced Platinum Dunes remake out of their mouths. This is truly one of the most groundbreaking horror films of the 20th century and it's importance in the genre and the entire world of film itself should not be forgotten.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I just thought it out to be odd..very odd..Its mainly about a ""slow"" dude who likes to eat people along with his ever so cute family. But i noticed, he hardly ever uses his chainsaw, so why didn't they just stick with the name ""headcheese"" its much more cool and retro for its time. But the movie honestly didn't scare me, It also was a complete throw off from the Ed Gein story's i have seen and heard. It was pretty crappy and merely scary and it wasn't as gruesome as its cracked up to be. And on the box case of the next TCM in the series, it says ""More funny then the first!""

Let's face it, if I was a lot older, and saw this movie when it first came out, I would've been petrified for life, but now watching it, just isn't as great as I thought it would be, everyone hypes it up to be the greatest horror movie, but it just isn't what I expected.

668,timmyross,"One of my favorite Horror Films of all time. A CLASSIC, simply put!",10,22 October 2016,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was the first film of its type that I saw when I was a kid. I started watching horror films when I was very young. I remember watching Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, Chucky, Michael Myers, and so forth. I was 12-years-old when I finally watched this film in the summer of 2000. After watching it, I remember knowing then and there that it would go on to become one of my favorites.The plot (which I am sure everyone knows by now) is pretty simple to say the least. Five friends, Jerry (Allen Danziger), Pam (Teri McMinn), Kirk (William Vail), Sally (Marilyn Burns) and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain)are driving on the lonely back-roads of Texas on their way to a nearby graveyard to check up on their grandfather's grave, after hearing reports on grave robberies occurring in the area.Thankfully, the grave is untouched, and they go on their way. Shortly after passing a slaughterhouse (and some pretty gross details on how the cattle are mutilated courtesy of Franklin), the group encounter a strange-looking skinny feral-looking man (Edwin Neal) hitchhiking. Feeling sorry for him walking in the sweltering Texas heat,they make the first mistake.......they stop to give him a ride.At first (despite his obviously incest appearance), the man seems quite polite and even somewhat befriends Franklin as they discuss slaughterhouses, and the correct way of cooking headcheese. However, the man quickly becomes more and more erratic, first slicing his own hand with Frankiln's pocket knife, and then setting a photo on fire he had recently taken of Franklin. Thereafter, he slashes poor Franklin's arm before the group manage to kick him out of their moving van.The group (all except for Franklin)believe the worst of the day to be over......that is until they unknowingly end up at the house of the crazy hitchhiker, where they meet his enormous, equally insane brother......the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen).The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is one of those films that will always stick with you after watching it. As one poster described it: ""Once you stop screaming, you will start talking about it"", which is very much correct. There has never been any other film quite like this. There is something just totally horrifying about it that can never be matched. Whether it be the ominous grainy documentary-like feel of the film, or the insane close-ups of terrified Marilyn Burns' face and her screams of pure terror. Watching it for the first time (even by today's standards), one will get a feeling that what they are seeing is actually REAL. When it was first released, the film was marketed as a TRUE STORY. The VHS copy I originally rented from the video store had the tagline, ""The UNCUT TRUE STORY!"", which made it all the more scary. The documentary-like feel to the film, and the reports that it was a true story really made it all the more a horrifying experience. Being someone who has always been interested in crime and forensics, I was even somewhat disappointed that it later turned out this film was only LOOSELY based on a true story, that being the story of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. Sadly, there was never a family of inbred chainsaw-wielding cannibalistic lunatics who went around barbecuing their victims and selling their remains to unwary travelers at a lonely gas station. Sure, that sounds weird being disappointed, but that is how powerful this film is. It is so raw and realistic, that it seems completely plausible that this stuff really did happen in real life. And you feel weird after learning that most of it was made up by the very-talented Tobe Hooper.I don't think there will ever be another movie like the original TCM. Though I enjoyed most of the sequels and remake, it is always the original that I remember whenever someone asks me....""Have you ever seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?""",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

676,intruder44t,Shocking experience,9,18 September 2000,"I just saw ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" by Tobe Hooper. I didn't wanted to see other ""Texas"", I wanted to see the first one before. This was a weird experience.  It was cool because at halfway of the movie I thought everybody was falling too fast and was expecting a known end. How wrong was I. The final moments where very shocking, and until the end got me with my eyes wide open. I didn't wanted to compare it to Evil Dead, but the low budget feel and weird shots reminds me of Raimi´s masterpiece, but then I realized that this movie was made almost 10 years after¡ (and so it makes it more cool), sure people run of the theaters with this¡¡. One very cool thing it was that unlike other films this wasn't actually a tale of zombies or vampires but about demented people with an special dinner menu (some images of Ed Gain came to my mind). Other thing that I really like about this movie was the realism and simplexes of the acting. I hate that when people is confronting an incredible menace they say those stupid cuotes (A trend Raimi also parody but that later also become a cliché too). In this film people scream like crazies, and even that the screaming was annoying at a time, I wouldt expect less. The scream is very important thing on a state of hysteria. When one is having a nightmare, one feels the urge of scream as hard as one can, like trying to break with the moment or disconnect the conciusness. But this wasn't a bad dream and so the senses reach the point of breakdown. The tale follows with realism and not falling in holes or f**k ups.

Mostly '80s horrors are like that. Except for my other favorite; Poltergeist, but that's more a beautiful movie, rather than a scary one. But this movie is so different, also because it's from the '70s, but most of all because the scary thing is not what you see, it's what you don't see. That makes it freaky. The atmosphere is so creepy, also because these are normal teen-agers, these could be you and me. Also the music/sounds in the movie gives you goose bums. The most frustrating scene is when the freaky family has the girl at the dinner table and the grandfather (he must be at least 165 years old!) tries to smash her head in with a hammer. Also the scene when she escapes and finally finds a police station and thinks she is save, it appeared that the police man is also one of them and brings her back to the chainsaw family.

678,cool_dude_2003_99,A Movie that defies the word HORROR,9,27 May 2001,"I've seen a lot of movies where they made comments on how scary this movie was, whether it was a kid staying up late to watch it or whatever.  I never really knew what it was about, I thought it was just a guy going around the town killing people with his chainsaw, which is what the plot of every new horror movie is. I first watched this about 5 months ago with a friend, and we put the tape in at about midnight.  I have to admit, the first part of the movie is a bit slow, but then again, so is The Exorcist, which is another extremely scary movie. The second part of the movie more than makes up for the first part though.  People complain about how this movie ""wasn't gory enough,"" yet the movies these days that use so much gore aren't even scary, they're stupid. This movie didn't need gore.  The killings in this movie used pretty much no gore, but they were extremely disturbing, and frightening. Trust me, when you watch this, the first kill will just freak you out, it is so unexpecting, and then it happens. What makes this movie even more horrific and disturbing, is knowing that are people out in this world like that.  In fact, Leatherface was based on a real serial killer back in the 50's.  Everything in this movie is what every horror movie now doesn't have.  I can see how this movie was really arguemental when it came out, people just weren't ready and expecting that kind of movie, even now it's still really disturbing to watch.

679,austinwjohnson,Utterly Terryfying.,9,30 April 2020,"No movie has ever scared and disturbed me as much as 1974's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre""I first watched this movie after a year or so of being into horror movies (i was late i know) expecting it to be a Friday The 13th, Halloween esc slasher.What i got was much more...more gritty and terryfying than i could ever imagine. Right from the start this movie sets a truly unsettling and disturbing open with the extremely well done industrial sound effect with pictures of a crime scene. Even after my 4th watch it unnerves me like nothing else, makes my stomach twist in a knot.What makes this film so special is1. Its incredible cinematography, from the shots of the glooming moon and the dark forest around them as Sally and Franklin search for their friends, to the shots of the Texas wasteland the group find themselves in.2. Lack of music/camera quality - Ive always loved the gritty camera quality in this film, and it really makes for a more realistic, indulging experience. The lack of music during intense scenes, to maybe somes disbelief, actually makes the scenes scarier. During the famous chase scene, all you hear is the menacing roar of Leatherface's chainsaw behind Sally and she runs away in terror, and to me that is much more horrifying than a score.3. Its truly disturbing subject matter - The idea of being chased by a lumbering man wielding a chainsaw, wearing another persons face as a mask, and being kidnapped and mentally tortured by a family of cannibals who plan to kill you is horrifying and disturbing, and you really feel this in the famous dinner scene.Overall, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a atmospheric, disturbing, horryfying experience that is definitely not for everyone, but if you want to be scared, this is the movie for you.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The thought of some neighbour bursting out of their house with a chain saw seemed all too possible.By presenting the movie as a ""this actually happened"" movie, a very real feeling is obtained. The semi-poor 70s film quality and the very natural acting makes the movie seem less like a movie and more like something that could have taken place. I think this ""real"" feeling is what scared me so much, considering every time i look anywhere but my street I see houses like the one in the movie.

684,quietsquash,Look what your brother did to the door!,10,29 June 2021,"A masterpiece of 16mm, minimalist horror. This film proves you can make a good horror movie without expensive, excessive special effects, or a complex, convoluted plot. With this film its weight is carried by its details and symbolism.Supremely gritty looking; with the lope of that old Bolex you get the impression that there is nothing between you and the world in front of the lens, there is no Hollywood shine or artifice. When Gunner Hansen fires up the chainsaw for the first time you can almost smell the two cycle smoke and the stench of that hot, filthy house.The cruelty with which Tobe Hooper rips apart his celluloid characters is brutal, and carries the mood of nihilistic dispair, reflected in derelict buildings, dying cattle, vandalized graves, depopulation, poverty, isolation, unemployment and a recurrent radio news narrator listing the daily toll of violence, disease, crime, death and arson.The film was influential for countless other filmakers in the horror genre and beyond, for its artistic style, strange beauty, cruelty and black-hearted cynicism. It has a style saturated with a symbolism and detail that is more fitting of Bergman than Wes Craven.I've heard people complan that the story is weak, though I don't agree. Tobe Hooper seems to have been inspired by fairytale Hansel and Gretel, but instead of German children wandering off into the forest and finding the house of a witch who wants to eat them, it's American teenagers wandering off into a sun baked, rural noman' s land and finding the house of unemployed slaughterhouse workers who want to eat them.For this film complex plot and deep charachter development is unnecessary. The story takes place over a cycle of less than 24 hours, and it feels as if, like a hitchhiker, these are just random people you have suddenly met, and you are experiencing things in the moment, just as they are. There is a feeling of immediate presence, without deeper retrospective or prospective musings. Adding to this restricted view of the main protagonists, the antagonists are rarely shown on their own without the physical presence of the protagonist, this makes it seem like the villians are just as confusing and unexplainable to the audience as to Sally and her friends.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

687,laughingtree,"If you like horror, watch this once",5,11 September 2021,"This has been on my list for awhile, namely because it is accredited for being the first Slasher film, and secondly because of it's strong cult following. I will break my review up by what I think the most important tenets of a good movie are. Enjoy!Plot:
The premise of this movie is the go-to for all slasher films; a group of friends goes to an abandoned house and are terrorized by a family of local psychopaths. It was funny to see all of the horror tropes that you wouldn't want in a script today cropping up throughout this movie. They run out of gas, there are no phones, characters are tripping during chase scenes and making dumb decisions. It really is a testament to it's influence on the genre. At the end of the day, there really wasn't all that much of a story and you can't help but think that these people shouldn't have gone to the abandoned house to start with. There are several elements of foreshadow and bad omens that happen, including a violent encounter with a hitchhiker, as well as a very strong opening that did a good job of hooking you in (see what I did there?) to see what is about to happen...plus the intro used the word macabre...that's impressive by itself. There is a lot of discussion as the characters pass a cow farm, which seems to be drawing a parallel between how the cattle are treated with great cruelty as they are slaughtered to how the characters are going to be treated by Leatherface and his family. In general though, the dialogue was really weak, which I'll talk about more in the character section.Directing/Camera work:
The camera work was actually what got me the most interested in this movie because it isn't like anything I remember seeing before. There is a strong emphasis on really low angles looking up at the characters for a lot of the movie, which I thought was an interesting way to tell a story. There are also a great deal of close ups, which were definitely heavy-handed at times(the infamous family dinner scene), but still a cool way to depict the characters reactions (if any of them could act). There are two main chase scenes in the movie, both involving the same character. I enjoyed both of them and thought they were exciting and suspenseful, but the first one went on way too long through the woods.Music/sound effects:
There really wasn't anything that stood out to me here as far as a musical score. Nothing even close to the scores from Halloween, or even the ominous ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" chants of the Friday the 13th franchise. Aside from the eerie noises at the very beginning when they are taking photographs, Leatherface squealing like a pig, and the roaring of the chainsaw, there wasn't much else. Oh, besides the CONSTANT screaming of Sally for the last 30 minutes of the movie. Clearly they don't gag people often enough, because that woman would not shut up.Characters/Acting:
As bad as the writing was, the characters and acting were even worse. I have seen movies where bad writing can be somewhat salvaged by good actors, and I have seen movies where bad acting can be salvaged by good writing and directing. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of those exceptions. There is ZERO character development. You have NO IDEA who the characters are, what they think, what drives them to make decisions, and you have no vested interest in them surviving. They are basically a bunch of hippies in Texas, along with a super annoying invalid. None of them can act, deliver lines or express what they are thinking. I think the closest thing to understanding what they were thinking came in the scene with them being wary of the crazy hitchhiker, but even that wasn't all that great. The only semblance of a protagonist is Sally, and she sucks. She screams constantly (and dear Barbara I mean CONSTANTLY) and you really only want her to live because you literally have nothing else to cheer for as the audience. There seemed like there could have been such rich characters. They could have developed the love stories between either of the couples, the strained relationship between Sally and her needy brother, or her and her girlfriends. Alas, none of that was ever explored.Taking all of that into account, I thought this movie was more on the disgusting side than interesting horror. I am not opposed to gore at all, but typically I think it should have some sort of purpose to it. I loved the ending of this movie and was pleasantly surprised that Sally escaped, even though she was a totally flat, albeit noisy character. I WOULD NOT CALL THIS A GOOD MOVIE even though it is iconic. I don't want to ever watch it again honestly.If you like slasher films, or you like interesting camera work/directing, you should give this film a try. Be warned though, it is quite grotesque at times and is too graphic and gross for the casual cinema fan...and there is A LOT of screaming.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
688,Bernold,True story my ass,4,13 July 2003,"To say that the texas chainsaw massacre is based on a true story is like saying that a frog and a toad is the same thing... Since the story they say that the film is based on is the story of a necrophile named Ed Gein, and is the same story that they say that The silence of the lamb is based on too, it should be pretty evident that it's not really a true story. Ed Gein was an alienated man who dug up some corpses (well quite a lot of them...) and made clothes and furniture out of them, but he NEVER killed anyone even though some people thinks he did... even though Ed Gein was a very sick man he was no leatherface and he wasn't any Buffalo Bill either.

It's grainy documentary style makes it a very realistic film. In addition, the fact that there is no real music only helps to drive home the realism. The characters in this film are very real. The five teenagers who unfortunately bump into the clan of cannibalistic crazies are actually very similar in many ways (possibly intentionally) to the gang from ""Scooby Doo."" Aside from the fact that you are watching a group of kids die one by one at the hands of a man who wears a human face mask, one of the scariest factors of the film is the isolation. For miles and miles, nothing but the baron Texas landscape. The family is probably more terrifying than anything. The family is horrifying. Three brothers living together with their barely alive Grandfather and the rotten corpse of what we assume is their Grandmother. The eldest brother, ""The Cook"" (we find out in the sequel his name is Drayton) is probably the only way you could survive the situation. He seems to have a conscience. And even says that he doesn't enjoy killing. Therefore, if you eliminated the other 2, you might make it out alive. Especially when you consider that, he runs the gas station at the beginning. If he wanted to kill people, he would have killed them one at a time as they came into the store. ""The Hitchhiker"" (who in the sequel we learn is called Nubbins) seems to be uncontrollable. Obviously mentally handicapped, his threat is real. You think he is just weird in the beginning, but then as you see, any kind of excitement can and will set him off. Now we are left with the big man, Leatherface (who yet again we learn in the sequel is named Bubba). Leatherface is by far the scariest of the brothers. Leatherface is also one of the scariest characters in film. Leatherface is 6'5"" and easily 350 pounds or more. He wears horrible masks made of human flesh and kills with two things, a sledgehammer, and his signature tool, the chainsaw. And by the way folks, THIS NEVER HAPPENED! Do some research and you'll find out for yourself.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
690,billy_bufordstick,The best part of this movie: It inspired the remake.,5,29 February 2008,"It is a classic, I will give it that. However, I really, really disliked this film. In my opinion it sucks, and I can overlook many things if I enjoy the killers, but even that was lacking.THE GOOD: It created Leatherface, inspired the remake and helped launch the 2006 prequel, thats the best thing this movie has ever done in my opinion. The idea of a hulking, skin wearing, mute, brutish killer was genius and pretty original for the day.THE BAD: The film is way too slow moving. It focuses on unnecessary things far too much. In one instance Pam stumbles into a bone filled room that seems to stink from her reaction, but still she waits for a stupid amount of time just so the camera can pan around unnecessarily at the bones. Also, this film keeps character development (what there was of it) in the first half mainly on the most annoying character of the film, Franklin. Franklin was so annoying that if he wasn't in a wheelchair there would be nothing sad about seeing him bite the dust. In fact, I can see his death as a relief for some viewers. And even the other characters are lame. Jerry and Sally were laughing while talking about Sally's grandmother dying, Kirk found it amusing to pick up some nasty tooth and hand it to his girlfriend, and Sally wouldn't stop screaming! The sound quality is horrible, it took me like 10 views to figure out that Leatherface was laughing during the scene before he hooked Pam. The hitchhiker silently howls by the side of the road, and the dialogue on occasion seem like mumbles.Even though the basic idea of Leatherface was genius, it was seriously detracted from by the ""retard"" persona they chose to use. Why should I be afraid of someone who doesn't know why things happen and is even afraid of me? Squealing like a pig, acting stupid, he really didn't seem to know why things even happened. The new Leatherface acts more like real killers. In fact, he acted a lot like a mute BTK. In my opinion the remake/prequel Leatherface is superior in intelligence, looks, and demeanor. Speaking of looks, the house didn't look as good as the remake house in my opinion, neither did the setting. Last, I hate the soundtrack! Well, what there was of one.So whats the best part of this movie? It introduced Leatherface and inspired the remake and prequel. Other than that its the worst kind of a pointless film, one that made a lot of money.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
691,Indiana John,who'd of thought anything from '74 could be scary?,9,24 March 2002,"This is it you know? This is THE movie. No other movie has scared so many people, sure the Excorcist had it's moments, but no other movie made people go, ""Hey, why isn't the camera man helping these innocent kids???"" So many movies have seen this and pretty much copied it. Friday the 13th - TCM with a hockey mask and a big knife, Nightmare on Elm st. - TCM with a claw, and dreams, Halloween - TCM with a knife and Capt. Kirk mask, American Psycho, Silence of the lambs, etc, etc. So you see, this is much more than a movie, it's a chunk of psychological insanity!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
692,Corky67,"Tobe Hooper + a camera = Atmosphere, tension and horror at its purest.",10,11 February 2009,"Just from observing the title, you'd expect Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be a hoot 'n' a holler of violence, an orgy of blood and guts; it's violent all right, except that it is done in a manner somewhat, as considered nowadays, unorthodox. Who needs detailed, close-up shots of man's internal organs spilling out like rice from a hole in a sack when you have the marvellous talent of Tobe Hooper? His craft makes TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) one of the most brilliant and atmospheric films of any genre, never mind horror.The title pretty much sums up what to expect in the ensuing 80 minutes. An innocent, young group of people are caught up in bloodbath in the hot, dry and deserted back-lands of Texas. It is a simple premise, and it works well for what the film is. The characters themselves are much like the story, simple and straight-forward; there's no real depth to their personalities, but that is not entirely a bad-thing for director Hooper is more concerned with the film's depiction of horror, and the tension and atmosphere developed by this.As one may have been able to tell, it is the function and construction of horror which makes this film the classic that it is. The atmosphere and tension of the film makes your heart pound like it were begging for mercy to be released from your chest. The look of the film gives it a raw feeling, something unkempt, and dirty, like it were itself a rotting limb from one of Leatherface's several victims. Tobe Hooper's choice of setting, a farm house in the middle of a deserted Texas, adds a sense of isolation and helplessness; filming particular scenes in the dark also add to this effect as well as a sense of nowhere-to-run. The corroded, dry roar of Leatherface's chainsaw as an alternative to music builds the tension up fantastically; the louder the roar as it approaches any innocent individual, the more nails you bite. Chase scenes, in particular, feel never-ending; you simply want the hunted to escape somehow, and this adds loads more tension to what is already a very scary film. One aspect of Tobe Hooper's depiction of horror that is so wonderful is that he doesn't rely in any way on explicit gore, something which is common to most horror films, even the best of them.Tobe Hooper's achievement with Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been unrivalled to this day in terms of pure atmosphere and tension. Never has a film succeeded so well in keeping the audience on the edge of their seats feeling no other emotion other than anxiety for 80 straight minutes. And in my opinion, it is arguable to suggest that this is one of the best directed films in cinema history.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
693,s-sweetheart,"Not just the best horror film, the best film!",10,14 July 2019,"There isn't enough time in the world to write about all the great things about this movie. The fact that I watched it as a nine year old at the peak of the video nasties in 1983 (parents worked and had great , reckless big sisters babysitting) and was mad about it then and now, says everything about this timeless classic.
The film is scary..it has dark nights, screaming men and women, weirdos, vans running out of petrol (gas), and big, powerful men with minds like insane simpletons. Plus it has Texas in the title, which for a girl from small town NI, sounds strange, weird, hot, sticky and painful. This small town Irish girl is right.
One thing I love, is that PAM was right. She was right about retrograde malevolence, she was right the Sawyers wouldn't want Kirk's guitar, she was right that they should TURN BACK NOW. But Kirk, being male, overrides Pam and the rest is history.
The lesson from TCM...LISTEN to your girlfriend/wife. It just might save your life.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I'm a 14 year old guy and this didn't really even phase me. My favorites are definitely Two and Four and Texas Chainsaw. Part four was hilarious. Part three wasn't as good to me because I don't care that much about the whole family thing. TCM is a horror film not a drama. To me I liked Texas Chainsaw because it gave us Leatherface chasing people around not Chop Top and the Cook and Hitchhiker. Anyways, It's a good film but everyone is calling it pure terrifying, I don't think it is.

There are several remakes, which proves this is a kind of pioneer.But what about having a decent plot? Where is proper acting? The plot is quiet dull. The acting is shockingly amateourish.I am a fan of old school horror movies, I even like teen slashers and gores. But this is a very low budget, homemade like, ""head chees"". A huge disappointment which makes me think about reliability of IMDB user reviews.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
696,Fectom,Why is this so well rated?,4,13 May 2013,"As I stumbled upon this film, I was very excited to see a horror movie, which has actually gotten some great reviews. Most of the other well rated ""horror"" film have concentrated on the plot (like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Psycho"") and therefore I hoped to find at least a great story and not so much the scares, since I know, that most of the horror movies from the previous century can't compete with the jumps, that the ones made today are full of.Unfortunately, there was nothing, what I was hoping to find. The story is about a commonly dumb group of teenagers, who bravely wander around and find themselves in trouble. And that's about it. The movie only shows one side of the story, which makes the plot poor and the only side that is shown is executed far from expectations. Only one of the 5 teenagers actually has a noticeable character, but for the others a simple question will be stuck in the observer's head: ""Why?"".I can't say, that it was all bad. The beginning of the story is actually well created and it sets the viewer in the wished mood. Sadly, the warm- up for me at least was completely unnecessary. I became more and more numb as the movie progressed and not once was I scared nor on the edge of my seat.After I had seen the movie I was confused. This movie is well rated, but why? I have read other reviews and people keep saying, that this movie is scary. I have to disagree. Because of the poor editing, I had the desire to laugh at the scary bits not scream.So don't get confused by the rating. This movie has almost no storyline, nor is it any scary. I'm not saying don't watch the movie. I'm just saying have low-expectations and the movie might turn out to be watchable.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
697,shotgun_mcguffin,A truly disturbing classic,10,30 September 2010,"I finally re-watched this gem today and what a disturbing piece of rock it is. This is truly a classic within cinema, and a testimony to why these old low-budget horror-flicks beats any of the Hollywood-horror movies of today.the story itself is not so amazing. five young friends go for a summer-drive that lands them in hells-ville. and of course like any horror movie it plays on your imagination and fears and prejudice, in this case, inbred, demented, small Texas towns. this is not what makes it great. what makes it great, and a movie that is still scary and very very disturbing, is that the director understood that the less you see, the more is left to the imagination. This means that there is very little gore in the movie, and instead some very effective camera work and truly bizarre occurrences. its like a long nightmare.the acting is of course, below average, although compared to todays teenage slashers, it's great. the only actor that really stands out is Gunnar Hansen, who plays Leatherface, who gives so much life to an unforgettable character in the history of horror cinema.this movie is not for everyone though. if you are into Hollywood, CGI, and well, doesn't like horror-movies, don't watch this gem. But if you are among us geeks who enjoy Deadbeat 'till Dawn, Combat Shock, respect the original Halloween for what it is and thinks that Night of the Living Dead is still a good movie, you will be able to watch this again and again.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
698,thrasherck80,"Without a doubt, the best horror ever.",10,30 September 2010,"1974 was a groundbreaking year in history of cinema. Previously unknown director Tobe Hooper created with only about $83,000 budget shocking image, which for decades has became the brightest hallmark for all slasher films. And he didn't need any well-known actors nor spectacular special effects.The plot tells a story of the five friends travelling through Texas to their grandpa's old house. During a travel they pick up a suspicious hitch-hiker (which was quickly thrown out). In a short time friends are left alone in complete isolation among a family of cannibals.Film doesn't have extreme gore or scenes which leads you to jumping out of chair. So what is the biggest advantage of the film? Atmosphere. Stifling, morbid and paranoid atmosphere. The feeling of terror has never been so real. Every aspect of 'Massacre' is filled with eerie and horrible emotions. Scenography including the real human skeleton, creepy dark ambient music or acting of a main evil character set up a shocking nightmare in which no one ever wants to be find.Main character Leatherface is the subject of separate discussions. Retarded butcher wearing a mask made of human skin. Gunnar Hansen who played him added to an already frightening character more terror. The scene of his dance with a chainsaw is together beautiful and disturbing.It's a pity that Tobe is making now garbage like 'Mortuary' or 'Crocodile', and he won't probably get close to a greatness of his masterpiece .It is hard to write something new that nobody knows, everything I can tell is that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a film that you should see before you die. You will never forget it...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
699,cerealheed,"Interesting idea, poorly executed.",5,20 August 2011,"Being a huge horror fan, and a Slasher fan more than anything. I was told that this film was a ""must see"" for any Horror fan. This film was a let down.My first problem with it is of the acting, or rather the lack of it. The acting in this film is very bad for the most part. Their are a few good performances in it, Edwin Neal is very over the top as ""The Hitchhiker"" which you may like depending on your view on how an acting performance should be done, personally i am not a fan of it especially in Horror, and Allen Danziger as Jerry was decent. But almost all the rest are awful. Jim Siedow as ""The Old Man"" is quite possibly the worst performance of all time, and the rest of the teens are pretty awful.After watching the first twenty minutes of this film i thought i was going to dislike, due to bad acting it but being a Horror Nut i decided to finish it should so i could say ""I watched the Texas Chainsaw Massarce"" (apparently you cant call yourself a Horror Nut if you cant say that)and kept watching.My opinion then changed, after the first death (that of Kirk) which i thought was done very well. The strange noises leading to silence, the appearance of the killer, the crack on the skull and the slamming of the iron door (note you don't see what happens behind the door, therefore your mind starts to ""think"" of what might had happened) a very well done scene. However my opinion soon returned to it original thoughts. After the second death (or more accurately while the death is accuring) the film goes down hill. Terrible scene, Pam falls into a room full of bones. She then decides to remain calm for about thirty seconds and look around, giving the camera times to show the audience the room, and THEN after thirty seconds decides to start freaking out and making a lot of noise attracting the killer. Either make the teen a fool and start freaking out straight away or sensible and slowly, quietly and calmly exit the serial killers house. Jerry's death is also badly done. He enters the room in which Kirk and Pam were both killed, and though a teen was bashed over the head with a sledgehammer and cut up with a chainsaw, while another was hanged on a meat hook their is no evidence to suggest any violence accured there. No blood, no flesh nothing. Later on in the film after Sally escapes the house, a lorry stops to help her. The driver helps her get in and close the door before the killer can kill her with his chainsaw, but instead of just driving away what do... They decide to open the door on the other side of the lorry and go right back outside to the madman with the chainsaw.Overall this film was not only bad, but it was simply not scary. If this film scares you then you are obviously not the right type of person to watch Horror. The first death was well done but not scary, and all the others are just stupid. Even one of the last scenes when Sally is round the table with the whole family, which could of been quite an intense scene it is ruined by the acting.If you want a good realistic Horror film based on a real life killer, then watch either Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, or The Silence Of The Lambs. Both of which happen to be based on the same real life killer Ed Gein. The difference is that those film are brilliant and done very well. Psycho is possible the best Horror of all time, and neither of them are just Stupid Boy 1. ""i'm going to check out this house"" Stupid Girl 1. ""Ok"" ""Stupid Boy 1 gets killed"" Stupid Girl 1. ""Hmm he has been gone along time i'll going to check the house out too"" ""Stupid Girl 1 gets killed"" Stupid Boy 2. ""They've been gone along time, i'm gonna check out that house too"" ""Stupid Boy 2 gets killed"" Stupid Girl 2. ""Let go check out that house too"" Stupid Boy 3. ""Okay!""

This movie is the latter. usually i don't get scared watching a horror movie but this one passed right through me..It was 83 minutes of trauma. Guys if you are out there trying to watch it, then better gather some friends. The plus point with horror movies is that the flaws of camera, lighting, cinematography, sound mixing turn out to favor the aura of the movie. the weirder these stuffs are, the better the movie gets. i wouldn't give a damn to what way the actors acted because it was overshadowed by their screaming. At least 80% of the time strip is only made of screams. Well it worked out to be a perfect prime-time for a horror movie bulimic. i would say the the Texas Chainsaw Massacre has what it takes to be a good horror flick. although i would advice you guys not to eat anything while the movie goes on..it will not help. and just to hit the bell, this one is way better than the wrong turn-like gory flicks that are interspersed with nothing but mannequin heads and legs. watch if you are a gore movie buff but like the mutilated details hidden.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

The ""family reunion"" made me think about the Addams Family. The killer is lame, the victims are dull. There is absolutely no buildup in the terror, no atmosphere, no development, you never get hooked. Being bang on the shocking scenes may have been an editorial choice, but for me it just doesn't work at all.

They featured or showed a scene that contained a guy in a leather face chasing a girl up some stairs, and then jumping from the window. From that moment on, I always wondered what film could contain something like that. Seven years later, I find out it turns to be this movie. However, my story on how I saw this movie doesn't go too far back.My introduction to the film starts back in March, were my dad rented the remake of it. I was quite interested in seeing the movie, and enjoyed too. However, I felt my satisfaction wouldn't be complete until I saw the original version. And so, I decided to hunt for the movie and rent it, and so I did, at last. I go home, put it into my DVD player, and watch it.Boy, let me tell you, it was one wild ride. Seeing Leatherface kill all those kids was anything but not frightful. I can now understand why so many people left the theaters back then when they say it, it was disturbing, gory, and frightful. It was also unpredictable, you didn't know if the character Sally would live or not, after the hell she goes through. The realism portrayed in the movie is excellent. It's just bunch of normal teenagers going through a trip were it becomes a hell for them.''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' is great movie, sure, it may not have a lot of gore, or may seem funny in today's standards, but just because it's a low-budget movie doesn't make it ''poor'', if your a fan of horror movies, and can accept this for what it is, then I recommend it to anyone.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I don't give two shits if it's 2035, it'll still be the scariest movie i've ever seen.And the last hour or so of this movie, around the famous dinner scene is absolutely disturbing.Leatherface will never top Michael Myers but he's just one more face to really be afraid of.9/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Considering these factors, I would have to say that Tobe Hooper has done a fantastic job! This movie is very professional - and, as all horror movies should be, very scary - and even scarier that it's based on a true story.However, I feel the need to comment on a couple of weaknesses. When Sally discovers that the old guy at the servo is a baddie, there is not enough terror conveyed on screen. The guy comes in with a rope and a sack, and Sally freaks out. Then the guy says ""take it easy, everything will be okay"", then he starts attacking Sally with the rope. How can anyone be frightened to death of that? Also, some shots of ""Leatherface"" are not scary enough. In many shots, he looks extremely confronting and sadistic, but there are times that he just looks like a ""mean old man whose mother has just died"", that is to say, a wimp.But, all in all, the movie was very good, and I recommend it to any horror movie fan out there.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Not Very Scary LOL,6,19 November 2005,hmmmmm... i don't know bout the rest of you but this movie was not very scary at all perhaps it's because I'm a different generation to when this was released...this movie is about a bunch of hippies who get killed one by one except for the pretty girl who manages to survive but i think it drove her insane lol! but yeah i don't get how people can find it scary i was watching the very worst gore films and this one was the first one on! Wes Craven (scream director) was going on about saying how scary it was but i found it more funny that scary...then again scream didn't scare ME lol it's either hard to scare me or this scary movie is no longer scary for the kids like me growing up in the 21th century. lol it's still a pretty cool film you'll either be scare or laughing !!,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
715,qwerqwer-255-205050,The best horror film in cinema history.,9,14 June 2016,"Forgive me, human nerve King Alfred Hitchcock, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau and others, but their films did not become a landmark horror. It Tobu Hooper managed to remove most fascinating and terrifying horror film, which can be a maddening anyone. An interesting idea director: people are afraid of something like that patient. So he made a film with a focus on the maniac with a chainsaw - nothing could be easier and better. Leatherface no less frightening Freddy Krueger, Jack Torrance and other lunatics in the world of cinema, and his chainsaw - like a symbol of human pain and fear captivating. Almost the entire film from the first murder scene, the viewer wilts in exciting fear and consternation, and closely following the fate of the poor five. Generally the very first stage appearance Bubba Sawyer (so called maniac Leatherface) most important is to compare with the scenes, for example, the eye cut in ""Un Chien Andalou"" and the scene in the shower in ""Psycho."" The latter is generally considered the best scene in horror movies, what can and to argue. The moment Kirk stumbles in the same frame appears Bubba - a reference sequence. In the course of the film, we learn that a whole family of cannibals living in the wilds of Texas. This gas station worker, strange hairy man, and even a grandpa, who for 130 years, but the one half-dead, yet can kill. We can say - what a crazy story and crazy movie anyway? The family of cannibals living away from the city, killing people out of their hammers, saws, axes, and then in the family eats them. But unless there is a sense to redo something? After all, such a plot is able to capture every nerve, even cold-blooded audience. Follow the fate of the five friends in this film is terrible to the very end. Of course, capture and other horror movies, with some even less, but the director's been possible. We know that the movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was filmed without particularly large budget and quickly. Sometimes the actors had to endure the pain alive. Attention to Hooper's film, a large number of sequels and the cult of the film and is a direct confirmation of his genius. He deservedly stands in the forefront with ""Psycho,"" ""The Shining,"" ""Jaws"" and even in many ways superior to them. It should not pass any true lover tickle your psyche.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
716,herbman1974,All-Time Horror SHocker,10,20 June 2005,"This Movie will forever haunt me as long as i live. When I first rented this movie in 1985, I was disappointed in the plot and was even more upset with the dialog. When I watched it a year later, alone in the dark, my views had quickly changed at how much material I actually overlooked a year before. There is so much going on in the film that you do not realize until you have watched it again and again. The most disturbing and frightening things in this movie are the elements that are left unexplained and the setting is all too real and authentic. The murder scenes are genuine and the killer in the film was the first horror film icon to sport a mask during his reign of terror that has been mimicked by other horror icons such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and other serial Killers. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the Mother of all Horror Films. A Prelude to the horror exploitation that was just a few years away!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
717,5jerry,This is disturbing.,10,22 June 2005,"The ATMOSPHERE is the real star of this film, the idea that a group of people can fall into such misfortune, right under the noses of the world at large, and it's just plain disturbing. I get mad at the sequels, because Gunnar Hansen's portrayal of Leatherface is genuinely frightening. He is nothing more than a killing machine, no personality, severely retarded, and only gibbers and squeals to speak. The sequels softened his ""character."" When you finally see the family together, they look like the Rogues Gallery from the old Dick Tracy comic strips, and Leather's brother , well, we've all seen this type, and we all avoid him. You just itch at the sight of him.(spoiler coming up) One of the hardest scenes to watch is when Leatherface drags Pam, hysterical, back to the kitchen, and just plops her on one of the meat-hooks. She gasps, chokes, and cries as her boyfriend, Kirk, is being dismembered on the table. The shot of a weather- vane outside, with distant screams, is gut-wrenching. The dining room scene, toward the end, is just SO unsettling, the muscles in the back of my neck need to be relaxed afterward. Forcing Sally's head down into a washtub, and letting the grandfather try to hit her with a sledge hammer, will fill you with such revulsion, you forget it's just a movie. They just don't make them like this anymore. But then, maybe they never did in the first place. Don't miss this.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

This movie has a lot of blood for the era, when Pam is murdered, i was so shocked, that scene was so intense, and the hammer of Leatherface, scares me. I think Franklin was the main character, but when he was killed, I feel bad, but Sally was good! she runs with heels without falling down, really intelligent, I have to say; Hitchhiker reminds me Tiger from Winnie The Pooh (laughs) jokes later, he is crazy a lot! my god, when he slash his hand I think that is the warning of the events in the movie, poor teens, and the horoscope of Pamwas a warning too! again, poor teens. Leatherface is so horrible, when I see the movie for first time, I feel horror, pure and deadly horror, Leatherface is one of the best villains in the cinematography!

We would go almost every weekend. As I had a pretty unhappy home life, these excursions were holy to me. My uncle had a 1972 Plymouth Satellite with bucket seats and a forest green metallic paint job. I don't remember what kind of engine it was, but it had a lot of power and roared when you punched it. The soundtrack was always The Doors, Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd.It was the most psychotic thing I had ever seen. I had already seen a lot of horror movies at that tender age, but I had never seen anything that relentless. It gave me nightmares later....and that's how I discovered the power of cinema.The South Trail no longer exists. It closed in 1984 and was turned into a car lot.

722,PurpleFanatic,Without Question: THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER,10,22 September 2005,"There is no other movie in the horror genre that comes close to the original TX Chainsaw Massacre. This movie even 30 years later has all of the components of a great horror movie. This movie contains no ghosts, spirits, Devil or ""monster"" or unexplainable entity. What this movie has is a 100% crazy psycho covered with a grotesque leather face who is hacking young adults to bits with a chainsaw. Classic! Freddy Kruger can not touch Leather Face, because he talks so much he starts to sound like a burnt up stand up comedian with all of his corny one liners. Jason and Micahel Myers from Halloween don't talk, but they aren't scary to look at either, the kid next door with a hockey mask on? Leather Face is just plain old scary to look at, whether or not he is yielding his chainsaw. His weirdo family also adds to the scariness of this movie. It's like those people had no idea that they were crazy as all outdoors. If there is even one New School horror fan out there that saw the remake of this without seeing the original, do yourself a favor and see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I dare you to even think about picking up a hitchhiker afterwords.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
723,LemonLoafer,The Most Disturbing Movie You'll Ever See.,10,20 May 2006,"This movie has to be the all-time most disturbing movie to ever hit our screen. 5 Teenage friends are travelling across the countryside and stumble upon a hitchhiker who is deranged and everyone expects that he is part of Leatherface's family. Later on they find a house. A house with wallpaper made of skin, a room with chicken feathers/bones/live chickens. And the infamous torture room featuring 2 hooks. 1 by 1 they are picked off, leaving poor Sally running for her life from the chainsaw wielding Leatherface. She then finds herself tied to a chair and forced to have dinner with the family and there Grampa. The grampa probably is the scariest element of the movie seeing as he looks like he is over 100 years old and likes to suck blood off of innocent girl's fingers. The sole survivor then legs it for survival.The showdown is one of the moments where you begins screaming at your television: ""RUN!!!!!"" ""He's gonna getcha!!!"". A trucker stops of and throws a wrench to leatherface's head, (whatever happened to that trucker guy anyways?)then another pedestrian picks her up in his pick up truck and that leaves Leatherface stranded in the middle of the road with his chainsaw going up and down up and down then END. All too quickly. I didn't feel 100% healthy after watching this.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
724,barnesag,Unpopular Opinion,3,9 September 2018,"I feel I should add a few qualifiers before diving in. I went into this movie with high expectations because of its reputation. And had I seen this in 1974 when it was released, those expectations may have been met. But that is not the case. So it's hard to say if I genuinely dislike this movie, or if I'm just disappointed. But either way, I do not think it is good, or worth your time. It's not all bad, I must admit. When we are first introduced to Leatherface, when he comes from around that corner and slams his hammer down, it is a great moment in horror. The surprise, the bluntness, and the brutality all add up. And this is shortly followed by him grabbing Pam as she runs out the front door, another iconic moment. And I also need to give credit to the thought behind Leatherface. His different masks determining his personality and his motives, showing that there is nothing behind the mask. Removing a sense of humanity from our killer makes him scarier, in my opinion, because that means you won't find reason or empathy within him.So credit and praise where they're due, there are definitely good things in this movie. But...My biggest complaint can be summed up in one word: noise. After Franklin is killed, this movie fills with so much noise I can't stand it. More specifically, screaming. Which I completely understand, to a point. This girl just saw her brother take a chainsaw to the chest, of course she's going to scream. But she screams while running through the woods, she screams while running through the house, she screams while running down the street, she screams right up to the point she falls through that door and thinks she's safe. And the whole time there's also the sounds from the chainsaw and the random grunts and yells that Leatherface makes.And then when she realizes she's still in danger and tries to defend herself, she gets knocked out with...a broom. She, a young adult with a knife, gets knocked out by an old man hitting her with a broom. And then there's the dinner scene. The dinner scene is where I completely stopped enjoying this movie.What happens in the dinner scene? Mostly more screaming. The men are yelling everything they say, and Sally screams her head off the whole time. And they get close up shots of her face while she's screaming. Anything interesting that might be happening during this scene, is completely ruined by her screaming. Leatherface is wearing a new mask. We're given some more information about this backwoods cannibal family. Is that what you'll remember from the scene? Nope. Just screaming. And then there's the bit with the hammer. Look, I get that they're showing how grandpa isn't even strong enough to hold the hammer, but why show him fail 8 or 9 times? It doesn't build tension, and it's certainly not scary. If anything it's comical. And while that's going on Sally just...gets away? They seriously let go of her and she just runs and gets away. After running for a while, and screaming the whole time, she makes it to a road. And luck is on her side because a semi truck is driving down that road. The driver stops, after running over one of the guys chasing her, and lets her into his cab. But then when Leatherface gets to the door, they leave the truck. Why? This one action bothers me so much because I cannot justify it at all. They're in the truck. Leatherface's chainsaw is not getting through the door. They can drive away and both be safe, but they just...don't. They just get out of the truck and run. If someone knows an explanation for why they do this, please tell me, because I am at a loss. Then while Sally and the truck driver are running down the road, Sally is lucky enough to hop into the back of another truck that stops to help. And she gets away. But the semi driver doesn't. The last we see of him, he's still running down the road. So, in conclusion, I do not understand how this movie became so popular. Again, if I saw it when it first came out my opinion might be different. But I can't give a hypothetical review based on an impossible situation. 3/10. Would not watch again. I do not recommend this movie.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

It's slasher villain doesn't talk or make jokes like Freddy, he isn't this impossible murderer like Michael Myers or Jason, Leatherface and his family seem more real and that is what makes this movie scary.

This element is often ignored and replaced by false suspense, and plugs for plot.

But if you ask people what their favorite horror movie is, this better be up there. If it isn't, and they have crap like Scream 2 or Urban Legend or even the Nightmare on Elm Street's (and if they are adults, not children) then don't trust their opinion.

It's very underrated compared to such other horror classics such as The Exorcist or Halloween while I believe that this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Even though there have been tons of more gory films released since this has come out, it doesn't look dated and it still shocks people today.This movie is very disturbing and leaves a lasting effect on people because it's always been said to have been a very violent film while there's hardly any onscreen violence. The acting and directing is so good that it's still able to scare you without tons of gore. The dinner scene at the end where the grandfather continues to try and hit Marilyn Burns' head is so grueling because you feel so bad for her. The final scene showing Leatherface swinging the chainsaw around in the air is a great ending to an excellent film.If you watch American Psycho, you'll notice Texas Chainsaw Massacre playing in the background while Patrick Bateman works out.10/10",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Everything is done well here, from the camerawork to the lighting to the sound.  But what I've always found most fascinating about this picture is how much you think you're seeing compared to how much you actually see.  The first time I saw this film, I could have sworn that I saw that meathook go into that girl's back; but guess what, I didn't.  I didn't actually see her boyfriend get cut up with the chainsaw or the kid in the wheelchair get eviscerated either, but it sure as hell felt like I did.

749,TheTrueCapitalist,A good horror film.,7,29 July 2020,"Ok, first off I won't spoil the film for anyone, even though I assume the vast majority of people have seen this film already or know at least some of the plot points of the film.
Secondly I just wanted to clear up the fact that I already knew most of the plot of this infamous movie going into it and saw multiple review. Even so it did not take away much from the viewing experience at all, rather at some points of the film it enhanced the experience. Prior to viewing the film I watching some reviews and interviews/behind the scenes and this made me appreciate the film even more.
Onto some points I enjoyed in the film with no spoilers, The start of the film is quite long but it makes sense, the build up and tension it creates really pays off with the reveal of leatherface.
The characters are fine, moderate to little depth but that's fine, we don't need to know every little detail about each character for us to root for them to survive.
The film really succeeded in its use of lighting and sounds especially in the use of appropriate music at certain points in the film, but the films lack of music to create artificial tension, really adds to the tension of the film as some of the best scenes in the film lack sound. The film also uses diegetic sound certain points most notably at the start to great effect.
I won't go into the plot as I don't want to spoil the film in anyway and this review is a non spoiler review anyway so I can't spoilt it at all.
Last thing I'd like to note is that the film is not that violent compared to later installments this is a negative to an extent as some scenes could really benefit with some more gore but this is not a necessarily negative as the film achieves its goal at being a horror movie without the use of excessive gore.This film is a solid 7/10 and if you have not seen this legendary film I do recommend giving it a watch even if you already know what it is about as watching it will still be a fun experience.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I remember watching this movie for the first time.  I was six years old and my father had come home with the first movie he'd ever rented to play on our brand new Betamax.  At this point I'd already seen screamer classics like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"".  I had grown up watching these movies.  I had no idea the depths of terror that could be unveiled. You have to remember, this was before all the mega-gore splatter-fests churned out for the straight to video market (hell, there was no straight to video market).  This was fresh and original.  Up unto this point, there were things you just didn't show...(like gruesome dismemberments and graphic depictions of heads being caved in)...but it wasn't just the graphic depictions of violence that made this a classic, it was the terror.  The terror of madmen seen in their natural habitat, the fact that something like this could happen.  You can't say that the first time you saw this movie and heard the opening voice-over about the events being seen here are actual events and not just feel chilled afterwords.  This is a landmark film in the horror genre...even if you didn't like it, there is no way you can deny it's effect on all horror films made after it was released.

When one thinks ""massacre,"" one would expect a lot of murder, gore, and (at least attempted) scary scenes, wouldn't one? One would. Yet, we follow the travels of an incredibly uninteresting group of only five, and we never see much when they get killed. They talk about pointless garble and we don't connect with them. (And Franklin was an idiot.)What happens in the movie? No massacre, I assure you. Rather, we get a look at just how little can happen in an hour and a half movie. There is no real plot development, and the movie has zero intrigue to it, leaving me bored and just BEGGING for the ending. The ending, by the way, consisted mostly of the lunatic family dragging everything on and on. The girl screaming hysterically had potential, but it only served to stretch out the scene further. The last scene also had potential but was far too abrupt. It was all just plain uninteresting.Being a fan of classic horror movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th, I was very disappointed with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

But this is definitely the one you need to see if you want to get scared to death. This is Tobe Hooper's cult classic horror flick that does one thing that many other horror movies don't. This film gives you scares from beginning to end. It starts off with a camera flashing on skeleton corpses and end with ''Leatherface'' swinging a chain saw AHHHH!! This film has a lot of terrifying moments, like when the ""dead"" grandfather hits Marilyn Burns in the head with a sledge hammer. This is one classic that will NEVER disappoint you, it gives amazing scares and will have you trembling throughout. This movie is positively ruthless and will drive you right out of your mind. So this is definitely a true horror classic that I recommend to anyone who wants a good scare. I give this film a 10/10. Tobe Hooper, your the MAN!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I didn't like it, simple as that, I just didn't see anything in this movie that scared me. The story wasn't even that great for it to be consider a good horror movie.The acting was below-par, It seemed the director had just hand-picked these so called 'actors' off the street and told them to scream endlessly through the full movie. This movie could have been a good if there was more depth in the script, the director should have gave some attention to characters backgrounds, telling the audience more about the family, their history and why they do such things.Not worth a watch if your looking for a good horror movie which you can truly enjoy.

755,stefanhunt,Where to start?,1,14 October 2006,"After decades of hearing about this film, I thought I would make my own judgement and see it for myself.I don't know what's worse. The fact that people want to make films like this, or that people get some entertainment value from watching them. Violence, if portrayed properly with artistic skill, has value in conveying a worthwhile message. It has to have context and meaning in relation to character and situation to have any sense to it.Films like this portray violence (even if implied) for violences' sake. Completely pointless. Hey guess what? 'People are cruel to each other'. That's no surprise is it? What motivates and drives violence is more interesting and worth exploring.Badly executed (pardon the pun), poorly conceived in relation to what actually happened, this film is worth missing, even if you are curious.I find it deeply troubling that anybody watching this film, and others like it, can derive any kind of pleasure from doing so. Perhaps what's worse is that they delude themselves into thinking that because it was banned that it then deserves the banner of 'classic'. Or that by virtue of it being reported as 'shocking' it has some kind of artistic value.This film only works on one level. It is that if proof where needed that the there are certain individuals that get their 'jollies' from watching rubbish like this, then films like this will continue to be made. And they are! What does that say about society? How very depressing?",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

761,erik-54313,Drags out both the Great and the grooaans,4,9 October 2021,"Tl;dr: I see why it was so important for the slasher subset of horror, but it really isn't that good today.As a cult-classic no, legendary IP in the horror genre it pains/delights me to rain on everyone's nostalgia by sharing my deep disappointment after finally watching this movie. I did not enjoy watching it.. for the most part, there are some great scenes in this movie and the camerawork in many if not most scenes is fantastic.The scenes in this movie are long, and I mean LONG and that works both in it's favor and to it's detriment. The two good examples that benefit from this are genuinely unnerving, first the scene with the hitchhiker is great. He immediately rubs you the wrong way and the length of the scene really let's that sink in just how right that gut feeling is.The second being when the camera pans around the Sawyer house, you know there is going to be a scare any second but the scene drags that feeling of suspense out for almost an entire extra minute while it continues building up the terror and our exploring characters urge to vomit.I'm going to preface the bad examples with this: the acting is what you'd expect from the era and genre.Now, the first bad scene. Before our cast of naive and dumb adolescents make their way to their slaughterhouse they spend some time eating fried fingies, being concerned with their lack of gas or not listening to Franklin. God help these poor fools as the only man with a good head on his shoulders has the worst body for the occasional serial killer to happen upon them.Poor Franklin, he was to pure for this movie. He just wanted to protect his sister. (Guess he did?) Speaking of bodies, there's plenty of'em and one is very unconvincing. Now I'm no proffesional, but I don't think dead bodies start convulsing hours after death, especially not when most of that time has been spent packed up in a freezer.The last 30 minutes are unnerving, physically, like turn down your volume or suffer a headache unnerving. Sally screams. A LOT. Way too much actually. Even when gagged, bagged and beaten unconscious she still can't SHUT her mouth. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The chase suffers the most from the long dragged out scene, to put it frankly, it sucks. 7 minutes of Sally screaming while running through foliage, briefly stopping by the Sawyer house before running back through the same foliage in footage I assume is the same as before reaching the house except it's mirrored this time.Dinner is cool, I like what the cameraman is doing here getting a lot of close ups the participants eyes and faces and generally does a very good job making it all look unnerving and grotesque. Without subtitles I can barely tell what the Sawyers are saying here because Sally IS STILL SCREAMING. I'd admire the lungs on her if they weren't so intent on hurting my ears. Through the sheer power of her vocal cords Sally gets loose, breaks a window and runs away again.Some black guy that seems pretty confused to be on set throws a wrench at Leatherface knocking him to the ground giving his own thigh a boo-boo with his chainsaw. He then throws a tantrum flailing his chainsaw around as Sally's screams which she is Still doing by the way turns into maniacal laughter while she rides into the sunrise. The movie then ended so abruptly I thought it was broken and had to look it up.I tried to keep the review spoiler free at the start but considering the people that originally watched this movie in theaters are dying of old age by now I don't care.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

As others have remarked, the movie has less gore than even Psycho, achieving its power through suggestion and some amazing performances by the amateur cast.Due to the lurid title and posters, you may have some unrealistic expectations about Chainsaw. This isn't Faces of Death. With a group, a six pack, and the lights on, you can laugh your way through it (I daresay that'll still be tough in the final ten minutes).

This is the first(and maybe last)movie that invites you to join in there,be a part of the movie,feel the intensity,be a part of the massacre.Words are meaningless here,but at least I can try making some comments on this masterpiece.First of all,it's a movie made on the 80's(i.e. 1974), and that means that it was made before Halloween, The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs and most of the 'known' horror-thrillers out there.Tobe Hopper's originality is majestic!The guy really introduces some really original ideas here:the chainsaw(as a weapon), the raw and merciless murders, the sick introduction of the 'family' and their house(chicken feathers and bones decorating the house),the family portrait(sick brothers and 'Grandpa'),the creepy paranoid music sounds,the moody and freaky atmosphere and the way they murder their victims-plain and simple..just as that..nothing more-nothing less.No special cgi-effects-everything here is original and true as hell!The killers here are really hunters..you will not see any of the victims trying to hurt-or attack the killer(in comparison to all these Halloween and Friday the 13th crap-where the killer is slashed-hacked-drowned-electrified...BUT STILL ALIVE!)No..no...forget about that..the victims just run for their lives..

It's the one film I've ever seen that's genuinely scared the sh*t out of me.5 kids (Kirk, Pam, Jerry, Franklin and Sally) breaking down on a road trip doesn't sound like a very original concept, but remember this film was the first to use this formula. After about 20 minutes of setting the scene (this is long enough to build the tension but not so long the audience gets bored waiting) the real action starts.Kill #1: When they discover the house Kirk enters alone, begins to look around, but before too long Leatherface jumps out from behind a door and beats him on the head with a sledgehammer. This kill always makes me jump, although admittedly not a foot out of my chair like the first time!Kill #2: Pam goes looking for Kirk (her boyfriend) and stumbles across a room filled with human bones. She runs out of the house but is caught by Leatherface on the porch and dragged back inside, where she is impaled on a meat hook hanging from the ceiling. While she is hanging there we see Kirk's body being dismembered by a chainsaw-wielding Leatherface. This is a pretty brutal kill, and my second favourite in the film.Kill #3: Jerry goes looking for Kirk and Pam, and discovers Pam in a freezer, still alive. While Jerry is trying to comfort her Leatherface reappears behind him and he receives a blow to the head form the sledgehammer. Leatherface then locks Pam back in the freezer. This is my least favourite, because it's the one you most see coming.Kill #4: When night begins to fall Sally starts to get worried and wheels Franklin (who is in a wheelchair) towards the house. As they approach Leatherface appears out of the trees and rams a chainsaw through his chest. This is my favourite kill from the film, because of the sheer brutality of it. You see Leatherface ramming the chainsaw into Franklin's chest for about 15 seconds.Sally then runs away and a long chase ensues, lasting for most of the last 3rd of the film. In the end Sally escapes after Leatherface falls over and cuts into his leg with the chainsaw. The final scene shows Leatherface dancing manically, waving the chainsaw round in front of the sunset.The chase leading up to Sally's escape is very tense, and Leatherface's crazy dance is my favourite scene from the whole film. I love the way Leatherface isn't shown to be crazy until right at the end of the film.It is an overall brilliant film, and inspired an entire sub-genre of 'slasher' films. I consider it to be one of the most influential films ever made.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

And I was forever mesmerized by the movie, one day I run into it special edition, re-mastered, the whole bit, for three bucks how could I say no.Anyways to the review, first of all, you could tell this is a low-budget movie, but aren't those the best, well the film looks like it was taped by a home video camera, but it gives it style, almost this realistic feel to it. But some scenes are so dark you can't even see what's going on. The natural lighting does well on some scenes, especially in the last one, and does poorly in others.The acting for the teens is hit and miss, but the performances of the family is just top to the line, the cook/gas man is really good.Some of the characters get under your skin like some kid in the wheelchair, man is his voice annoying. The family are a bunch of freak-a-zoids. the famous scene with the family in the dinner table was just so weird and freaky I loved it but, I had a problem with the movie it just wasn't scary I never jumped, yelled ""ohhh!!!"" never did the hide the screen with the knee but it still looks like I'm watching the move thing. I just felt well that sucks for them.another thing, it's probably due to all the new movies with gore and all that, well you don't see people get chopped up with that chainsaw leather face would only wave it around to make it look like he is cutting threw them, but you don't get fooled. The reason I give it a 7-10 is because I expected more from it like, super scary.**super spoiler** when the hitch hiker(that weirdo) is chasing the sole survivor down the street and then that trailer runs him over looked surprisingly good, almost real, i don't know how they did it. it is also very satisfying to see that bastard go!!!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

I've seen some films that are quite scary, but in my opinion, they can't beat this one. What i find so scary about this film is its ending where the woman at the end is captured by leather face and his family and they frighten her and mentally torture her. I also find the bit where Leatherface's brother is mocking the woman's cries for help and laughing in her face. This film is definitely going to be on my top ten horror movie list.

775,saveusjericho,Frightening And Gripping!,10,1 November 2011,"You may not be swept in by the rather clichéd storyline of this film, but once you watch it, the point of return will have been sealed, and your mind will be lost in a realm of chaotic disturbance.Five young adults travel through rural Texas, only to fall victim to a bloodthirsty chainsaw wielding serial killer. OK, sounds typical, but you cannot judge a book by its cover.All I could say about this is...WOW! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre by Tobe Hooper is definitely one of the most legendary slasher movies in history, and one of the best movies in the 1970's. It also has birthed a well-known figure in horror, Leatherface. But what is it you ask, that made this movie fantastic? It was predominantly the relentless strikes dealt by the dark and intense atmosphere. Tobe Hooper has used natural elements of the environment of a rural Texas, and projected it to intimidate the audience. The sparse lands of the Texan desert and the tension of the night were effectively put into play to define suspense. Suspense is an important matter in horror films, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre allows you to experience fear first-hand! The movie has several gripping scenes, perhaps the most engaging part was when Sally (portrayed by Marilyn Burns) was running from Leatherface after he brutally dismembered Sally's handicapped brother in one of the most ensuing chases I've ever witnessed.What has been especially gripping was the complete lack of a musical soundtrack. It was substituted for very eerie sound effects, which were very abundant during the chase scene, and throughout the film. The impact of was so immediate and made you realise how fear can be shaped into many different ways to toy with your mind.Unlike its worthless remake, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre featured minimal blood, but disturbing violence, especially in the scene where Leatherface pummels Kirk's forehead with a sledgehammer. It reinforces how you don't need gore to be frightened. And that is what really impressed me about it. The movie is loaded with, and ready to burst with suspense, the species which keeps your eyes adhered to the screen.I found The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to be one of the best and most influential slasher movies ever made, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fright.

So you have Leatherface, this rather large fellow, now, he doesn't really look all that scary, despite his skin-mask, and he keeps making all these corny noises, which makes him appear less dangerous and more comical. And the fact that he cant catch a girl who can barely run after jumping through a 2nd story window, makes him even less scary... so what we end up with is a big guy in a mask running around with a chainsaw while squealing like a pig. Not very scary (the evening news gives me more of a chill...) And then we have these stupid teens. Now, as a rule, teens in horrorflicks aren't all that bright, but these ones seemed to be particulary stupid. ""Oh my... my boyfriend went into that house and doesn't come out... maybe I should go check?"" ... right... I salute leatherface, those kids deserved to die... it's darwinism in action. This movie, just as many others are purely surviving on their initial hype. There is NOTHING special about this movie. You might as well catch any other 70's horrorflick, since this one only scares the weakest of heart...2/10 for this piece o' crap.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
778,ollieowen,One of the best horror films,10,17 November 2011,I'm 17 and I'm really into horror films and i have got to say this scared me a little bit! Would be in my 10 ten horror films and is an utter classic! if you haven't seen this yet and your into horror BUY IT! If you want to watch Texas chainsaw massacre then make sure that you are watching the original before you watch the other's. I haven't finished watching all the remakes yet but you have to watch the original first.If any one who has this on blue ray could inbox me about weather or not it is worth upgrading and buying it on blue ray i would appreciate it. Over all this is unmissable and is utterly enjoyable. This inspired me to start collecting horror films. :),The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
779,papertigers,"Awful, I'm sick of hearing great things about this trash",1,22 February 2004,"Ok, I saw the remake before I ever saw the original, and I've always thought remakes just tarnish the identity of the original but when I saw the remake and loved it, I expected the original to be a cinematic masterpiece. Well, I couldn't be further from the truth. The opening was just about the only interesting part. Right off the bat, you hate the characters. Most of them are snobby, the guy in the wheelchair is annoying and they're just not nice people. So right there, when they start dying, you don't really care, at all. The hitchiker part had no signifigance whatsoever besides just implying everyone in that county was messed up. There was an extreme lack of gore, which isn't a bad thing because I've found being overly gory can make a movie look silly. The remake had pretty graphic violence in it, but in my opinion kept it classy enough so you didn't think it was there just for eye candy, but rather to make it more brutal and real so you could feel how they feel. Everyone says the original relies on ""pure scares and disturbing moments"" rather than blood. Well, it got disturbing at times, but the pure scares? Yes the girl popping out of the freezer made me lose sleep for days, um I laughed at that part. It's clear to me the only reason there isn't tons of gore is because they didn't have enough money to have gore that would look real and not ridiculous. Because if I remember correct, Tobe Hooper came back to make the sequel which was over the top gory, over the top in every way. There was nothing scary about this, it was all cheap thrills and I turned it off after about two people got killed, and I don't even remember who got killed, because I never cared when someone died.

I had seen all the classics, and had considered myself immune to actually getting scared during movies. I was wrong. I just spent the last 83 minutes in a cold sweat, eyes glued to the screen. This movie had me on edge from the intro monologue and did not let up. The best thing about this movie is the creepy atmosphere, which was brilliantly done. It had the tension raised long before Leather-face even appeared. The kills were extremely brutal, especially for the time period. The acting was spot-on, and added to the effect of the film.

785,Tsumaru,Terrible! This movie should be chainsaw massacred!,1,7 February 2006,"Potentially one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. From the fallacy of it being based on actual events (though it may loosely be based on Ed Gein, Gein never used a chainsaw and worked alone) to the terrible acting (the jolting closeups of Sally screaming towards the end...which lasted way too long, mind you); it wasn't scary at all.I'm not particularly fond of horror movies. Mainly because I don't like getting scared. I'm usually apprehensive when watching any movie that is classified as a horror. I tend to stay away from the genre totally. Watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre was far from scary - it was *DEAD BORING*. The acting was terrible, it was slow, dull and repetitive, there was way too much screaming and running around it reminded me of Scooby Doo, and the whole thing was worthless to watch. The only good part was perhaps Leatherface at the very end. That was quite amusing.Honestly, this movie made me sick not from any kind of gore - but due to the utter crap that it was. It should be banned from all countries so no one can be tricked into thinking it's a good film and watch it. No one deserves to go through such torture. Worst movie ever.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

We are speaking 1974 or something, come on! the fact you have seen it all before, is because other movies are made after this one and LIKE this one, because it's that good. This is horror as it should be. Suspense, murder and nasty details. The sound effects are killing you, as it should be.In a time when special effects were not available as they are today, this is a outstanding peace of work. The characters all differ, like Scooby Doo or something, which makes it all interesting. The main character is a very good actress. One would think she was really afraid and confused when shooting the movie. And that masked murderer is just plain sick. He has a brother who also adds a great deal to the movie, but not too much. Everything is right as it should be, and that's what it's all about to make a great movie.If you think you like horror, you MUST see this one.

787,Paulorama,Tobe's Filthy Masterpiece,9,20 October 2009,"Five teenagers embark on a road trip through rural Texas in search of their grandfather's grave. On the way they pick up a sadistic hitchhiker who ominously smears blood on the side of their van. Undeterred, the group keeps on driving, descending deeper into the backwoods of a forgotten Texas town. Eventually the van runs low on gas, and the group decides to stop and get some help from the locals. They stumble upon an old farmhouse with a generator and decide to investigate. Instead of finding gas, they discover a family of cannibals, including a psychotic son wielding a chain saw and a mask made of skin. Each one of the teenagers are killed and butchered by Leatherface as their curiosity gets the best of them. The one remaining survivor, Sally, is kidnapped by Leatherface and his family, who are intent having her for dinner.This film doesn't leave your mind upon leaving the theatre. It stays in you, swirling around in your stomach, creating a mix of nausea and disbelief about what you just witnessed. As I was walking out, I heard people saying ""that wasn't even scary,"" and I thought to myself, 'did we just watch the same movie?' They weren't scared because they didn't absorb it; they didn't let it penetrate their psyche. They wanted a slasher film, and what they got instead was an unsettling portrait of a family so depraved and malevolent that it felt like they could actually exist somewhere. That's what is so terrifying about this movie. It explores the horrors of what could be. It exploits the unexplained fear we have of towns that are stuck in time and cut off from the rest of society. How are these people expected to evolve socially when they are removed from all civility? There is certainly a sociological subtext to Massacre.There is some compelling camera work in this film. The low-angle shots add to the tension of what lies ahead, and also helps to portray a sort of gritty sexuality. There is a particular shot of Pam walking up to the farmhouse that emphasizes her posterior qualities, and as we take in the shot we are still very afraid for her. This juxtaposition of sexuality and horror is a powerful combination that invokes two of our strongest emotional responses simultaneously. This balance falls in line with genre conventions of 70's era horror. The grainy quality of the film gives it a dirty realism that hasn't been matched in a horror film since; it immerses you into the filth and decay of the old Texas town. Tobe Hooper's extreme close-ups of Sally's eyes and teeth make you understand her terror in the most personal way. The atmosphere of this movie is visceral and confrontational; it exploits the human mind's tendency to amplify fear in one's own consciousness What exactly is behind the mask? How many victims have been mutilated by this family? We construct our own terrifying conclusions.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
788,Sardumnoonspa,Love it,10,13 November 2012,"A group of teenagers on a road trip... OH BOY!!! HERE WE GO AGAIN... the typical horror movie set up. But wait.... something sets this one apart... IT'S SCARY... to be more precise, IT'S TERRIFYING!!! And I'm not just talking about the horrible 70's clothing and hairstyles. This film is one of the very few films I consider scary. Let me list a few reasons:1) The gritty documentary feel the film has.2) The excellent performances by Edwin Neil (the Hitch-Hiker), Jim Seidow (The Old Man), and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) as the psychos (in a film this low budget and grainy, performances this real feel all the more scary) and Marilyn Burns (Sally) and Paul A. Partain (Franklin) as the victims (we truly believe and feel their fear).3)The atmosphere (the skeleton bone art... the freaky metal door in the farmhouse... Leatherface's mask and demeanor... even the way the sun sets in this film is spooky along with the sound of the farmhouse generator).4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only ""gory"" scene is when Leatherface accidentally cuts his thigh with the chainsaw). The scares lie within the performances and atmosphere and pacing.In closing... this is truly the greatest horror film (and one of the greatest films period) ever made. 15 out of 10!!!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

And all with very little blood and guts. The real selling point is that it is shot so stripped down and amateurish and performed by very few seasoned actors (mostly local college students). These factors give it a documentary-like feel which really sells the terror. And keep in mind, it's the early seventies: before Friday the 13th, before halloween, before freddy, before scream, I know what you did last summer, jeepers creepers, and countless other knock-offs. This one sets the bar. It is a thrilling horror story, shot with very few, if any, ""jump out and scare you"", cheep thrills.

793,rmtemin,"""Horror classic"", my ass!",1,4 July 2008,"As a fan of pulpy, low-budget horror, I probably should've seen this sooner, but I didn't, and frankly I wish I hadn't. This movie is dreadful in virtually every way. For starters, the premise is completely implausible - you'd think that with the implied number of victims the 'Sawyer' family had killed over the years, even backwoods Texas authorities would've taken notice and closed in on them at some point. The acting and scripting... sucks. None of the players were professionals, and it shows. The teenage victims are insufferably dull and trite, and their dialogue was irritating at best (particularly the strangely unsympathetic Franklin). The family's hamminess and lack of subtlety makes them far less than believable as villains. Even the infamous Leatherface is rendered more comic than menacing by his jerky motions (particularly during the final scene) and apparent mindlessness. The element of surprise is the only thing this movie has going for it in terms of inciting real terror, and even that is dulled by the hamfisted use of foreshadowing, and tedious pacing. As for the supposed 'graphic violence'... where is it, exactly? The only visible bloodspray in this film is caused by characters being cut on their hands or forearms. What the hell good is a gore movie with no gore? If you want real effective low-budget horror, you're much better off watching the original Night of the Living Dead, Cannibal Holocaust or Zombi 2. Those films will horrify in a convincing manner. Hell, even mainstream films like The Thing, Alien and Jaws (or the newer and much maligned Hostel) offer exponentially more scares than this piece of crap.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
794,laurenabyrd-37921,Very disappointing.....,1,28 October 2019,"Obviously pretty much everyone has heard of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even if they have never watched it before. It's been around for something like 40+ years now, spawned a remake, made its way to the top spot on some of the ""best of"" slasher movies list. So, when I was looking for a scary movie to watch for Halloween, I figured ""This ought to be a great choice, right?""..... I was wrong.Just to get it out of the way, I'm not someone who thinks all older movies are flawed. I didn't have problems with the low visual quality (actually that was one of the few things going for it. It gave it a gritty feel.) Nor am I someone who needs a horror movie to be filled with gratuitous violence and blood. I was perfectly fine with not seeing any of the bodies being dismembered in detail. When I watch a horror movie though, I do want to actually feel scared during it. All I felt during this one was anguish.For what felt like the entire first half of the movie, we were introduced to the whiniest, most annoying, useless group of victims you can imagine. They were so bad that I couldn't wait for them to start dying. In situations like that, you think ""at least I can cheer for the bad guys""..... except they were just as annoying, if not more so. I think everyone just screamed for the last thirty to forty minutes of the movie. There was no fright, no suspense....just screaming.There were a few moments (mostly right before a character was going to die) where I might have experienced a little bit of suspense. But, then it happened and it was over and that was that. By the time the dinner sequence rolled around, I had lost any respect for this movie. I mean, come on, I was sure Grandpa was a corpse until his lips started moving. Did they mummify him while he was still alive? And all those close ups of her face and eyeballs while, guess what, everybody screamed some more were just too much. And I saw another review mention this, but why did they get back out of the big truck at the end? The chainsaw was not penetrating the door. It seems like staying inside and driving away would have been the smartest move. At first, I thought the driver was kicking her back out for dragging him into her mess lol. But, no, they decided running down the road with a wrench was the best idea.When the credits rolled, I said ""That's the worst movie I've ever watched.""

Shot on a modest budget of $140,000 this movie was a huge box office success, spawning several sequels, remakes and comic book spin offs. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the cornerstones of modern horror, and it set the tone for generations to come - it manages to create a feeling of genuine terror through the use of atmospheric sounds, little gore and no true explanation as to why this cannibalistic family is the way it is, it just is.

798,whovian-65614,Texas Chainsaw Massacres Viewers,9,23 January 2020,"One of the most shocking movies in cinematic history, Texas Chainsaw Massacre delivers the scares and is a must see for horror enthusiasts.
A low budget horror flick from Texas, Tobe Hooper directs a masterpiece of horror. Working within the confines of a low budget, Tobe Hooper creates a gritty masterpiece. Rather than the budget holding it back, Hooper uses it to add to the realism. He makes it feel as if you are truly there, rather than watching a smooth, cinematic film. The jolts and shakes in the camera make it seem more real, as if the film was recovered from the site of the massacre. The setting is also rather simple, but the bones and carcasses along with the isolation of the house, off a road deep in rural Texas, make it feel extremely grimy and clearly as though you have stumbled alone into the abode of serial killers.The budget constraints also lead to more horrifying kills. Rather than seeing cheesy special effects, most of the gore is left offscreen. This allows for the viewer to fill in the blank. And whatever the viewer imagines is bound to be worse than what would be shown on screen. The meat hook scene is a notable example. The girl is dropped on the hook, though it does not show the hook impale her. Rather it only shows her hanging with the blood bucket below her. This causes a visceral response in the viewer, despite no on-screen gore.Though the budget does show its limitations by the clearly inexperienced actors of the victims being nothing exceptional. Passable enough, the acting of the kids does at times seem stilted. However, this is inconsequential as they do not last very long.However, acting by the cannibalistic family is extraordinary. Gunner Hansen is the much talked about killer, playing Leatherface. While he is very good, it is also worth noting the extraordinary effort put in by Edwin Neal as the hitchhiker and Jim Siedow as the old man. Edwin Neal excels at making the audience uncomfortable, especially the scene when he is picked up by the kids. He becomes his character. Siedow also plays his part very well, controlling his family and playing the mentally unstable killer he is. The chemistry of the characters is also quite palpable. Watch as they interact in the extremely disturbing dinner scene. It almost makes you want to take a shower. Despite the low budget, the cannibal characters are played very well.Finally, there is nothing much to write home about in regards to the story. Lacking substance, it is extremely simple. A group of kids come across a cannibalistic family and are subsequently murdered. However, this is no big complaint. There is no need in this type of film to write deep stories exploring the human condition. Rather, it pushes the limits of horror and achieves its goal of scaring the bejeezus out of you.For those looking for a film low on story, but high on scares, check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Best watched late at night with the sound up, give it a look.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

804,romansokal,review/reflections back in 1999 for its 25th anniversary,10,25 February 2018,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Under the Microscope.
by Roman Sokal (originally published in the Free Spirit Magazine 1999)
Many events can occur as a result of running out of gasoline whilst being in a strange place. You can find instant help from another driver, or perhaps walk to the nearest gas station and obtain help from there. Or, you can find yourself in the most unbelievable of dangerous situations. This happens in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Perhaps the title should have tipped you off already...Twenty-five years ago, a low-budget 16mm film tainted the white screens of movie theatres with an experience that few viewers would ever forget. Essentially they were presented with a highly deliberate and calculated film of which the visual and aural content could only best be described as 'the ultimate nightmare', The victims in the film probably couldn't believe what was happening to them, but closer examination shows that the events are all very plausible.Those unaware of sparsely populated rural communities do not know that its isolated inhabitants can lead a 'different' way of life than those in major urban centres. In such small communities, one is generally influenced only by their immediate surroundings, with little intervention by objects and concepts such as television, libraries, and other things that major cities take for granted. In these conditions one is usually reliant upon one major activity, that of which is the source of maintaining their existence - a simpleton 'way of life'.In TCM, the antagonists, the 'family,' had based their monetary existence for years and years on the only local 'job' out there -working at a slaughterhouse. If this is the only thing that they were exposed to, then by osmosis they were pre-assimilated into what they did for a living. Unfortunately for the victims, their assailant kllled cows for a living. Being from an isolated environment they lacked the influx of cognitive variables that city dwellers were subjected to. 'Leatherface' knew no different - strange people in his home were like cows, and subsequently were treated like cattle, bashed with a sledgehammer, which is what he did for a living. In a sense, their rural living can be compared to that of an isolated African tribe, only doing what they know and were raised to do in order to survive. It may be savage, but it is perfectly 'normal' to them. An acute degree of underdevelopment exists in these sheltered inhabitants. The concept of identity can be minimalized in such environments - one is left to oneself and does not have a variable of examples by which to base maturity upon. In the case of 'Leatherface', he had not progressed but remained a child. In the confrontation with his much older brother, he reacts like a child, making strange noises and acting nervously. Identity was a problem for 'Leatherface', who wore masks of other people (and of the opposite gender) on his own face. These masks, of course, In the nightmare horror tradition, were human faces skinned from their sources. This concept however extends to the more civilized. As exhibited by Franklin, the wheelchair bound invalid. His pathetic sense of self-debasing behaviour was depicted by his childish noise making in order to suggest discontent at times. In turn. he is never taken seriously- the others in the film treat him more as a child, and prey upon his weaknesses. The 'family' hunt animals, and humans prey upon humans. They, and we, are all guilty- one way or another. ·And that is what TCM plays on - the viewer's malleable perception. Are the events merely coincidental or were they doomed from the start? As calculated as the film is, it still presents an open-interpretation aspect. If you pay attention, you will notice the references to astrological events that were taking place that day, as stated by one of the female victims in the van reading from her astrology book. Also throughout the film we are shown insert shots of a mysterious hot blazing sun that a character keep looking up at, not to mention bizarre solar flares in the brilliant artsy psychedelic title sequence, which could have some kind of physiological effect upon humans bombarded by its rays. In conjunction with the slaughter-type mentality that the family possessed, TCM also depicts the possibility of some kind of dark 'ritualism' being practiced by the 'family'. The burning of the picture of Franklin the invalid by the hitchhiker/family member was indeed bizarre enough to invoke questioning, not to mention him smearing his blood on the side of the van in a symbolic looking pattern. The shrine of skeletal matter in the farmhouse invokes such theories as well.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre portrays the ultimate dreary middle finger 'fuck you' message towards Americanization. It somewhat laughs at the true quest of North American civilization- to 'keep the machine going'. And what is the symbol of such an ideology in this film? Gasoline! All plans the victims had were thwarted by the notion of obtaining the precious fuel. The family's fuel-run generator was the physical perpetrator for the fateful nightmare that took place - they were attracted to it by hearing it purring and whirring just as a pioneer did at the turn of the century by being attracted to glittering gold in a riverbed. One small step of deviance away from the 'norm"" and everything can easily tail based on the everyday schematics of relying on technology. TCM may be an extreme portrayal of this idea, but it really is no different than being in a foreign country with a different mother tongue. We are automatically re-set and must deal with primal instincts in order to get by. For the remaining protagonist, Sally Hardesty, it is survival - to innovate methods on how to sustain her own life. For the family, it is kill, kill, kill.The film seems to accurately channel and extract from the subconscious. There are moments of feeling trapped- as when Sally is in tile farmhouse, she has nowhere to hide but upstairs, which is the last place where one wants to be when one is being stalked, as escape is more difficult. One feels safe when 'grounded'. This fear also applies to those who fear flying in aircraft, because if they were in a vehicle that breaks down, they can get out and walk. In an airplane, there is nowhere to go but down - and rather quick. A manipulative element also occurs on two occasions In the film - the 'near getaway'. The narrative in the film boils the viewer's and character's blood intensely. It never lets up. Freedom is hard to come by in TCM. They are teased with it only to be pulled back into Hades. And what holds this all together is the subliminal use of radio broadcasts throughout the film in which reporters mention the time, weather, and events. It is a metronome of sorts, we are constantly being made aware of the 'moment'. And in moments of fear, a second is not important, milliseconds are.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is considered a monumental film for these very reasons. Not only does it portray a sense of 'doom', but it also projects a struggle. It enforces the notion that in tough times, one might have to take large risks to stay alive. The more one pays attention to the current moment, the more one may avoid a situation altogether. Many beacons exist in the film that take the shape of a 'warning'. The hitchhiker scene alone should have been enough to keep driving. Reading into a situation is like playing chess - I consider it 'preventive thinking' for self-preservation. Watch TCM and watch It again. You may be surprised. A copy of It even rests in NYC's Museum of Modem Art. And not only that, it is loosely based on a real-life event...",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
805,camzmetz,To me this is the scariest horror film I have ever seen and why...,10,23 May 2018,"First off.. I purposefully created an account for imdb JUST so I can write this review.. NO JOKE.. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre directed by Tobe Hooper is the scariest horror film I have ever seen in my lifetime. I first saw this recorded on a VHS tape back in 1998 when I was twelve years old from one of my older brothers who was a big film buff. I watched it alone and I heard and saw clips of it growing up earlier but I had not sat down and experienced it from start to finish. After watching it, the film would be forever ingrained in my subconscious going forward and only reinforced my love for filmmaking.In short, five young adults(or teens maybe) go out on an ideal summer day to visit an old family house, only to then find themselves being butchered and tortured to death by a chainsaw wielding, dead skin mask wearing cannibal. Thats it.. Literally.. There is no need to further explain any other details to this horror monolith. But here is why I want to explain to you why I think it's the scariest to me.1. ACTING: It is masterfully acted, the actors are not well knowns. LeatherFace, played by the late Gunnar Hansen, studied at a youths' handicap school(to my limited knowledge) to understand movements and noises by the mentally challenged. He produced an iconic performance that is at the level of movie monsters such as Dracula(1931) and Frankenstein(1932) of their time.2. MUSIC: The scariest if not one of the scariest set of tracks I have heard in other films. 3. UNKNOWN: There is not a reason to why these events transpired and happened to these youths, nor is there a reason to understand the point to it. But that leads us to understand that terrifying and horrifying things can and do happen to us people everyday without explanation. The UNKNOWN.4. MOTIVES: There are none.. There are no motives to what transpires in the film. The youths are not hunted or lured nor trapped and LeatherFace is not actively seeking out to murder and kill. Both parties just stumble upon each-other. THIS IS NOT, NOR EVER WILL BE AN ORDINARY SLASHER FILM.5. CAN'T REPLICATE: This film cannot be replicated, period. There will be sequels, remakes and other similar formulated horror films created in the same realm of it but it will never be nor have the effect of this visual viewing. It is a SUPERNOVA OF THE VISUAL MACABRE.6. SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF: From the first time to repeated viewings of this, it has felt like the actors were ACTUALLY MURDERED on set. It feels and sounds and looks like this horror is real life and we are witnessing an act of cannibalistic mayhem before our eyes. IS THIS REAL?IN CONCLUSION: As this film ages and future generations of people view this experience, I sincerely hope they experience the same that I did. Granted there have been scarier, more disturbing and jump out terror moments in other movies before and there will be in the future. What separates this film from the others is that it never happened.. But events that inspired the birth of this film was true and DID HAPPEN.. Thus taking us at the thin line to the edge of lunacy and terror of unimaginable proportions.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
806,Walexe-72950,Overrated,4,28 January 2021,This movie is truly overrated. Probably the worst horror movie that I know which have good rating.Casting: 4/10Storyline: 3/10Filming: 4/10Visual effects: 3/10.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
807,spenajohn,"The Citizen Kane of Horror, a genuinely terrifying film......",10,27 December 2019,"The grandfather of modern horror, Raw , unrelenting and magnificent, I'm always surprised when people criticise the acting ?, it was a bunch of young students who needed some work in the summer and apart from the great Jim Siedow none of them had acted before, they all did what was needed and especially Edwin Neal and Gunnar Hansen who were fantastic as the crazy whacked out Brothers Leatherface And Nubbins Sawyer, the film is definitely some twisted fairytale in the shape of Hansel and Gretel a real nightmare feel especially the long winded scene of Leatherface chasing sally and the Legendary dinner scene which is one of the most iconic scenes in horror movie history, the film is certainly a product of its time, echoing unpleasant things that were going on at the time Vietnam, Watergate, mass unemployment, social tensions, the atmosphere is so intense you can almost smell the inside of the sinister house of the cannibal clan which I may add is another strong character in the movie , the art direction of human skulls, lamps made from human skin a real Armchair lol, a plump chicken housed in a budgie cage it can hardly fit in very creepy and the soundtrack is awesome , so bleak and terrifying, the film is a classic along with The Thing, Alien, the Exorcist, the Shining, every budding horror director needs to see this awesome influential film, it's just a shame Tobe Hooper reached these heights again.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
808,hazb93,very scary if you're only 12,8,12 February 2006,"Quite a good film to watch if you want to stay awake all night terrified. If you don't like thinking about pain or get nervous when you can't see who's behind you, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. May not be suitable for vegetarians, people who live on an isolated farm in Texas, people who are in a wheelchair, anyone who does a job involving a chainsaw, anyone who has eaten meat in the last couple of hours, people who run out of gas for their car too often, anyone living near a graveyard in Dallas, people who are likely to pick up a hitch hiker, anyone who owns any sort of meat farm or their grandfather did, anyone who has heard a scuttling sort of noise in their house before, or anybody living near a trail between two sheds leading to a creek. Lets just say it ain't a creek down that trail sunshine...next time you hear a weird noise remotely like a chainsaw in the dark turn off your torch, run for cover and don't scream!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
809,jabba121,does anyone else agree that classic flicks should be left alone?,10,9 July 2006,the first time i saw this flick it scared the s#!t out of me. Leatherface the dad and the hitchhiker are the unholy trinity. any director that remakes classic horror films should first study their subject matter and fully evaluate the ramifications of their actions. what i mean is if it ain't broke then don't try to fix it. think about it would you remake a new hope or Goodfellas or raging bull? some things are sacred and Hollywood just doesn't understand that. what else can i say? if you've ever been scared by a movie you know what i'm saying. Jessica Biel notwithstanding the remake was a total piece of s#!t. remaking classic films is mental masturbation!! in summary i believe that there are certain classic movies that aren't considered classics yet said movies deserve that status and respect.,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
810,chilliecharlie,Errrrrrrrrr...scariest film ever anyone?,10,5 January 2007,"Well lets see, let me just put it this way: i never thought that this film would be so amazingly scary and strange. When I saw that the film got 5 stars in the Radiotimes I only thought that the acting was the great bit. Sure the acting was awesome but the real reason it got five stars is because it does the job of scaring the the hell out of you well...VERY WELL!! It may not be the average film length but who cares?? It scares you like hell, that is what was supposed to do and deserves a lot of credit.Another reason why it's awesome: it inspired Hooper to create a sequel and another one after that (not by Hooper), I haven't seen them, they look crap! It also inspired directors like Jonathan Demme to think of Silence of the Lambs-the guy wears peoples skin. It also inspired the creating of games including Resident Evil 4, name another game with a chainsaw wielding psychopath trying to kill you? You will be mentally scared by this film!...Unless you are really weird in the head, which you will be after seeing this film!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
811,larissajchavarria,Amazing Even Today,10,30 November 2018,"Real animal corpses, a disturbed backwoods family, and the infamous ""leatherface""- a true horror fan can not pass up the glory that is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre left the world shocked with what many critics have claimed to be the scariest movie of all time. While I myself would not make such a huge declaration, I will say that The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is beyond revolutionary. One of the key points that many people forget about the film is that it is not just thrown together willy nilly. Many people are under the assumption that this movie has no cinematic value. However, the cinematography within the movie was not only expertly planned, but is also visually stunning. During the opening scene of the film alone, viewers in the theatre got up and left due to the fright created by the horrific images before them. Every shot in the film brings out an emotion, whether it be horror, disgust, or even a laugh. The cinematography is beyond a doubt one of my favorites, playing on the actors outfits and expressions to heighten the effects of camera scenes. Without a doubt, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre inspired many other movies cinematic choices, including another famous work, The Hills Have Eyes.Another key element is the level of terror that Hopper brings to the playing field. Unlike movies dealing with the supernatural or paranormal, the Texas Chainsaw is based on more serious, more real events. This is something that could legitimately happen, a story in which the monster is human. That aspect is what without a doubt creates such a shocking vibe throughout the entire film. The psychological aspect of the film is chilling. With a spine tingling score to go along with, audiences who watch the movie will fear to ever set foot in Texas again.Among the the other brilliant traits that Hopper brings to the table, I believe the best of all is that the movie is just fun. This is a film that you can truly never get tired of watching. The energy, the action, and even at times, the comedy, just keep you begging for more. Sometimes the best aspect of a movie or novel is that you can have fun with it no matter how many times you've experienced it. That you can enjoy the movie for what it is, not just the hidden deep meaning that everyone is searching so hard for. I mean really, what more would a horror fan ever want?Overall, I give Hopper 10 stars out of 10 stars for his brilliant creation of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Go check it out!",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
812,tomrobe-10550,genuinley horrifying,10,15 December 2019,"This movie is a perfect example of why blood isnt scary on its own. From the title you would believe this film just gore with nothing more. But the film is relatively tame bloodwise. That is not to say it isnt violent it is, just not as explicit as you would think. The final sequence of sally being almost caught affected me on a gut level with these terrifying cannibals, And the last few moments of sally climbing into the back of a pick up truck as leatherface slowly limps toward her. The grainy aesthetic from the low budget adds to the terror, if it had a large budget it wouldn't be nearly as affective. I cannot reccomend this film enough. Go watch it.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
813,clintshannon-39124,Can not be compared with other slashers,10,27 February 2019,"The original. It's a 10 because nothing from the slasher or exploitation era compares to it. It is intense, raw, and it is terrifying. Few movies will make you feel like this. You are a stranger looking in at something that you are not meant to see. You feel slick and sticky from the fear and the heat, caked with filth and grime. Once it's over you are glad it's over, yet you will return to watch it again. The remakes and sequels do not even come close. How could they? This was the first.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
