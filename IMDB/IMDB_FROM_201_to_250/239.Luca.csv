0,SnoopyStyle,looks beautiful and sweet little story,8,23 June 2021,"Off the Italian coast, Luca Paguro is befriended by fellow sea creature Alberto Scorfano who leads him to live on land. Luca runs away from his home in the sea. While on dry land, the sea creatures look human but they turn back when they get wet. They enter a small town where they are befriended by local girl Giulia Marcovaldo. The trio join up for a race competition. The boys dream of buying a Vespa with the winnings and riding away.This is a beautiful looking Disney Pixar movie. The story is simple and sweet. I do have to say that I missed the closeted gay subtext. I looked at it more in terms of passing. Quite frankly, I wanted more dangerous initial stakes. Luca is more in danger on land. It's perfectly safe for him to go home. There is a way to raise the stakes by taking away a safe return as an emergency exit. If the two boys are refugees and their ocean home destroyed, it would raise the danger and their ultimate stakes. If they have to leave the ocean, it would be a more compelling dangerous journey. There are some powerful scenes. The two boys have a complicated relationship. I love Giulia. All in all, this is wonderful Pixar and a sweet little story.",Luca
1,nogodnomasters,I hunt Sea monsters,6,28 July 2021,"Luca is an underseas creature who speaks English and is banned from going on land. He is instructed to hide from boats and humans. He meets a fellow sea creature, Alberto, who drags him on land. Luca and Alberto become boys and enjoy the life of young boys. Their dream is to win the racing cup and get enough money to buy a Vespar and travel the world.The story reminded me of a number of things. Pinocchio was one. Man's fall from the Garden of Eden. And of course those sea monkeys that were advertised on the back on comic books in conjunction with hallucinogens. It was a film about diversity and acceptance and pasta.",Luca
2,paul_haakonsen,Sea monsters on a surface land adventure...,6,22 June 2021,"I sat down to watch the 2021 animated movie ""Luca"", as my son wanted to watch it. And with it being a Disney and Pixar animated movie, of course there were great chances of this being a spectacular animated movie.And yeah, the storyline was actually rather enjoyable. Sure, it was predictable, but hey, this is an animated movie aimed at a younger audience, so of course such a storyline was to be expected. But it was actually surprisingly good and provide adequate entertainment from start to end.The animation and art style in ""Luca"" was pretty good. Lots of vibrant and outstanding colors, which really brought the characters to life on the screen in a very spectacular manner. And the characters in the movie were very nicely detailed and fleshed out, which meant that these characters were ones that you quickly take a liking to.""Luca"" had some great voice acting, which is everything when we are talking about an animated movie. Having the proper cast and having talents that can bring out characters with their voices alone is a make or break for an animated movie. And needless to say that ""Luca"" definitely had a great ensemble of voice actors and actresses to portray the various characters.While ""Luca"" is not really among the top contenders of animated movies I have seen recently within the last couple of years, it is without a doubt an animated movie that is well worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch, regardless of if you are an adult or a younger audience member.I was definitely adequately entertained by ""Luca"", and my rating of director Enrico Casarosa's 2021 animated movie lands on a six out of ten stars.",Luca
3,view_and_review,Merpeople?,7,24 June 2021,"""Luca"" is about a race of merpeople??? Luca (Jacob Tremblay) is a young Italian merman/merboy who dreams about life on the surface. His parents, Lorenzo and Daniela Paguro (Jim Gaffigan and Maya Rudolph), however, are deathly afraid of the surface and don't want Luca anywhere near it. Luca defies his parents with the help of another merboy named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer). When he gets to the surface he finds that he becomes an air breathing, tail-less, human boy. He enjoys every minute of surface life, but he has to keep his true identity secret if he wants to stay safe from the townsfolk who are afraid of sea monsters.I enjoyed ""Luca."" I knew the moment would come when he and his friend Alberto was discovered, but it wasn't as dark and ominous a moment as I expected. Even with the somber message, ""Luca"" never got too down and depressing as I've seen some other animations get.",Luca
4,evanston_dad,Pixar Goes LGBTQ+,8,20 August 2021,"""Luca"" is Pixar's boldest attempt yet at an LGBTQ+ friendly film, though apparently it's still subtle enough (hard for me to believe) for the gay themes to go right over a viewer's head. My mom, for instance, didn't catch any of it at all.I had low expectations going in, but I found this movie to be very sweet and pretty delightful. Jacob Tremblay does terrific voice work as Luca, and the relationship between the two male characters at the story's center, whether you choose to read it as a coming out story or just a very close bond, is touching without being aggressively manipulative in that way Pixar movies can sometimes be.Plus, the pasta in this movie looks soooooo good that my family went on an Italian food binge for about a week after seeing it.Grade: A.",Luca
5,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Luca (2021) 7.5/10,8,28 June 2021,"""Here, the message can be either interpreted as a subtle coming-out metaphor (something that mainstream cinema struggling to represent in the dead center) or read as an effusive encomium of friendship between two prepubescent boys. Either way, LUCA is as anodyne as crowd-pleasing, if its oceanic scenery cannot surpass FINDING DORY's alluring pellucidity and ripple mobility, Casarosa and his team's picturesque creation of the town called Portorosso is a sublime knockout, and their vibrant aesthetics are overtly influenced by the Studio Ghibli's variegated coloration and hair-splitting attention to even the smallest details (the name Portorosso, ""red harbor"" itself is a homage to Miyazaki's PORCO ROSSO, 1992), looking at that Italian pasta with pesto sauce and fresh basil leaves, how toothsome it could be!""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Luca
6,thesar-2,The Little Merboys,5,19 June 2021,"Look at that bike, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think this movie's a repeat?I got used to saying: Pixar's done it again! But, luckily, I don't have to this time. Ho-hum, here we go.If you shove about 9 Disney movies into one and then cut so much out you just get a watered-down version of all the others, you'll end up with Luca who also lives on the second floor. (For part of the film. Tree house counts.)Title Sea Creature Teen wants to be part of his buddy Alberto's world above the sea and with courage, deviance and a little luck and lady, he might just see a world that makes such wonderful Vespas and Italian stereotypes. I'm trying not to spoil too much, but really, there's not too much here to spoil.It's totally serviceable, absolutely gorgeous and incredibly fast paced. In fact, when I started it and saw it was an hour and forty-one minutes, I had no idea the final 16½ minutes were ALL credits. So, in short, it is short and feels that way.But I don't have any real regrets other than I expected so much more from the story department at Pixar.***Final Thoughts: LOVED that cat, though. Too bad he shares probably 1-2 minutes of screen time. He was the only character I really liked.",Luca
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Now that they're men...,7,29 June 2021,"'Luca (2021)' is about the budding friendship/ romance between a pair of 'sea monsters' who try to find their feet on dry land so they can get a Vespa (#notsponsored?) and ride across the world together. The eponymous Luca initially leads an incredibly sheltered life, taught to fear humans as much humans fear him, but his curiosity soon leads him towards the surface, where he meets the more sure-footed Alberto and makes his way to a local village (in natural disguise, of course). It's here that the pair meet Giulia, a bright and bouncy young girl who wants to win the traditional team triathlon - consisting of swimming, eating and cycling - that she's lost for several years running. As the trio train for their task (which should provide enough cash to buy the aforementioned branded scooter), contending with a bully and the constant threat of exposure as they do (rain is, in essence, a death sentence for them), their goals begin to shift; will their friendship stay steady? As you can probably tell, there's quite a bit going on here to say that the story is actually incredibly small-scale. It takes a while for the piece's moving parts to come together into something that feels properly cohesive. It's a little stylistically strange (though its distinct look isn't unpleasant) and it plays with themes that have been seen many times before. However, it's a well-made and charming little tale overall. When it settles into itself, it's enjoyable and, even, somewhat subversive. Its ending is satisfying, if perhaps a tad artificially tearjerking, and there are plenty of chuckles peppered throughout. It's not one of Pixar's best, but it's a solid entry in their catalogue. 7/10.",Luca
8,cricketbat,"Good, but doesn't rise to the levels of previous Pixar movies.",7,20 September 2021,"Luca is a literal fish-out-of-water story that features entertaining animation and amusing characters. However, the plot is pretty predictable, and it doesn't quite have the same magic that classic Pixar movies have had in the past. There is heart & humor, but not to the level there used to be. I won't mind watching this film again if my kids choose to, even though I probably won't seek it out on my own.",Luca
9,westsideschl,Unimaginative,4,10 September 2021,"Fish type creature with family that acts and somewhat looks human-like becomes human when it crawls on to the forbidden upper world (i.e. Us).Negatives: Set in Italy we get all the Italian stereotypes along with fish & human stereotypes - very done before, unimaginative. Animation quality was average to poor - no detail, painted unmoving backgrounds. Usual morality tale of accepting others no matter how different they may be.Positive: Might be good for grade schoolers.",Luca
10,paulclaassen,So much more than just an animated movie.,7,7 July 2021,"'Luca' is so much more than just a delightful animated movie. It is a film that shows us the values of friendship, and how important it is to try something new sometimes.The animation is simply stunning. The dialogue is original and funny, while there were also many moments in the film that would make one sit and think for a moment - deeper thoughts. This is a film young and old can enjoy together. They younger demographic will enjoy it for the relatable characters, and mischief they get up to, while the more mature demographic will ponder about the film's sentimental elements. I also loved the Italian flavor.Our hero Luca reminded me a lot of the character Miguel from 'Coco' - filled with ambition and determination, yet also cautious. 'Luca' is wonderfully imaginative and inventive, while also managing to maintain a sense of reality. I loved it!Would I watch it again? Absolutely.",Luca
11,briancham1994,Warming tale of friendship,8,19 June 2021,"This film is nothing we haven't seen before. The premise will strike many as a literal fish-out-of-water story along the lines of The Little Mermaid, with an art style somewhere between Hayao Miyazaki and Hotel Transylvania. The setting is true to life, the animation is sparkling winh reflective details and the plot moments are comedic and add up to a compelling quest. However, the true strength of this film lies in the nostalgic dynamic between the protagonist friends, one an anxious introvert and the other an energetic thrill seeker. Together, they have fun, learn from each other and push each other's boundaries to achieve new and great things. It's a true testament to the power of friendship that exceeds its derivative premise.",Luca
12,Thanos_Alfie,Beautiful...,7,16 July 2021,"""Luca"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch the beginning of a new friendship between a sea monster who is disguised as human and a human. Their friendship becomes very strong and they have their own plans for the future.I liked this animation movie because it has a nice, interesting plot consisted of many beautiful scenes. The whole concept of the movie is very important for everyone and it is presented equally well. On this Enrico Casarosa who is the director of the movie made an astonishingly good job. The voices of Jacob Tremblay as Luca Paguro, Emma Berman as Giulia Marcovaldo and Jack Dylan Grazer as Alberto Scorfano fitted very well to the main characters. Finally, I have to say that ""Luca"" is a beautiful animation movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it no matter your age because I am sure that you will earn very much by watching it.",Luca
13,cruise01,Cute story about friendship and taking a chance.,8,2 August 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Luca is a good animated film and another one of pixars great films. About two sea monsters boys who are coming out into Italy small town. Where they dream about travelling on a Vespa. And competing in a competition.Beautiful and cute story. It is a coming of age story. And it works well. The animations is colorful and beautiful. The music score is great. Having a 1960s Italian tone. The voice cast is cute. The script delivered with the two boys forming a friendship.I did not like the film did have some pacing issues. Still a cute film thats worth seeing.,Luca
14,eddie_baggins,Low end Pixar,4,23 August 2021,"For good reason the Pixar brand has become a name synonymous with the words quality and magical and while expectations on new outings from the Disney owned company can't always be expected to be in line with the likes of Toy Story, Wall-E or Coco, the mediocrity of the animation behemoths newest adventure Luca comes as a shock to the system in more ways than one.Directed by first time feature length animation director Enrico Casarosa, who has previously worked on Pixar outings such as Coco and The Incredibles 2 in various roles, Luca lacks any of the charm, spark or fantastical goodness that many of its counterparts have had in abundance, as we are thrust into a story of friendship that has very few life lessons or reasons to engage in its narrative as Jacob Tremblay's sea monster/human boy Luca finds himself on dry land with new found fellow friend and compatriot Alberto as the two wide eyed youngsters join together to find a Vespa scooter to frolic around town on.The Italian seaside village is certainly a colorful and energetic landscape for Casorosa and his creative team to explore in a visual sense but all the nicely animated set pieces and visually appeasing moments fail to make up for the lack of charm or spark elsewhere as we as an audience are thrust into Luca's life and world with barely an ounce of set-up or refinement with Luca and Alberto's childhood adventure far from quality Pixar storytelling.From everything from Monsters Inc learning to confront ones fears, Coco's acceptance of death as well as life, Soul's purposeful expose on what makes ones life special or Wall-E's tale of love and friendship against all the odds, Pixar has long managed to make heartfelt animated tales that wonderfully mix together entertaining and emotionally poignant stories for young and old, whereas Luca feels like a film for nobody in particular with even young children likely to have grown tired by its repetitive feeling plot around the half way mark at best.Another key flaw to Luca's inability to make strides is the fact that Luca, Alberto and all other characters that find themselves embedded into their Vespa infused tale aren't at all engaging, there's nothing memorable or special about any of these humans and creatures. In desperate need of a Woody, Buzz, Dory, Bing Bong or Sully, Luca's failure to bring laughs or heart often stems from its poor narrative harboring bland characters, characters that are unlikely to be remembered in the months or years to come.Final Say -It's colorful and well-intentioned but Luca is one of Pixar's bigger missteps in a mostly grand history of great produce. Unlikely to be spoken about by anyone in the soon to be future, this is an animated offering even the most easy to please of Disney fans can skip.2 record players out of 5.",Luca
15,SAMTHEBESTEST,Yet another heart-touching triumph for Pixar. The desires and emotions of Inhuman creatures tugs a ring in heart of Humans.,7,18 June 2021,"Luca (2021) :
Movie Review -Pixar never makes a bad film, even their lowest rated films have tremendous one time watch value. They either make a certified Classic or a very goon one which misses a Classic tag just by one or two Inches. If you believe in all these statements then don't think about anything and watch Luca ASAP. Luca is a sort of experiment done by Pixar with inhuman creatures to leave us humans emotionally spellbound. It does not get a certified Classic tag but it's that very good one which misses it by a few inches. Pixar's filmography is like handlful of diamonds, half of them are the finest films ever made in world cinema (Animation genre) and the rest are still a must watch material for different different reasons. If we talk about recent classics like 'Soul', 'Onward', 'Toy Story 4' and 'Coco' then Luca is slightly less, but individually it's a fantastic experience for all ages and all kind of taste.Luca is a complete work of fiction when it comes to the leading characters but it has human proportions involved by the help of supporting characters. On the Italian Riviera, an unlikely but strong friendship grows between a human being and a sea monster disguised as a human. His only companion before meeting humans is his best friend - another sea monster but more matured than him. Pixar creates a fascinating world that surely mesmerizes us and some of the scenes are exactly like those wild desires we humans always dream of. This trick of showing human's fascinating wishes through inhuman characters works tremendously well. However, there is little hurrying in the pre-climax portion which looks little dull, but then sentimental conclusion covers those loopes.Just like every film, Pixar uses the same formula of taking you on a ride. You know this is a basic trick hypnotism to show you something wonderful then make you believe that it's real for those particular 90 minutes of the runtime. It works same as earlier as production design and storytelling of Luca takes you on a dreamful journey of aquatic and terrestrial souls. The background score is absolutely top notch. The animation work will take you to an unseen world of sea and surface as well. Luca has a great visual appeal and the framework is technically brilliant too.Luca is directed by a debutant Enrico Casarosa and he has done a great job considerably. However, any other experienced director from Pixar's club would have made a little different for sure. Nevertheless, it's a terrific start for a debutant. He believes in his conviction and makes you believe in spite of the fact that it's a tough job in animation world. It's not a fairytale so obviously Casarosa had to keep some things grounded and simple. Overall, Luca is another attractive piece of animated filmmaking in Pixar's factory. Do watch it as there is nothing bad about it and who knows you might find it much better than many other animated flicks. Pixar always worth those 90 minutes of your life and Luca is no different.RATING - 7/10*",Luca

17,Vartiainen,Charming childhood adventure,7,22 September 2021,"Luca is the story of a single summer in a lovely Italian seaside town of Portorosso. Two sea monster youths, named Luca and Alberto, infiltrate the town to experience human culture and end up helping a young girl named Giulia race in children's triathlon, a long local tradition.The film has been compared to Studio Ghibli films, most notably Porco Rosso (because Italy) and Kiki's Delivery Service. The latter is an apt description of the general mood of the film. It's at times pure nostalgia and feel-good moments.Then again, one of the best things about Kiki's is that there's no real villain in it. There's no good or evil, there's not even that much conflict. And that's what makes it so endearing. Whereas in this movie we have a children's film bully so stereotypical that he's even lying about his age in order to keep beating children years and years younger than him.If that bully had been a bit more three-dimensional or if he'd simply been a rival of Giulia's, this film might have been one of the best Pixar films in recent memory. As it is, it's not bad, and the good moments far outweigh the bad ones. But it has noticeable flaws, I cannot lie.",Luca
18,lisafordeay,Nice film from Pixar that deals with acceptance and knowing who you are,7,18 June 2021,"Luca is Disney's latest animated film from Pixar featuring the voice talents of Jacob Trembaly(Wonder),Jack Dylan Grazer(Shazam),Emma Berman,Staverton Raimondo,Maya Rudolph (Bridemaids) and Jim Gaffigan(13 Going On 30).Set in Italy the movie focuses on a young sea monster named Luca(Tremblay) who meets a mysterious boy named Alberto(Dylan Grazer) from the dry surface. However when its revealed that Alberto is also a sea monster in disguise, Luca decides to step out of the water and venture onto dry land as a human boy. The two later become best friends and they meet a young girl named Giulia(Berman) who has no idea that the two boys are sea monsters. The question though is will their secret get exposed?Overall I thought it was a nice film. The plot has been done to death as it reminds me of The Little Mermaid meets Splash as its a fish out of water film only the setting in this film Luca is in Italy instead of New York City or Denmark.Maya Rudolph and Jim Gaffigan voice Luca's parents along with Sacha Baron Coen as Luca's uncle along with Saverio Raimondo who voices the villian Ercole Visconti.What I liked about the film was about acceptance in the world and not to be afraid to show people who you are.Keep your ears open for celebirty chief Gino D'Campo as the voice of an italian priest.",Luca

20,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Luca,6,22 June 2021,"6/10 - while it had a lot of great themes (including a really nice allegory for the LGBTQ+ experience) and was pretty to look at, the central story of the race needed work and is easily forgettable.",Luca
21,kevin_robbins,This movie is an absolute must see,8,5 July 2021,"Luca (2021) is a movie we recently watched as a family on Disney+. The storyline for this picture is about a curious ""sea monster"" that finds an independent sea monster not scared to investigate the water's surface. Despite his parent's warnings the sea monster follows his new friend onto the land and discovers as long as he stays dry he looks like a human. The two young men/sea monsters try to find a way to live a life of their dreams among the humans. This movie is directed by Enrico Casarosa in his directorial debut and contains the voices of Jacob Tremblay (Good Boys), Jack Dylan Grazer (It), Emma Berman, Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) and Marco Barricelli (The Book of Daniel). The storyline for this movie is very unique and unfolds well and unpredictably. I really liked the intertwined story of friendship, family and regular teenage curiosity. The animation is outstanding and I loved the depiction of underwater, the countryside and everything in between. The ending is very heartfelt and I really appreciated the full circle of the storyline. This movie is an absolute must see that we all loved. I'd score this a 8/10.",Luca
22,drqshadow-reviews,"Another Efficient, Flavorful, Expertly-Realized Adventure from Pixar",8,8 July 2021,"A secret race of mer-people live their quiet lives off the Italian coast and raise their quiet children to fear the surface-dwelling monsters that sometimes pass overhead in wooden rowing machines. Luca is one such good boy, obediently spooked by what lies above, but also a little intrigued by the promise of a bigger, broader, brighter world. When he befriends another, more daring child, the two begin testing limits. Limits imposed by their parents and society, but also those within themselves. They push each other like any good, close, young friends, bolder together than they'd ever be alone, and share the pleasures of discovery that result.What follows is a beautiful coming of age story, set in the lush summer of a sleepy seaside Mediterranean village during the mid-twentieth century. It embodies the awestruck sense of limitless possibility that typifies the nearing of adolescence, as well as the golden warmth and sure, steady pacing of Italian cinema. Luca isn't afraid to linger in a moment, to better appreciate its beauty, and the masters at Pixar have once again outdone themselves in this respect. It feels redundant to mention at this point, but these guys know what it takes to make the screen come alive, while also showing enough restraint to avoid overloading the senses. Just another entry in a long line of stunners. The arching storyline is similarly rich, simple and effective. There's a cocky bully-type in town, a resilient young girl tired of taking his crap and a triathlon proving ground (of sorts), plus the natural tension surrounding the transformed sea-kids' fear of discovery. Nothing groundbreaking, really, but it's all efficiently managed with a good sense of timing, a playful spirit and a whole sackful of delicious regional flavor.I wouldn't put this one on a pedestal beside Toy Story 3 or Wall-E, but it's comfortably around the top of the next tier. Light, beautiful, warm-hearted and hopeful... just like a well-spent summer vacation.",Luca
23,CubsandCulture,"A more family friendly take on ""The Shape of Water"" (or the tropes that inspired it)",10,9 August 2021,"I am sure Luca is more directly influenced by The Creature of the Black Lagoon, Roman Holiday (Vespa) and a few other films but this parable about an outsider being accepted into ""mainstream"" society and the danger of intolerance poised to marginalized people reminds me of Del Toro's wonderful The Shape of Water. Luca is the weaker film but it is a lot more accessible and a much lighter take on the material. The film even manages to have something of the intersectionality and openness of what sort identity the metaphor is suppose to convey as it was in Shape of Water. I.e. Luca (character) being a sea monster can easily stand in for a person being LGBT, neurodivergent, and/or an immigrant. The film contains multiple characters who are marginalized in someway as was the case in The Shape of Water. I relate strongly to these themes-I also just really like sea monsters, amphibian monsters- so I am *very* fond of this film. It stands behind only Coco for my personal favorite in the Pixar canon. (Mileage will differ-the film isn't as weighty or complex as say Soul or Toy Story 2. )On its own terms this is film filled with such life and joy. The animation is very colorful and the film feels very much like it is in love with being alive. Luca and Alberto are fully realized friends and the test their friendship goes through has a very strong emotional payoff. I simply adore the designs of the sea monsters; the transitions to looking human are technically some of the best animation Pixar has done, especially on point blur. The film does a great job of mixing in Italian language and touchpoints of Italian cinema and culture that it feels distinctively unlike most Pixar films. (Like how Coco feels like a Mexican studio trying to do an American film, this film feels like an Italian studio trying to do an American or something like that)Kids and adults should find plenty to love about this film. It is yet another rousing success for Pixar.",Luca

PHENOMENAL!!,10,14 August 2021,"This film has so many great things to talk about but the 1st one that made us love it immediately is before covid hit we spent 14 GLORIOUS days in Italy and this film brought us back to that magical place. The animation was stunning as usual for a pixar film but the story was FLAWLESS.This film is extremely entertaining for all ages, it's a magical film and by far the best movie of the year!!

28,aidanratesmovies,Beautiful and Endearing- Luca is one of Pixar's best,10,18 June 2021,"Although there are similar elements throughout the film we have seen in other animated works- Luca never has a problem with being unique- and is perhaps one of the most colorful and nostalgic Pixar films to date. I watched Luca with the thought it wouldn't be a very good film. I had heard many positive things about it, but never anything too grand, and there were plenty of negative reviews comparing it to Pixar's 2015 film The Good Dinosaur which I hated. Not only was I pleasantly surprised as I hoped the film would do for me, but Luca is so incredibly tender and sweet I was crying far more than I have before in any Pixar film. Some complaints I have about the film are mainly its structure, nothing that doesn't work, but it feeling a bit familiar to other films like it- and some predictability issues because of it. That being said though, I nearly enjoyed every second of this movie despite those facts. As where many animated films struggle to stay fresh and copy off other films, Luca is simply conveying is story in a familiar format- which thankfully is executed far better than most. The character have a lot of depth, and there is such an underlying theme of fun and kids being kids, it makes me nostalgic for days where all that mattered was a smile or a laugh. Pixar beautifully captures this energy with its touching screenplay and its stunning animation , as well as through the voice performances of its main three young characters. The animation is very different than Pixar's usual schtick, which I enjoyed. There are so many beautiful and colorful scenes throughout, its nearly impossible to not smile while just looking at the film! In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed Luca and all its qualities- it may be a bit familiar, but it works very well as it is, and certainly made me care and smile more than most films this year- which after all- is the most important thing a film can do.My Rating: 9.7/10.",Luca
29,masonsaul,Great Pixar movie,8,19 June 2021,"Whilst it lacks the emotional weight of the best of Pixar's output and it's pacing meanders a little, Luca is still a great Pixar movie that's funny, heartwarming and gorgeous with a really good message.

30,jadepietro,A Fish Out of Water Tale that Entertains,8,21 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: The book may be a letdown, but the visual look of the film is stunning.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Enrico Casarosa makes an impressive directorial debut in his animated film, Luca, which celebrates an Italy of long ago. With its nostalgic yearning of a simple small town life and its cultural traditions, the film, circa the mid-50's, tells its sweet story of two misfits who happen to be sea monsters masquerading as humans, that is, as long as the conditions are dry. It seems that water thwarts their disguises and seems to convert them back to their fluorescently-colored scaly selves. No, they won't melt like the Wicked Witch of the West, but H2O is still a dreaded enemy, although they dry awfully quick.The screenplay by Jesse Andrews, Simon Stephenson, and the director follow their misadventures in our real world of land monsters. One summer, Luca Paguro (Jacob Tremblay) befriends another sea monster teenager named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer) and they spend their days exploring the sun-drenched coastal town of Portorosso, dreaming about owning a Vespa and traveling the Italian Rivera. As luck would have it, they meet an outsider named Giulia (Emma Berman) who is entering a local race, a triathlon with enough prize money to buy this retro scooter. The film's main flaw is a story so slight, with some detours into Luca's dream world that do little to advance the plot, except pad the screen time.Fortunately, the Pixar artistry is there. With wonderful details to the Mediterranean setting and underwater world, the film is quite lovely to behold. Seas glimmer, tides ripple, and fish scales move with the ebb and flow. The color palette is alive with vibrant aquas and greens and the town contrasts with its russets and orange tones. Character design is also strong and expressive. While Luca is a tad bland as our cute hero, the mostly colorful character happens to be the town bully and Luca's chief competitor in the race, Ercole Visconti (a scene-stealing Saverio Raimondo). Other characters' designs are memorable as well.Voiceover work remains good but uneven. The thick Italian accents come and go depending on the characters, which seemed too inconsistent for this reviewer. The aforementioned Mr. Raimondo and Ms. Berman are terrific, as is Mr. Grazer and Mr. Tremblay, but other vocal duties are only adequate and fail to bring their characters to life. As Luca's worrisome parents, the usually reliable comedians, Maya Rudolph and Jim Gaffigan, could have delivered more color to their brightly-hued counterparts. Sacha Baron Cohen has a small but indistinguishable part as a creepy Uncle Ugo that lacks real humor.Luca is a good sentimental family fare for young and old. Its positive view of diversity and inclusion might be rote, but its message is still timely. This fish out of water tale truly entertains and will captivate the younger set. But as ground-breaking and innovative as most Pixar movies usually are, Luca doesn't make waves. In fact, the filmmakers play it too safe in their storytelling. But it is a simply told tale with enough visual beauty to satisfy most moviegoers, including me. (GRADE: B)",Luca
31,doomedmac,A very nice movie,7,19 June 2021,"When I finished Luca I was very pleasantly surprised. It isn't groundbreaking or anything, but it was extremely pleasant and small-scale in the best way possible. Give it a watch.",Luca
32,Kamurai25,"""Merfolk of the Deep""",7,20 June 2021,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is full of fun and child-like wonder, with a surprising edge to it as there is an usual amount of violence directly related to the main characters.This has a very wholesome feel to it as it has the romantic aspect of searching for new frontiers and adventures, but not necessarily for romantic relationships.The story does a good job of pacing out the events of the movie allowing for each aspect to take the focus it needs.While this is a movie about a triatholon, it's a better story about freedom and acceptance.",Luca
33,Abdulxoxo,Mid-tier pixar,7,21 July 2021,"It's no secret that Pixar's animation quality is great; and Luca's animation is no different. The aesthetic of the town is stunning, filled with authentic little background details. The score is also nice, it has a Mediterranean vibe to it, that was perfect for the film's setting. The majority of the characters were likable, although not as fleshed out as other Pixar's characters. However, the villain was rubbish; and Luca, Alberto, Giulia (and almost all of the supporting characters) felt too generic. There wasn't enough of anyone's backgrounds to get emotionally invested in the way they wanted it to be. The story was pleasant enough for a family movie. This was one of those Pixar films that was aimed much more towards young children, rather than when Pixar's at its best and it's aimed at everyone. Overall, Luca is an incredible story of friendship, it might not be as creative as other Pixar stories, but its gorgeous animation is outstanding.",Luca

From the basic story to the uninspired characters, the terrible Italian stereotypes and fake Italian expressions shoehorned in there just to make it look Italian, or the fact that it comes out as a giant Vespa ad, I actually had a hard time watching until the end. For sure there's the usual Pixar level of polish in the animation, directing, and voice acting, but it's definitely not enough to save this. Maybe I'm just not the audience for this one.",Luca

Considering what they captured with Coco (Mexico) and Ratatoullie (France), I felt that I was in for an unforgettable film experience that I could call my own. Emotionally, this film falls very short. It doesn't pack the punch of the majority of other Pixar films. I really wish that it did. But what we get instead is still a treat for viewers. This a quick, light and gentle movie. For little children, it's perfect. Luca and his friends ride Vespas, eat pasta and gelato, and play all day. La Dolce Vita, as the saying goes. I'm reminded of classic Italian cinema while watching this. Fellini and Di Sica come to mind. It captures everyday Italian life, but with the otherworldly essence of a Miyazaki movie, with a hint of Aardman.",Luca

After proving his name in some of the acclaimed forms, he has come up with this brilliant work. The italic tint given to the animated form adds to the entertaining experience.Animation: Whenever we come across work from western counter-parts, the quality stands out.

Let's hope same is the case in this pandemic and the movie does well.Final Verdict: Well when the duo met, I remembered my childhood, especially with the adventurous one. We are young living in our own world, trying to find our own stories, obviously after going through typical kind of mini adventures as a result of now and then, rising innocent curiosities.Every mini story included in this movie came across a justified conclusion, making it a movie where children could learn about situation's in progressing life and together with family have some quality time.",Luca
38,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A visually dazzling and cute coming-of-age story.,8,14 September 2021,"It's interesting how computers continue to become more powerful, just so they can make 3D CGI look more like traditional 2-D animation. Granted, this usually applies to the characters, as textures and settings are becoming so realistic as to be nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. While I'm sure we could probably jump the uncanny valley by now, Pixar chooses to play to its more ""cartoony"" roots in perhaps the most charming way possible. Their latest film, Luca (2021), oozes charm in a way that a small story like this can only achieve.Set in what appears to be early to mid-1960s (at least by the movie posters hung on the town's walls), Luca is another coming-of-age tale like Onward (2020) but with less emphasis on family bonds and more emphasis on personal independence. And while I appreciated the ""big brother"" narrative of Onward, I think Luca's format worked a little better since not everyone will have the blood relation they can look up to. Still, most everyone has that close older friend they idolize. At the very least, Luca is charming in its message and clear in its characters' motives.As always, Pixar blows me away with the realism of their visuals. At this point, I don't even care if they haven't focused on the plot and story as much as they did in their formative years. I'll still sit down to watch their films to see how much closer they are to simulating the real world. Even if the fact that they still need to appeal to families means the characters will always have that cartoon feel to them, then it'll be interesting to see how far they can take that aesthetic to break away from the standard ""Disney look"" of the CGI characters and create something unique each time.A visually dazzling and cute coming-of-age story, I give Luca 4.0 stars out of 5.",Luca
39,bankofmarquis,Charming and unspectacular,8,22 June 2021,"Usually, a motion picture premiere by PIXAR is a major event and (most of the time) the product premiered is one of the better films debuting in that year (regardless of whether they are animated or not). But...the past 2 PIXAR films have debuted directly on the Disney+ streaming service.One can understand SOUL debuting on-line since the world was in the midst of a global pandemic. But with LUCA, one had to scratch their heads wondering why the brass at Pixar wouldn't give it at least a cursory theatrical release.But, now that I've seen LUCA, I know why.Luca tells the tale of a sea monster named...you got it...Luca, who ventures above the surface of the water with a friend to the human world. As a premise for this film, the Sea Monsters turn into humans when their skin is dry (and turn back into Sea Monsters when they are wet).As Directed by Enrico Casarosa (the director of the the wonderful 2011 short animated film LA LUNA), Luca is a charming, if unspectacular, film that wears its heart - and it's message of inclusion for ALL, no matter their differences - on it's sleeve in a pretty overt way that doesn't aide, nor does it detract, from the film.Playing the lead roles of Luca and Alberto are child actors Jacob Tremblay (ROOM) and Jack Dylan Grazer (IT) and they are just like this film - charming and unspectacular. They instill these characters with youthful zest and energy...but not much else. Rising above them (and this film, if I'm being honest) is the voice work of the wonderful Maya Rudolph and the always affable Jim Gaffigan as Luca's parents, who end up looking for Luca in the human world. To be honest, I would have rather had a film focusing on these two looking for Luca, than the movie we got.Director Casaroso has stated that he has been inspired by the works of the great Japanese animation Director Hayao Miyazaki and it shows in some of the scenes that are absolutely breathtaking to look at while the feeling of this film is light and airy and not too terribly deep.This is the 3rd straight film from Pixar that I have found to be ""just fine, nothing special"", which is just a bit disappointing in that Pixar films were once the gold standard of animated films.While not a standout film, Luca is an entertaining diversion and certainly one where the younger ones in the family will find fun while their parents will be entertained...enough. I have to admit, that I was not engaged with the main characters throughout the film, but was caught up at the end and found myself rooting for our heroes, so I guess Casarosa did something right.Letter Grade:B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Luca

43,kjproulx,A Very Solid Pixar Outing,8,25 June 2021,"Pixar is one of the rare studios out there that doesn't want to have anything to do with poor films. Yes, there have been a couple of instances where it was pretty obvious that they made a sequel in order to make a quick buck, but every major studio has done that at least once. Instead of hitting theatres, Luca is now available to stream on Disney+ and while it's definitely not anywhere near Pixar's best, it's a very good film for kids all around. With some underlying messages that older kids will definitely catch onto, I really think this one is worth the watch. Let's dive in (no pun intended).Under the sea, on the edge of an Italian town, Luca, a sea monster, wishes to reach the surface, where he will become human. Stumbling across another boy around his age who has been living on the land for some time now, the two of them become best friends. Due to the fact that a poster of a Vespa is on the wall, they choose to venture further into the town, befriending a young human girl, Giulia. These three become inseparable and strive to win the annual town race. This story worked as is, but it's where the film goes at the end that sold me.About 30 minutes into this film, I found myself wondering what the point of it was, other than some fun visuals for kids. Certain life lessons come into play, as well as moral dilemmas and I admired that about it. I had a good time with the first half of the story, but it never felt like it was going anywhere, outside of these kids hiding the fact that they're monsters. Even during the climax, I still found myself wondering that same question, even though I was having a good time with it. It took about until the last 10-15 minutes for me to really feel like the movie earned its stay. With that said, the ending was much more than I was expecting, because most of the movie just feels like light-hearted fluff.As always, Luca is beautiful to look at, just like every Pixar film before it. Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer, and Emma Berman are all likeable as the main voices, but Tremblay and Grazer are minor veterans at this point. The funny one-liners that riff on Italy were also a blast and the dialogue all-around was well-written, especially for just being a film for families. I smiled throughout the majority of this movie, even though there are many inconsistencies about how much water affects them in the real world and how quickly they dry themselves. This became a problem for me and took me out of multiple scenes, but you're just supposed to be having fun. These fish out of water scenarios have become a staple for most Pixar films for some reason and there's never a single person who witnesses anything suspicious. It was funny that they had a cat recognize them, but that gag wasn't enough to sell it for me. Overall, Luca is a very solid family film and I recommend checking it out, especially if you're already a fan of Pixar films.",Luca
44,AhmedSpielberg99,Bellissimo!,7,7 July 2021,"I will never forget the first time I saw La Luna with a crowd. The look of the glowing stars scattered in millions and covering the moon left us in awe - like, we literally wowed at the look of them. Was it the first time for our eyes to be graced with the wonder of magical cinematic experience? Definitely not - or at least not for me. But there was a certain tactile sensation the animation in that short evoked in spades like no other. They seemed tangible. I felt like if I stretched my hand I could touch them, and even feel their weight, bolstered by the glass-like sound they make when they are swept up. Luca has no dearth of that quality. Enrico Casarosa's first feature film has an animation reminiscent of that of stop-motion films. Its 3D animation possesses that malleable look that almost could be mistaken for claymation. That brings a sense of vibrancy to the already-vivid idyllic Italian setting. And when you see the tide soaking the beach pebbles and listen to the pitter-patter of the rain, it's guaranteed you'll feel the breeze coming off from all around you with the redolence of childhood summers. I also adored the underwater world. It's nearly as if it exists in a parallel realm that happens to be in the Mediterranean Sea, where fish bleat and crabs bite when they ""sense weakness"". No wonder why its inhabitants consider humans ""Land Monsters""!Unfortunately, I can't muster up similar praising words when it comes to the story. Sure it's a sweet fish-out-of-water story - I mean, literally - about our titular kid breaking the protective shell built around him by his overprotective parents, while tackling themes of friendship and acceptance. But haven't we had enough of this already. I mean, I'd lose count if I tried to mention how many children-oriented movies that have taken such basis to build their stories upon. The story here hasn't much substance to keep it from dragging. It's definitely a joy watching the trio of under(the)dogs daydreaming about the dream they share of winning the Portorosso Cup and Alberto being the daredevil he is or even bickering with Giulia. Other than that, there's not too much that really happens. Even Luca's antagonist, Ercole Visconti, that garnered plenty of admiration from many people because of how a typical villain in the vein of Toy Story's Sid he is, is nothing more than a bully that no one can stand against.Regardless, there's at least one thematic choice that reinvigorated this traditional fable near its bellissima finale. Without getting into detail, it's something that has to do with doubt in Luca and Alberto's friendship. It's not about it per se - it's nothing new and you can even see that moment coming from a league - but it's the way it ties up how Luca perceives Alberto's quasi-hedonistic view over the course of the story with Luca's fear of destroying the image his parents would like him to present was kind of brilliant. He's striving to satisfy his innate thrill-seeking desire and sense of curiosity while fitting the mould of the ""good boy"". I think that added an extra layer to the character of Luca. Really enjoyed Pixar's latest effort that, small-scale as it is, overflows with wholesome vibes.",Luca
45,Movi3DO,Overdone story,6,19 June 2021,"Silenzio Bruno paparazzi Luca Alberto *in Italian accent*A new Pixar Disney movie in an Italian town. Luca, a sea monster with the ability to turn into human when on land, ventured into land with his friend Alberto and the two hoped to win the race in town to buy the Vespa.The animation was pretty alright. However, it's for sure not the best from Pixar. Still, the movie looked dynamic and fresh. The animation of transition of the sea monsters into human were smooth.It's the first time that I watched a movie about an Italian town. I found the characters hilarious with their accents. Also, when Luca and Alberto came to land and learned about the world of humans, they used sentences at the wrong time and asked silly questions that cracked me up many times.The story itself was done a hundred times before. It's a story of a character who defies their family or tradition and ventures out to the new and sometimes unforgiving world. The characters were pretty straightforward as well. There's nothing in the progression and ending that were unexpected or unique.However, the bromance between Luca and Alberto was still sweet and endearing. They had fun, then conflict, and then reunion that solidified their friendship even more. There was also a human girl that befriended both of them, and honestly I didn't invest much in the dynamic between her and the two boys.An odd aspect of the movie was its theme and execution. Since the humans saw these sea monsters as not human, it's obvious the theme would be about inclusion and accepting the characters instead of judging the look. However, because of the familiar plot and seemingly quick ending that I felt the delivery of the theme not convincing. It felt too optimistic and maybe even naive.Overall, it still had some heart and comedy, but the story was overdone and the execution was a bit off. 6.5/10.",Luca
46,katyayan-12892,Simple And Beautiful,9,6 September 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe stand-out element of every Pixar feature is the visual splendour of the storytelling. Luca is no different in that department. Breathtakingly beautiful scenes of the full-fledged underwater civilisation that Luca belongs to; the gently rippling sea at the shore; the crystal clear azure sky, seagulls flapping about with abandon; the picture perfect seaside town, with gurgling water fountains and sloping, cobbled streets all come together to deliver visually pleasing frames. The warm colour palette aflame with fiery oranges, ablaze with bright blues is a delight by itself.

From the detailed animation that makes the Italian coast look realistically astonishing to Dan Romer's rich score that hits all the right notes, without forgetting the outstanding voice work, every Pixar's trademark technical attribute is present in an admittedly less complex, unsurprising narrative. Enrico Casarosa takes Jesse Andrews and Mike Jones' light screenplay through a generic structure, where the ""feeling/being different"" theme is efficiently developed but closed in an underwhelming manner. Nevertheless, predictability means nothing in a movie where fully-developed characters spend the summer creating genuine friendships with an impactful emotional weight that might induce a couple of tears in the last few powerful minutes. It's not my favorite Pixar flick, but it's definitely a good film that I wholeheartedly recommend watching.""Rating: B.",Luca

Yet, with an amiable set of characters & true-to-life illustrations; it is still a well enough animated piece that must not be overlooked!Pixar has always been my first pick in terms of Animation Movies! The reason being, on top of providing us quality content time and time again; they routinely incorporate significant subtexts in their writings. Which can be associated on a larger scale!With vividly drawn sketches and a pacifying score behind, the narrative here centers on two undersea critters who are deemed to be 'Sea Monsters' in the eyes of Human Beings; at the other end, Humans are looked on as heartless sociopaths. Therefore, these two diametrically opposing colonies avoid crossing each other's paths at all costs! However, In due course; under unforeseen circumstances, these two worlds come face to face.And quite surprisingly, the cunning veil of fallacies starts to fade away as the prospect of feasible coexistence dawn upon them. Globalization, Refugees, Immigrants; can you figure out the astute symbolisms? Ponder over and you will understand its close ties with our social welfare! Besides, it also goes on to showcase the true worth of acceptance & acknowledgment.It teaches us to accept ourselves as we truly are. Being different, it's nothing to be ashamed of! Every single culture, tradition, every last one of us is different in some way but that is the beauty of the human race, right?I know there would be people who won't understand but the rest definitely will! Just as Grandma Paguro says to Luca's concerned parents;""Some people, they'll never accept him, but some will. And he seems to know how to find the good ones!""Golden words, if you get the context underneath!I could go on and on about its unobtrusive sanguinity, but now do me a favor; go and give it a watch!

52,MrDHWong,"A simple, sweet-natured story that doesn't quite reach the heights of the studio's all time best",8,24 June 2021,"""Luca"" is a CGI animated film by the people at Pixar. Featuring the voices of Jacob Tremblay and Jack Dylan Grazer, it is a simple, sweet-natured story that doesn't quite reach the heights of the studio's all time best.In the ocean surrounding the Italian seaside town of Portorosso, young sea monster Luca Paguro (voiced by Jacob Tremblay) lives with his parents on their underwater farm helping them out with the herding of goatfish. While out exploring one day, Luca meets a slightly older sea monster named Alberto (voiced by Jack Dylan Grazer), who reveals he has the ability to travel out of the sea onto the land at will. After some convincing by Alberto, Luca joins him on the surface and he soon discovers that they can transform into human form when completely dry while reverting back to sea monsters when wet. Realising the world above the ocean isn't as dangerous as he had initially thought, Luca accompanies Alberto on an adventure into Portorosso while keeping their true identities a secret from the townsfolk.As we should expect by now, Pixar films have a tendency to cleverly deal with themes that virtually all age groups can relate to. For example, the original ""Toy Story"" focused on the inevitability of being replaced by someone better while ""Inside Out"" dealt with taking bad memories with the good to help become a better person. In ""Luca"", its theme is about as obvious as it gets - it's okay to be different. From the moment Luca sets foot on land, it is clear that at some point the story is going to feature him convincing humans that sea monsters are nothing to be scared of and that we should all be accepting of others no matter who they are. Although I have no problem with this theme, the way in which it is promoted here feels too lightweight and lacking in subtlety. This feels like a major downgrade from previous Pixar films like ""Soul"" and ""Coco"", which were considerably more philosophical in their storytelling methods. That's not to say ""Luca"" is a bad film, it's actually very good otherwise, it's just that I've gotten so used to Pixar being much cleverer and wittier in recent years that this one seems so inferior in comparison.One thing I can never fault Pixar for is the quality of their animation, although here it feels more stylistic than realistic. The vibrant look of the small Italian town of Portorosso looked so alive with its residents going about their business eating pasta, walking the cobblestone streets, and riding their Vespa motor scooters, all while the sea gently laps at the shoreline. Later, this is juxtaposed with Luca and Alberto's multicoloured sea monster forms emphasising the literal fish-out-of water situations they often ended up in. The animation technique employed here feels like a humble return to their roots rather than something groundbreaking, as it reminded me of their earlier work from over twenty years ago. Another thing that came to mind was the Studio Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"", which also featured a seaside setting and an aquatic character who wanted to venture out onto the land. It turns out a comparison like this isn't too outlandish, as the film's director Enrico Casarosa has stated that ""Luca"" intends to pay tribute to the work of Studio Ghibli filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. While I did enjoy this combination of eastern and western influences, I just wish it had a better story to go along with it.I liked watching the interactions between Jacob Tremblay and Jack Dylan Grazer as Luca and Alberto, respectively. The two of them were believable as a pair of best friends trying to familiarise themselves with a completely different environment from which they aren't accustomed. Newcomer Emma Berman also gave a nice performance as Giulia, a local girl who befriends the duo and teaches them about life in her hometown. All of this encapsulates another prevalent theme found in Pixar films - the importance of friendship. However, I was disappointed with the film's main antagonist Ercole, who is nothing more than a one-dimensional bully set on making life hell for Luca, Alberto, and Giulia. His sole purpose in the story is just to be an annoying stumbling block for the three of them whenever necessary and he added little to the overall story.Though I doubt it will ever be considered a classic, ""Luca"" is still just as fun and entertaining as most other CGI animated films released today. What I believe holds it back most is its unwillingness to step outside its comfort zone and try something different with its thematic elements. That doesn't mean I think it isn't worth seeing, I just wish it had utilised its potential better. For all I know, this could have been another Pixar masterpiece, but instead, it is what it is.I rate it 7.5/10.",Luca

The characters and conflicts might have been a little predictable, but they were also well developed. By the time the stories all collided (because it IS Pixar, after all), I couldn't help but care. It is not on par with their very best movies, but it is a reminder that simple can be beautiful.",Luca
56,elicopperman,Adorable & Nostalgic Take on Friendship,8,19 June 2021,"This month, Pixar released a brand new feature called Luca, set in the Italian Riviera sometime between the 50s and the 60s. Directed by Enrico Casarosa, who previously made the Pixar short film La Luna about a decade ago, the film is loosely based on Casarosa's childhood in Genoa, Italy. While its initial plans for release in theaters might not have gone as planned, mainly with the pandemic still being around, it has gotten a lot of traction on Disney + and within the film & animation circle. As of now, the film has been viewed as another solid entry in Pixar's catalogue, but let's see how it favors out overall.The film focuses on a young sea monster boy named Luca Paguro, who has the ability to assume human form on land. Along with a new best friend named Alberto Scorfano, Luca experiences a life-changing summer in the town of Portorosso. Now even though that premise sounds like a literal fish out of water storyline, what does make Luca at least somewhat distinctive from others like it is the metaphorical aspect. Around regional Italy, sea monsters are mythical creatures of ancient folklore, and the film makes good usage of those myths by making Luca and Alberto different from the people in Portorosso. In fact, their whole friendship goes from the usual shy kid and troublemaker duo into a much more genuine and emotional relationship based on what they want to become. Alongside the luscious Italian seaside, it's the unforgettable summer adventure itself that further develops Luca and Alberto as maturing youth. It might be hard to overcome certain obstacles when you're trying to pose as something you're not to others, but it makes all the difference when you're doing it with close friends.Along the summer of their lives, Luca and Alberto are not without plenty of friends and foes. While they may face some enemies such as the egotistical blowhard champion of Portorosso, Ercole Visconti, they do make a genuine connection with the outgoing and adventurous bookworm, Giulia Marcovaldo. What's fascinating about Giulia is her skepticism towards sea monsters, partially from her fisherman father Massimo, and yet her overly abundant enthusiasm makes her a delightful companion to Luca and Alberto, even if they don't share the same views. Meanwhile, you have Luca's overbearing sea monster parents who are determined to keep their son safe without understanding what's best for him. While their scenes could have easily been tiresome, the film only showcases them from time to time, and they do get some of the better laughs throughout the feature. In many ways, the nostalgia from childhood is heavily present in this cast, because like several kids who experienced multiple people throughout their youth, Luca and Alberto come off stronger with these differing personas.As usual for Pixar, the art direction and animation is nothing short of gorgeous, but in this case, they manage to elevate the old look of the Italian Riviera through strong architecture, near painterly colors and adorable character designs. Given that the crew behind the movie spent a lot of time researching the landscapes and locals of the Italian Riviera, they managed to capture the right amount of detail and texture common around a seemingly imperfect yet lovely seaside town. These set pieces are often utilized best in some chase and biking sequences, with some appropriate lighting and shadows to emphasize the tensity of the sequence. In addition, the character designs look like old Italian cartoon caricatures brought to life in computer generated imagery, with some smooth motion and sincere acting emphasizing their appeal that much further. The underwater scenes are also a nice added bonus, for even though the overly complicated process of generating water in a computer might not be a concern to audiences anymore, the movie does its job so well that it doesn't need to be.With enough charm and heart to win over as many people as possible, Luca is one of the most humble depictions of friendship in a feature length film in such a while, live-action or animated. Given how deep the idea of staying true to your friends no matter how much you grow up is, there's a good chance future generations will gain that sense of morality from this wonderful feature altogether. If you're a fan of Pixar or looking for a delightful taste of Italian authenticity this summer, give this flick a shot. As lower scaled and infectious as it may be, it's well worth giving the attention it could use.",Luca
57,dilipbts,Luca,9,19 September 2021,"Just got out of a showing at the first day of screening of this film at a cinema in Israel with my family. Firstly, this film is perfectly made on the technical side. Everything looks beautiful and fully immerses you into the world created as if it were real. Underwater shots as well as shots of the city. The story is not completely unique, a ""fish out of water"", a story of a character learning and developing -- overcoming adversity as well as self doubt. A classic worth telling and it is a good feel good story with well defined characters, each helping the story move along. I think emotionally, this story gives a lot of things to think about and the communication between characters, Luca and his friends, are very well written and very believable even though we're dealing where the fantasy part (becoming a ""sea monster"") is an occurrence. If I have to nit-pick, I would say that the film on one hand shows that dangerous things could be dangers but also that it is important to confront your fears -- perhaps in an instance or two it might have been good to add a band-aid or something to make it slightly clearer that a character went a little too far. Overall, though, this is not an issue to worry about. I don't think any kid is going to jump off a cliff because of this movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good character building with an arc. It is not Shawshank, or Empire of the Sun, but it is a lovely movie. Very happy this was my first film-house visit after the pandemic.",Luca
58,saadanathan,Funny and enjoyable summer movie 7/10,7,1 November 2021,"Pixar's latest film, Luca, is a very welcomed movie for the whole family to watch together on summer vacation.It is enjoyable, funny and emotional, just like a Pixar movie should be. The actors did a marvelous job, the characters were funny and great, the animation as always is a top tier and the idea is brilliant.Although I did find it to be a little rough to watch, not only is this movie not going to be compared to other great Pixar movies, but the whole concept and idea is a little taken off from ""The Little Mermaid"". I mean seriously, Sea Monsters? And non talking fish? Kind of seems to me like they were trying to copy the success of Finding Nemo.Even though this movie falls short from its previous stories, I do believe it's worth watching and appreciating it. After all Pixar doesn't fall short often but rather try new things every time.",Luca
59,PyroSikTh,Enjoyably Unremarkable,7,25 June 2021,"Luca wasn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm hesitant to say it was particularly great either. It was an enjoyable and colourful cartoon for kids, that had my own kids laughing numerous times (Machiavelli the cat was by far the best character), but it doesn't offer a whole lot for the parents. Ultimately it's Pixar being generic and vanilla; not offering anything particularly new or challenging, which is fine - they're allowed to do that - but it means this movie will be one of the forgotten entries in their catalogue. There's nothing wrong with this movie at all, but there's nothing that particularly stands out in it either. I give Luca an enjoyably unremarkable 7/10.",Luca
60,baileycrawly,Breathtaking,10,28 June 2021,"Pixar, you made me cry again!It's almost impossible to see a film like Luca and not draw comparisons to other things. And it's true, there are moments of this film that are derivative of other things, but it takes the core concept and develops them in their own unique ways. Sure there were moments in this film that were reminiscent of Call Me By Your Name (another favorite film of mine), but to say that it's the Disney version of the film is unfair.There are definite LGBT themes running through this film despite the director swearing up and down that there aren't. Not in the sense that there was a genuine sexual tension between the characters, but rather this film works as an allegory for being gay in a world that, while still somewhat inclusive, has a lot more work to go. Having just come out this year myself and having seen some of the negativity and hostility, it's extremely easy to relate to the characters on that level and, as the story progresses, it's more than enough to make a person shed a few tears with Pixar's patented emotional manipulation techniques they've employed since Toy Story.The cast of the film is phenomenal yet again, another testament to the talent scouting team at Pixar. The endlessly talented Jacob Tremblay, coupled with fellow child actor Jack Dylan Grazer are absolute scene-stealers as Luca and Alberto respectively, crafting a dynamic relationship that is able to touch the hearts of the audience within a very short span of time.While it's not PIxar's best film (I still maintain that Coco is solely deserving of such an honor) it's an absolutely beautiful film. Well acted, gorgeously animated, and with a message that a lot of ""underdogs"" need to hear. I feel heard and validated in who I am after watching this movie. And although it might be trendy to hate on Pixar right now, I don't even care. I love this movie.",Luca
61,sweidman-28016,Heartfelt and Cute,8,28 June 2021,"""We can go anywhere, do anything... we just gotta stick together!""Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, Luca is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below the water's surface. Pixar is known for their breathtaking animation that keeps getting better and better, and their deep messages hidden (or plainly out there) behind the heartwarming story. Luca has the animation part down. I'm not entirely sure the messages are bolder than other works, but that doesn't take away from the experience. For Pixar, this is a ""simpler"" than others. Some might find that disappointing. I found it to be a breath of fresh air. I don't think everything need to be profound or bigger than it needs to be. Luca was different than I expected. The goal is pretty simple and I like that. Parts may be a little overdone at this point and it can feel a bit too predictable. As it goes along, I couldn't complain. The beginning does take a little getting into. Once everything is setup, it's gold. One part I do have some issue with is the main antagonist. He's very basic and I would've liked to have some reason to understand where he's coming from, but it's alright.The voice acting is perfect. Jacob Tremblay voices Luca well. Emma Bergman adds fun to Giulia. My favorite comes from Jack Dylan Grazer. He's built up a career since the It movies. I really liked him in We Are Who We Are and this is another good performance. The animation never fails to bring amazement to my eyes. The character designs aren't some overused Disney template or too realistic, but instead a something new. Hair looks great in this I will say that! The backgrounds are complex and pull everything together capturing the Italian seaside beauty. Dan Romer's score is one of the highlights. He's one of my favorite composers and he does such a good job with adventure films, especially ones involving the childlike wonder. Technically, it's great, but it's not like we expected any less. Something I took note of was how inspired this was by Studio Ghibli films. The story feels something out of one, some of the visuals and scenes alone, even the town is called Portorosso- named after the film Porco Rosso. It's hard not to be inspired by Ghibli but this takes it heavily. In the end, I would've liked just a little more out of Luca, but this is still adorable and heartening. It's a shame that this didn't hit theaters and that it is free on Disney+. Free is nice, but also it sucks for all those who out work into it, especially for a Disney project. Anyway, I would recommend Luca and it'll be one to revisit again.",Luca

65,LloydBayer,"Breezy summer fun, Luca is just the remedy for wonder-starved kids and travel-starved adults",8,29 June 2021,"Fish out of water films are nothing new for Disney and Pixar. But using the concept of yearning and discovery from beloved animations like Finding Nemo or The Little Mermaid, Disney takes another plunge, this time off the coast of Italy. In its purest form, Luca is a beautifully told story about friendship, sacrifice and loyalty, through the fun, frolicking and fleeting moments of youth. The magical beauty of the Italian Riviera as a backdrop will capture you from the first few seconds of this animation, and transport you right through to its bitter-sweet ending. In between, prepare to abandon all your worries and let wanderlust take over as we discover that fish out of water, and specifically a sea monster, can appear to look human.Voiced by Jacob Tremblay, Luca is a sea 'monster' living in the vivid blue waters surrounding Portorosso, a small town that looks like it could be part of Cinque Terre. After befriending fellow sea monster Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer), they discover that the world above is a fascinating place. Learning to walk and hide their true identity becomes fundamental to blending in with humans, but not so much as the effects of gravity and their newfound love of the almighty Vespa. After fun but failed attempts at riding a Vespa made of scrap, Luca and Alberto crave at the chance of riding the real thing. With a lot of help from Giulia (Emma Berman), a human girl their age, they might just have a chance at acquiring a real Vespa if they win the town's annual triathlon. What follows is the preparation for the race, with stiff opposition from the local bully who can quite literally tell that there's something fishy going on.With an unspecified time period, the gorgeous visuals and production design would have us believe that the adventures of this trio of misfits are set in the 1950s. For the keen eye, there are also bread crumbs dotting the background with Italian pop-culture of a bygone era. And yet, the heart of this film is a coming-of-age underdog story with a message that is hard to miss. Although on the nose, the metaphorical and literal message in Luca shares the same sentiments as the Academy Award winning Best Picture - The Shape of Water - that humans are capable of fear and loathing of anything or anyone different. While Pixar films have long explored complex themes of existence and belonging, this is a film about acceptance. And on a deeper level, feels like a calming whisper about inclusivity, identity and the fact that we are all the same no matter the label.Story artist of Coco fame turned debut director; Enrico Casarosa is clearly not aiming for anything as profound as Pete Doctor's Academy Award winning Animations Soul and Inside Out. That ambition aside, Luca is still a loveable film with warm exchange of culture and a deep rooted love for life in simpler times; like those bygone years when you could go to the beach in summer and wear what you want without worrying about what other people think. No labels.",Luca
66,daisukereds,Santa Mozzarella!,8,19 June 2021,"Beautifully crafted and animated movie. Has a lot of spunk in it's step and lots of energy in movement and speech (the Italian sprinkles were very different and fun). The clothing textures, the colors.. everything in it is very vibrant and cheerful.I quite enjoyed the art style and stylistic direction, particularly in the logos, brochures, and even the storytelling in the credits, etc. Excellent world building for such a short photoplay.And just as the animation itself is energetic, so it's the story and characters, with very fast paced beats that make up for a good story as a whole!

Overall rating 88/100Luca is about a young boy who experiences an unforgettable seaside summer on the Italian riviera filled with Gelato, Pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound bestfriend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply held secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below the oceons surface.Despite not having as much impact as previous pixar films, Luca was still a beautiful film. The animation was absolutely incredible and inventive, you truly got lost in the world. It was very funny, the worldbuilding was excellent. I loved the Italian representation and culture, it made me want to go to Italy. The characters had fantastic chemistry and were very likeable. The movie had a good set up for development. The film had a beautiful charm to it, I also liked the character conflict. The progression to the plot was well thought out. The voice cast was excellent, especially Maya Rudolph, Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer and a key standout of Emma Berman. It was visually very creative. I loved the themes of friendship and acceptance, they touched on it beautifully bringing the emotional weight expected from Pixar. I liked the character development and there was some good depth to the characters. I loved the separate storylines and building of tension between the main characters friendship. There was enough stakes to do with the water, and the ending was very heartwarming.However, the villain was very bland and forgettable. The set up was slightly rushed at the beginning. There was a slight lack of plot and stakes that effected the film in parts. And it didn't have the same amount of depth and originality as previous Pixar films.So overall, Luca isn't top tier Pixar and they played it slightly safe. However, Luca is still a visually beautiful, heartwarming and charming adventure with loveable characters. And its beauty was in its simplicity, and is another win for Pixar just on a slightly smaller scale.",Luca
69,jakethesnake-42007,A simple but great film,7,4 July 2021,The last few Pixar movies have been hit and miss but I found Luca to be one of the better ones. What's great about the film is that it's not big flashy it's just a simple story and a simple movie but that's what works. A great coming of age story for anyone. I liked the characters and the story. Is it Pixar or Disney's best films no not close but its a hidden gem Disney movie and I have a feeling it will become one of those hidden rem movies.,Luca
70,MogwaiMovieReviews,The Little Merman,7,25 July 2021,"It's almost to be taken for granted now, that a Pixar movie should have likeable characters, lovingly-detailed production and immaculate-in-every-way animation, but Luca has all these all the same. It's some way short of the best Pixar films, and there's nothing here to really make it stand out above any of the others, but it's still so much better than everyone else working in that field: Pixar is the dream factory of today that Disney was back in the 1940s and 50s, and it's good to remind ourselves that, in these most ruined and hopelessly compromised of all cinematic ages, there is still magic in the world to be found up there on the screen.The weakest parts are the occasional product placements for Vespa scooters, which are a little over-the-top and distracting at times. The ending feels rushed and pat and less believable than one would like, and the story as a whole could have been more fully realized than it is, but otherwise Luca is just another fun, solid and wholesome Pixar movie.",Luca
71,dommercaldi,"Pleasant, Eye-catching, But Lacking Depth And Intrigue",6,1 July 2021,"Pros:
1. The animation is gorgeous and utterly entrancing.2. The score is nothing memorable but does its job by heightening the emotions when needed, as well as imbuing the film with a fun Italian feel.3. The set design and world created is incredible in its detail and eye-watering colour scheme.4. The sound design upholds the movie well, particularly in the magical moments e.g. When Luca Paguro (Jacob Tremblay) and Alberto Scorfano (Jack Dylan Grazer) transform from sea creatures into humans.5. There is really good chemistry between Jack Dylan Grazer and Jacob Tremblay.6. Saverio Raimondo (Ercole Visconti) and Jacob Tremblay deliver brilliant voice acting performances which allow for their characters to really stand out.Cons:
1. The third act feels really rushed as the conflict between Luca Paguro and Alberto Scorfano is introduced and then resolved almost in the next scene.2. The character's motivations of Ercole Visconti are a little shallow which make it difficult to take him seriously.3. It's extremely unbelievable that all of the residents in the Italian Riviera, who despise sea creatures, to all of a sudden accept Alberto Scorfano and Luca Paguro's true nature just because Massimo Marcovaldo (Marco Barricelli) decided to overlook it. This makes the conclusion come across as lazily written and incredibly cheap and cheesy.",Luca

73,Darkjak007,Part of that World,7,19 June 2021,"Luca tells the story of a sea monster named Luca(Jacob Tremblay) who longs to see the surface world curious for all its wonders. One day he meets another Sea creature name Alberto(Jack Dylan Grazer) who lives on the surface disguised as a human the two spark a friendship. After Lucas sees what the surface has to offer and his parents find out threaten to send him away, runs away with Alberto to the nearby city PortoRosso (a tribute to the studio Ghibli film Porco Rosso) so they can get a Vespa and travel the world. At first glance it feels like the movies going to follow a plot similar to the little mermaid, a literal fish out of water scenario where they don't know the human world and they have to remain hidden entire time until it's revealed what they really are. Apart from that it's a basic coming of age story with a message of being yourself and not hiding who you are. It's just about these kids learning more about themselves and being accepted by others. First 15 minutes you don't really know where the movies going to go. It starts to pick up when they meet a young girl named Giulia(Emma Berman) she tells him about this race for prize money and the three of them become close. The characters themselves are a decent bunch Luca has a basic protagonist mentality he's really friendly and just eager to know more. Alberto's more that friend that thinks he knows what's best and has all The answers and despite his actions still has good intentions. Giulia The ""odd kid"" energetic, optimistic, stands out, herself no matter what others may think. It's because of her why Luca starts to have a much broader perspective. The parents even have their own funny moments, while Searching for Luca constantly shoving kids in water. Probably the worst character is the antagonist this kid that you just look at him he just comes off as such a cliché character with his peach fuzz, good hair and sweater over his shoulders. You see this type all the time with things set in Italy he's just a jerk just for the sake of being a jerk. Like with most Pixar films the visuals are beautiful, seeing the coastlines of the city and the views of the ocean and the Hillsides are mesmerizing. It follows the same footsteps as ratatouille and Coco were they show off the stunning visual design, a different national Perspective offering something different. Although probably not as much as those two the film it's in a more smaller region and more in a Coast city but it probably would've been nice to have a few scenes of them exploring the town and the people. The design of Luca and the rest of the sea creatures are Vivid and diverse similar to a lot of real world fish. However the problem with the sea creatures is the fact that you don't really know much about them. It's never explained why they're able to just transform to humans on the surface and show themselves when they get wet. It doesn't really show anything Trumatic in the sense of why These fish creatures would be afraid of humans. It doesn't have any catastrophic bloody event in their history or anything like that they're just afraid of humans. Lastly one of the things that probably have people split on the film is the art style specifically the character models, it's not as anatomically correct as Inside Out or Ratatouille. Maybe others would think it's just not as much effort put into it the visuals do speak for itself throughout the film it's just more of an artistic choice they decide to go with a more simplified Rounded style. It's criticism doesn't really seem warranted it's not that different from the models from Soul or UP. Overall Luca a good Film it's not in the same league as Toy story or Inside out. It's more in between the middle like onward and monsters Inc.",Luca

If you are a serious Pixar, animation, or child-friendly adventure fan, Luca is definitely a marvellous choice for you. It's nice that Pixar takes a friendly sea-creature story and places it on the Italian Riviera, as well as setting some pleasing and agreeable messages along the way.It's a refreshing and beautiful animation, but it's not a tearjerker to those who were expecting some cries. The animation in this coming-of-age family-comedy is visually striking. There's lots of lovely bright colours, plus the depictions of the sea-monsters are just gratifying.Obviously the voice acting, sound effects, and music of Luca are all diverting. There's always the average extendedness in the film, which is usually forgettable but not really moving at the time. Children and adults will likely love the charming story and gorgeous animation. The film is also amusing and quite funny at times, but can also get a little silly.Thanks to the fine creation of this beautiful animated tale, it's a very nice-messaged story about friendship and most importantly, acceptance (in an adorable fantasy context).If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Luca

Naturally there are misses as well but this one is closer to a hit though because of its fantastic voiceover work and non-conventional animation but overall a rather more children-oriented flick than Pixar's latest hits Soul or Toy Story 4 which is good for occasional moviegoers and children themselves but not for yours truly.The ideas of not fitting in, self-identification, racism, superstitions and quest for answers in this world is hip now and it's explored in literally every second movie coming out in theaters. And it's not bad per se when it offers something more than meets the eye but Luca does not do that. It remains just another fairytale wrapped in not-your-everyday setting, shallow characters and screenplay. The music score on the other hand is great and adds so many colors to this beautifully drawn picture that I would not get back to due to reasons mentioned above.",Luca
81,ivanmessimilos,Good summer cartoon,7,28 June 2021,"A summer cartoon from the Pixar studio. As expected visually, the film is beautiful, full of colorful colors. Italian directorial debut Enrico Casarosa and I think he did a good job, so far he has only collaborated on other famous animated films. Some will resent the film for having nothing new, nothing spectacular or big like most other Pixar films, but it seems to me that was the goal of the film. This is a feel good, summer refreshing film for the youngest viewers, even most of the action takes place in a small Italian town on the coast, and I imagined how the film could work without problems if the place of action is one of our islands (from Croatia). Despite everything, the film still kept a serious note due to the motives of friendship, family, acceptance of others, parenthood. It turns out that this is ""just an ordinary"" cartoon, so it won't get much attention. The story is relatively familiar, simple, the characters are clichéd, but still the overall product in the end is likable.",Luca
82,Olicosmic,"Familiar, yet fresh",9,22 August 2021,"Every bit as charming as it is beautiful, ""Luca"" takes the concept of friendship and acceptance, and makes something very delightful out of it, resulting in one of the better Pixar films of the past decade. And while the story may not be anything ground breaking, the film still rolls with it, and it's surprisingly refreshing. After so many years of not having a film with a villain, this film takes that concept and uses it wonderfully with the premise of the film-being that the main characters are sea monsters. Overall, this film, instead of being outwardly new, takes a tried and true formula, and expands on it for one of the studios most charming and adorable films yet-all with its own lovely art style to boot.",Luca
83,TheVictoriousV,Pixar meets bean-mouth?,5,18 June 2021,"I expect great disappointment over Luca, not because critics so far have called it ""only okay"", but because of the way it looks. This is Pixar, a company whose name is synonymous with artistry and creativity (give or take a Cars sequel or two) hopping on the ""bean-mouth"" bandwagon.For those who don't know, the bean-mouth art style is kind of a joke on the Internet. Often erroneously called the ""CalArts style"" (just because many CalArts students would come to use it in recent years), it refers to the fluid but simplistic type of 2D animation used by a great many modern Cartoon Network shows, Disney shows, Adult Swim shows, and even reboots of things like The Powerpuff Girls and Thundercats, the latter of which sparked a meme in 2017 where once-distinctive cartoon characters would get ""rebooted"" into inoffensive bouba creatures with bean-shaped mouths.Basically, it's the colorful, cutesy style used by Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, certain sections of Gumball, and most notoriously, Steven Universe - which, along with its subject matter and infantile fanbase, has associated the bean-mouth look with, well, a metric f?ck-ton of cringe. People will complain that Steven Universe fans are ""autists"", ""deviants"", and what-have-you, and while that's hardly the problem with the fandom, the fandom hasn't exactly done wonders for our perception of the show or its aesthetic traits.Obviously, the TV shows I listed don't look exactly the same and the ""style"" mainly subsumes the character designs and movements (things like shading and presentation still vary wildly). Being in 3D, Luca is even further removed from those shows visually, but the fact remains: people are lumping many shows underneath the bean-mouth umbrella, and this film shares just the right number of attributes to be laughed at alongside them.And no, it doesn't help that this is the umptieth time Pixar is considered to have lost the Golden Touch. They lost it once during the early 2010s, then it supposedly came back with Inside Out. They lost it again with The Good Dinosaur and Cars 3, then it supposedly came back with Coco. Their latest instance of returning to form (and this time I actually agree) was Soul, which won several Oscars, and yet Luca is supposed to indicate a fall from grace.The movie is at best cute (not unlike Raya and the Last Dragon but that one was legitimate enough to earn Disney+ Premium) and certainly plays like skippable filler - something to hold us over until the next Pixar hit. But that's the thing, Pixar is doing pretty great, and this film won't be a huge blemish for them. They're allowed to make a movie where a sea creature (Jacob Tremblay) roams about the coast of Italy herding goatfish that bleat like goats (Get it?) until he defies prejudice by befriending humans and, for the most part, going through the standard motions of such a plot.The film shoots for ""Miyazaki meets Fellini"" and is quite charming in its attempts to mimic the sort of stop-motion figures we might see from Aardman (even though, again, the final result recalls something quite different). But this is nowhere near Pixar's most gorgeously detailed film, in spite of how it depicts idyllic coastal Italy, nor the most creative. It's just something to pop on, and sometimes that's enough. Not for me, but for someone out there no doubt.Just a final note on ""bean-mouth"": Some will argue that it's hypocritical to complain that bean-mouth shows look too similar, since nobody whined this much when cartoons like X-Men and indeed Thundercats and She-Ra also looked very similar. People will ask rhetorical questions about this and feel like they've successfully owned ""CalArts haters"" as if the answer to the question isn't a very straightforward ""The difference is that those drawings looked good instead of bad"", but I haven't named this the Dark Ages of Discourse and Understanding One's Opposition for nothin'.",Luca

The story succeed every-time they try to make this movie seems have increase tentions, they close it with a good portion of fun. Luca and Alberto shows all we been through with our best friend, separate. But, its not always a bad thing.That last scene also have powerfull feels. Good job, really good job.",Luca

It was entertaining for a wide variety group, but a couple people were falling asleep towards the end of the movie, so I guess it wasn't quite stimulating enough. Definitely not the best animation ever, but I enjoyed the story very much.",Luca
87,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Not Pixar's typical best,7,18 June 2021,"This is a Pixar film that just didnt really captivate me as much as others. Which isnt to say it was bad. Just kind of a basic story. Boy wants something more out of life. Adventure. Freedom from their hum drum day to day. Its the same thing we have seen before like The Little Mermaid (which is also about a underwater creature) or Beauty and the Beast for example. And I just dont feel like this film did anything really different to make this theme feel fresh. Again, not bad. Just kind of basic.I did really like Luca and Alberto though. I think they were super cute together. I thought the character Giulia was ok. She had an annoying catchphrase though. ""Santa Mozzarella"" or ""Santa Ricotta"" or basically anything cheese. Im sure the writers thought it was cute or funny, but to me it just came off that they didnt know any genuine italian phrases so they just wrote some italian cheeses and want ""Good enough"". And I dont feel like the film really has any other memorable side characters. I mean the parents were fine - but like a lot of parent characters. As I said...just not super memorable. For me, its Luca and Alberto that really shine and make this movie. Which is a good thing since they are focus of the movie/story.The animation is beautiful as well - but its Pixar so what else do you expect? And the setting was beautiful too. It really makes me want to go to Italy and have a big bowl of pasta. I really felt transported to that world.I'll give the film a 7, cause a 6 or lower feels wrong to me. Its definitely not a bad film. Its good for the family. But I was a little disappointed. So I think 7 is fair.",Luca
88,eldreddsouza,Visual treat. Too Good!,9,20 June 2021,"Pixar is back with their top class animation style. Last couple of movies, Soul, Inside out had simple drop style animation. Soul not entirely, but for the most part yes. I'm not a fan of that style of animation as it's overtly simple and uninteresting. At least to me. Luca is a visually stunning film. The story is simple and sweet and has a couple of fun and comedic moments here and there but the animation reminds you of Pixar's top tier films like Up, etc. I just can't get myself to give it anything below a 9. The movie is just stunning and makes you feel good.",Luca
89,Avwillfan89,Fish out of the Italian Riviera,7,27 June 2021,"This film was better than I expected.Big pro: This is 100% a queer love story - at least it seemed that way to me. Though the friendship between Luca and Alberto is purely platonic, they both have to hide the fact that they are sea monsters. They live near a conservative town that hate the sea creatures and are proud fishermen.Small pro: Their relationship is so incredibly sweet and believable. Alberto is the street smart older kid who appears more knowledgable than Luca, but doesn't have an education. Luca is the naive one, literally a fish out of water, who wants to learn as many things as possible and not be sent away by his parents.Big con: The stakes. It's established that bad things will happen if the boys are found out to be fish people. Yet because they win a competition, all of the apparent townsfolk suddenly accept them? That part really ruined it for me.Small con: The main bully in this movie is kind of weak. Sure, a bully can just be mean because his insane ambition drives him to be nasty, but there should have at least been something to enrich.In conclusion, although this is proof that Pixar doesn't have to be overtly ambitious all the time to make an enjoyable, cute movie, it does run the risk of undermining the stakes and removing any real consequences to the actions in the film.",Luca
90,nidhunmoviebuff,"A joyous, infectious bundle of energy with wonderful life lessons!",8,22 June 2021,"The expectations are always immense for any Disney-Pixar animated feature and 'Luca' had all the trappings of a cliched narrative.The story follows a bright, inquisitive young 'Luca', a mermaid-like young boy who is stuck living in the ocean when all he has ever wanted was to venture onto land.He encounters a rambunctious merman 'Alberto' and strike a friendship that sees them break all societal shackles and embark on an adventure in the nearby human town.Despite a familiar setting with the usual coming-of-age tropes, Luca breaks new ground by subtly conveying its politics and messaging via smooth allegories and child-friendly situational comedy.Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer and Emma Berman voice the three leads with the right amounts of authenticity, innocence and a childish sense of wonder.It is at its core, a beautiful tale of friendship and camaraderie and tells us that it is completely ok to be the 'different' one, to own it and stand out from the crowd in doing so.This movie will leave you with an urge to dial-up a dear friend you haven't been in touch with or reconnect with that estranged childhood buddy that you lost along the way. And that's what makes it great cinema.A definite must-watch. Highly recommended!",Luca
91,AdrenalinDragon,Weak tier Pixar for me,5,19 June 2021,"There's nothing outright bad about Luca, but at this point Pixar are doing the same stuff I've seen over and over again from them at this point and it just kind of makes this movie a bit forgettable for me. It literally plays out a ""Fish Out of Water"" story using Italy as its main selling point with a sea monster gimmick, but the plot beats play out with zero surprises and the characters are simple and bland. It looks and sounds great, but I expected more from Pixar and it ends up just being a meh Animated film at best.5/10.",Luca
92,sirwillisiv,A pure and delightfully nostalgic portrait of childhood...,8,20 June 2021,"I really enjoyed Luca. It took me back to the carefree days of my youth and I came out with a more positive outlook on it. As someone who grew up as an oddball outcast and spent my summers causing trouble around the neighborhood, making new acquaintances, encountering bullies and occasionally getting in fights with friends, I identified a lot with this film. I appreciate that the characters were written to be curious, ambitious and believable kids prone to flaws because it made me relate to them so much more than the excessively perfect and ultimately bland and forgettable angels that most other Disney films have a habit of including.Luca's laidback nature mixed with its colorful, eye-popping visuals radiates a strong Hayao Miyazaki vibe, namely My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service. You're meant to just take in the character's dilemmas and appreciate the artistry and you know what, sometimes that's enough. It's tempting to wish for more complexity, but Luca works exceptionally well as an easygoing, feel-good slice-of-life. If I had one criticism, though, I'd say the comedy could've used more of a punch to it. With Jim Gaffigan in the voice cast, I expected some hearty laughs, but I mostly found myself chuckling throughout. I know Pixar is perfectly capable of delivering more meaty humor.Pixar has raised the bar so high that it had to stop at some point but they're making up for that by telling personal and authentic stories with a rich cultural perspective and Luca is a fine example that the studio has effective staying power with that formula. It's a pure and delightfully nostalgic portrait of childhood that I'm sure everyone will relate to in some shape or form. Its artful simplicity is its strength. Dive on in.",Luca

96,arabnikita,Perfect for the Whole Family,8,22 June 2021,"Luca (2021)An aquatic creature boy, who turns into a human whenever he goes on land, becomes friends with another aquatic boy and a regular human girl. Admittedly, this kind of synopsis didn't make Luca look like anything special or hype-worthy. However, one factor that is important to remember, is that Pixar made this film and these guys know how to create good stories. This time, they decided not to dabble in the philosophical concepts of the mind and soul. Instead, they chose to bring us a heartwarming story about a beautiful friendship.Luca starts off with a young merman casually living with his family underwater. Pretty soon, he finds himself on the surface and meets Alberto, a similar merman who has been living there for quite a while. Alberto introduces Luca to the wonders of human world and eventually, the sense of adventure takes them to a little Italian human town. This film has a easy-going story that took me back to the old days of joyful feel-good animation. It was simple and most importantly enjoyable to watch these boys chasing their dreams and the encounters they found themselves in, not only brought a smile to my face but also filled my heart with happiness.When it comes to animation, Pixar is seemingly competing with itself and this time, the studio has once again created visual magic while making it look different. The characters are full of life and the cheerfull voice acting elevates the positivity as much as the bright colors. Oh yeah, if you have never been to Italy, you will definitely want to visit it after being immersed into this coastal magic. Luca is perfect to watch with your family thanks to the pleasant atmosphere and the simple fact that this is a film which you watch with your heart.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",Luca

From Toy Story to Bug's Life (and recently Inside Out and Soul), these thought-provoking storylines and deep messages can teach powerful lessons to adults and children alike.While Luca does not reach the emotional depth of some of these aforementioned films, its carefree nature made the film a joy to watch. With the mantra of ""Silenzio Bruno!"" ringing in my ear, I was transported to Portorosso where my only concern was a bike race and a splash of water.A necessary distraction in an ever-confusing world, Luca's simplicity and succinct identity made it my favorite film of the summer so far.",Luca

All other supporting characters were meh. The plot is supposed to be interesting with the mythical sea creature aspect but falls short with nothing really interesting happening with it. The animation under water and in general was just disappointing. Overall a 3/10 for me, I didn't even want to finish it but maybe some people would like this but I just didn't.",Luca
101,MovieBuff11732,Not Pixar's Best But It's Still Good,8,2 August 2021,"Luca is a 2021 animated feature from the studio Pixar. It had a right to Disney plus release which was sort of disappointing because theaters were open and it probably would have made some good money. It would have also been good to see all of the beautiful colors on the big screen.Luca is about a kid named Luca (Jacob Tremblay). He lives down in the ocean with his parents who don't let him go anywhere near the surface because of the humans. He then meets this one kid, Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer), who goes to the surface frequently. They both go into town and meet a girl named Gulia (Emma Berman). She is really training hard to win the race against the town bully. The kids both want to win the race as well so they could get enough money to buy a vespa, but Luca's parents are also trying to bring Luca back down into the ocean so nobody finds out his true identity.Pixar has made some of the best movies in recent years from Coco to Incredibles 2 to Soul. They have all been some of the best movies I have seen in recent years. They have also been behind their fair share of just mediocre movies like Onward and The Good Dinosaur. I think Luca goes right with the mediocre movies. It was fun and had some fantastic imagery but the story just felt put together to visit this location and test out the animation that they used. The story was just bland and didn't really paint a good picture of who the main character is. So it was really hard to care for Luca when we didn't know anything about him and why he really wants to leave his house. The bully also is stereotypical and has his entourage of people he hits or gets mad at when the hero does something he doesn't like. The movie didn't really even have that good of point. It was really just get away from your parents and win a vespa. That being said the story still ended up being fun enough to enjoy the rest of the movie and it never really made me feel bored, it just made feel no connection or empathy for/with the characters.The animation was obviously going to look like a picture. They did the realistic backgrounds like they did in Onward and Soul for this film. It really worked to the films advantage because of how beautiful it ended up looking. They also toned up the brightness of the colors. That is why I was saying it would be nice to see the film in the theaters. The character animation had a little different style than what Pixar has been doing and I thought it worked. All of the animation was superb.Luca felt more like an experiment than a full fledged movie and that ended hurting it a little but the animation still made the movie look like a postcard. I would recommend Luca to anybody who wants to watch a fun movie with the family and to people who have Disney Plus.",Luca

In fact it's great. My kiddos and I first heard about the movie through a Happy Meal during a summer road trip to Indiana Dunes, and this odd corporate marriage served its intended purpose: we were intrigued. Lots of important themes here: following your path even into unfamiliar and perhaps uncomfortable places, friendship, and following your heart, and, for the parents, being supportive of your children. The disabled father was an excellent role model for that. In short, an excellent family movie, with the possible exception of the weird Vespa fetish, which gets abandoned in the end anyway!",Luca

106,theredsky,Luca Review,6,26 June 2021,"Cute at the moment but ultimately forgettable. Luca is another big step in terms of visuals for Pixar. The movie looks and sounds absolutely phenomenal. This, Soul, and Coco are probably the best looking Pixar films ever. The score is really fun and works well with the film and the sound design is phenomenal. However, I can't let the animation blind me to the fact that the story and characters are very subpar. Luca and Alberto have good voice actors doing a good job with the material but their character development is thin and generic for a Pixar movie. I don't remember a whole lot about their characters other than they are fish people. All of the other characters felt one note especially the villain who is awful. The villain has absolutely no development, motivation, or interesting backstory compared to any other Pixar film and it sucks because Pixar has cranked out some fantastic villains. This story feels very generic and has very low stakes. There isn't anything wrong with a low stakes story but it needs to have a solid story built around it and this doesn't really have a solid story. Events just kinda happen and they form a story but there isn't anything deeper than that. It has some good themes of acceptance and belonging but they feel one note and not explored enough. I ultimately found myself getting bored at points which usually doesn't happen with Pixar. While Luca can excel in its visuals, music, sound design, and voice acting, it ultimately doesn't have a lot more to offer than that. If you like Pixar then check this out but don't expect it to be the next Ratatouille.",Luca

Though it is by far one of Pixar's simplest films, in terms of scope and artistic design, it hits a deep childlike vein that reminds one of what it's like to grow up and have an adventurous summer.It's charming, cute, touches on heartstrings, and is an excellent addition to the Pixar canon.",Luca
108,pritol,Beautiful feel good movie!,8,27 August 2021,"One thing Pixar films genuinely try and do, is leave you with a warm, fuzzy ""feel good"" sensation, and that is exactly what Luca does!The story of two underwater Sea Creatures trying to enjoy life above the surface in an area based on Cinque Terre in Italy, has such a wonderful warm and sunny colour palette, it just makes you smile and wish you could live there.The story touches on the joy of moving away from home and trying things for yourself, but also addresses some of the fear that comes with it, both for you and your parents. There is a moral to the story that becomes quite clear at the end, but I wont spoil it.It's typical Pixar in terms of gorgeous animation, lots of humour, but with some snappy dialogue and a few moments that hit you right in the heart strings.I watched this with my wife, but it would be a great film to watch with the family if you have young ones!",Luca
109,haydenluz,Luca,4,1 August 2021,"I didn't quit, they forced me to stopLet me start off by saying, I'm with the minority on this one, when I say, I didn't enjoy Luca nearly as much as everyone else. With a very simple plot (which can work, if done right), and a lot of counteracting points, with very minimal risks, Luca's story ran rather thin, not giving the film much of it's own personality. Luca seemed to cater to the younger audience, not seeming to try hard at all, moving very fast, and leaving a lot of moments and characters to be left underdeveloped. Luca has a big 2021 topey vibe to it, trying to be subtle with their life messages, but it came off too forced, and not so genuine. Don't get me wrong, Luca definitely has it's charm, with good general messages for kids, but I feel like the film was taken too lightly, falling to the bottom of the pack for Pixar.Even though Luca had a simple plot, and had some good moments, Luca felt more like a character driven film. I prefer character driven films, because story motives can run pretty dry at times, but the characters have to be done right, for it to succeed. Luca, Alberto, Guilia, and all of the other characters seemed to be a big hit with a lot of people, but I found everyone to be, by the numbers, struggling to have their own unique personality. All of the characters went underdeveloped, leaving them to be hollow, and forgettable. I found their character designs to be pretty simple as well. They were still fun and all, but they weren't like some characters you'll never forget, like anyone from the Monsters Inc, or Toy Story films. For a film to be titled after the main character, you'd think they'd, at the very least, make the character indulging enough to watch for the one hundred minute run time, but Enrico Cassarosa tried to give all of the cliche side characters too much aimless time, leaving it hard to really care about Luca. The few good things I can say about the characters - all of the voice overs were top notch, with a fairly well written script, to give the film a little humor and playfulness.Overall, Luca is by far Pixar's simplest film, not breaking any barriers, and just seemed to be okay with skating by. I'd say give the film a shot, but I do have a differing opinion than a lot of people, but it's definitely something I'm not going back to watch, like I do with twenty out of the twenty-four films by Pixar.",Luca

115,stefstars,A Simple Film That Delivers,8,27 June 2021,"This movie is a perfect example of what can be achieved when you don't try so hard. There's no need to always try to tell some complex story or recycle already established characters in an atrocious ""retelling."" Luca is a delight to watch from start to finish. From Luca's whimsical undersea world to the gorgeous Italian riviera he has his adventure on, the movie is gorgeous to look at - and that's despite the characters looking very cartoony. Everything about this film is perfectly charming, the voice acting is awesome, the animation is up to excellent Pixar standards, and the story (though simple) is great !I've seen the arguments come up that the film feels like Pixar is 'losing it's touch' but that's not the case at all. The film doesn't kill off characters to pull at your heart strings but simply reminds you that you're human and no one has to die for you to feel something. What's heartwarming in this film is the friendship that develops between Luca and Alberto, it's such an innocent connection that you'll be transported back to when you were that age and made life changing connections at that time of your life. As a Youtube film critic perfectly stated in his review of this film, this movie is a ""breath of fresh air."" Pixar doesn't always have to make long, epic cinematic dramas in the same vein as Coco or Soul ; although these films are animated treasures. Their simple stories should be happily welcomed also. After all, this is how we got classics like Toy Story ( at it's core, it's a simple story about friendship and talking toys ) it didn't get deep until it reached the 3rd film in the franchise. Simplicity is even at the core of Ratatouille, a film that's hailed as perhaps Pixar's best, it's a movie about a rat that cooks where no one got killed off but it tugged at your heart strings cos not only does it show a sweet depiction of friendship but also how anyone can achieve their dreams, no matter who they are or what species they are. So before you bash Luca as a 'Pixar losing it's touch' film, I suggest you think about the films that have made you love Pixar to begin with, they're no different than this one. This one is very much up there with the Pixar greats and will definitely stand the test of the time.I highly recommend this film, it's fun, it's magical, and you won't regret a single moment. Also you may get a craving for Italian food watching this film.",Luca

If you choose to look at and discuss the acceptance part of the movie, then it might become something else, for you.Regardless of what you choose to take away and look at, you won't be disappointed if you decide to watch it.PS: Shoutout to whoever animated the cat.",Luca
117,jon_pratt12345,"Simple, heartfelt and uplifting",7,27 June 2021,"A very sweet, heartfelt and uplifting film filled with charming characters. It felt very stripped-back and deliberately simple compared to the sprawling worlds built in other pixar films, although the story felt refreshingly original. There was a fairytale quality to the film and the costal Italian setting was wonderful to look at.",Luca
118,Harry_Gleeson,Pixar and Italy go very well together,7,20 June 2021,"Overall, I thought Luca was another solid outing from a studio that keeps delivering. With Pixar it's very difficult for me to decide on a specific favourite as there are so many good films and they're all unique in their own ways, Luca fits into that as well. It has that important message driving the film from the beginning like Soul did with its discovery on the meaning of life. Luca focuses on a coming of age tale with it's main lead, Luca voiced by Jacob Trembley. This was a really positive aspect of the film, the message, as it felt feel-good throughout.The fact the film is based in Italy also was a big plus for me as the Italian scenery is beautiful and extremely picturesque. As with Coco and the Mexican traditions, I really love how Pixar are using different cultures from various countries as the landscape of their films, it works brilliantly with animation.I loved all the characters within the film, but Giulia voiced by Emma Berman, was a real bundle of joy and comedy in the film alongside Luca and Alberto. However if I had any complaints with the film I thought the script was pretty cliche and nothing amazing. I do feel that if the script was better I would've liked the film even more. Some pacing issues as well hindered the film with it's flow, but all in all I did enjoy it.Luca definitely is a film to enjoy, it has an original concept which Pixar has become known to create with each film that produce.Quote - Silenzio, Bruno' - Luca/AlbertoRating - 3.5/5.",Luca
119,gabethedinosaur,A brilliant Italian Pixar movie,10,19 June 2021,Pixar did a great job on Luca . The story reminds me of Nemo and the little mermaid who wanted to see the surface and rescue your friend . Pixar made history again of making a story about a young sea child who wanted to see the world . And I say it's worth something for al kids and adults to see . I hope this wins an award for best Italian language and see critters . And The Who entire cast did a fantastic job.,Luca
120,valen060,A Simple Pixar Film That Explores Innocence and Charm,9,3 July 2021,"Following after the success of the 2020 Oscar-winning flick Soul, the studio's follow-up Luca from La Luna director Enrico Casarosa is a simple movie that pays off well with courage and heart.Luca Paguro (voiced by Jacob Tremblay) is a timid kid who is actually a sea monster living in the coastal region of the Italian peninsula. Through there, he grows curious of the surface world much to his mother's fears. But with some encouragement from fellow sea monster Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer), the two friends venture on land and learn more what it has to offer all the while maintaining their secret from the local townsfolk.To me, it feels more lighthearted and delves into the perspective of an innocent, young kid compared to the more mature Soul that touched mainly on adult issues about life's purpose. I have a young nephew that was plenty focused on this movie as he found the two main boys relatable to his own rambunctious nature. He felt pretty engaged to their adventures. Luca learns that being in the presence of friends helps him see things differently than what his overprotective mother couldn't allow.With a visual setting that's very reminiscent to Studio Ghibli's work Ponyo and Kiki's Delivery Service, Luca is like the boy version of 1989's The Little Mermaid crossed with the friendship dynamics of Harry Potter. Luca's friends Alberto and human girl Giulia (Emma Burman) helped guide him into finding his own purpose and at the same time provides a moral lesson that kids can relate to. It's a film that doesn't need today's trends, lifestyles, or modern day conveniences to make this a good movie rather it explores innocence and charm timelessly. I recommend it.",Luca
121,jeromesgabilo,ENJOYABLE AT EVERY LEVEL,6,10 October 2021,"Luca seems like one of those early feel-good Pixar films. The story is adult and kid-friendly, and the multitude of characters are interesting. It was great but not too great.",Luca
122,Benslie,Luca has a lot of heart to it with some problems as well,9,21 June 2021,"I feel like this is said about every single Pixar movie that comes out but it just has to keep being said and that's how beautiful the animation in this movie is. There were so many moments where I was just awestruck by the animation. One of the best moments that showcase how much effort the animators put into this movie is whenever the two boys had to change between human and sea monster. One thing I definitely didn't think I was going to get out of this movie though was actually great humour. I was constantly laughing throughout this entire movie and not just from the jokes but some of the slapstick or even subtle things happening in the background. But overall, the entire writing in this movie was really well done. I just want to especially say the music, done by Dan Romer, was spectacular and helped bring the audience into this Italian setting and intensify some scenes. But the most important thing this movie does though is bring you back to your childhood with friends. Overall, this movie is about friendship and growing up and that's something everybody can relate to especially with the characters. Everybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters in this movie. As much as I praise this movie, I do have some complaints such as the main villain, if I could really call him that, was really weak. I feel like Ercole Visconti, voiced by Saverio Raimondo, wasn't supposed to be a villain but no matter what he was a pretty weak character. This movie also couldn't escape some cliches which you can mainly see at the end of the third act of this movie. Overall, ""Luca"" is a beautifully animated movie that has a lot of heart and humour to it that still has some problems that don't take away from the enjoyment of the movie.",Luca
123,Master_Strange,I'm sure everyone will relate to in some shape or form,10,20 June 2021,"It's beautiful, the colors are vibrant, there's a nice stylization, character designs i never got tired of looking at, etc. Pixar movies are always stunning, though. I would suggest watching this as a family. Everyone can be able pick up on things about the other and hopefully, just, help bring in some new realizations. I'm sure everyone will relate to in some shape or form. The ending was nice and I can't wait to see it again! I think it sets the stage for a part 2. Maybe a 2nd movie would have a deeper message or moral theme and go into detail about the characters past a bit more.",Luca
124,alexscott-35299,Extremely surprised!,8,15 July 2021,"After this movie got released on Disney plus for free I started to worry. This movie barely had any marketing and for Disney to just throw it out for free i really thought this was going to be an unfinished mess. But no I was so so wrong. The first 10-15 minutes were abit slow and started much like finding nemo with the underwater setting, I started to think my predictions were right until the movie took a massive turn as they moved onto the surface. The visuals in this movie are incredible as they always are in Pixar movies, the story telling and captivating characters just make this movie a joy to watch! The voice acting is incredible also and it really surprised me with some very young talented actors leading this movie. This movie doesn't really have that signature Pixar feel but it's still so obviously a Pixar movie with a plot that revolves around family and friends. I really enjoyed this one and think it will be a favourite of mine for a long time to come. Go watch it!",Luca
125,quiqueperezsoler,I loved it!.... But for the wrong reasons. Studio Ghibli presents PIXAR's Luca,8,18 June 2021,"Luca is a light-hearted coming of age tale backdropped in an italian mediterranean coast town. So the summer vibes are guaranteed as well as amusing and engaging sequences thanks to PIXAR's never-failing top notch animation.I was worried the over-stylized, can't believe I'm saying this, ""cartoon-inspired"" animation would be a bit of a drawback. But I found it refreshing and unique, and somewhat reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki movies. And that's just it...The story is endearing and engaging but only because it draws ideas from already seen themes: the ""fish out of the water"" tale from The Little Mermaid, the tone, feel and even animation (like the cat, when you watch it you'll know) inspired by Hayao Miyazaki. So much so, that even the town was an homage to what I assume was one of the inspiration (Porco Rosso). If you don't believe me, watch Ponyo. Which is a movie inspired also by the Little Mermaid's tale but with a Studio Ghibli twist which is so similar to this movie. Not to mention the animation, with expressions, character designs and reactions and sequences that reminds of Ponyo, Spirited Away or Porco Rosso.So I found myself loving almost every aspect of the movie: the summer vibes, the coming of age themes of accepting who you are and many other great messages for the kids; I love the aesthetic and backdrop of the coast of Italy and the back and forth to Italian. The kids felt like kids and the story felt whimsical and dangerless.... And that's part of the problem.PIXAR movies have always displayed amazing worldbuilding skills and characterization, however, in Luca's world... There are no stakes whatsoever, aside from the obvious one I won't mention in case someone doesn't know (even though it's in the first trailer). There's no personal connection to the conflict at hand, something impactful that would drive the behavior of Luca and the other characters to do or not do the things they do.And that's the most ""disappointing"" thing, and I'm adding quotations because this movies isn't by all means bad, it's perfectly wonderful, chirpy and whimsical. But there isn't a sense of deep conflict or danger that would weight in on the eventual character development. The film opted for the more surface ""you don't belong here"" with the only REAL danger being a snobby, over the top, plain villain.IN CONCLUSION, watch Luca if you love summer movies just as much as I do, and enjoy with this wonderfully animated world with engaging (although some stereotypical) characters, endearing (yet heard of before) themes and an endless parade of child-like fun and laughs. But if you expect a deep, profound coming of age message that would stuck with you at the end of it, don't look for it. You will find a couple but they don't say anything, or use a different way/metaphor of saying it, you haven't heard before from movies like Little Mermaid, Tarzan and a couple of Studio Ghibli movies. And it's not a bad thing per se, is just that it tells a new story using elements we have seen before and love which is why it's hard for me to not enjoy this movie. I can't see flaws in ""summer vibed"" movies like these, I just love it simply for the animation.",Luca
126,racoonito,Why are people acting like this a Masterpiece.,5,22 June 2021,Pixar has been doing the same thing for soo long and I have been getting sick of them. They need to change with time. I predicted every single dialogue before it was said. I would have gave this movie a 8/10 if it was made in like 2013.,Luca
127,mynameritesh,Luca Review,9,19 June 2021,"Luca is a heartwarming, stunningly animated adventure presented with all heart. An ode to a beautiful friendship between 2 sea monsters and a human kid which makes your heart skip a beat. Pixar's yet another picturesque animation combined with resonant storytelling makes it a must watch.",Luca
128,mailtaskservice,Failed to grasp the real excitement,7,8 September 2021,"I cannot give 5 stars because its not that super good and despite its disney picture, it failed to be a nice movie. There are just too much unrealistic nonsenses.",Luca
129,MovieWarfare,"A joyful, fun and pleasant experience worth watching",8,9 July 2021,"At this point, I am truly a sucker for any Pixar movie, so of course, I was going to watch Luca. The synopsis is ""Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, the original animated feature is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below the water's surface"". So is this another hit from Pixar or an unfortunate 'flop'?Let's get the obvious out the way, Luca is visually stunning. The marine world is gorgeous, but when they are on the surface of the water it looks photorealistic. Additionally, the land is also spectacular and rich in colour, which makes it so pleasant to look at. I also really love the character design for the characters in their land and underwater forms, it isn't as realistic looking as Soul but it has this ""Studio Ghibli"" look to them that makes it very charming. The cinematography in Luca is excellent as well. There are some shots in here that feel like a painting. They manage to capture the joyfulness of the setting and make this sort of realistic land feel completely magical.The music score by Dan Romer is also phenomenal. Dan perfectly captures the hopeful and Italian nature of the setting. The score perfectly elevates every scene and giving it more impact. One memorable score that sticks out is every time our main character Luca starts imagining, the music that happens in these scenes is just wonderful. I also love the chemistry between our 3 main characters. Every time the 3 main leads are together on-screen is the best part because their bonding is just so sweet to watch. This is also thanks to the voice performance of Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer and Emma Berman who do a great Italian accent. I also love the theme that was explored in Luca about friendship, acceptance and openness as it is a great message and it was done very effectively here.However, Luca does play it very safe compared to previous Pixar movies. The plot doesn't have much twist or interesting development and for the most part, is very predictable. This is okay as it is more focused on the friendship between our characters rather than having high stakes in the plot. Although, it does make Luca not as memorable as say Toy Story or UP. I also have a slight issue with the 3rd act as it resolves nearly everything way too easily for my liking. There are also some plot threads that don't get resolved and it does certainly feel like sequel 'bait' a bit which is a little annoying.Overall, Pixar does it again by providing another big hit. Luca is an extremely joyful, fun and pleasant movie to watch that it would be honestly a shame to not watch it. It may not do anything unique but what it does, it does superbly. Luca is a magical experience and I certainly would love to revisit this world in a sequel.",Luca
130,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Off to the Big Fish in the Sky with Luca,7,21 June 2021,"Welcome back, Streamers! A Disney+ release? Sign me up please! Luca, the new Pixar film, premiered on Disney+. It's a movie about a young sea monster who experiences his first unforgettable summer on land in the Italian Riviera filled with gelato, pasta and endless Vespa and bike rides. We follow Luca as he takes this adventure along with some newly found friends all the while fearing that his aquatic secret would be found out or even worse his parents would catch him. Let's see if Luca is worth the watch.Now, you already know that Pixar and Disney are the kings of movie animation. Luca continues in that tradition. We are transported to the Italian Riviera (as if I've been there and know, smh). The film does a good job of making the audience feel like they are zooming through the streets with the cast and on vacation. My one ding against the movie is that the parts underwater, while limited, were pretty underwhelming and bordering on boring. The creatures and their transformations were cool and seamless, but it just makes sense why they spent so much time on land because the sea is boring! For me, what comes to mind when I say boring... The Little Mermaid. Sorry, I should phrase that better. Luca gives me the pre-teen male equivalent to The Little Mermaid vibes. From the beginning of the flick, when he starts to find human trinkets on the ocean floor, my eyes began to roll back in my head. Then, he gets on water and becomes human with legs. You couldn't imagine my boredom at the storyline. They picked it up from there, not by much but they did. Pixar movies are generally good at telling compelling stories but this one just doesn't seem to be one of them. Maybe it's just such a basic story that we've heard it too much? I think the lack of originality in the plot lessens the execution and beauty of the visual film. The kids are great. The comedic bits are pretty good. I'm looking at you Mom, *Dolphin noise* (you'll get it when you watch the movie). So, while you'll get the feels here and there, I feel something was missing from the heart of this movie compared to a UP, Soul, Inside Out, etc.Overall, Luca is a cute movie and adventure. It feels a bit too much like the boy version of The Little Mermaid without singing but a good story nonetheless. Kids will definitely enjoy this film, but I don't think this is one of Pixar's most compelling works. Turn on Disney+ and enjoy a bowl of popcorn and pesto spaghetti with Luca and Alberto.",Luca
131,j_movie,some feelings,7,18 August 2021,"It's better than the midsummer of 85. Although the story is the best for the whole family, at least all kinds of emotions are self consistent. There are many metaphorical points worthy of interpretation, but they give up the interpretation halfway. Sometimes the fun of watching movies is lost in excessive interpretation, so now it's like returning to nature and being a simple audience. Just like Luca and his friends, living a little simpler can sometimes harvest real happiness and happiness.",Luca
132,margineanvladdaniel,Good ol' Pixar,9,20 June 2021,This one really hit the spot. Unlike the one that was before(Soul..). Interesting idea of the movie. I didn't expect for things to get along like that in the end. Like I saw in the comments of today's posts. Happy fathers day! He deserved it! For best friend too! Cheers to all of you! Looking forward for this kind of movies again!,Luca
133,pronitmallick,Lacks the classic magic heavily,6,15 July 2021,"Luca is a movie that starts with a fast pacing and pixar's classic touch. The pacing of the movie seems off than the average pixar movies and also the feel. The screenplay has ups and downs along but it does provide the classic pixar magic. From young to old everyone will enjoy watching the movie thanks to pixar's touch. The animation looks simplier which kinda
looks like downfall for the feel and emotion inside the movie. The animation and direction does the job until a certain point but beyond that there's nothing much left for the audience. From just the perspective of only fun luca looks quite an enjoyable movie but it's definitely lacking in terms of pixar's beautiful magic. Overall it's a movie built for fun and
to watch on weekends with whole family. In terms of watching the pointer is kinda heavy towards one time watch.",Luca
134,PerryAtTheMovies,A good quality movie....,7,19 June 2021,"My rating: 72/100
My IMDb rating: 7/10
My Letterboxd rating: 3.5/5""Luca"" was a good quality, family movie and i felt, even as an adult, it taught a couple things.First, exploring can be beneficial, especially, if it involves meeting new people who can help bring you out of your comfort zone. It might take a bit of time break that shell, but once you do, there's a chance you'll have the time of your life.Second, even if you're different, in whatever sort of way, odds are you'll meet someone who will accept you. As we see in the movie not everyone is accepting of Luca and Alberto, either at first or never from beginning to end, but once they gain the trust of people they were there for them in their time of need. And though it may seem cliche. I do believe that it can translate to real life, as well.Besides the morale epiphanies. The film was visually stunning. Whether it was the way the waves formed or how a body plunked into the water, how the wind blew through the trees, or just simply cycling through the streets. The animation felt real for what it offered.The only true downside to this film for me was that I didn't find it emotionally engaging. I'm not sure if it was a lack of good musical tones, or the pitch of the actors voices, but I wasn't convinced to be sad, angry, or happy 100% of the time and emotions are key to a good movie, especially, for an animated movie I find.Overall, definitely worth the family movie night viewing. Kids will definitely enjoy this more than adults, but the adults should still be able to find some entertainment value. The runtime of 1h 41m is perfect. It didn't feel too long or too short and it came to a good end.Enjoy the show!",Luca
135,Clank_Zoka,"Charming and Beautiful as Always, But Not Pixar Perfect Unfortunately",9,20 June 2021,"So!, new Pixar film is out, but still not in cinemas?, seriously they are already open, come on!, we need another Pixar film in cinemas!, anyways, this new film is directed by Enrico Casarosa and it's based a bit on his childhood in Italy, along with a good enough cast, well as you know I am a huge Pixar fan so, of course I'd watch it and one thing that I do admire Pixar amongst other things is that they are original, well not always but at least they try to make films that aren't really based on anything other then personally experience or ideas and this film seems to be in the right mind set, it also looks a lot different compared to what we are used to form Pixar, I like the sound of it in all honesty so will it deliver?, I certainly hope so, it came out on Disney Plus on Friday (Premier Access free mind you) and... yeah, it really liked it, mostly good familiar but also new Pixar material, so much so that it might a bit too familiar to stand out, so let's talk about it.Luca Paguro (Jacob Tremblay) is a sea monster who has never been on land, his parents warm him to never go to land and remain at sea where he belongs because of dangerous humans, but is all the more curious about it, so he disobeys his parents and heads up to the land where he meets fellow sea creature Alberto Scorfano (Jack Dylan Grazer) who seems to know more about land then Luca ever did, Luca transforms into a human as soon as he walks on land, both Luca and Alberto dream of driving a Vespa scooter around the world to wherever they want, however they have to earn it by doing some jobs with their new human friend Giulia Marcovaldo (Emma Bergman) and try to win this race as well in order to get the scooter, meanwhile his parents Daniela (Maya Ruldolph) & Lorenzo (Jim Gaffigan) go out of the ocean and try to bring him back home while avoiding causing any attention that could potentially kill them, so they need to avoid getting close to water of any kind, which won't be much help when snow off bully Ercole Visconti (Saverio Raimondo) tries to be better in every way then the underdogs, this is basically a typical fish out of water story (no pun intended) where an outsider enters an all new world that is completely different from his/hers and has to blended in (physically in this film's case) without causing too much attention, this has been done to death and we're kinda sick of it without any creativity, heart or some originality, lucky this film has all three of these..., kind of, first off it has heart, it really does, it's quite relatable in some way when you know what these kids want, they have different goals and they want to achieve them so they can explore and be more independent, that I can relate to, also it's super creative in how the sea creatures blended in with humans on land, there's lots of silly slapstick and big movements that makes this quite fun and pretty funny too, we see how Luca is learning from the world around him from how to walk and how to ride a scooter also, I wouldn't say it's exactly original or anything, but it works in it's own way very well!, which I admire very much, along with that, the film has classic Pixar humour, not very modern or cringey, just charming, clever and most of all, hilarious!, the emotional elements are well done also, sometimes we need to explore more in order to succeed, which does mean leaving other people behind, which can be tough since Luca and Alberto have both grew a friendship with each other, so it can be heartbreaking especially towards the end but it feels earned in a way, which is what makes this writing so wonderful and unique!, however with all that said, the only criticism I have with the movie is that this is one of the few Pixar films where while it is predictable, it's predictable to a point that you exactly what is going to happen and it is a bit tiresome I'll be honest, but at least you want to see what happens since the story is still engaging and interesting enough to leave viewers with an emotional conclusion, also the side plot of the parents looking for him can be funny when they throw kids in oceans, foundations and even throw water onto them, it may not be much but at least it's related to the main story in a way, despite how predictable and cliched the story can be, it does do the most it can with what it has, engaging story with charming and fun humour and a good emotional heart and message to it, it's completely original and not based on anything (except for folklore myths) along with great creativity and exploring the world from the eyes of Luca along with a rather nice ending, this isn't one of the stronger Pixar writings, but at least it made it interesting enough to have it's own identity in a way.The animation is spectacular which is to be expected, but I mean look at this, this is unbelievably gorgeous!, so bright and colourful and full of style, first Italy Rivera looks outstanding, with great use of textures, I love the look of the sea monsters and how they transform to humans, it's quite creative and mesmerising, the characters kinda have that Grubhub look to them especially Luca (I'm not the only one to say that...), but they look great and stand out, they all have unique expressions and colour to them, they have this rather simple yet cute look to them especially the kids, the water effects continue to improve and have that feel of the ocean which works with the creativity and movements of the sea monsters, although we don't get much of the underwater world, it is a visually pleasing sight to hold, any film with sun, water and bright blue skies get a thumbs up in my book, the movements of the characters are super fast and have good cosmic speed and timing along with big expressions, however the only gripe I have with the animation is that although the characters are well designed, they don't really look like they are animated by Pixar, they look like they came from Sony by how simple and big their eyes are, which is strange, but they still look great, it's just it doesn't have that classic Pixar look to them, but besides that, the animation still proves that Pixar can do anything in terms of making a country and town itself look beautiful, and still look dazzling with all their technology and style!The characters are cute and quite charming, well most of them anyways, Luca is just a genuinely likeable main character, he wants to explore what's outside of the sea and he wants to do more then rustle fish, he's very charming and has a understandable goal, Alberto is a good secondary main character and the friendship between the two is genuinely lovely (as friends not lovers), he has more knowledge on the land then Luca, he's definitely funny and entertaining and gets along with Luca, Giulia is a good supporting character who helps the two main characters and has her own goal too, she's charming, funny and has fun chemistry with them, so all three of them are great together and emotionally understandable, they are not annoying or bland, they are well written enough to stand out, the parents of Luca are only the overly protective parents who don't want him to disobey him, however they are funny and likeable enough to be enjoyable, Giulia's Father Massimo Marcovaldo (Marco Barricelli) is a genuinely sweet and amusing as a good animated father too, other minor characters like Uncle Ugo (Sasha Baron Cohen) and Luca's grandmother are informative about both the ocean and the land and are enjoyable even if their roles are only small, however the only character I genuinely didn't like was the bully character Ercole, granted I get that he is the heartless bully who wants respect and attention, but he is not interesting or that memorable, definitely the worst Pixar villain thus far, on top of charming characters, the voice acting is pretty good on everyone's behalf, Jacob Tremblay and Jack Dylan Grazer are both very spectacular and fit their voice roles extremely well, same can be said with Emma Berman as Giulia who is fantastic, Maya Ruldolph & Jim Gaffigan are great as always since they have done voice acting before, even Sasha Baron Cohen's small role is hilarious along with a nice small voice role for Peter Sohn, the characters are well written, likeable, sweet and genuinely relatable and hilarious, along with some pretty good voice acting, they don't have to be afraid to show their true selves.Dan Romer's score is really magnificent, it's relaxing, nice, really captures the feel of Italy nicely, along with good use of old Italian songs.This might be a rather familiar sounding story, but it still has the classic elements that work superbly, Luca is not an Pixar masterpiece or anything like that, but it has just enough to be entertaining and very charming, the animation is gorgeous, it has a nice enough heart and message to support the feature, the characters are delightful, it has a engaging story, it has ear pleasing music and some good voice acting along with a pretty cool concept that does work quite well to the film's favour, however it can be tiresome with it's predictable outcomes along with a extremely annoying villain, this doesn't quite reach the highest standards in Pixar, but it's still pretty solid and has busier enough for any Pixar fan to love and enjoy, so do check it out and have yourself a monstrously good time, oh and stay for the end credits (and credits in general) it's quite funny even if it's short but hey that's end credits for ya, hopefully the next Pixar film won't disappoint which I cannot wait!.I'm going to give Luca a 9.2/10.",Luca

Thought the monster could have been idk done better kind of lazy looking but otherwise cute.",Luca
143,HollisWoods,Will probably be an underrated classic,8,19 June 2021,"It is a literal crime that we couldn't see these vibrant colors on the big screen. Nonetheless, Luca was very beautiful to look at. Between the coloring and art style, I knew just by the trailers that this film would stand out amongst the rest. The lighting achieved here also added to the wonderful detail that 3d animation is able to achieve. It wasn't just the artwork, though. The music also did a great job of immersing us in this Italian atmosphereWhile this isn't one of Pixar's most emotional titles, it was still a charming tale of friendship. It's an instant classic, but I fear, like last year's Onward, it will fly under everyone's radar, especially since it wasn't a theatrical release. I loved the daydream sequences; they were very reminiscent to the director's Pixar short, La Luna. Those scenes were just beautiful animations and very aesthetically pleasing. The characters were also extremely likeable. Each member of the little trio had different stories and personalities, but their bond was the heart of the film.Luca is not my favorite of all time or anything, but I'd love to watch it again. The art style and the cultural aspects really kept my attention. Don't even get me started on the underwater sequences. The designs of the ""sea monster"" race were spectacular. Will definitely enjoy Luca for years to come. Might even get a pin for it at Disney World.",Luca
144,kysta,Didn't capture my attention or heart but still worth a watch,5,20 June 2021,"Went in with no expectations to watch with my 5yo daughter.Whilst the colours and imagery are lovely, the characters lively....something was still missing. Many parts reminded me in likeness to the storylines in Coco and Cloudy with a chance of meatballs, maybe the reoccurring themes of family, friendship and belonging. It did lack a lot of the comedic tones that us adults probably enjoy more than the kids. It held the 5yo's attention, credit for that.Overall it was ok and i appreciate the effort gone into production but i found it lacking charm and fun to make it memorable.",Luca
145,lakings97,Another version of Little Mermaid,8,19 June 2021,Luca is a Disney/Pixar movie about teenage sea monsters along the Italian Rivera that were curious about the life of living as a human beings. Luca voiced by Jacob Tremblay and Alberto voiced by Jack Dylan Glazer befriend a human girl voiced by Emma Berman who wants to win the village cycle race. The story is a coming of age teenage boys much like Little Mermaid without sing-a-longs. It was a lovely flick with beautiful sceneries along with parental voices played by Jim Gaffigan and Maya Rudolph. Overall it was a wonderful family oriented fun movie for everyone.,Luca

148,achmoye,"Cliché, boring, and charmless",2,16 July 2021,"Luca has nothing to do with usual Pixal standards, except animation maybe, but even this style has grown old. Honestly a movie is not just a story, it's also a visual experience and it's been years that Pixar has been using the same visual engine without any artistic consideration. But that's the tiniest problem.Luca has no charm, it sets in Italia, and all the clichés you can expect, pasta, italian accent, arrogant character, and 20 minutes of the movie feels like an ad for Vespa, it's pretty cringe to be honest. I have no idea what they tried to achieve here.The mechanics of the MC avoiding water is interesting but again seen before and without any progression or added complexity. Pretty hard to believe the same guys did Coco, Toy Story, Up and Onward. Time to stop ?How in the hell can I be interested in some random bike course in Italia ?",Luca
149,salonsoab,"Simple, but fun",8,1 July 2021,"Although 'Luca' distances itself from the though-provoking and conceptually stellar narratives characteristic of many pixar classics, it still manages to present a very heart-warming storyline that although simple, carries a lot entertaining moments.7.5/10.",Luca

Children will enjoy the fun characters and their hijinx while parents will enjoy The meaningful story that the film creates, Meanwhile everyone in the room will get a kick out of the genuinley funny humor thrown in throughout. The ending was pretty predictable and the film had some writing that didn't make a whole lot of sense but hey, it's still another heartfelt Pixar movie that the entire family can sit down and enjoy for what it is!",Luca
152,andrewtisler,A heartwarming tale of friendship,10,1 September 2021,"From Disney and Pixar comes ""Luca"", their newest animated feature, starring Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer, and Maya Rudolph. What a film this was. I cannot describe enough how much I enjoy this movie.Set on the Italian Riviera, a 12-year old sea monster named Luca Paguro, who lives beneath a small town called ""Portorosso"" with his overprotective family (save for his grandmother), goes up to the surface and befriends a 13-year old sea monster named Alberto Scorfano, eventually learning about the human world and meeting a human girl named Guila Marcovaldo. What I like about the story is how it's briskly paced and loaded with heartfelt moments of friendship. That's not to say ""Luca"" is devoid of comedy; the humor is very subtle and faint, but very funny and entertaining.Luca is also a very relatable character, reflecting on how I once refused to explore other areas and see the world, even to the point where I had very few friends. I love how he and Alberto bond well with each other because they're both curious creatures, and eventually desire to gain a special moped called a ""Vespa"" to explore other areas beyond Portorosso. Alberto might be a rebel, but as that is part of growing up, it seems understandable he would be portrayed that way. Guila is a very tough and go-getter kind of girl, determined to not let anything get in her way, until she befriends Luca and Alberto and allows them to compete with her in the Portorosso Cup. Daniela and Lorenzo Paguro are scene stealers, with hilarious voices and weird, wild personalities. Ercole Visconti is the movie's antagonist, whose characterization ranges from snobby bully to cruel killer. His mixed nature makes him one of the most unusual Pixar villains ever. Massimo Marcovaldo is Guila's father, very caring and loving, and is also like a mentor to Luca and Alberto, when they work with him to earn money for the race.The animation is very stylish and well-crafted, with some very beautiful visuals and interesting Hayao Miyazaki-style character designs. The use of color is interesting too, such as Luca's green, Alberto's purple, and Ercole's blue. I also like how the sea monsters have humanoid designs to make their transitions to real humans on land believable and real.The music also brings about that warm, nostalgic feel to the table. Composer Dan Romer adds a very rich orchestra into the heartwarming feel of the film's tone, and captures the spirit of Italy very well in the style of instrumentation. I also like how it gets intense when Ercole's tension rises and he attempts to murder Luca and Alberto outright.Although it plays it safe, ""Luca"" is a very emotional tale about friendship with some memorable characters and incredible animation and visuals. The movie proves that Pixar can make entertaining features even with simple plots (although ""Cars"", an earlier effort from the studio, already proved this). You won't be disappointed if you check this one out.",Luca
153,alexkzapf,No politics Just pre family entertainment,8,25 June 2021,Great family movie about acceptance. Being comfortable in who you are. And enjoying life to the fullest.

I loved Luca as a character and all of the characters are fantastic love all of them, expect for the villain. The villain is pretty weak. The plot is simple but fantastic. I love the whole Italian esthetic so much. Luca's parents are some of my favorite characters in this film. The film is kind of slow at the beginning but once they reach the town which is named after the Studio Ghibli movie Porco Rosso, the film really really picks up. The ending at the train station was one of the best Pixar movie endings ever and I loved it because I cared about the relationship between Luca and Alberto. I loved the ending and it made me sad but happy at the same time. The film looks absolutely beautiful like most Pixar movies but I thought that the entire film looks just beautiful. I just love that this film takes place in Italy. Luca is amazing and I loved every second of it. Please see Luca!",Luca

Gone are the days of absolute classics like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, A Bugs Life, Up, etc. With the exception of the Toy Story sequels, their last several movies have been duds. Soul, Onward, Cars 3, The Good Dinosaur and now Luca all lacked the magic that has made Pixar a pillar in the animated movie world.

Luca has enough drama/emotion so adults can enjoy this, and enough adventure so kids will love Luca. Did I cry in Luca: no, but seeing that I've only ever cried in two movies I would be surprised if I did. The animations for Luca are phenomenal.

I watched every single one with my mom, so this was a super fun experience. I ended this run with this movie, and all I gotta say was that this was a very pleasant surprise. I was expecting this to be an average animated movie made just to promote Disney+, but I was wrong. This is currently the front runner for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. It's so much better than I expected and fully deserves its strangely high rating on Letterboxd and IMDb. I can tell this will be one of those nostalgia trips for the younger generation. It's got a lot of the amazing elements and animation that makes Pixar so amazing, especially the montages. This is also a great return to the kids movies Pixar is usually known for putting out, after Soul completely shocked everyone with its maturity. This film does feel very magical and will definitely be worth your while. 2021 has been kind of underwhelming for movies with Covid still out there, but this is one of the few bright spots the year has put out.",Luca

The vivid landscapes and animation. It's a perfect family movie. Filled with adventure, friendship and fun! I was chopping some onions towards the ending. I'm so happy that everyone got what they want, especially for Alberto. He has a father figure like Massimo, Luca and Guilia are enjoying school and that was a blast! Must watch film! Go Luca and Alberto! Also, the end credits with drawings were really entertaining. Thank you Disney and Pixar!Randy (sunflower emoji)",Luca

With his kept secret he experiences more in life in one summer than he has ever before.Pixar delivers another engaging story drenched with relatable/realistic themes such as: a wholesome friendship, inner optimism, curiosity of the unknown, a group seen as an outcast, and betrayal just to name a few. Also, the Italian culture was displayed well, with splashes of food, dialogue, architecture and idle time.This film has effective pacing, there is never a dull moment. There are just enough unique personalities that bring another engaging dynamic to this simple but complex film.The drama is developed well between the many aspects this movie displays with the two sea monsters facing a constant threat of being detected which leads to an interesting twist to the story; that many people face in real life. In addition there is an annoying character that serves as an extension of the overall antagonist that adds to the quality of the film.Side note, did the sea monsters technically eat their own kind?VerdictThis film is really good, the themes are so heavy and deep you can't help to over analyze.

166,thatfilmperson,Perfect for kids,8,15 September 2021,"If you liked:
The Little Mermaid
Tangled
Call Me By Your NameSilenzio Bruno!Note: for those of you who saw ""Call Me By Your Name"" this film is in the ""if you liked"" category ONLY because of the warm, Italian summer atmosphere. No peaches were used in the making of this animation.Luca is a story of mermaid-like creatures who turn into people when out of the water, but for obvious reasons are always told they should never set foot on land. An age-old story of overprotective parents trying to keep their child away from danger (The Croods, Finding Nemo, Tangled, The Little Mermaid...); but Pixar know that this is a cliché at this point, so they make a very smart move of skipping the part where you're supposed to show his life underwater, his desperate curiosity and longing for adventure, and the fights with his parents almost entirely, as Luca is on land 10 minutes in the film.This is the Pixar I love. This isn't the best or the worst of their work, and it also is a lot more childish than usual; only this time it isn't a problem but a feature. It is childish not because of silly jokes (although those are there too) or simplistic story with plot holes behind every corner, but because it deals with actual problems children of age ~10 might face - being afraid of something new, not fitting in and feeling isolated from other kids, being laughed at for dreaming big... I wish this came out when I was little, and I feel like any young kid would take away some lessons that would make their lives easier. As it always is the case with Pixar, the animation is insanely gorgeous, every shot except for the characters (which by the way are animated in a very unusual style for Pixar) looks like it's been photographed rather than drawn; it is also funny, entertaining, has a magnificent score and a beautiful atmosphere that instantly puts it into the category of a summer movie. Because the target audience is primarily smaller children it is also very short (only 90 minutes), and this is also a rare case where I think Pixar could make a very nice sequel of.I would highly recommend you show this to your kids or little siblings. Available on Disney+ only.",Luca

And that's really amazingly bad for a Pixar movie.Luca is a very beautiful movie with a shallow plotline with a few bits of emotional scenes. One huge gripe I have with this movie is how it normalizes undesirable behavior, mainly bullying and negligence from adults, throughout the movie.I think that one of the main points of the movie is right at the end of the movie.Luca's mom:
What he did today was amazing.But we can't let him stay in this world.Can we?Luca's grandma
Some people, they'll never never accept him.But some will.And he seems to know how to find the good ones.This seems to be the driving point of this film, I just wished that they would have incorporated this into the spirit of the movie, instead of the in-film line of """"Risking your life for a Vespa?"".Which indeed, most of the movie showed that a Vespa is more important than family, safety, and even a friend who brought him to surface in the first place.

171,JoelAlexanderr,An escape to a time when life wasn't complicated,8,22 June 2021,"Surprise, surprise. Pixar has another hit on their hands with LUCA, a heartwarming tale of two young boys in the Italian Riviera who bond over one summer together. Oh, and they also happen to be fish creatures. This movie captures the innocence and magic of a childhood friendship like few I have seen before, and it will win any audience over with its charming and well-developed ensemble. There are plenty of plot elements that everyone has seen before, but after the movie gets going and the relationship between the two main boys is sparking, any conventional plot points began to melt away in place of nostalgia for a time when having fun and living life with a friend was all that mattered.The voice acting is excellent, with Jacob Tremblay reminding audiences why they adore him in the first place as the title character and Jack Dylan Grazer bringing arrogant charisma to the wild best friend of Luca. The animation style is beautiful as usual with Disney, but the filmmakers have decided to take a simpler approach to the visuals. Many recent Disney/Pixar movies have looked photorealistic with the amount of detail they contain (Soul, Toy Story 4), but LUCA looks purposefully like an animated film, which adds to the mystical and wondrous aspects of the friendship and of the fantastical story.LUCA isn't quite as masterful as many other Pixar movies, and doesn't contain a deep and profound lesson about life that will make you change your entire way of existence, but it's never trying to be either of those things. The nostalgia and the happiness that it invokes in the viewer will come through in audiences of all ages, which some could argue is just as important as any life lesson that a movie such as this could provide.

174,willcrabbe,Pixar tries to replicate Studio Ghibli and only partially succeed,5,20 June 2021,"Set on the picturesque Italian Riviera and at times feeling like a pale imitation of the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, Luca is the latest film released by Pixar and follows a sea monster with the ability to walk on land as a human who explores the coastal town of Portorosso (a nod to Miyazaki's Porco Rosso maybe?) with his new friend Alberto.The early critical response for this film was unenthusiastic and lukewarm while more recent audience feedback has been very positive (just look at the average rating here on Letterboxd). Luca has certainly been resonating with some and I can see why. It's full of charm and tells a gentle story of youth, friendship and chasing dreams. It tries to pull off the simplicity of Ghibli films such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Ponyo and definitely succeeds in some regards such as the idyllic setting, but unfortunately this film fell flat for me.The characters were uninteresting, making it hard to connect with any of the emotional moments or beats the film was going for. There were a few moments from Luca's parents Daniela and Lorenzo that had me chuckling, but this was mostly the only reaction that the film could elicit from me.The animation is generally wonderful and is undoubtedly the best part of the film, but the character models are just plain ugly. They resemble some sort of horrid cross between the characters from the game 'Two Point Hospital' and Aardman's Wallace and Gromit. It almost felt like more effort had been made into realising the world and environment than the characters themselves.The film is certainly not bad, it has some lovely vibrant animation and a distinct warmth and nostalgia, but it is exceptionally unremarkable and will be forgotten very quickly in my mind at least.Luca certainly doesn't help to buck the idea that Pixar are losing their golden touch (Soul was maybe an exception to the rule), and it is probably one of the weakest films they've released since The Good Dinosaur. We can only hope that one day we will see the next The Incredibles or Ratatouille, but for now we will have to accept perfectly fine efforts from a studio formally renowned for excellence.",Luca

181,G-Joshua-Benjamin,A sea of disappointment.,1,23 June 2021,"First, when this first started, I got such a cool feeling. Like I was in a theater. I thought of how much has changed since I was a kid. It was a good way to start a movie.I liked the voice acting. I thought it was great. I didn't like anything else.May be spoilers below.So, the first thing I noticed is that the movie didn't look that good. A few months ago, I watched a movie called Soul and while I did not like the movie at all it was the best-looking animated film I have ever seen. Luca just looked like a TV movie.So, there is a kid who is a fish. He realizes he can turn into a human and the ONLY thing he wanted to do is get a Vespa. Really? I guess seeing all the new things there are to see, trying all the foods, smelling all the new things, and seeing all the people are worthless? It just took what was trying to be magic away from the film and made it seem like a normal movie. But it had a weird vibe. Like it was from the early 80s.The music was not memorable at all.When he meets his friend, I kept thinking of another cartoon. Jimmy Neutron. I have never watched that show. But I saw the character. So that only made it feel more like a TV movie or show.Where was the action, excitement, drama growth? As far a character development goes, I think the main characters parents and friend had some growth but the main character not so much.After about 30 minutes I said out loud to myself ""this movie sucks."" I started looking to see how much time was left. I did that a bunch of times after that. I was happy to see that the movie was finished even though it said there were 16 minutes and some seconds left.The movie just seemed like it was missing so many things that Pixar movies normally have. I found no part of the story interesting. Nothing got me excited. It was something I watched that I regret and that I would never watch or recommend to anyone.Now as far as kids go there is no way I would let a kid watch this. It talks to much about death, killing and those sorts of things. I have a two-year-old niece and 6-year-old second cousin. The thought of them watching this makes me feel so uncomfortable.If you look at the reviews a lot of people liked the movie. So as with anything in life it is up to you if you like it or not. At least now you can watch it for the price of Disney + and you don't have to pay anything more. Still I would not recommend it.",Luca

Leave it up to Pixar to give me the much needed smile and happiness that I'd been missing with resent film fare. Luca is a joy. It's imagery is stunning and colors are mind blowingly beautiful. It grabs you instantly. But so do the strong and endearing main characters. The theme and story might be to on the nose and a little to familiar, especially when compared to the company's long history of strong adult themes in such great kids movies, but I loved that about it. Some times you need something nice and loving to remind you how great animation can be and how much we need to see such open compassion in these bizarre dark times. It's a shame that Disney wasn't able to give the movie a big theater release that the people who worked on it so hard , deserve. But I'm glad it is there for people to watch on Disney plus for free.

185,azeezsmith-61542,Luca Review- A Summer Blast PIXAR FILM,10,9 October 2021,"I ABSOLUTELY HAD SUCH A BLAST WITH LUCA. Being A Pixar Fan Is Sool Riveting And Exciting And This Is Definitely One Of Pixar's Best Quality Movies To Date. From The Gorgeous Ocean And Clouds And Beautiful Setting Of Italy. The Pixar Characters In Luca Are Soo Funny And Quirky And I Enjoyed And Adored Most Of Them. The Breathtaking Animation IS TOO DIE FOR And Makes You Look At How Pixar's Animation Has Really Leveled Up Now. I Nearly Cryed In This Movie But Some Of The Best Moments Were Cheerful And Rushed. Literally, Luca Is Fresh, Filled With Endless Laughs, Delicious Pasta, Scooter Rides, Its Neverlasting Adorable Characters And An Adventure Worth Seeing And The Summer Movie Event That We Need And Obviously BEGS TO BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN!!",Luca
186,moiseshuizar,Surprised hit,7,22 June 2021,"I was not expecting much from this movie. Since Pixar has been on a recent decline. I was pleasantly surprised, good movie of a sheltered boy coming of age story. Enjoyed the simple life and town in the italian riviera.",Luca
187,nicolaperrin,Cute,8,17 July 2021,"This movie is very sweet. I think the storyline is well written and her here are some funny bits in it, which I always love to see in Disney/Pixar movies. My children love it, we've already watched it about 5 times. The only thing I would have preferred is if they'd used Italian voice actors instead of American. That's the only bad thing I can say about it though.",Luca
188,raykuanlabel-291-473410,ALMOST GOOD,8,19 June 2021,"Unfortunately like Crazy Rich Asians, Luca also turns out to be another long Travel Destination commercial.",Luca
189,a_filmcritter,a great story about friendship,8,4 July 2021,"Disney does it again; with its animation, story telling, valuable lessons. Simply put, it was a great family film. It was one of those classic friendship movie.",Luca
190,hydralien-40230,A beautiful story,10,11 August 2021,"It's a beautiful story of breaking the stereotypes, acceptance of unusual and letting kids do what their hearts desire. Animation is gorgeous, voice acting is great and the story is simple but full of heart. I guess it's simpler and less existencial than e.g. ""Up"", but it's not a bad thing - it still has a point, and it's quite stronger in that regard than e.g. ""Soul""",Luca
191,joostkale,"Is it groundbreaking? No, Its Luca!",9,18 June 2021,"Stop it Pixar! Just stop it! Even the simplest stories are becoming masterpieces in the hands of Pixar. I don't know how they do it. It doesn't take the emotions risks like an Inside Out or Soul, nor is it a masterpiece of a screenplay like the Toy Story franchise, but boy oh boy I love it. Probably, its biggest flaw is also it's strength. It doesn't try to be the next masterpiece. It's Luca. It's a fun crowd pleaser with the typical Pixar emotional moments. It doesn't brake boundaries, but that's okay for me. For what it is, it's perfect! The story is sweet, and the characters are charming and lovely with real development. Yes, the story is a little predictable at times, but it doesn't bother the story much for me. I also love that the villain is the complete opposite of a twist villain. From the moment he pops on screen, you know he's the baddy, and he fits the movie very well. What makes this movie stand out, are the visuals. Holy crap, this movie is gorgeous! Literally the most beautiful movie I've seen this year so far. Also, the score, holy crap. Everything fits with the beautiful country that is Italy. I already know a lot of people will think it fits too much in the Pixar formula, but what can I see. The formula works, so why change it. It has his flaws, and it probably is not the next Pixar masterpiece, but it does work perfectly for what it is.",Luca
192,MahnoorKhan-FilmCritic,Pixar Never Fails To Impress,10,24 June 2021,"I just loved the Storywriting of Luca movie. It has a good, simple, and intelligent story, nothing irrelevant, nothing boring. What's make an animated movie beautiful is the Visuals. The Visuals of this movie are stunning, which makes it more beautiful and worth watching. You will fall in love with the designs of Animated characters, and the all-over setup. Luca movie is set up in Italy country and I love the Italian culture in this movie. The Italian dialogues, food, and the whole Italian atmosphere were too good.",Luca
193,sagar-swapna,A Good film for Kids under 12 Santa Pecorino,6,23 June 2021,Excellent animation as expected from a Pixar film. Story had great potential could have been a great adventure but I guess the writers and the director stuck to the very basic and did not venture out. Adults or anybody above 15 will find it hard to enjoy. The film lacked emotion and growth of characters in a significant way. Nothing stood out after you watch the film except Giulia saying Santa with different cheese name that thing stuck with me and I still keep saying it. I think the concept still has great potential and Pixar could redeem this one with a great sequel which they already had set up. I ll go with 6.5 with this one though.,Luca
194,rajitecture,Warm Sweet Movie,7,22 June 2021,"Had some early bad reviews, but over all it was a very warm sweet movie with a lot of powerful messages for kids and adults. It reminded me of my own childhood and brought back some fond memories.",Luca
195,ryanwesthamfan,Amazing!!!!,8,8 July 2021,The Good- Luca is just flat out amazing. The thing I love about Luca is that it is a coming of age story but to a smaller scale compared to what we have seen in the past that will take you back to your childhood. The animation is as great as always but that is what you expect from a Pixar film. I love this new world and mythology that we are introduced to here. There are some little moments here that are very heartwarming and these moments are because of the music.The Bad- I wasn't able to see it in cinemas.Overall Thoughts- A coming of age story with beautiful animation and direction that brings our characters to life. This will be another hit from Pixar which I absolutely loved. Overall I'm going to give 'Luca' an 8/10.,Luca
196,sugus-54811,This movie was the best !!!,10,27 June 2021,"This film was incredible, I really enjoyed it, it's an amazing movie to enjoy with family and friends.This movie tells the story of Luca, a kid that lives under the sea and he wants to go to the surface and meet another different world.The main character is Luca and he found a friend call Alberto that results to be a mermaid like him!When they arrive to the surface they found a new girl called Giulia and they found that to win money to get his motorcycle they need to win the race.The plot is very interesting, you won't get bored during this movie.Another amazing thing is the characterization, all the scene and the ambient seems to be real and cool, it's almost as if you were inside of the film.Everyone should see this movie!Highly recommend!!! ✨✨✨",Luca
197,antony-69,Disney proving yet again that paint by numbers sells,5,21 June 2021,"It doesn't matter who's name is above the door anymore, all Disney/Pixar films are the same. Onward, Coco, Moana, Inside Out, Soul and now this. They look alike, they feel alike, they are alike.You used to be able to identify Pixar movies as being technically better, exceptionally witty, individually styled and fantastically voiced with the added benefits of cool Easter eggs. Now, only the Easter eggs remain. Everything else is paint by numbers.The people at Pixar need to understand that using magic, foreign cultures, nerds, etc. As allegories for everything that is wrong with America is paid out.Bring back John Lasseter!",Luca
198,pruz-55801,Simple and emotional,7,18 June 2021,"Man it definitely is hard for Pixar to follow up after onward and soul so when I saw luca I had high expectations.Then I realized that this movie was not made to be like other Pixar greats it was made to show the beauty of life, youth, friendships and what a magical summer can do
There was no big twist no big arching plot just a simple story about 2 somewhat simple boys and the meaning of family and relationshipsThat being said I was quite disappointed with the results mostly because of the ridiculously high bar Pixar has set but after some time I realized that I was on the verge of tears at the last scene so yes even though the plot may be limited the villain may be stupid or heck they maybe could've done alot more with the material it doesn't matter cause once again it wasn't made for that it was made to enjoy after a nice long day with a loved one by your side and embrace the simpleness
It may not be a pixar classic but in some ways MAY be a pixar classic.",Luca
199,titushowlett,A Flawed but Beautiful Movie,9,19 June 2021,"Let's start off with the cons.(Spoiler Warning!)Some plot devices feel a bit misused/something that amounted to nothing. Such as the race. While it did do well for development, it felt a bit misused periodically.It felt quite a bit predictable.Some characters feel a bit cliché such as the parents (being overprotective and quirky) which isn't inherently bad, just seemed a bit generic. Or the cliché annoying jerk. While he is entertaining and kinda goofy, he didn't feel all that ""special""Now onto the Pros.Once again. The animation is the most professional pleasure for the eyes. All the colors, shading, subsurface scattering, water, hair, sand, scales simulations look amazing.The expressions are especially well done too.This one did make me tear up. I thought it's ending was really good. Alberto developing and selling the Vespa out of love for Luca was just so tear jerking and heart warming. Makes me recall just how much I love members of my own family and friends I have that have done things for me because they love me.It made me feel like a kid again. In a magnificent way. Trying new things. The urge to learn. Taking risks and being silly. Learning about our surroundings more. Such as the Universe. I'm almost an adult so just that made me tear up.This is certainly not the best movie in terms of plot, but god is it enjoyable.It starts off a little slow but once things are kicked off, it's excellent. It doesn't feel like it's going too fast or slow. Impressive considering it's 1 hour and 30 minute duration.The 3 main characters are just oozing with charm. By some top-notch voice work. For voice actors in their teens/tweens. They are INCREDIBLE.This movie tackles how our dreams can change in a magnificent manner with such high levels of respect. I can relate a lot considering I'm having my own crisis with what career I want to dive into. By the first 3rd, Luca and Alberto want to get a Vespa and explore the world. But eventually Luca slowly changes and wants to go to school with the excellent member of the Trio, Giulia. To learn more about the universe and humanity.Some side characters are great and entertaining. Such as the nice and massive father of Giulia. He is portrayed as this hard boiled fish killer. But we eventually come to see he is rich in wisdom and ideologies. I wish we saw a bit more of him, but I'm satisfied on what we got.The conflict/emotional scenes felt tense and organic. Also very natural.In summary, an eyegasm to behold with some noticeable flaws. While it may not be groundbreaking, or super new and amazing, it's a great movie that tackles a genre very well. In comparison to other Pixar movies, it certainly is up there on the list.I give a huge credit and special props to the people that made this movie. Especially the director and writers. For being on the lower experience level side of the film spectrum, job well done. I salute you all.I highly recommend this film. It will definitely be a good family watch.9/10.",Luca
200,ismaeelbuttib,Very good animation style,8,28 August 2021,"Yes,as far as the animation goes it was great. The story was great and luca and his friend alberto being able to keep their identity hidden gor that long was impressive. Should definetly watch,i personally think it is one of pixars best.",Luca
201,a-clinch1,Family Friendly Film,6,19 June 2021,"A film for kids, simple story. Heart in the right place but still not the high quality you would expect from pixar.Incredible animation as you would expect, but the story was unimaginative. It didn't have the magic or charm of Disney's best films but it was still worth the watch.Not one that your likely to watch again.",Luca
202,systersister,Lovely film,9,10 September 2021,"So Italian, still so international. Warm, funny and interesting. It's a great story about friendship and family. And freedom. Thanks! Made me 😃",Luca
203,bananasonata,Where is Porto Rosso?,8,4 July 2021,"Love the story! All characters have their own peculiarity and Uncle Ugo is my favourite! He does not make much appearance but his lines are so funny! The would not say it is a story you never seen before, like many, it is about our protagonist, Luca, embarked on a journey to the human world and earned friendship and recognition from human and his sea monster parents, and the way the story conveys is very worth watching. Animation is the best like always from Pixar. Finally, where is Porto Rosso? I want to make friends with sea monsters too!",Luca
204,Hopedoesnotdie,Amazing LGBTQ+ film,10,19 June 2021,"This movie is historical. They subverted so many LGBTQ themes extremely well. I felt the sexual innuendo was a bit much for a kids film though. I mean them riding a bike through fish towards a metaphorical climax, my mouth was on the floor lol. And I was not happy that Alberto ended up with the old single dad in the end: but it's a movie about acceptance and loving who you are. And it debuted in Pride month!!!",Luca
205,pbstarman,Remarkable,10,7 July 2021,It is rare that I watch a movie more than once. I've watched LUCA three times. Everything about the movie is brilliant!!! Please make a sequel that is just as good or better!!! Bravo!!!,Luca
206,acanacox,Hmmm,8,13 July 2021,"I'm 25 and I will always give a disney movie a chance. I had to watch it like 5 times to get my final thoughts on it. Creative, charming, ehhhhhh 4/10 predictable story line. Boy finds out second lifestyle, makes friend, runs away from being sent to someplace he doesn't wanna go because they wanna protect him, makes a loner female friend, meets the bully, almost gets caught with his other life form, bully gets suspicious, but doesn't try to reveal his secrets, more so just wanting to win competition, team breaks up, friend shows his second life to the girl, surprisingly the girl tries to protect Luca and his secret and not kill them, kid competes on own team, wins, town finds out about the secret, accepts them, parents let kid go to school. It's funny and gets straight to the point in each scene! Which I can understand due to it being a kid movie and kids attention span is that of a goldfish. Lovely movie. Please don't make a sequel! It's good where it ended! Don't ruin it.",Luca
207,Paradroid78,Pixar does Ponyo,9,27 June 2021,"This movie is basically Pixar's (very good) take on the movie Ponyo. And it doesn't try to hide it - the seaside town where the action takes place is even called ""Porto Rosso""!Now to be fair that movie was itself inspired by The Little Mermaid, so things sort of come full circle here. And outside of the basic framework of the story and some nods and winks for those in the know (note the scene where the two fish in human form eat human food for the first time at the human child's house), the story very much does its own thing and does a very good job of it.It's definitely one of the better recent Pixar movies and worth watching, if you're into animation, or have kids. It also has a great message about accepting the ""other"" (unlike the aforementioned Ghibli inspiration, the townspeople here are a real threat towards the sea creatures).",Luca
208,mohammedsalehali99,Okay.,6,19 June 2021,Luca wasn't exactly Pixar's best work to be honest. It draws a little bit of inspiration from both The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo. I enjoyed watching the movie but as soon as it was over I quickly realized that it's going to be very forgettable. It's okay overall but it's not as good as the reviews say it is.,Luca
209,jharaldson-73888,Enjoyed it with Kids,9,19 June 2021,This was a movie my kids were looking forward to seeing and the more I saw the commercials I got excited with them and noticed myself referencing the movie with them. Then I realized it was coming straight to Disney+ and that was amazing cause it made it more simpler for me and 3 kids to make a movie night at home. They enjoyed the movie as so did I.,Luca
210,skpc9,Fantastic & Amazing!,10,20 June 2021,"LUCA, was simply AWESOME!! I throughly enjoy the laughter, tears, & AMAZING tour of Italy! PIXAR honestly did it again, and it's a wonderful family movie and a must see!!!!",Luca
211,chrisrowe-97677,It's just ok,6,9 July 2021,"The girl makes this watchable, it's OK. First forty minutes are quite dull but last fifteen are awesome. It's forgettable but just ok.",Luca
212,ranoosh2005,Nice movie from Pixar but not great like other's,6,19 June 2021,"The movie is good and has simple ideas about friendship and acceptance no matter what it looks like. But it's not as cool as UP , wall. E , and Inside out.It is not easy to forget them , they have deep feelings inside us and in our children . I hope form Pixar make more movies deeply and beauty's like before . I'm waiting something like coco , we still love it and love they song's . It's really magnificent .",Luca
213,eqtron,Average,6,27 August 2021,It didn't offer anything special tbh but it wasn't bad either.,Luca
214,tmoser1434,A beautiful summer vacation to Italy,7,22 June 2021,"Luca feels like a summer vacation to Italy, beautifully animated and filled with charismatic characters. However, the film tends to play it safe and probably will not be remembered as one of Pixar's best.",Luca
215,kerorogio,"Bread, Love and Laziness",6,23 June 2021,"Very simple story, with the typical message about the acceptance of those who are different from us, a valid narrative element but ... now more than half a century has passed since ""The Boy with Green Hair"" or even the more famous ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner "", I understand the difficult times, but by now it is no longer a courageous topic and hardly enough to excite if it is not supported by an interesting script.The first half hour of the film is a pure and boring commercial for Piaggio, then from the acquaintance with the Marcovaldo family the vision improves, even if the film remains uninvolving, and not very original with its typical problematic parents, to whom the son not even seem be fond of. Not that the village bully is better, he's a pretty forgettable villain, moreover, the only problem of the Marcovaldo family is solved quickly and easily.Overall Luca is super-American in bringing together Italian elements and not knowing what to do next. The seaside village of Portorosso, inspired by the coastal area of the Cinque Terre, is rendered in a colorful and pleasant way, while the marine world is definitely neglected. The choice of songs is very vintage, undoubtedly cult songs, but they do not always feel appropriate to the scenes. Frankly, where was the usefulness of the direction of Mr. Casarosa, outside the beautiful dream sections and some old quotes, I ignore it, but I suspect only to avoid controversy. In short, a Pixar product of the less important ones. To make a forced comparison, ""Luca"" is comparable to ""Coco"" as ""To Rome with Love"" is comparable to ""Midnight in Paris"", they can like both, but the level of inspiration is different, and the sad thing is that Luca, with the context of sea monsters, started with less worn bases than mariachi and the feast of the dead.The theme of friendship, however, has been cinically well transposed, but given the setting, I was hoping for something more ambitious. Regarding the possibility of potentially controversial content, the rumors about it were all mental fanfiction of those who enjoy matching characters of each product with a minimum of notoriety. There is no Lgbt stuff, the director had already clarified about it. The Disney princesses are no longer what they used to be, and the tv series ""Star vs. The Forces of Evil"" and even more ""The Owl House"" were effectively an introductory attempt, surely ""Amphibia"" will go that way too, but the situation in this case is different. On the other hand, those who complained, obviously have not seen the film, or they interpret it with particular dedication.A film that can be watched by everyone, but designed only for a young American audience, who will quickly forget it after viewing.",Luca
216,samuellickiss,"Perfectly enjoyable evening viewing - not mindblowing, but good",7,22 June 2021,"First things first - ignore the 1/10 scores. Scores that low means there's nothing redeemable about the film, and that's simply not the case. The animation is lush, the voice acting good and there are some laughs to be had along the way.Plot wise, it's not transformative - this is not Inside Out or Wall-E. It's a simple tale about two friends who happen to be sea monsters navigating their way through the human world, bonding along the way. It's a little generic, but it's fun, entertaining and you'd have to be a real dullard to not appreciate that this film is brimming with enthusiasm. There's plenty of great Italian folk music mixed in with a beautiful orchestral score, all of which for, the perfect backdrop to a picture-perfect Italian seaside town that's overflowing with colour.I think there's a tendency to dismiss simple films, which I think is unfair. Not every film needs to be a cerebral exercise or be era-defining. Just live and let live - that's a good message to take away from the film.Overall, I'd put it in the same bracket as Raya and the Last Dragon - solid and entertaining films that, while perhaps not doing much new, are still worth watching.",Luca
217,clarks58,Fun,8,29 June 2021,"Did not find this to be the usual Pixar emotional wonder and more like a Disney animated movie but the colors were fantastic and the story warm and fun. Definitely worth watching for good,fun,feel good entertainment. 😊",Luca
218,madden-brad,Children are loving it,8,22 June 2021,My kiddos love this. It's sweet and heartwarming and teaches great messages about being yourself even if not everyone will always accept you. Beautiful music too :-),Luca
219,bmorgs-03860,Worst Pixar movie,3,20 June 2021,"This is definitely the worst Pixar movie they've ever made. Has funny parts and has the amazing animation, but the story and everything else is terrible. Hard to actually pay attention it's so boring. The girls dad is a complete knock off of the dad from cloudy with a chance of meatballs. And not to sound soft, but this is kind of insulting to Italians.",Luca
220,silliohooie,Super cute,7,15 September 2021,"I thought Luca was a really cute movie! Although, if I was watching this as a child I may have been a little frightened by the looks of the 'sea monsters!' I loved the friendship between the two main characters & how we saw Luca grow as a friend and person by the end of the movie. I think it teaches great messages of personal growth and acceptance of others to young kids.",Luca
221,elijah-alcantara,Should've gone to the deep,6,21 June 2021,"Beautiful colors and animation but the story and dialogue feels too simplistic ... should be great for kids but there's no deep meaning on this film like many great Pixar titles that many of us look for. It's like year by year Pixar is losing it's soul. And the music feels like aeris' theme from ff7, anyone who has played the game will recognize it and be distracted the whole film. Pixar is running out of ideas.",Luca
222,EvanoOruvan,"If you think you don't like the movie, say ""Silenzio Bruno""",9,3 July 2021,This is a wonderful movie. I thoroughly enjoyed both the underwater scenes and the above land scenes. Its was warm and excellent.,Luca
223,alesaenz-48003,Pixar is back!,9,19 June 2021,"After having serious disappointments with ""Onward"" and ""Soul"", I was afraid that Pixar had lost its charm, but I became glad that ""Luca"" is up to the expected standards of quality in storytelling for Pixar. I'm not blind neither since it's pretty obvious that the script copied elements from ""A Good Dinosaur"", ""Coco"" and ""How to train your Dragon"" but the film has enough on its own to stand up. I enjoyed it a lot.",Luca
224,thomasbgleeson,Calamari by your name,9,19 June 2021,"Beautiful animation and a story of live and friendship. This is a wonderful film with a somewhat predictable plot but at a short runtime, it's a pleasure to spend time in this universe. Appeals to all ages and has a unique story telling perspective.",Luca
225,fanimator03,Slightly better than Cars 2,6,21 June 2021,"Luca was in between mediocre and good. The animation was bad for Pixar standards. This looks like an Illumination movie branded as a Pixar film. The story was ok and not that interesting. Good character dynamics. The way the sea monsters transform into humans was so quick and glossed over. As one of the biggest Pixar lovers, this was slightly better than Cars 2.",Luca
226,lmidgley05,BEAUTIFUL,10,1 July 2021,"From the beautiful friendships, to the gorgeous aesthetics of the animation, this movie is all around incredible! It shows us the difficulties of hiding our differences and unaccepted traits, and the amazing friendships that can come out of it. This is a very funny and inspirational movie that i 100% recommend to everyone!",Luca
227,aj1218,Good movie that is free with Disney +,7,22 June 2021,Surprisingly this movie doesn't cost anything extra unlike Mulan and Raya. This movie is good but not as classic as early Pixar. The studio is defiantly missing some key elements since ygis was the first film to be primarily created after John Lassiter left and took some key staff members with him. If you have Disney + go see it.,Luca
228,jim921977,Not the greatest Pixar movie,8,18 June 2021,"It's a sweet, family friendly story. It's fun, funny, and simple. The scenery is amazing and the music is great, this does set it apart from most other Pixar movies.",Luca
229,akellashashank,Simple yet beautiful flick from Pixar !!,7,18 June 2021,"Yet again, Pixar delivered a warm, fun, cute little movie in the form of LUCA which has its heart at the right place with right amount of friendship , drama and adventure to tuck you in. The Vibrant and eye pleasing animation will make you sit through. That final send of off in real form is indeed a marvelous touch. Cant say it is one of the finest pictures from Pixar, but definitely a good watch.""Vespa deserves an award for supporting role ;)",Luca
230,jenaycarter,Beautiful Coming Of Age Story!,10,26 June 2021,"Loved every second of this movie! I really enjoyed young Jacob Tremblay's voice acting! Same thing for Jack Dylan Grazer! Both boys did amazing! And just like Raya and The Last Dragon I wouldn't mind watching this movie again! Also it took me awhile but I finally realized that a miss Maya Rudolph was apart of this amazing project! Beautiful!I love the story and what direction it heads in. This story shows that you are loved and accepted at the end of the day no matter who or what you look like and that no matter what decisions you make, you will always have your friends and family by your side to help make those decisions.Luca is just a kid and just like Ariel who also wanted to venture out and see more of the world from beyond the sea, took a huge leap and found Alberto and together the two of them had many great adventures and met Giulia. And along the way learned more and more about new things. And Luca learned a great lesson too. To follow you're destiny and go for you're dreams. Loved it! Highly recommend this!",Luca
231,iamdcontingency,Great Movie With Nostalgic Feel!!,8,21 September 2021,"I was originally reluctant to see Luca expecting it to be a great ""kids"" animated movie. I even put off seeing it for months. But Luca was great movie. The movie was wonderful, emotional with great themes. When you see Luca, halfway in you'll forget it's just a movie and you'll be surprised when it ends.Also the visuals, setting and most of all the voice acting was excellent. Viva Luca!!",Luca
232,diamondarrow,One of Pixar's best!,8,13 August 2021,"I thought this movie was amazing it was visually stunning, funny and thought out.

233,AndyCordReviews,Luca is as light and sweet as expected,8,5 August 2021,"The animation is beautiful and summery, perfect for this season, taking place in a small fishing town in Italy.The story is perfect for both kids and adults, inspiring to both. The friendship between Luca and Alberto is refreshing, pure, and true.Themes like inclusion and the importance of true friendship while working to make your dreams come true are all handled in this film, with a touch of innocence and a positive outlook on life, this will surely warm your heart like the summer sun.",Luca
234,rick-jatti,had good themes,7,23 June 2021,"The film did well at exploring the throes of childhood friendship in 90 minutes, and those relationships did tug at the heart strings here and there. Obviously the animation was fantastic, and the depiction of the italian riviera and countryside italian culture were great, although i'm not sure if any actual italian says ""santa"" followed by a cheese like giulia.At first i wanted to say the acceptance scene at the end was a little unrealistically conflict-free, but i caught myself and thought that if this is the message pixar wants to show to our children, then more power to them. It was a great way of saying ""embrace our differences and accept each other"".Pixar seems to have become a victim of its own success though, as nothing really blew me away in luca or struck me as super creative. Maybe 20 years ago the concept was innovative, but today luca was merely an above average animated movie, falling short of the likes of ratatouille, toy story, soul, coco, and many others. The plot ended somewhat along the lines of what i expected, and to that end it doesn't play as well for adults as i believe it does for children, unlike some of the films mentioned above.",Luca
235,Cold_Aqua_Tomato,Predictable but very sweet,8,23 June 2021,"I've just watched it, and I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. The story is simple with lots of clichés, but somehow makes you happy. You feel the happiness you last felt when you were little, everybody was alive, and you didn't have a care in the world. And you sit there thinking ""what a beautiful world we live in"", despite everything humans have done. Your life is accomplished if you've had one friend. If you've listened to music, danced, swum in the sea, and slept under the ""fish"" even just once. It is so worth it.",Luca
236,yoveikivi,Outstanding Animation & Voice Acting -but- Generic Story and Bad Pacing,6,21 June 2021,"Out of Pixar were all used to expect masterpieces that are heartfelt and emotional. This movie is a good reminder tyhat not everything that comes out of a good studio must be perfect. This is a funny and hopefully acurate portrail of small italian towns, and mermaids/mermen. I loved the voice acting and the animation was impeccible. It's a crowd pleasing summer movie that I reccomend if you want to have an enjoyable time. There is bad pacing and a generic story; therefore I would give it a 6/10 just below Onwards.",Luca
237,HunterGee,Thought it would have been better.,3,11 October 2021,"This movie is probably best enjoyed by 4 year olds.I'm not going to go into it, but nothing happens in this movie.Two sea monsters go to a town to compete in a bike race so they can get a motorbike and explore the world.The antagonist is nothing but annoying and torture to look at and watch.The whole time Luca's parents search for him is pointless, as nothing happens with it.The friendship between the two boys is alright and I suppose touching at times. Especially since it means so much to Alberto because it's the first relationship since his dad left him.Other than that this film is just not worth watching.And to top it off the ending ended fast. It just felt like something was missing.The concept was cool though, I admit. Mermaids disguised as humans, I thought this movie was going to rock.Lasty, I'll say the animations were really good. 10/10. Unique. I like when these movies stand out in that way.",Luca

I can't believe how close to reality this film is, aside from people turning into fish. But of course, it's a Disney and Pixar film. I really did love all of the characters and how they were involved in the story. The story itself was very unique, never seen before. It's one of those movies that puts a smile on your face. I noticed how this film had the same vibes as older Pixar films, which I loved. Overall, I highly recommend this film to watch on a Friday night with your whole family.",Luca

240,amenfd,"Mediocre Story, Great Theme, Awesome Depiction of Portorosso",7,12 July 2021,"Luca is a ""sea-monster"" boy who-after becoming friends with a troublemaker, Alberto, becomes fascinated by the idea of going to the land and explore the wonders of the human city of Portorosso. However, as the villagers are hostile to sea monsters, he needs to keep his identity a secret. The story has a theme of childhood friendship and acceptance from others; it also explores the idea of hiding your true self in society. I love how they resolve the story around this concept and that both the boys and the villagers accept their true identities. However, I am a little disappointed in general due to the story's simplicity and the overall arc the characters go through. As a Disney movie, I honestly expected more from the story. For example, I would have loved it if something more substantial would have drawn Luca to Alberto after he betrayed him by calling him a sea monster in front of everyone.Luca is a beautiful animation. Considering the style of Disney animations, the characters are designed in a cartoonish way, but the scenery in all the shots is breathtaking, and I was tempted to pause every frame to take in the gorgeous designs. From the bottom of the ocean to the landscapes of Portorosso, everything was designed to perfection. Because of this alone, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves animations.Finally, as expected in every Disney movie, the music and the voice actings were beautiful and would correctly capture the essence of every scene. In some situations - such as the scene where Luca betrays Alberto, the music would give me the final push to become emotional, and I would definitely check out the soundtracks later. Also, Jacob Tremblay and Jack Dylan Grazer both give excellent performances as the movie's main characters; however, the accent is better judged by a native Italian.In conclusion, I would say that Luca is worth your time, and with great art designs and resounding theme, It can be enjoyable to the audience.",Luca
241,ryanperez-90314,"A Fun, Warm Summer Movie for the Whole Family",10,20 June 2021,"""Luca"" is so far Pixar's best movie of this decade. I loved it better than ""Soul"" because it felt like a family movie, not a complex film to challenge kids. And it had a lot of warmth like ""Onward"" which I also loved. It's a sweet movie and the character designs reminded me of Aardman Animation's ""Wallace & Gromit"". Giulia is the best character in the movie. She reminded me of Ellie from ""Up"". She's my favorite female character from Pixar so far. It also reminded me of ""The Little Mermaid"" when Luca was picking up things from the surface like Ariel did. Overall, I loved it. I wish it came out in theaters because the whole world needs to see it and the last Pixar movie that made a profit was Toy Story 4. If ""Luca"" came out in theaters, it would make $700 million. And it came out 11 years after Toy Story 3 did because both films came out on June 18. The writers honored that film's legacy.",Luca

That is the truest single-sentence review of this movie that could possibly be made. I will admit that this movie is fairly straightforward, more-so than most Pixar movies, but therein lies the charm. It's actually kind of nice watching a Pixar movie that does not take itself too seriously and just floats along with retro-style, gorgeous animation. Pixar has obviously been trying some new things since Coco came out, and that is fine. The truth is that Pixar can only pump out so many ""sad sack"" movies. If you are a thirty or forty-something whining about this movie, get a clue - this isn't about you! Nor was it made for you. Pixar has, for years, made movies that go over younger kids' heads, despite them being billed as kids movies. No five year-old or even most ten year-olds are going to grasp what is really going on in Inside Out. That is what makes Luca so great. Even younger kids can appreciate it. Bravo Pixar.

There are so many wonderful things that make Luca so spectacular:1. The story is very entertaining and fast-paced, but without making us lose sight of what makes the writing so intriguing. Luca's journey to the surface is full of thrilling adventure, solid comedy, and great friendships made throughout the film, including his relationships with Guila and Alberto. As the film goes on, Luca's parents Daniela and Lorenzo realize that humans aren't as bad as they seem.2. The voice acting is full of some of the best actors ever. Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer, Maya Rudolph, and Jim Gaffigan round about the principal cast of the film, and despite being Caucasian, they do an excellent job playing the characters they've been cast as. The Italian-accented characters are also well-voiced too, sounding rather authentic in their accents.3. The animation is realistic, but also cartoony. Luca and his family's character designs have humanistic hints to make their disguises more believable and real. The backgrounds, both on land and in the sea, are beautiful to look at and rather polished. The town of Portorosso is very colorful but also nostalgic-looking, with a unique 1950s-esque depiction. The humans are also appropriately caricatured.4. The movie is also a little bit tear-jerking. There are parts where you will cry at scenes in the film, because it's got some really sad moments. The ending was the one that touched my heart the most.All in all, Luca is another solid entry in Pixar's canon of animated movies, and is a definite recommend. Please check it out.10.5/10.",Luca

I suppose for a kids movie, Luca fits the bill for a nice life lesson to children about the importance of friendship, adventure and school education. Yes, it even makes school education an aim for the main character which is wonderful. However, one can't help but feel Luca is rather empty and stumbles towards the finish line.

261,carsontuscany,Pixar Better Than Ever,9,20 June 2021,"86/100Luca is yet another example of Pixar flexing its muscles as a studio and showing how they can make animated masterpieces out of nearly any material that is handed to them. The animation teams at Pixar recognize the true beauty and art of animation and how much more can be added to a scene through vibrant landscapes and colors, and there is simply not much like their work at all. Luca reminds me of 2017's Coco, as it is a true love letter to the culture and background surrounding the characters in the film, making it diverse and inclusive of other cultures, giving many a sense of relatability and connection to the film from start to finish, while introducing an entirely different group to a culture and lifestyle that they may not be familiar with, and as a result uniting many different groups of people in our world. That right there is the true magic of movies and storytelling, and it takes masterwork of a craft and true passion and dedication to accomplish it effectively. Luca is a tale of growing up, finding oneself, and accepting others for who they are on the inside rather than simply what you see on the outside, and is the perfect film for educating the youth of our world today and as a reminder for older audiences.",Luca

274,theashcritique,"""Simplicity makes anything perfect..""",8,31 August 2021,"2021 Animation/Adventure
Rated: 7.5
Directed by: Enrico Casarosa, he created this movie in honor of his time in Genoa italy, and Alberto was his childhood friend's name.""Its a reminder of how friendships should be""Plot
The story revolves around a sea creature, Luca, known as the ""sea monster"", who lives in the sea with his family on the shores of the town of ""Portorosso"". The sea monsters never go to the surface because when they dry they turn into humans. So, Luca is bored with his daily life and always wonders what it's like out there from the things he collects from the boat that goes fishing, but he is forbidden to reach the surface because it's dangerous. One day, he runs into another sea monster who goes to the surface constantly and they become acquainted.Personal opinion
The story focuses on the simple ideas of life, which are friendships, sacrifice, family, responsibility, accepting one another and working hard. In just a very simple animated movie, you can get all that. It also addresses different kids who are scared of lots of things, standing up for themselves, taking risks and other challenges.. The movie is very simple and colorful, a great reflection of the beautiful towns of Italy. Yet I loved the rise of events, the ending, the music takes you right into Italy. It has been a while since I have seen a movie that reminds me of how cartoons were in my childhood.I believe this movie is going to collect quiet enough awards.Luca is a good kid who doesn't want to get in trouble, but he had to ""silenzio bruno""..

288,maztergamer,nice and heartwarming but really nothing special,7,16 July 2021,Luca is a new Pixar film which for some reason is being labeled as a Disney + original even though it's a Pixar film. This movie is pretty par for the course among Pixar films recently. It's going to make you laugh it's going to make you cry and you will have a decently enjoyable experience.I actually didn't have very high expectations because I had kind of heard that it was kind of a mediocre Pixar film but I surprisingly liked it quite a bit. The animation is great (though saying a Pixar movie has good animation is like saying water is wet at this point) though I couldn't help but notice that the fish look less realistic in this then in Finding Nemo. I mean Finding Nemo came out almost 20 years ago why do the fish look less realistic.This movie was actually pretty funny. Legitimately one of the funnier Pixar movies I have seen. Or maybe I just like that the cat is literally named Machiavelli. The story is good. It is obviously heartwarming and I enjoyed the story. I mean I was basically never surprised throughout the entire film it followed all of the story beats that you would expect. But it was still decently enjoyable. One thing that helps this story is that it is fairly high concept. Pixar is really good at doing high concept stories and I feel like they haven't done as much of that in recent years. So in that way this movie's story was refreshing.While this movie is pretty predictable and isn't really anything special it is still a fun movie that will have you entertained throughout.7.5/10.,Luca

Are incredibly likable, Luca, Alberto, and Julia are an amazing group of friends and every moment they were on screen together was so wonderful. The movie I compare this too is My Neighbor Totoro as both movies have simple plots but make them work so well and both have a heart-wrenching finale.

There is family drama, friendship problems, and the fear of showing your true self in a disapproving world.

Directed by the same person behind the Pixar short, La Luna (2011), Enrico Casarosa, this Hayao Miyazaki-inspired masterpiece takes place on an Italian Riviera in the small, fictional town of Portorosso, where two sea monsters, Luca Paguro and Alberto Scorfano, living underwater by the Riviera, who can turn human on dry land, experience an unforgettable summer while trying to hide their sea monster identities, as Portorosso is dedicated to sea monster-hunting. On the way, they meet Genova-student, Giulia Marcovaldo, who comes to Portorosso every summer, who becomes their best friends, because they're Underdogs, and they have to look out for each other. Even though Alberto reveals his sea monster secret out of jealously over their growing relationship, Giulia, and later, the rest of Portorosso and presumably all of the world, come to accept their true identities as sea monsters. In the end, Luca decides to go to school with Giulia after Alberto sells his Vespa in order to get Luca a ticket. On the first half of the end credits, we see Miyazaki-esque drawings of Luca and Alberto, and their families enjoying their new lives in Genova and Portorosso. If you're looking for a Miyazaki-inspired Disney flick, then this film's highly recommended for you. I hope a sequel or a spin-off comes out one day, I would love to see more of Luca and Alberto's adventures. Let's just hope that it doesn't get wound-up off-canon like the.Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2017) TV series, that ruined the entire Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) franchise. Don't forget to check this film and La Luna out, because Enrico's the Italian Miyazaki!",Luca
302,ijaka,mediocre ... Waste of time,1,11 August 2021,I'm sorry pixar.. i love you.. but you can and must do better... Its a sad mediocre movie. This story we have seen a 1000 times already...,Luca
303,ryankfullmer,One of Pixar's best and funniest movie I've seen,9,18 June 2021,Sure this movie isn't what Pixar usually puts out but I think this the most unique out of all of them. The animation is beautiful like a laika animation or old Disney animation with 3D model. The voice Acting is top notch the story is so much fun but it also has heat like any other Pixar movie please if you have Disney+ GO WATCH IT!!!,Luca

bad ending.This is not supposed to be in a Pixar movie, it's worse than Coco, Soul, Up, wall e, monster inc,.....

306,kritikasinghap,Old Pixar movie.,7,22 June 2021,Expected more of a story and meaning from Disney after their recent release. A sweet and small movie for one time watch. Clearly the targeted audience are children and not even teens I guess. Chilled out movie with a classic story. Do watch it with your kids or enjoy!,Luca

I loved the trailer and I'm glad I got to see it finally. I loved how the story brought the characters to life and how it highlighted the importance of family.

311,anniewhitcomb-06675,A beautiful masterpiece 💖,10,2 July 2021,"This animated film is a beautiful masterpiece! It felt like a lovely indie European cartoon but with that perfect Pixar pixie dust of joy. Left me wanting more and to jump through the screen and go on adventures with Luca, Alberto, and Julia.",Luca
312,leopoldfrank-1,Missed Opportunity,4,25 June 2021,"This is a really weird movie. One of the main plot points is that they are sea monsters. I spent the entire movie wondering why the characters had to be sea monsters. Really? What was the point of that? If they had just been normal people the movie would not have been that much different and the makers could have indulged further into their love of Italian culture than they were able to with the pointless sea monster thing.It is obvious that this movie wants to be an Italian Coco but the pointless sea monster thing knocks it off that path before the movie has barely got going. I would have really liked to see a movie more about Italian culture than fricken sea monsters - My Brilliant Friend is one of my favourite series and I have Italian family but this movie only touches on that whilst wasting our time with the whole sea monster thing.Aside from that, it is an incredibly run of the mill story - friendship, yada yada yada, wins out in the end, yada yada yada, people overcome their prejudices, yada yada yada, everyone is left wing in the end, yada yada yada.To conclude, this movie was a bit crap. The animation was good, obviously, it's pixar.Btw, did I mention I hated the sea monster angle?",Luca
313,artistcrazy,Movie for VERY YOUNG children!,1,17 June 2021,This film seemed like it would be on the Disney junior channel which is for toddler aged children. I don't recommend this movie at all! Blah!,Luca
314,vanessakelly99,Out of context,2,30 October 2021,"I'm Italian and I have lived not too far from Porto Rosso. There is no history of sea monsters there, neither anywhere in Italy that I know of. The red head girl with the freckles doesn't look any what Italian. The story is stupid and completely out of context, it has nothing to do with Italian culture.",Luca
315,jhndvd-02301,Alberto bit his lip lol,8,29 June 2021,I like when luca betrays alberto lol. Im so quirky XDDD UwU I have a crush on luca. I dont know anymore but pixar is not disney . Alberto and green beans is my fav ship. Its so cute and i think its canon. I head canon that luca and alberto are going to the lakers tomorrow morning and brown beans.,Luca
316,press-31193,The Fabulous Journey of LUCA,10,29 June 2021,"A Re-VIEW by Maria Elena GutierrezIn Disney and Pixar's LUCA, a shy young sea monster named Luca emerges from the sea to discover that above the waves there exists a world of unexpected wonders. His guides are Alberto, an adventurous sea monster whose cockiness conceals an essential fragility, and Giulia, a spirited human girl with a fascination for stargazing. Banding together as the 'Underdogs,' they compete with the local town bully Ercole to win the coveted Portorosso Cup Race.Directed by Enrico Casarosa and produced by Andrea Warren, LUCA is a heart-warming celebration of friendship. If we look past the apparent simplicity of its themes, however, we find a complexity as deep as the ocean itself.Near the beginning of the film, bored with his life as a goatfish herder, a disillusioned Luca blows a bubble in the water and contemplates his own face reflected in the shimmering sphere. Later, Luca studies his surroundings through the bottom of a glass tumbler. When he uses the glass to frame a gramophone at a distance, immediately the object becomes enchanted. In these scenes - throughout the entire film, in fact - we are invited to see the world, and experience the story, through Luca's eyes.By viewing reality through the limitations of a lens - a bubble, a tumbler, or the lens of cinema itself - we immediately gain a different perspective. Perhaps even a fantastical one. When Luca first emerges from the water and sees the beautiful green landscape of the Italian Riviera, the blue sky, the warm sunshine, the fluffy clouds, the birds - it is a revelation. The upper world is stunningly beautiful and, in sharing Luca's eyes, we also share his sense of awe. Through Luca, we rediscover the magic in the everyday.The film's emphasis on viewpoint is reminiscent of the work of Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. In Studio Ghibli's My Neighbor Totoro, for example, there is a scene in which we see the young girl Mei looking at the world through a hole in a can. There are many such moments in Luca, when we as an audience are invited to rediscover reality by changing the angle from which we look at things. This is what all art does. It invites us to consider the world from a new perspective. In doing so, we are given an opportunity to do what Picasso strived for his whole life - to see through the eyes of a child. Since Enrico Casarosa is a self-professed Miyazaki disciple, it is no surprise that we find references to Miyazaki's work everywhere in LUCA - the use of simple forms and compositions, the discovery of wonder in nature, a perennial fascination with flight. Even the name of the town - Portorosso - brings to mind Miyazaki's film Porco Rosso. However, by bringing his distinctly Italian approach to story, setting and character, Casarosa succeeds in creating his own powerful artistic style.Luca's experience of the upper world is presented in glorious detail. The texture of the stone walls is hyper-real. Close-ups of the sea washing on the shore are uncannily 'realistic.' Vivid colors and atmospheric lighting bring an extraordinary sense of texture, volume and sensuality. You can feel the sensation of walking on pebbles and almost taste the ice-cream being served up in the town's piazza! Seen through Luca's eyes, our familiar world becomes a place of miracles. Everything becomes an adventure.But, this is not just beauty for beauty's sake. Casarosa's careful use of light and color constantly enhances the mood, and deepens our understanding of the characters. The pivotal scene where Luca betrays Alberto takes place before a stunning sunset, with sea and sky blending into a stunning tapestry. The color palette is dominated by hot oranges and reds - the colors of Mars, the Roman god of war - and so perfectly communicates the anger of the confrontation. Later, a night-time scene on the roof of the boys' hideout is barely illuminated by dim coals, adding to the profound melancholy of the moment.Such moments are the result of confident creative choices, and reveal the complexity hidden inside the film's deceptive simplicity. By creating a series of powerful emotional resonances, they let us not only share these characters' experiences, but also look into their souls.Just as powerful is the sense of place. From the moment when we first spy the lush green coastal slopes of Liguria, there is no doubt we are in Italy. Every detail, every flourish is exactly right, from the shape of Portorosso's quaint piazza to the way the light shines through the clothes hanging on the washing lines. The Italian vibe pervades the whole film, from locations to language, to the evocative soundtrack featuring popular songs from the 1950s and operatic arias such as Puccini's O Mio Babbino Caro. The iconic Vespa holds center stage as an object of desire - perhaps even a divine presence - while the photograph jammed between the handlebars of Alberto's motorcycle is a portrait of Marcello Mastroianni, Italy's most famous actor of the period.The Mastroianni photograph is just one of many movie references scattered throughout the film, part of a meta-language used by Casarosa to celebrate cinema in all its forms. The name of the fishing boat in the opening sequence is Gelsomina, which also happens to be the name of the protagonist in Federico Fellini's La Strada, a delicate film about self-discovery set against the backdrop of rural Italy. The walls of Portorosso are adorned with posters paying homage to the cinema of the 1950s. Fellini's La Strada makes another appearance here, as does William Wyler's Roman Holiday - famous for its shots of Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck speeding through Rome on a Vespa - and Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, based on the science fiction novel by Jules Verne and presenting a highly romanticized vision of the underwater world.This is the Italy remembered by the post-war generation as a land where imagination and innocence still lingered, in defiance of the inexorable advance of modernity. The march of progress is symbolized not only by the Vespa, but also by the motor boats which the humans have begun to favor, and also by the train that carries Luca away at the end of the film.Adhering to a cinematic trope that evokes classic farewell scenes from a hundred different movies, the train departure scene delivers what is undoubtedly the emotional climax of the film. Here is the moment when Luca fulfils his dream and sets off with Giulia on his way to school, when he says goodbye to his best friend, and Alberto in his turn accepts that he must let Luca go. It is intensely sad, but at the same time uplifting. Before our eyes, we see the two boys coming of age and learning what love truly means. When Luca looks across the ocean and sees a ray of light illuminating the island where he and Alberto had so many adventures, he knows he is leaving his childhood behind. The moment is bittersweet, yet filled with hope, and surely inspired by Enrico Casarosa's own youthful journey across the ocean from Italy to study animation in the United States.Anyone who has ever left someone or something behind to follow their dreams will empathize with Luca as he boards that train. Luca's own journey is driven by a thirst for knowledge, and an insatiable curiosity about the cosmos - an inner fire whose flames are fanned by the equally enthusiastic Giulia. Like every Italian child before her, Giulia has no doubt learned the lines from Canto 26 of Dante's Inferno, spoken by Ulysses as he urges his crew to voyage with him into the unknown: ""You were not made to live for brutish ignorance, but to pursue virtue and knowledge. Consider your humanity."" The lines might have been written for Luca himself.Earlier in the film, we see Luca's secret desires encapsulated in a literal dream, one of several fantasy sequences that employ an exaggerated visual language to catapult the audience into the boy's imagination. In this dream, a Leonardo da Vinci flying machine carries Luca and Giulia to Rome, where they fly over the Coliseum. Art, science and history collide in this scholarly flight of fancy, and literature makes its appearance, too, when they spot the wooden boy Pinocchio strolling below them. References to Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio are pervasive in this film.Giulia has a small Pinocchio sculpture in her bedroom. The Pinocchio-inspired song Il Gatto e la Volpe by Edoardo Bennato plays on the soundtrack during a montage of the two boys cementing their friendship on the island. When Luca takes his first steps on dry land, his clumsiness evokes the awkward stumblings of the stringless puppet in Disney's 1940 animated feature. When Luca dreams of going to school, is he not really dreaming about becoming a real boy, just like Pinocchio? Surely he is.In leaving behind his underwater home, Luca ultimately comes full circle, just like any hero following the classic journey outlined by Joseph Campbell. As the train leaves the station, the rain causes both Luca and Alberto to transform from human back into their original sea monster forms. We have seen this metamorphosis many times already in the film- a subtle and expressive feat of technical animation, by the way - but only now do we recognizethat the transformation does not represent the otherness that so many of the film's characters fear. Rather, it represents unity. Luca is neither human nor sea monster. He is both. He is, simply, Luca.And so, in that moment, we are returned to the beginning of the film, by way of a framing device we did not even notice was there, but which is evident now as we recall the opening shots of LUCA. In a clear visual nod to Casarosa's short film La Luna, these show the fishing boat Gelsomina journeying
through moonlit waves. All is dark and mysterious, with nothing to differentiate between sky and sea. The surroundings are primordial. We are in the realm of fable.",Luca

323,jcmark-66725,"Pretty average, but interestingly stylized film",5,28 June 2021,"Disney rehashes pretty obvious story elements from its other oceanic based films The Little Mermaid and Moana as well as The Fox & The Hound; there just isn't much novelty to the story. While I love the actors involved (Jack Dylan Grazer really shines as one of Disney's most seamlessly funny comic relief characters), they did a much worse job than a film like Coco of blending languages in a way that is both appealing and purposeful, especially with the choice of American actors.While the film has some fun Studio Ghibli vibes in the style, it takes a half-baked approach to doing a more foreign style film because they still want to appeal heavily to their U. S. base audience. I love the director's work in this project, especially as the one whose personal life heavily influenced the interesting summer friendship dynamic. The design of the movie is pretty great, but the overly simple plot and overtly familiar story trends make it more narrowly appealing to a much younger audience than it could have been. It carries the extraordinarily dumbed down adult trope to a level I haven't seen since 90s Nickelodeon. While the aim seems to be to promote a theme of nondiscriminatory inclusivity, the simplistic nature of the film mostly serves to dampen a lot of credibility to the motivations of its characters.I have read comments from people elsewhere that they were unsure of the film's quality within the first 10 minutes, but soon came around to really enjoying it. However, the awkward and rushed start can definitely serve as an off-putting exposition that doesn't draw the viewer into the story.",Luca

326,ziprsedi,This movie has 0 qualities of a Pixar film,1,9 July 2021,It is clear Disney has overstepped their boundaries for this film. It very much feels like a cutesy cash cow generic kitschy Disney film (not old school disney - think the newer live action remakes that were horrible). There are no qualities whatsoever of a classic Pixar film. The story is a rewrite of the Little Mermaid. Characters and animation are one-dimensional and bland. This sort of felt like a rough draft and I imagine Disney just rushed it out the door to increase Disney+ subscriptions. Thankfully I don't think we have seen the downfall of Pixar yet because Soul from last year was outstanding and Onward was very original and funny though it wasn't on par with Up / Toy Story / Finding Nemo etcDISNEY please stop telling Pixar what to do and let them have their creative freedom. Didn't you learn that with the first Toy Story???,Luca

329,alammuntasir,The animation is stellar as always. The cast is okay.,8,21 June 2021,"LUCA: MOVIE REVIEWLuca is an animated movie by Pixar Studios under Disney.The animation is stellar as always. The cast is okay.The story is about some sea monsters who can turn to humans when not in contact with water. Among them Luca and Alberto are two friends. Luca is scared of the human world but Alberto isn't. But both have the same dream. To go to different places in the world with a Vespa.(Vespa are one of the best scooter makers in the world and they are one of the originals). But they didn't have the money. So they went to the human world where they met Giulia. And the story continues on how they become friends and win the competition.Pixar makes the best animated movies in the world. The level of detail and sense is Bellissimo. Though this is an italian movie. The cast struggled in italian accent. One time they were speaking in italian accent and other time they were in American accent. But the story is awesome. It proves that you shouldn't be scared of what you are be proud of yourself. It also heavily focuses on the value of friendship and sacrifices which is a common theme for Pixar movies. It's not as good as the previous Pixar movie Soul. But definitely a good movie. In fact its am awesome movie. It's a must watch for everybody.Personal rating: 8.5/10

335,JoeyLeblanc85,it's just okay... and that's the problem,6,18 June 2021,"It's a nice movie with an interesting premise, but it doesn't go deeper than that. The story is simple, and it could've been handled beautifully if only they didn't spent most of the screen time stabilizing this underwater world and the boys friendship, which is beautiful, but sometimes takes completely the focus of the story, that doesn't develop in any way. I wan't to say that the movie felt flat by the second act... but the movie doesn't feel like having more than one act at all, it seems like just a long ''short story''. There is absolutely no character development in any character of the movie, really, Giulia's father is the one who changed the most by the end of the movie, but that didn't matter because they don't manage to show us HOW or WHY, instead they keep showing us how Italian kids like soccer, pasta, watermelon and ice cream. There is no moment of tension or suspense in any part of it, and every fight in the movie seems unimportant as they manage to get the two characters forgiving each other almost immediately. There was so much potential to a great climax, that never happened, it could never happen with a villain like that, he is totally mishandled and just pathetic (not in a good way) and you just know from the moment you put your eyes on him that he won't be threatening at all. It's a nice movie, the real sad thing about it is that it could have been so much better . 6.5/10.",Luca

338,hadzsocial,Great movie for kids on collaboration and overcoming differences,10,31 August 2021,"I absolutely enjoyed this film. It's about a beautiful friendship between kids from different worlds. And whether this was intentional or not, it is also about how ""generational hatred"" towards groups are quite meaningless and how new generations can bridge age-old divide, share common ground and succeed together. The people were hell-bent on catching the sea-monsters, but not one of them were actually victims of the monsters. You could also see that there were photos and sculptures of sea monsters being killed by humans, representing historical accounts. Why were they killing sea monsters? It was unclear. And when you think about world history, why did any one group kill another? From a modern-day POV, it all seems so absurd.The villain, Ercole Visconti, represents ""old institutions"" that have been consumed by arrogance and narcissism, and bully those who do not fit in or refuse to ""bow down"" to his ""superiority"". The way he treated his friends or allies was abysmal--his success was hinged upon THEIR efforts, but throughout the movie, he takes credit for it as if he was the lone winner. And if they failed, he would hurt them. Can't help but think of that in the context of global politics.At its simplest, this movie is a great learning for kids on how to collaborate in a team and overcome differences.Pixar really does an amazing job with incorporating complex adult topics into their stories, like what they did with Up and Inside Out.",Luca

I realize it's a movie for kids and that Disney/Pixar have been doing this for years, but it's a very basic and very predictable tale. Most characters are quite one dimensional or only scratch the surface of an actual personality, flipping between emotions at incredible speed.The drawings during the credits were all little stories that could have made this a more interesting movie. Now it feels like a stretched out Pixar short.(I did watch this shortly after seeing Raya, so maybe I was expecting to much).",Luca
344,conan-42640,Just because they are different doesn't mean they are bad,9,19 July 2021,"I really like its message from the movie. It can relate to the problems of racism or LGBTQ today. Since the start of the movie, it tried to show how they don't understand each other. Both sea monsters and human calls each other as 'monster' due to just considering that other one lives differently. However, for the monster seas side, it is more difficult. They had to be the defenders who protect themselves by being not dare going above the sea surface or expose their identity while human is living freely and be the attacker. Luca is one of all sea monsters who was taught to behave surreptitiosly. However, Alberto is different. He exposed and found the way out to live above the surface. Moreover, I also like Julia and her father. They are the people living out there and tried to kill the sea monsters because they just thought that they are dangers, but after they know Luca and Alberto real identities, they found out that they are okay and good ones. Just like in our society, being other nationalities, believe in other gods, or love in different ways doesn't mean that they deserve to be deprived since we can live together and respect to ethics.For the scene I like, it is when they shock me. When Alberto seemed to be jealous of Luca talking and enjoying too much with Julia and tended to leave him, Alberto decided to expose everything. I was like very shock and say 'ohhh don't do that!', but he really did that althrough Luca was trying to stop him. Moreover, Luca, instead, pointed at Alberto and pretended to be shocked seeing a sea monsters even through that is also what you are, and that could make him die. However, I understand that since it is how they can survive at that moment.I really like the ending too. How they expose sea monster existance was so fast so that I didn't think that they would accept that, but it is what happen in the real world. The exposition can come in the time you won't be prepared, but if you respect others, it would be fine. And also when they show out that not just the kids and Luca's family are sea monsters, but two grandmas as well. I was like WOW.It ends in bittersweet way. Eventually, Alberto decided to give up his dream being with Luca and exploring the world with Vespa by letting Luca to go outside, to go where he was interested. Anyway, he deserves to have nice new father.PS. Thanks and I like Italian more after watching this. The language is captivating more than I thought. Oh. Not to mention that their voice actors' accent is so Italian as well. I have a nice Italian teacher and they sound like him!PS.2. In my opinion, Alberto's feeling can develop to be love to Luca. Like, I really love that sentence and I am glad knowing that I am not alone notice this ""My friend smells amazing"" Wow. Anyway, Luca may not have any feeling towards him right now since his passion is more focused.",Luca

At the end I cried simply because it was so sweet. If you have a heart at all you will love this. The animation and screenplay is fantastic, funny and imaginative.

354,llydlester-16065,Luca (2021 film) Review,9,26 September 2021,"Pixar's Luca unfolds like an animated and magnetic adult fantasy with lots of farce, fun and joy, heartwarming and inescapable family consequences, there is no doubt that the temptation of visual effects, whether humorous or sub-textual, is dazzling. Luca is a film imbued with a sentimental affection for the Italian environment and its quaint, bountiful and breathless villages scattered around its shores, as Pixar Animation Studios does so well, the added angst of improving its ability to achieve data while remaining faithful and enjoying the ability of a united family is a fantastic and welcome storyline and
Pixar's fairy tale mud sun whirlwind, reverberating sound recording and the sweet lessons of acceptance distinction take a short passport. It wouldn't be Pixar's best or riskiest film to date, however, Luca is one of the few who thinks he's not afraid to be something else. Luca is the smallest movie created by Pixar, however, he's arguably one of the best in the studio. Pixar's Luca is fun, refreshing, and well-animated. Luca is a beautiful illustration of Italy, even animated! The script isn't powerful enough or the stakes high enough, but a film that is still smart, however, could be much higher. One of the most breathtaking movies Pixar has ever created. Each character has his or her own life, and it's not just a random character who is there to help Luca. I could still watch it and it excites me despite this study, right? There is food and parfaits, fountains and a bicycle, ugly mustaches and even the starry sky. I found myself on the verge of tears in the last moments of this excellent and disarming film.",Luca

356,sidneyfmn,An amazing movie with a simple story and deep meaning,10,20 July 2021,"I've been in love with Pixar since Toy Story. All Pixar movies always bring generally simple stories and deep messages. The movie in question manages to do this in a unique and very exciting way.I wanted to use this space to leave here some details that I realized from the story.First of all, Luca and Alberto lived in their bubbles. Luca is on the ocean and Alberto is on the island. Alberto pierced Luca's bubble when he brought him to the surface. Luca broke Alberto's bubble when he made him lose his fear of not being accepted by society.Second, if you understand how long Alberto was alone on that island, you will understand why he was jealous of the first company that appeared to him after several years of solitude. On the wall on his island, there were 359 scratches (pause the video and tell yourself), so he was alone for 1 year, right? Wrong. He said he stopped counting after a while, so he had been alone for several years. Now it's clear why he wanted Luca to stay.Third and finally, why did he sell the Vespa? The story of the film boils down to Alberto and Luca's search for Vespa, and when they finally do, why did Alberto sell? He had already managed to achieve what he wanted. A friendship, a best friend, a father. In the first part of the film, when the two meet, Alberto has a hard time convincing Luca to stay on the surface. Luca was more ambitious than Alberto and wanted more. Since Alberto already had what he wanted, he did what a father would do, gave a part of his dream so that Luca could get his.This movie will win the Oscar, and it goes for the beautiful messages contained in it. Watch this movie, it's worth it, and don't forget a handkerchief.",Luca

It has beautiful animation, solid voice work, and a decent story, all set upon what seems to be a fictional Cinque Terre.While I really enjoyed this film, I don't think it's close to some of Pixar's best. This and Soul both felt like Pixar executives had a meeting and said ""we need to have each of our films explore different cultures after Coco did so well."" This and Soul both felt like shells of what Coco was. There isn't much about this film that feels distinctly Italian, unlike Coco, which felt Mexican to its core, it's conflict was distinctly Mexican (music and family), characters and the setting (Dia de los muertos). In contrast Luca's conflict involves a race and eating... pasta? Hm. I think I just am expecting a lot from Pixar after seeing Coco.Enjoyable movie, light 7.",Luca
366,abigailsomberg,Pixar at its simplest!,1,18 June 2021,This film had lots of potential however I think it was waisted on the final product. The director is a first time director and I don't think he was ready for a full length feature film. It's definitely one of the shorter and less interesting Pixar films.,Luca
367,josepaulo-72710,"A simple, funny and touching movie.",8,18 June 2021,"Luca is the new pixar movie directed by Enrico Casarosa. This movie has a running time of 95 minutes, being one of the pixar's shortest feautures. Luca is a beautifully animated movie with a lot of inluence either from ghibli studios and from italian folklore.The majority of the characters are really well done and feel very real. Luca, Alberto, Giulia, and luca's and giulia's parents are almost flawless and touching characters. The biggest downpoint regarding the characters is probably the enenmy, Ercole, who feels very generic and cringy.The story is great and the character arcs are really interesting. There are many beautiful moments. The voice acting, the animation style and the score all combine to help achieving a trully great way of storytelling. I have some issues regarding this topic thought. For instants when Luca's fathers were trying to find their son by ''yeeting'' some random kids into the fountain. If any of those kids happened to actually be Luca everyone would see that he was a water monster.Overall I very much enjoyed this piece of art, it wasn't a masterpiece, definetly not top tier pixar movie's, but was really great and entertaining.(76/100)",Luca

374,burntoutboy,Not Pixar's best but still good,7,20 June 2021,"Luca is a good film. It has charm, good story, good characters and the animation as always is brilliant. However, when comparing it to the recent original stories that Pixar have done (Soul & Onward), Luca just doesn't quite compete on the same levels as those two. What I found quite surprising is the lack of humor in Luca. Yes, there were a couple of funny moments, but compared to others there was barely any humor. Still definitely worth the watch though for its coming of age story, the music and animation.",Luca

The characters were adorable, and I actually teared up at the end (I guess it isn't a pixar movie if you don't lol). It gave me much needed Studio Ghibli vibes. Don't go in expecting an intense conflict, it's more based on the characters and their relationships, but I loved it regardless.

The animation was actually pretty cheap and low quality compared to more recent Pixar films (not sure if intentional?). Anyways, I couldn't find much to like about this film.

380,patriciajohnson-22048,Probably one of my least favorite Pixar movies,5,18 June 2021,"Giving this movie a 5 star rating is me being nice. It wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly didn't match up to other Pixar films and their execution. As other reviews have mentioned, there are bold colors utilized, and some visuals of the village are beautiful, but that's all what this movie has going for it. It was a very simple movie with no plot, and it's kind of scattered. I knew the moment Alberto spoke about his father that he was actually abandoned (bc that's how most of these movies go). I don't know, the movie didn't even feel emotional, and just fell kind of flat. The ending especially was very abrupt, and was definitely rushed (so everyone discovers that they boys are sea monsters, but it's perfectly fine bc they won a race? Okaaaaaaay?) This movie doesn't deserve a 1 star, but definitely not a high rating. Anyways, definitely one of my least favorite Pixar films (and I've loved/enjoyed about 95% of them).",Luca

Luca makes a pretty good protagonist. This isn't some random cartoon from Pixar that disappoints, it's their usual magic at work again.Watched this as soon as possible from the release time. Totally worth it. And the characters are not perfect, they have emotional disputes, relationships and faults. It was amazing seeing such a simple story come to life with so much pop, and all the scenes of this movie were so pretty!I very much recommend this movie for another 90 minutes of classic Pixar fun. Ignore any ratings below 6.",Luca

I really don't know how this film was ever the best idea they had.Widower tries to fly his house to an exotic waterfall.Toys try to find their way home after being donated.A fish tries to find his son that went missing.And now... a mermaid kid want's a Vespa?Anyway, this was a real snooze fest.

It may not be groundbreaking or revolutionary for its genre, but it is still highly enjoyable. The story is interesting enough to make one care about what will happen next, even though one should not expect events that are outside of Pixar's comfort zone.I did not cry at several highly liked movies of Pixar (e.g., Coco, Inside Out) and, fair enough, I did not cry at this movie either. However, I had a lump in my throat during the emotional scenes of Luca. For me, it is one of the more enjoyable Pixar movies, but I guess it is just a matter of personal taste in the end. So, please watch it yourself, and then decide whether the abundance of 1-star reviews is justfied! :)P. S. I really like the Roman Holiday references in this movie! Maybe Luca shares some similarities with Elio? ;)",Luca

402,william101,Superb,10,14 August 2021,"Better than expected. The ending was surprisingly powerful and moving. There were a lot of themes about community in this movie, especially about reaching out to those who are stuck on their own personal ""island."" Coming out of 2020, this was a nice message to hear. The dynamic between the three friends was refreshingly realistic. All three of them had very unique character arcs and goals, and the filmmakers did a really good job making those individual stories flow together.",Luca
403,Zac_124,Really Enjoyable,8,28 June 2021,"This may just be me but this felt a lot like a Ghibli movie. Very little happened and it had very low stakes but it was still really enjoyable throughout. The whole third act was amazing with many memorable scenes and the animation was fantastic. The characters are all likeable and are all well written.The film's biggest issues for me are the comedy and one particular plot point. I found many jokes to fall flat. Apart from the stuff with the cat. The cat was hilarious. I also didn't like the plot point with the parents where they were trying to find Luca by chucking water on him and exposing that he is a sea monster in front of everyone in the town... the town that is famous for hunting down sea monsters. However, the rest of the film is really strong so you can easily ignore it.This bit isn't really a bad thing about the movie as it wouldn't really change much about the film but I wish we saw more scenes were Luca was living underwater. As the world seemed really interesting.Overall, the movie was great with a few problems but the strengths FAR outweigh the negatives in my opinion.",Luca
404,MovFan19,Beautiful. Touching. Great for the whole family,10,27 July 2021,"It's a while since an animation like this has been made. Most of the modern animations are tiring, noisy and feel like kicking your brain. This one is lovely, both visually and story-wise. Highly recommended.",Luca

407,Stevie_Deee,Pixar nails Italian stereotypes...,6,20 June 2021,"As someone who was born in Italy and has lived in Mexico, I was hoping Luca would be to Italy what Coco was to Mexico. Coco nailed the Mexican culture in a vibrant, magical and respectful way and it was loved there. Luca brought out tired Italian stereotypes that weren't flattering. Wish someone would explain to me why none of the title characters are of Italian background. And the exclamations that come out of their mouths - ""Santa Gorgonzola"" (Saint Gorgonzola), really???This wasn't a bad movie, but it left me grinding my teeth throughout at the portrayal. Sad to say that this was the first Pixar movie that has let me down.",Luca
408,roblloyds,A beautiful small scale Pixar movie,9,19 June 2021,"Saying this right up front, I really, really liked Luca. Watching it reminded me of going to Iona in the summer and meeting with one of my best friends I only ever really saw on that island. And the movie really hit a sweet spot for me with this. As most Pixar movies do, the friendship between the two main characters felt so genuine and real. Like a strong older and younger brother dynamic. I was a mess by the end.The story is quite straightforward and simple, which I liked. Especially after Soul, which was more complicated than I think it needed to be. Seems the critical consensus out there for Luca so far is that the story is rather generic, but I loved the slower pace and lower stakes. The movie is also absolutely gorgeous, which goes without saying for Pixar, but there were truly moments where I was completely absorbed in looking at tiny details like skin textures on Lucas nose or sea foam on the ocean or the way the town is laid out. You can tell how warm it is.There were also sequences in the movie I can say I've never seen before in a movie. Saturn surfing on the sea, Vespa riding alongside fish swimming in outer space. It felt so original and went in some directions I would never have expected.Now the worst I can say about the movie is I didn't really like Luca's parents that much. I felt like the mum was incredibly controlling, and Marlin from Finding Nemo is like that too, but it feels like he at least knows on some level he has to let his son go sometime. Luca's mum is on the extreme end of keeping her son safe, to the point where it just felt kinda cruel. And I don't think she's fleshed out enough where it's clear why she goes to such lengths to ""protect"" Luca. It just feels surface level.To go back to Marlin for a moment, he had multiple reasons to protect Nemo, not just because he cared for him, but because he made a promise to his partner. Luca's mother just explicitly says ""we don't go up there, got it?"" and thats that. Luca's dad I couldn't really tell what his character was, he's a bit of a bumbler. A little eccentric, but I didn't feel like he had much of a character. He was just kind of there. The parents and their scenes searching for Luca were my least favourite aspects of the movie.In Empires review of Luca, the reviewer mentions their favourite character in the movie is weird Uncle Ugo, an anglerfish sea monster played by Sacha Baron Cohen who (and I'm just guessing here) seemed like they ad-libbed their lines. I'm not really a fan of most uses of ad-libbed material in animated movies, I feel like it takes me out of the scene a little and it certainly did here. The same thing happened when Andy Samberg voiced a Skeksis in the Dark Crystal TV show. It just became Andy Samberg riffing.I guess it really just boils down to whether you find it funny or not. I like when its a Robin Williams playing the Genie or James Woods as Hades cause I feel like it fits better in the world? Sacha Baron Cohen feels like he was brought on to do the the voice just cause its SBC. It just doesn't feel like that style of humour fits in with the rest of the movie unless the whole movie has that style of humour? But thats just how I felt during it. It was taking me out of the movie a little. I was like, ""Ah, theres Sacha Baron Cohen"".But once the movie got onto dry land and away from the parents and Uncle Ugo it got so much better! And the soundtrack, my god! I loved the soundtrack in Soul, but I thought the music in this added so much to the scenes. The ending hit so much more from the score at the end.So ultimately, this whole review is to say I really liked Luca, way more than I was expecting to and it felt good to reaffirm (once again) how much I love Pixar films. Not all Pixar films hit, but I think this one does and it's worth a watch. I wish I saw it in a huge cinema.",Luca

411,gaddotgal,This is just a longer version of a sequence within cars 2,1,18 June 2021,This is one of the worst Pixar movies right next to cars 2. Ironically this film strongly mirrors cars 2 made about 10 years ago. The movie only lengthens a sequence in cars 2 where the main character and his friend visit portacorsa Italy in order to compete in a race. WAYYY TO SIMILAR TO THE WHOLE PLOT OF THIS FILM! I don't know why they thought this movie would be a good idea? Maybe it will appeal to very young kids because of its bright colors and simple story? I don't recommend it anyone over the age of 12 honestly .,Luca

Having been there several times, I can assure that everything is spot on.Having said that, I found the story unconvincing and predictable. The most interesting character (the antagonist, Ercole) is not described in depth; devoting more time to him, his two buddies and their motives could have made the movie better. The same could have been done for Alberto and the relationship with Luca. Where does Alberto come from? For most of the movie, scene after scene, the focus is the two protagonists trying to escape water not to be discovered and this gets boring very soon. On the other hand very little time is devoted to the final competition itself. The last part seems rushed and leaves you underwhelmed. The concept itself of these sea creatures becoming humans didn't impress me.Overall the movie has great animation skills, amazing artistic qualities but sadly a poor story.",Luca
426,StefAwnss,Boring and Predictable,6,21 June 2021,"Pros:
Enjoyable period film. Picturesque scenery and animation. Great attention to detail, especially with how the water affects the sea ""monsters"". Great music. Funny ""bad guy""Cons:
The movie didn't have many memorable moments. It tries too hard to be Italian (stereotypes etc) and didn't seem authentic. The characters were not likeable or relatable. The animation and facial composition was not very Pixar-esque and looked like a foreign animation studio production. The movie wasn't funny or fun and the post credits scene was just dull and disappointing. Overall, not one of my favourites. I won't watch it again in a hurry.",Luca

441,denhom,Pixar,8,18 June 2021,"Having watched the trailer, I was even alarmed that the characters were not visually attractive and could come out nondescript, and the work would be a favorite studio at the level of a ""car"" BUT this full-length film is like a fresh sip of mojito, vigorously fresh and most importantly familiar themes in a sweet interpretation.",Luca
442,BillGinWeHo,"Spongebob - 1, Disney - 0",3,26 August 2021,"You would think with the immense success of Nickelodeon's Spongebob, and the relationship between Patrick and Spongebob, that Disney would have the guts to allow two boys to stick together.But no.So instead of a movie that could have had an important message for kids, Disney caves and runs the usual boy chasing girl formula.There's a scene in the movie where the two boys ride down a ramp and crash into the sea. That's what Disney did to this film.As disappointing as the movie's plot is, the animation while flatter than many current 3D animation films, the palette is colorful and well saturated. There are also some early humorous moments with the human/fish shtick.Overall, the movie should certainly be entertaining if you haven't reached puberty yet, but if you're older keep in mind that the setting is 1941 not 2021.",Luca

447,dopey-kun,Amazing film with a disappointing third act.,8,22 June 2021,"This film was so refreshing! I love how simple and fun the movie was. Just a story about two friends who want a Vespa. The leads were really likeable and charming. I really loved how fun Giulia's character was, and Alberto's voice actor really surprised me with how well he did the emotional moments. The pacing, for the most part, was really good.I love simple slice of life stories. Unfortunately, Luca wasn't able to completely hit it out of the park. Without spoiling anything, the third act is kind of anticlimactic, and all logic just goes out of the window. Also, I feel like they need a feature length film to really do Luca's character arc properly. It just feels half-assed here. Or they could have handled it differently.It is sad that a movie that did so many things right could end up with such a disappointing third act. Personally, it didn't ruin the experience for me. But with how good the rest of the movie was, I really wished the ending was better.",Luca

451,juliaeckelkamp,So you fell in love with a monster,9,24 June 2021,"Luca is a gorgeous and entrancing film, but it's the subtext that's truly beautiful and groundbreaking because this movie is gay as hell. It touches on everything from the gay experience to the trans and gender fluid experience to pansexual/bisexuality. There's also some allusions to conversion therapy, closeting oneself, and queer codeswitching. AND it also teaches good allyship through the character of Guilliana and has differently abled representation through her father. Show this to your kids so they can see that love and acceptance is the most important thing!",Luca
452,dabaldere,The best from Pixar in a while,10,10 July 2021,"Luca will undoubtedly go down in history alongside greats like Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and Coco. The charming story was entertaining for my whole family and many elements touched my heart. The story, setting, and characters are all grounded and it is easy to make connections between the movie and real life. This film perfectly captures an evolving family dynamic and is much more memorable than some other recent Pixar projects. All of that combined with stunning visuals the likes we have never seen before create an incredible, wholesome experience that will be enjoyed for years to come.",Luca

At the end of this movie you feel like you have just wasted two hours of your life. My kids got bored and left the room after 45 minutes.",Luca

462,benibonco,Good movie but...,7,24 June 2021,"A beautiful animation but there is a serious problem, this is that the film does not present any conflict, some would say that the conflict is that luca's parents do not let him come to the surface so they are going to send him to the bottom of the sea, but in the Another scene luca is on the surface without problems, others would say that it is that the town does not accept sea monsters but after 90% of the film where they are hiding that they are sea monsters and in the end it is discovered that the 2 protagonists are sea monsters the town accepts it without more but in the town it was noticed that they tried to hunt marine monsters for decades.",Luca

464,danielecarlesso,"Classic characters, classic story, great animation. In other words, Pixar.",8,27 June 2021,"It is Pixar, and you cannot expect anything else than an enjoyable movie. Although I did not find memorable and heart-warming as other titles (e.g., Wall-E, Nemo, or Toy Story), it is a fun watch with family or friends. It's Luca!Jokes aside, I find that Pixar did not want to risk it and went into a safe zone. All characters are clearly defined and there's no room for ground-breaking plot twists. You know who's the good guy, who's the bad one and who's gonna experience the classical change-of-mind at the end. But IMHO none of that is a problem. The formula is the same as always, but it works well and there's no need to change it. The story is sweet and the characters cute. I am from Italy, and I loved to see some part of my own culture being represented on the big screen (yes, even the stereotypes!).The visuals are spectacular, as we can reasonably expect, even better than those from Souls. The photography of the movie depicts the Italian atmosphere as well.To finish, I do not think Luca is in Pixar's top three, or even top five, and most likely will not be remembered as other classics. However, it is a movie that I would recommend to anyone who's keen for a fun and easy watch.So if you are on the fence for Luca, do yourself a favour and repeat with me: 'Shut up Bruno!"" and go watch the movie.",Luca
465,timidit-62503,Good film with a good message - for any age group,8,5 July 2021,"The film is typical Pixar - suitable for any age group, because probably everyone will see a different message in it according to their personal development. And that is a good thing. Simplified, it's ""only"" about friendship, and the further you go into the complex interpretations, the easier it is to recognize the numerous metaphors, the dilemma of social exclusion, some even see an allusion to the LGBT community.Despite all the discussion, the film is one thing in particular: emotional. You feel for the characters because they were lovingly and thoughtfully created.Definitely recommended for children, because important values are conveyed, and for everyone else, because it is such an "" apparent"" children's film, which in the end is nevertheless more than just superficial entertainment.",Luca

It may help that I have a 10 year old Nephew called Luca who has made us watch the movie at least a hundred times (so far) because he absolutely loves the movie. But it's quickly become one of my favourite Pixar movies. A simple story about friendship, adventure, love and acceptance. The movie made me smile because of it's innocence.

In my humble opinion is also better than of ""Soul""",8,22 June 2021,"An animated film that enhances Italians and their traditions (I currently live in Italy, since 1991. I can consider an Italian myself). The typical ""italian-stereotypes"" are represented in a non-derogatory way, but as a strong value of this Country. This is a film designed for an international audience, but it was made by an Italian director, who chose the region where he was born and raised as the place. The Ligurian Riviera in the 50's-60's.Luca has a simple plot and carries a valid moral message about what diversity is. All is condensed with a flamboyant cinematography and songs that are still part of the ""folkloric"" panorama of the ""Bel Paese.""It didn't get a release for the theatres and that's a pity.",Luca

483,HallowLumos,Luca: Italian Fantasy for Sake of Beauty.,8,19 June 2021,"The best way to describe Luca is a ""post-card movie"", that's because Luca is nothing but an exercise of beauty very well executed. The bucolic italian aesthetic of the 60's gives this movie a very distinct tone and one can only fall in love with it. Even by having in it some fantasy elements, Luca is a human story. In its core, it is a summer vacation movie. An old memory of anyone's childhood of a summer vacation that becomes the escapism of an ordinary life.Luca shines by being simply that and it fails when it tries to become something more profound. When the movie tries to go beyond the Italian post-card, it shows us how shallow it really is. In this moment, Luca becomes Little Mermaid 2.0 with bad narrative. All the sea monsters' arc and the climax of the movie fails by trying to have a social commentary that simply does not belong in this movie. If Luca had kept being a post-card movie through its entirety it would have been a Studio Ghibli like movie, but by trying to be smarter that it really is, it fails at it.",Luca

As an adult it was something I will only watch once unless I have a child in the house, but wasn't totally painful to view (like some kids shows are).Also, this presentation is on Disney+ since IMDb seems to only advertise it as a purchase on Amazon. Don't know why they don't include that little fact but if you have Disney+, you probably already knew.",Luca
486,mrtouchedme,Not the worst movie ever...but...,3,19 June 2021,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely the worst Pixar movie. I don't understand all the raving, glowing reviews. This movie was slow, boring and super predictable with some Italian and pasta thrown in to make it seem different. Pixar doesn't usually miss, but first time for everything, I guess. Hope this low quality of writing and story aren't what we should expect from Pixar in the future. Do better.",Luca

488,anodette,As a Pixar Film? 10/10,10,24 June 2021,"There was once a time when being critical of Pixar was heretical against the film gods, but in recent years, Pixar's quality has been very inconsistent. There was a point when Pixar was poked fun at for making nothing but belated sequels to their older, more successful movies (Incredibles, Nemo, Toy Story, Cars, Monsters), and in recent years, it's been noted by some that while the animation has improved exponentially, the heart of what made a Pixar movie a was missing. This isn't to say Pixar hasn't had a few gems in recent years, Coco being incredibly charming with good music, and Onward being an underrated film in my opinion, but that doesn't remove the sour taste of The Good Dinosaur's boring story, Soul's alienating concepts, or Toy Story 4's not needing to exist. Even Disney has been limited when it comes to good animated features recently. This year alone had the abysmal Raya and the Last Dragon which was almost unwatchable. Needless to say, my expectations for Luca weren't at an all
-time high, nor were they below the point of expecting potential greatness.I was honestly baffled by how charming this movie was. We're ushered into this world with classical Italian music as were introduced to the world where sea monsters not only exist, but they're also able to turn into what appear to be humans when out of water. The concept is non-too-original, but neither was Toy Story. A great film doesn't need the intense world building of Monsters Inc. (my once-favorite Pixar film until Luca) or Soul when it has the rich character that this story has. Luca and his friendship with Alberto and Giulia is something that anyone can relate to, and the coming of age in a glorious summer where romance and drama have yet to enter the picture take an adult viewer back to a time where they had summers that were seemingly never-ending.The film is not flawless, necessarily. The stakes seem relatively low compared to something like Soul, where we see a man fighting against the forces of the afterlife after dying right before he was able to live out his dream as a middle-aged man (great for kids right?), with a villain who seems like more of an annoyance than a threat, but for a movie that is more about enjoying a summer and trying to find yourself and not be what everyone expects from you, the villain needn't be too much of a threat.In terms of animation, this is peak Pixar, with the surroundings and sets not being hyper realistic. A recent Pixar trend is to have photo realism in everything but it's characters. This film, thankfully, makes sure we know it's an animated feature. And boy, is it pretty.Our main heroes are adorable and relatable, with Luca wanting to find himself, Alberto wanting to find value in himself through the help of others, and Giulia wanting to find someone to share her goals with. The side characters are great as well, though not as fleshed out as the main characters. The mother and father of Luca are generic enough that a viewer can project their own parents onto the characters easily enough, and the stoic father of Giulia is a wonderfully sweet and subtle character. While not being a major threat, the villain is able to be one of the more hate-able villains that isn't outright evil.Overall, I was impressed to say the least. Wonderful animation that isn't afraid to embrace that it is a cartoon, wonderful and relatable characters, and themes that anyone can relate to. It may be recency bias, but this movie may be my favorite Pixar movie of all time. It is certainly the best since Toy Story 3. I have a feeling it will be swept under the rug and equated to something like Soul or The Good Dinosaur, but this has potential to have a cult following like Ratatouille. I personally believe it is among the very best Pixar has ever produced, and I cannot wait to watch it again. A new summer tradition for years to come.",Luca
489,ofersheffer,Adorable child and adult friendly film,10,17 June 2021,"Just got out of a showing at the first day of screening of this film at a cinema in Israel with my family. Firstly, this film is perfectly made on the technical side. Everything looks beautiful and fully immerses you into the world created as if it were real. Underwater shots as well as shots of the city. The story is not completely unique, a ""fish out of water"", a story of a character learning and developing -- overcoming adversity as well as self doubt. A classic worth telling and it is a good feel good story with well defined characters, each helping the story move along. I think emotionally, this story gives a lot of things to think about and the communication between characters, Luca and his friends, are very well written and very believable even though we're dealing where the fantasy part (becoming a ""sea monster"") is an occurrence. If I have to nit-pick, I would say that the film on one hand shows that dangerous things could be dangers but also that it is important to confront your fears -- perhaps in an instance or two it might have been good to add a band-aid or something to make it slightly clearer that a character went a little too far. Overall, though, this is not an issue to worry about. I don't think any kid is going to jump off a cliff because of this movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good character building with an arc. It is not Shawshank, or Empire of the Sun, but it is a lovely movie. Very happy this was my first film-house visit after the pandemic.",Luca

And it definitely has hints of queerness.",Luca
493,thomastestor,Very good movie which is unfortunately not in theaters because of Disneys new streaming strategy,9,24 June 2021,"This film was actually designed for the cinema, but Disney simply pushed it to their streaming platform Disney+, which actually hurts me as a big cinema fan on such a movie. This has nothing to do with the corona pandemic, you now can find other Disney films in the cinema such as Cruella or Black Widow (Marvel also belongs to Disney). Unfortunately, there's not a bit of appreciation here, which is also not well received by some Pixar employees. Disney's decision is apparently based on strengthening Disney+, as they has found a new business model in it. For me, that's rather a sign that Disney+ isn't working very well when they have to take such drastic measures. For me that's very pathetic and it also makes me hate Disney now, which wasn't before, because they make good films. It's also probably not optimal that they now have such a high market share that they tend to dare to do this. Disney is already starting to take advantage of its market position. Buying up an entire major studio would probably not have been approved in the European Union where I come from (Austria). Such deals and their possible negative effects on the market are carefully examined here. The first negative effect we saw, was the closure of Blue Sky Studios which also annoyed me very much.The film gets going a little slowly (I might be mistaken because Pixar has made a lot of very good films, so my expectations may already be higher in advance), but as soon as it's there, it's fantastic, like Pixar has shown already in many other movies. Very emotional at certain points and also immersive from halfway through. It's very nice to watch how the friendship between Luca and Alberto and also between Luca and Giulia develops. I also really like the ending which also leaves room for a second part, which I would be very happy to see.",Luca

The animation style was phenomenal, from the adorably designed characters to the beautiful Italian scenery. To put a single word to it, this movies is charming, and well worth the watch. Thank you, Pixar!",Luca
495,magzlovespandas,"New Setting, Same Old Story",5,10 July 2021,"I'm a big Pixar fan and have loved their unique storylines and movie settings this past decade. Luca was top on my list to see, but unfortunately it ended up being a massive disappointment. Even the beautiful visuals couldn't make up for the rehashed, unoriginal story that pulls from so many Disney movies. This would've been a beautiful short film, but it was a huge waste of 96 minutes. Because I felt like I had already watched the movie, I didn't feel as much emotional attachment to the characters and the ending felt a little rushed and anti-climactic.The character arch with the parents also ""floundered."" Parents being wrong and misunderstanding their children is a classic Disney trope. However, unlike The Little Mermaid where Ariel actually didn't face any danger above the surface and her father's fears were unfounded, the boys genuinely did go to a very dangerous place and basically got lucky throughout the movie. As opposed to directly confronting his parents' beliefs and seeing growth on both sides, Luca just avoids them the whole movie. This might be nitpicking, because I can understand the amazing values (imagination, openness, diversity) behind the story, but I also couldn't help but think of the Key & Peele skit ""you can literally fly, kids"" while watching Luca and Alberto quiet Bruno, ignore red flags, and hide from well-meaning parents.",Luca

We ended up watching Brave instead...........The animation also felt a little cheap compared to other Pixar movies. And I heard people comparing it to The Little Mermaid..........seriously , Little Mermaid was waaaaaaaaayyyy better than this movie . It's a little better than Cars 2 and The Good Dinosaur and that's it. Overall a Below average Pixar film.",Luca

The story is not at all engaging and overly straightforward for a Pixar film. It has this amazing theme about friendship but it didn't knew how to deliver it. The only good thing about this movie is that the visuals are beautiful and colourful but other than that nothing about this movie is great. The character designs were also stupid. Looks like Pixar wanted to try something new but it didn't turn out well. I really miss the old Pixar 😭😭 Even Onward was better than this. Overall a bottom tier Pixar movie. Don't recommend.,Luca

They pretty much took the most simple story in the world and made a masterpiece. I rated it 9/10 because it made me cry at multiple points(why did a kid's movie have to hit that hard?!) and because the ending was dissatisfying.My sister wanted me to watch this because it had one of her favorite actors in it(Jack Dylan Grazer, who played Alberto), and I wasn't expecting much from it. But the characters were incredibly faceted, and the story was both heartwarming and fun. And the love triangle. (I'll leave it at that for those who haven't watched it yet)I would highly recommend this movie: Also, if you're not satisfied with the ending, leave it to Gen Z to make everything work out in the end.(check out fan theories on tumblr)",Luca

I really appreciate it when they show cultural aspects in films.The style was very unique and animated which I don't mind but I really miss the style and look that most of the original Pixar films had that tied them together. It was kind of a turn off for most fans. The last few films since Coco have been very hit or miss and I believe a lot of it has to do with plot, style and pacing.Unfortunately, there was nothing really unique that we haven't seen before with the story/plot. Feels very similar to other ""fish out of water"" stories like The Little Mermaid, Ponyo, etc.I really wish they spent more time on the build up towards the beginning and ending. So much of this script felt so rushed. The conclusion in particular fell weak and it was a shame because it could have been much better if they paced it right. Stronger emotional pay offs but unfortunately with some of the decision they made, those payoffs seemed very cheap and almost too easy.Overall, enjoyable film but wish the script and pacing was a bit better.",Luca

The characters just didn't look the same as other films such as Coco or even the humans in inside out.

545,erikdanielson,An Utter Delight From Start To Finish,10,19 June 2021,"While it may not be Pixar's most complex or deep film, Luca makes up for it in heart, humor and charm. This is a gorgeously animatedcoming of age story set against the backdrop of the Italian Riviera packed with gelato, pasta, and Vespa rides, as our two protaganists Luca and Alberto discover themselves and the wonders of the human world with their new friend Giulia. While the story and its themes may be a bit cliche, the charm here really comes from the interactions between the characters, especially Luca and Alberto as Alberto shows Luca the ways of the ""land monsters"". Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer and newcomer Emma Berman are all fantastic as Luca, Alberto and Giulia respectively, but the most laughs come from MayaRudolph and Jim Gaffigan as Luca's parents.If there was ever going to be a cinematic embodiment of all the wonderful things about summer, I'd have to say Luca makes a great argument for why it should have that title.",Luca
546,sofiaspanberg,A beutiful movie about friendsship and dreams,10,31 July 2021,I cried and laught when i saw this movie. Beutiful in and out!,Luca
547,rusuhoria,Pixar's Italian Fever Dream - A Tale of Confusion Wrapped With a 1960s European Cover,6,18 June 2021,"After the (not suprisingly because it's goddamn Pixar) oscer-winner 'Soul', an overwhelming and at times predictable tale about the meaning of life, Pixar has just taken audiences to a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, where fish are hunted and the humans are quite entertaining (because... they're Italian... duh).Personally I am a huge fan of the animation presented in this one! The unique blend of stlyes throughout real events and dream sequences are pretty stellar, but, unfortunately, they may or may not make it up to the dissapointing narrative structure and character development.Luca Paguro is our protagonist, at times a carbon copy of an already well known sea-creature finding themselves in awe for the human world, who becomes best friends with Alberto Scorfano to form a beautiful but underdeveloped friendship centred around living your best life with your own individuality. They are accompanied by Giulia to form ""The Underdogs"" Trio, who throughout the film really became to represent a more realistic depiction of friendship, with both its' ups and downs.The main problem in 'Luca' is not the stunning animation or even the child-like whimsy feel whenever our main characters are wondering around Portorosso tohave the best summer ever, but the way Pixar and co have decided to structure the narrative here. Many (important) plots and places and gags feel a bit irrelevant to the story presented, and even if this is supposed to mirror the endless summer coming-of-age story that children their age have many times throughout their lives, changes like this really were not that greatly excecuted in comparinson to Pixar's other more unique approaches to storytelling in their past, making 'Luca' feel like a sad example of ""style over substance"".Overall, 'Luca' is a fun summer movie for people of all ages! A film which transports you to a certain nostalgic place, no matter the person, it unfortunately falls short at times with the blant story presented and the overall underexplored Italian leads...Also there is pasta here!!! So it's automatically above a 4/10 for me.",Luca
548,omegle-66767,Mediocre,3,6 July 2021,"Dialogue and plot were totally mediocre. I didn't laugh the entire movie. I was led to believe the scenery would be amazing from the preview, but it was pretty mundane. There was no cleverness to the writing or interactions. Of course there was the tomboy girl who's ""tougher"" than the male protagonist, yelling at the adults and so forth. There's the terrific example for children to ride dangerously, go off cliffs, etc. There was no brilliance or magic as there often is in Pixar movies. Maybe Pixar is declining without Jobs just like Apple is.",Luca

550,agaa-96954,Loved the movie,10,4 November 2021,"The movie is amazing. It has a new idea. It is so colorful and the kids can enjoy it. The idea of a "" sea monster "" is afraid of going out of the sea but likes to collects human's things and the human has a price for anyone can catch a sea monster but in the end they changed their mind about it. It deserves 10/10 .",Luca
551,ebtparkes,Pixar does it again!,8,18 July 2021,Luca was a beautiful movie that just shows why Pixar will forever be great. The visuals for an animated movie are some of the best I've ever seen. The musical score was decent at best and lacked a little for me. The story was good and had deeper meanings and life lessons about not being afraid to come out and be your true self. It's a story of acceptance and a beautiful one at that. I really enjoyed Luca and would give it a solid 8.5/10.,Luca
552,elleconlaesse,Just simple as it is,10,22 June 2021,"Luca is a film that probably isn't made for generations that grew up with the Pixar films.Not because it's done badly, but simply because now we want analyze every single thing as much as possible. It's like we want to know everything, so we can probably complain about that too.Luca only scratches the surface of the world he talks about, but that's okay, he wants to give us a summer adventure, a little moment of happiness and relaxation. I think the key word that better describe the film is lightness.A light adventure that leaves you with an almost nostalgic sense of happiness when it ends.I don't conceive how many people try to compare this movie to Cars 2.",Luca
553,rufus_gdl,Love it! Pixar at it's most subtle is perfect. Reminds me of Whisper of the heart and Kikis delivery Service.,10,19 June 2021,"Though the premise is simple and also the storyline... the Heart of the movie is so strong. Be yourself no matter what other people think if you. And that is all that matters.You don't always want a movie that deals with death, life o a more dramatic subject, sometimes you just want fun and remember what was like when you were a kid and what was like to discover the world and yourself.Kudos to Pixar for trying something new (more cartoonish characters) they outdone themselves.And last, i loved how they brought the spirit of some studio ghibli movies, though the town is named after Porco Rosso, i think it evokes more of Whisper of the heart and Kikis delivery Service, subtle movies with a lot of heart.The ending left me in tears, so bring tissues. And the credits wow, now i want a sequel so much.Great Job. Signore Cassarosa. Keep it coming.Greetings from Mexico.",Luca

557,mirandalaico,"It's simple, but truly beautiful",10,18 June 2021,"Pixar never ceases to amaze me, every story they do is different and follows a different way to tell the story, and I like this one pretty much!I really enjoyed Luca's and Alberto's friendship, but it can start a little weird, but at the end, it's all worthy. Later, when Guilia appears, it also shows a beautiful friendship between her and Luca, sadly Alberto kind of never fit in that friendship, but the story needed this.I like Ercole very much, it's not a classic villain, he's just a bully that wants to be number one and that's it, some people are like that, but at the end, he gets what he deserves. I can see how people may not like him because he's simple, but he was different from other Pixar's villains, and it was a way to make a change from the classy villains that we normally see.I was grateful that Massimo's character was like Pixar delivered, in the sneak speak I saw him a little tough and I thought he would stay like that but luckily he did not, he really love Alberto, he even went to look for him, I think he kind of represented the father Alberto never had, and this makes me so happy, because after seeing him in the island telling how his dad abandoned him, was just too heartbrokening (also that part was really good, because we got to go a little deep into the character and understand where he is coming from, which made me emotional)
I personally didn't like too much when Luca started imaginating things in his head but it was necessary to look how his interests change or the part that his parents played, they were funny, but it's like they changed theirs minds too fast from the beginning to the end, but after all, I don't think any part of the film is unnecessary.The comedy was great, the animation stunning, and to see how Luca and Alberto became friends and went through being scared of who they were and to finally let it go to reach their goals, was worth the one hour and forty one minutes.It was simple, nothing too elaborated, but sometimes is good to see a movie being simple, it doesn't drive you nuts to remember thousands of thing that will later reappeared in the film, so don't have TOO high expectations for it, just watch it on a Saturday when it's raining and you will truly enjoy it.",Luca
558,sorchasarah,"""Look me in the eye. You know I love you, right?"" - Luca",10,1 July 2021,"While Luca is different from Pixar's previous work I find it magical nevertheless. The Animation is beautiful while still using 3D animation with a wink at old 2D colour palettes and shapes, the movie is aesthetically pleasing. The characters are all special and the actors portrayed great chemistry. The world that the sea monster's live in remind's me of Finding Nemo. The story is basic, but it's a nice watch you can stick it on and relax and it's enjoyable for all ages. It's definitely one of my favourite Pixar movies now.P. S. If you're interested in cooking I highly recommend trying to cook Massimo Marcovaldo pasta dish, trenette al pesto, there are recipes online.",Luca
559,khaledketata,"An emotional, likable masterpiece",10,18 June 2021,"Pixar has a new reputation of making movies that will have very long legacies in this new era. They did with Soul and they did again with Luca. This movie is just great. The rivalry of humans and sea monsters, the friendship of Luca, Guilia and Alberto, The underdogs trying to stop Ercole from winning the cup for a 6th time. And of course, that extremely emotional ending.",Luca

* Don't be scared of society if your thoughts otherwise you are different, be the trendsetter and the last one
* Creativity has no boundaries, and if that exists, break that 😉

575,t_devlin,The perfect microcosm for LGBTQ+ struggle with coming out,9,20 June 2021,"The film was a change from the Pixar usual, sporting a new style of animation that felt very in theme with its Italian setting. There was a bold use of colour that was visually pleasing to watch and the character design was stunning.It's rare to find a good LGBTQ+ representation in film yet Pixar have managed to get there without even having a confirmed character in that community. Luca's struggle with hiding his fishy roots in the human town really hit home for me, being able to relate to the uncomfortable feeling that someone found out or the panic of what they might do. Even the desperation to run away from everything is on some level relatable.The Humour of the film was also very tasteful and made me laugh on several occasions, the plot was fun and while a 'fish out of water' plot isn't anything new it certainly was a unique take on the cliqué. My only issue is the pacing was a little fast, it felt like Pixar were trying to fit a lot into a little when there really was no need. However in the only criticism I can think of was a technical detail then I'd consider the film a raging success.",Luca
576,Glucifer_0601,Great movies to watch,9,19 September 2021,"The movie is great, both the plot and the characters are meaningful and cute. I really like how Pixar choose a plot for different movies, there's always a hidden meaning or give us heart-warming feelings after we watched it. Like it can be the nostalgic feelings when there are jokes or a small scene appears on the screen, or the enjoyable feelings when we get a chance to laugh, to cry and to sympathize.The animation is amazing too. I really like that last scene of the movie. When Luca and Alberto had a farewell, Luca stood on the train and looked back at Alberto and his family, at that moment, the sky started to rain and Luca slowly changed back to his original form. This moment makes me think that ""from the start to the end, he is still him, Luca.""",Luca

And, probably, the island where Alberto lives, is Ferale island. I love the place where I live, and the film is a perfect representation of Italy of the past (I think '60s, '70s more or less).The diversity theme is faced in a simple but efficient way... Good job, Pixar! A very inclusive film.Luca, Alberto and Giulia are nice: the friendship that everyone needs, I love them.The end is very very touching but real.I have to do only one observation: too much cliché about how Italians gesturing: we don't move hands so much (I think) and different way, I can say.The film is for everyone: children, teenagers and, why not, adults.It reminds me of my summertime in Cinque Terre when I was a child and the light-heartedness with my friends.Try to look it in italian with subtitles: much better, less cliché, and the accent are quite similar to our way of speaking with our idioms.I love it, and you'll love it.",Luca

Even surpassing their previous best of Onward and Coco.Storyline even though slower in the begining picks up pace quiet quickly and takes us to the world of Luca who is a sea monster as characterized by the Surface Monsters(humans). Luca dreams of going out of the sea and venture the world but is always discouraged. On one such occasion he meets Alberto a similar sea monster who has been living alone on the surface for a long time now.To go see the world they need a Vespa, which they can buy after participating in a race and winning it. As the story progresses they meet Giulia who is an enthusiastic teenaged girl who longs to win the race and participates each year only to be thwarted by Ercole. How Luca, Alberto and Giulia form the friendship forms the story of the movie.The characterization of Luca, Alberto and Giulia are pretty much realistic. Making us empathize with characters at all times and sometimes takes us to a trip down the memory lane.During our school and college days we have all had a friend like Luca or Alberto or Giulia. I know cause I had friend just like Alberto. Who would encourage me at each step.Luca is a must watch for adults as well as kids.

594,juliobg,Surprisingly good,7,19 June 2021,"To tell the truth, I had some faith in this movie, because I liked its style and after how good Soul was, I was hoping this movie would do something similar or at least try. To tell the truth, the story is not very ingenious, there are many silly things as if there are people who do not believe in sea monsters, why are these monsters afraid of humans? There are also characters like Luca's mother who try to be the protective character, but that is unnecessary because from one day to the next she changes her mind, without even showing us. I also do not like the scene where Julia's father defends the protagonists, because we were never shown a friendship between Luca and Alberto with this man, besides, I do not buy that everyone stops hunting monsters just because this man says they are good . Despite these mistakes I think this movie knows that it is not very ingenious and that is why it wants you to have fun, I also liked the character of Alberto, he is a boy who lived alone and later he meets someone who keeps him company and thinks that Julia He can take away his friendship, but later he understands that his friend may have different tastes from his and that is why in the end he lets him go to school. Score 7.1 / 10.",Luca

611,christopherfalzarano,Your heart will smile,10,19 June 2021,"This movie was absolutely lovely. Heartwarming, fun, and lighthearted while also having moments of emotion and tackling deeper topics. There is a lot ""below the surface"" about not being afraid to be yourself, acceptance, and not fearing the ""monsters"" that is people who are different from you. Great message! Would absolutely recommend! Your heart will smile!",Luca
612,lisafowler-09676,Heartwarming family film,10,19 June 2021,My family loved this movie! The characters were fun and engaging. The Italian details were wonderful and completely new to my kids. Such a good story!,Luca
613,themcreebingtonreview,Wish the casting was better,4,19 June 2021,"I really liked many things about this film, the idea, the story, the animation, the arc in general was really well put together. The one thing I was really disappointed about was the casting. This was a perfect opportunity for Italian and bilingual actors to have a chance to represent a character in a Pixar Italian film. Instead they just chose popular voice actors that get a million roles anyway, and who butchered the Italian accents. They wouldn't do that for Coco, they had accurate representation in that movie. Why did they do that for Luca? They literally only had 3 Italian voice actors in the entire cast and one of them was the villain.",Luca
614,ismailboubakry,You should see it by yourself!,10,19 June 2021,"This movie is an explosion of beauty, of fun with amazing characters heaving a lot of personnality!I watched it with with my family. When the movie was over, every one was like ""Oh this is my favourite movie, iv'e never seen something like this""!It contains a great story and mezmerizing environment talking about these nostalgic friendship you had in your childhood!In the begenning I new that this will be a great masterpeice.And when the movie was over...
I don't know you should see it by yourself...
(And the score has this vibe that you find in Disney Infinity. So beautiful!)",Luca
615,tabuschman,highly recommend,10,19 June 2021,"I loved this movie. The animation was so visually pleasing I love how it kind of meets in the middle of realistic and cartoony without feeling awkward. The story was beautiful. I loved the bonds between the kids and the whole found family trope with Alberto. I cried watching it, it was very sweet.",Luca

617,cpknips,i loved this movie SO MUCH.,10,20 June 2021,"This movie is definitely in my top 10 fav disney movies. I'm serious. Me and my mom saw advertisements for it everywhere when visiting LA and decided we were gonna watch it when it came out. So glad we did, i enjoyed it too much. Definitely made me sob as always at the end tho. But overall a 10/10 movie and i will be watching it again. (also pixar ain't slick about releasing this during pride month... i was picking up what they were putting down)",Luca
618,alexanderisraelrsrt,This is the first PIXAR movie...,2,20 June 2021,"That deeply shows a complete turnaround regarding enchantment and magic that inhibits all humans. And instead shows a shallow, robotic, surface like monstrosity in the form and shape of Luca. All Pixar movies were about that x factor, but this one is the product of the Cabal. There is nothing magical about this one! This is the one that shows/proves the loss of grip upon humanity, forcing people to live shallow lives, instead of their full potential like in Moana, Soul and many many other pearls.This is a movie about the need to go to school, the importance of the surface of things instead of their deep meaning. And then in the end the total ridiculed Uncle Ugo of the Deep - hence the opposite of Ego - , where in the very last shot 'the sheep' step aside and move away... It is a really really really deep message hidden withing this movie... The only place where the sheep SHOULD GO.So go watch all the beauty that Pixar showed in all of their movies. They're all about finding your potential by following your heart. Embrace those movies, treasure them. That is where you'll find who you are. Those you deserve.And burn/bury/ignore this one.",Luca
619,hallaem,amazing movie have to watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,20 June 2021,I am an ten year old girl and i can tell you now i am really fussy with some movies. I watched Luca it was amazing!!

620,humancookiemonster,Beautiful visually and conceptually,10,20 June 2021,"I understand some people's stance about the pacing but I didn't find too much issue with it. But like others that's about as much 'wrong' with this movie. It's bello, beautiful! Such smooth animations stylised to perfection, a very fun and enjoyable movie to indulge in. You did good Pixar.",Luca
621,wjod-19067,Wonderful love note to Italy,10,20 June 2021,"Recently I've been getting a bit tired of Pixar leaning on death as a lazy plot device to create emotional resonance. Has made me worry the cupboard is bare. Not so here.Simple plotting that made me shed a tear of joy. My 4 year old had been unusually quiet for this one, taking it all in. When ""La Fine"" came up on screen, he looked up at me with a smile and said ""I love you daddy"". It's that kind of movie. Thanks Disney for a wonderful Father's Day present.",Luca

628,hugohugoi,So comfortable!,10,7 July 2021,"I haven't seen a movie more than 1 time in a long time, but I've already watched this 5 times, it's such a comfortable movie, you can relate to the characters and it reminds you of the time in your childhood . Hoping for a part 2! But that should work with so much positivity!",Luca

630,stitchbolt,Emotional Roller Coaster,10,26 June 2021,"Oh my goodness! This is the most heart warming, and inspiring movie I have seen in months. Such a great concept, with lovable characters! There was parts of true heart break, and parts where I couldn't stop smiling. It had humor, and depth! You need to watch this movie! Sends a great message about self love, and expression! As well as understanding that not everyone will accept you, but those who do are always the best! This movie deserves 1 million stars but I only had 10 to give. Watch this movie, I think it changed me for the better! Im in love with this!",Luca

632,cgadvertising,A very honest movie,9,26 June 2021,"A kids movie that is not money grabbing, with an honest story that captivates you and you dont want it to end.I'll start by saying what doesn't have: no adult joke references, no desperate special effects and no stupid dialogues (you know those jokes that don't make any sense but the writters think they're funny because people laugh out of confusion).What this movie does have: is a great plot that stays true to a coming if age story, characters with very well defined personalities (sorry, Im still frustrated with bipolar writters for characters like loki, im good, im bad, im sarcastic, im emotional) sensational directing and animation that makes sense and enhances the story, not just moves for the sake of moving, flawless art direction and overall....a feeling of happiness and meaning.And kudos to the production team for bringing to light a movie that inspired my child to be curious and explore, to be creative, to be ambitious, to make mistakes but right the wrongs, to stay true to yourself and to always look for new adventures....all that by making her feel she was a part of the story.I'll end by saying the character design was amazing and made sense! (Which is rare these days) but the whole movie: objects, city, water scenes was designed to perfection - congratulations to the entire design team!",Luca
633,jeffchermak,Just not that great,5,27 June 2021,"This movie is just not that good overall. It's full of bad messages for kids, unlikable characters, and a poorly written plot. Hopefully your kids don't want to watch this over and over again like mine, as you feel every fault over and over again.",Luca
634,khickey-97720,FANTASTIC MOVIE,10,27 June 2021,My whole family is obsessed with Luca! It is a pure and heartwarming movie that I can watch over and over again. It is in my top favorite animated movies of all time!,Luca
635,akaitrannguyenlongan,"A good movie, nothing groundbreaking about it. But it's my most personal favorite of Pixar so far.",9,28 June 2021,"Luca's story is very simple but also funny and absolute adorable, which seems to make the focus of it toward younger people and especially children. But as an adult I had an amazing time with it nonetheless.The color is vibrant and beautiful, every pieces of animation is stunning. The 3 main characters are really likeable and have so much personality to them. Everyone has their own story to tell, it's not much but it has successfully established their goals and motive behind their actions.It's a cute story, not a grand journey or a quest that destined to change the world, many die-hard Pixar fans may not like the direction of this movie. But I think it's fine, Pixar has made so much masterpiece, this movie's power and message won't live up to some others, but I think it has successfully accomplished its goal to delivering a message about friendship and finding those that will accept you, in a beautiful way.If you expect something great coming from Luca, you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have a good times, to live back your younger self and to see a summer that is absolutely beautiful with a nice and easy-to-swallow message, this is the movie for you.",Luca

638,nandininayak-00676,Not what you expect from Pixar,6,30 June 2021,"This really isn't great but Pixar are so far ahead of the game that even when they are bad they are still okay. It's not horrible but it's by no means up to the expected standard. The story is simple, predictable and under developed but it is beautiful, well performed and passes the time!",Luca
639,jjgzlz,A VERY GOOD Pixar film,9,1 July 2021,Can you Believe that Luca was a very good film I love it from the bottom of my heart before everyone says well is it better then ratatouille or The Incredibles let me say that of course it goes over cars 2 for sure but I say it goes in next to coco or soul level not like Pixar's 2000 movies Because those are the BEST animated movies ever made so back to Luca first thing off is the animation let me say its GREAT plot is good not the best like it starts with them trying to get a vespa then to them doing a triathlon so little strange but good and the fact that they can't get wet because they are see monsters is pretty good so the character are very likable I like Alberto Luca the villain and Julia which are technically the main characters the side characters are cool to and all as well the ending is a little strange so it starts raining and Luca can't go on in the bike event for the Triathlon so Alberto comes and helps him but the villain comes and kicks him and it was raining so he turned into a sea monster so the town is shock but then Luca comes out of his roof or whatever it is and helps Alberto so when they get to the end they won so now everyone starts to get used to sea monsters even though the entire town hate sea monsters so that I had a problem with but then the rest of the ending get from happy to sad but still happy Luca wants to go to school so his parents who are also sea monsters let him and Luca thought that Alberto would come with him but he wants to stay in the town so Luca and Alberto say goodbye to each other and it's not up beginning emotional but it makes you sad and that's Luca so I will give it a 9 out of 10 for sure I hope you agree with me and I will see you in the next review and Pixar keep up the good work.,Luca

The way Luca took shelter in Roberto touched my heart. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I really believe Pixar hinted in a really relaxed and accepting way without offending anyone at a relationship between the two boys. I wish I had such a movie growing up. This allowed for some inner healing and is one of my favorite new movies. So much that I had to come type a review about it.",Luca

659,leviathanftt,Great Movie! Nothing Groundbreaking Though.,7,26 July 2021,"Honestly the movie was great! I loved the dynamic the three main characters share. The running gag where Giulia would substitute swear words for complex pasta names was hilarious. The animation was flawless and amazing and...(what am I talking about, it's Pixar. Of course it's amazing.) The movie wasn't redefining cinema like Soul, Wall-E, or Coco but that's in no way a negative. It's actually kind of refreshing. A little breath of fresh air in between the masterpieces. 7 stars out of 10.",Luca

661,lightner-94072,"For some it's a fun film of friendship and adventure. For others it's a familiar story of fear, self acceptance, confusion and first love. Either way it's undeniable sweet.",9,28 July 2021,"I loved this movie. So many of these low rating reviews are critiquing the movie for being 1 dimensional or basic. But at the same time they're failing to dissect this fantastic, multilayered creation. It's beautifully animated, colorful, funny, has a great soundtrack, and is plastered in subtext. At a glance it's about friendship and acceptance. But as the layers peel you have first love and the journey to come to terms with who you are. With every glance, expression, dialogue, and dilated pupil you can sense the layered context. We have a mother worrying about how the boys will be perceived to the world and the grandmother saying"" some people will never accept him. But some will..."" We have a bully saying things like: ""This is my town, people like you don't belong here..."" And so much more! Anyone ignoring this is blind or ignorant. Some could say that Pixar didn't go far enough in this story line. But I'd argue that it's absolutely perfect for a children's film. It portrayed exactly what it needed to. For some it's a fun film of friendship and adventure. For others it's a familiar story of fear, self acceptance, confusion and first love. However you perceive this film, the emphasis on acceptance is clear and perfect.",Luca

664,jnemmers-63541,Amazing Pixar Movie,8,8 August 2021,This movie was an amazing experience to go through. The actors bring the characters along with their phenomenal voice acting. But this movie lacks a big cause. I'm not saying it's bad for this reason just other Pixar movies have much bigger causes than this movie. I do like how the story only focuses on the town. I just wish I could see more of the characters. Overall 88/100.,Luca
665,yairtzvi,Santa Ricotta 😂 A crazy movie,10,24 August 2021,"Beauty of a movie, really. Luca and Alberto are marine creatures that as they emerge from the water they become humans.

They participate in a competition that includes eating pasta, swimming and cycling. At the end Luca and Alberto passions from the division team participates alone.

This film tells a lesson of how it's okay to be different as long as you're owning and you love your identity.

It's for all ages, and depending on your demographic and perspective, the meaning of it changes! ;)",Luca
668,anosochris,There's no magic I felt,2,28 August 2021,"Maybe its the story or the lack there of. Maybe I was just getting too used of seeing a good original plot from Pixar. Or maybe I am a little bit tired of 3D animations no matter how good the effects are. I don't know.. I'll just simply put it this way. For some reason, there is no magic I felt on Luca. The film is ok. But ok is not good enough for a Pixar movie. I truly hope they redeem themselves on upcoming movies.",Luca
669,pedroguarnieri,One of the best animations that I have ever seen,8,1 September 2021,"Luca is a movie with a silly objetive, where the the main characters are trying to win a race to get some money and buy a vespa.I really liked this movie but it isn't have the best main conflict, I think that the director scould tried to find a better main objetive for the main characters, Luca and Alberto.These characters are sea monsters, who on land they look like normal humans, but they turn back to their sea monster version when they touch the water. I really liked these rules and I think that this ones are so nice because they are so simple and anyone can undestand it.I really enjoied this animation and I think that if you are a fan of disney you should it.",Luca

675,contact-1028,This doesn't feel like Pixar,4,21 August 2021,"There is an unquantifiable, but certainly tangible, Pixar ""feel"". Their films touch a part of your soul and although they're not always successful (Finding Dory, the Cars sequels), that ""feel"" is still there albeit diluted.Luca is the first movie I've seen from Pixar to be missing this feel. It feels like a Sony pictures movie instead, particularly in the animation. It's jerky, characters move sharply and stiffly. The designs feel like they're a stolen mix of Peanuts and the Moomins (or in one case Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs) and have odd ticks like the mouths facing the camera regardless of where the head is actually facing.Performances aren't much better with most being perfunctory at best with either excessive overacting or numb underacting. It doesn't help that COVID has affected the production as some characters such as the main villain feel like the dialogue was from older takes that we're never updated to fit into the newer style of the movie.Compared to the most recent release of Soul, it is a massive step back in many of the important areas and has almost none of that movies charm, smarts, or emotional resonance.This is the first time Pixar has properly dropped the ball with an original property in... well, as long as I can remember and I just hope that it doesn't become a trend.",Luca

Just put in perspective that the ocean is the ""closet"" and the island is loneliness.Praying for a sequel!! Perhaps the characters will not only ""explore"" their friendship, but also love.",Luca

After the teo boys have a fallout though it changes radically to the usual terrible idea that the girl is now disposable - no longer needed as an arc's support for them. After that, the girl who was adorably noce to the two fishboys up until then, disappears in the plot. I am sick of this kind of use of female characters. 2021 DISNEY!!!!",Luca

In that regard, it looks more like a first or second draft of a story as opposed to a final, coherent film.At first Luca seems to be about the main character's fascination with the overworld (a la The Little Mermaid). Then, it seems to focus on Lucas's friendship with Alberto and their summer growth together. Afterwards the movie drifts away and becomes about winning a race (where a third character comes in, annulling the duality of Luca and Alberto). Finally, the movie then changes again and it becomes about Luca wanting to go to school. All of this makes it a bit incoherent.Another issue is that in the beginning the film tries to establish the upper world as a dangerous and forbidden place. Yet when the characters are exposed as sea creatures there are zero consequences; the human characters barely react to it except for the main villain (himself a bit problematic, since it feels a bit off to have a teenage boy wanting to kill the main characters). This makes the film seem a bit inconsequential. Disney has approached this theme way better in other films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame for example (where at a certain point, Quasimodo - who has always been secluded and told never to leave the cathedral - is having a great time amongst people for the first time in his life and, as soon as it's discovered that he isn't wearing a mask at The Feast of Fools, he is immediately humiliated, made fun of and assaulted). No consequence happens in Luca.However, sidestepping the issues mentioned above, Luca is surprisingly breezy and thankfully feels different from other Pixar films in tone - a bit less formulaic, a bit more nostalgic, and with a European arthouse vibe to it. The film looks great in its approach of cutting edge computer imagery and VFX blended with a more 2D, Ghibly-esque art direction (very noticeable in elements like clouds and water splash effects for example).Great soundtrack too!7/10.",Luca

686,pietrobr,Wonderful !,10,15 July 2021,"Second time I watch it and it got me crying as much as the first time. Beautiful story, characters and drawing. But it must be watched in ITALIAN.",Luca
687,jvantittelboom,it touches my heart,10,6 July 2021,This animation film makes you feel like you can dream again.Let that be just what everyone needs after such dramatic years.Thank you Pixar!,Luca
688,nozecuervo,Worst Pixar movie ever.,1,18 July 2021,I feel like I'm being punked. This movie was absolute garbage. I do NOT understand all the positive reviews.,Luca
689,ramiromaycry,A truly touching piece.,9,22 June 2021,This was a great piece of work. I watch it with my son (2 years old) and my wife. We both felt very touched by the story in this film. Many different life elements take place in such fluidity that it truly makes you admire the ingenuity of the Director.Such a moving story. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.,Luca
690,eringabrielletaylor,Pixar?,2,3 July 2021,"I thought the previews made this look like a rip-off of The Little Mermaid, but I banked on it being a bad trailer and hoped it's Pixar-ness would carry it through. So many gifted people there, how could they make something so bland. Didn't laugh once. The jokes felt forced and the animation was Nickelodeon-esq. I love Italy. I love sea monsters. It could have been so great. What happened?",Luca
691,arsenal_fan99,Just amazing,10,27 July 2021,Its A constant stream of events driving the plot forwards in A pleasurable way. Great storyline with great character development wrapped up in 100 minutes. A true joy.,Luca
692,ssliwa23,Sweet coming of age story,9,19 June 2021,I feel like I haven't seen a great coming of age story in a long while. This movie definitely brought me back to my younger days with my friends and learning who I am and taking risks.I wasn't sure about this movie when I would see the ads. I caught it on Disney plus while at the gym and just fell into the story. I wasn't anticipating on liking it so much but I'm glad I did. It's such a feel good summer story. A must see for kids of all ages!,Luca
693,sagor5373,Awesome movie,10,27 June 2021,This is an awesome animated movie. Recommended. Pls watch it!,Luca
694,xandermcnulty,"Not bad, just not great",6,23 August 2021,"Cute movie, just nothing special to make it a memorable watch when Pixar can create movies like Inside Out and Soul. This is on the same level as Good Dinosaur (remember that one?), something you watch just because it has the Pixar logo on it.",Luca
695,jloureiro4,Great !!!,10,26 June 2021,Beautiful movie.Congratulations to the producers.Our family love this story!,Luca
696,W0RqR0,Amazing movie,10,24 June 2021,"I never write reviews for movies, but this was the best Disney movie I've seen in a long time, animation work was fantastic story exceptional maybe not in the complexity. But the story really excels in portraying a very fun and nostalgic playground, with beautiful music to blend it together and filled with Italian nuances, and that ending.... I need more! I can't get enough of it!( Watched to to many times already)Can't wait for a second movie 🍿🍿🍿Please Disney and Pixar give us another one!!!!",Luca

698,macshade,A Pixar movie for kids!,10,19 June 2021,"It's not a story inside your mind, it's not after life (or before life begins), it's not highly complex, it's simple (and it also isn't), it's beautiful and it brought memories about my childhood but also about reading Saint Exupery's Little Prince.It's a movie for children that parents can also relate to (but the focus is correct and needed!).I loved it!",Luca
699,thatdennyswaitress,Super Cute,8,8 July 2021,Great movie about how sometimes it's ok to rebel if it's going to make you happy.,Luca
700,blorraine-83754,Pixar's best in a long time!,10,19 June 2021,"While normally I'm partial to Disney's happily ever after rather than Pixar's plot twists with happy but emotional ending Pixar has now created a beautiful picture that captured my laughter bitter sweet sadness and all while making me want to go to the Italy pavilion in EPCOT. Between Luca finding him self wanting to experience human things, Albertos troubled past, and Giulia's tenacity to win the race this heartfelt message was truly a must see!",Luca
701,Jerieth,Funny cute movie,8,20 June 2021,"Enjoyable movie that has a few plot holes, but overall is fun to watch. This movie is actually the prequel to The Shape of Water.",Luca
702,walidelbanna,This animation movie deserves this rate 9/10,10,4 September 2021,"No need to write a review , i'll give this movie 9/10.",Luca
703,calbrigham,My Own Opinion,5,20 June 2021,"Context: I'm a huge Pixar fan, like most. The only films I haven't seen are the Cars sequels and the Good Dinosaur. I personally really enjoyed Soul, even though it felt much lower budget than previous Pixar Films.The Good: the animation is nice and the cat brought the only laughs.The Bad: The story of this film was very surface level. It felt like a long short film in all the worst ways. I did not feel a connection to the main characters, and I feel like the antagonist is the weakest out of any Pixar film. The story was a little too simple, no twists or turns. Extremely straight forward with no believable motivation for character change.Another review mentioned how stereotypical they portrayed Italians, compared to the well portrayed culture in Coco. Totally agreed with that. I watched the Good Dinosaur trailer afterwords and was shocked at how much more beautiful that looked compared to Luca.",Luca

705,JRobb210,Perpetuating Dysfunction and Stereotypes,3,10 August 2021,"Though the story and characters may seem cute and endearing as they engage in light-hearted childhood fun; unfortunately, Disney continues to put forward works insensitive and antagonistic to culture and language.-Main protagonists speak in mostly North-American accented English with occasional stereotypical Italian phrases.-Antagonists strictly presented with Italian accents even though speaking English.-Triggering dysfunctional family dynamics and traumatic events are presented without any meaningful or appropriate modes for reconciliation or healing. (e.g. Models of healthy boundary setting, reconciliation, healing, and conflict resolution are portrayed simplistically without any substantive models through communication)The premise of Luca could have emerged as a novel portrayal of expanding compassion, love, and acceptance for the seemingly ""other"" which at first seems scary and different. Instead, this film will fail the test of time as it sits clearly within the Disney MO of perpetuating cultural and linguistic stereotypes through an Anglo-American centered narrative.(IF the Italian setting and language is of importance to the story, what if Disney were to actually produce the film in authentic Italian and the include English subtitles)",Luca
706,ordway-45557,Great story,10,23 June 2021,Subtle references that have a great story to tell. Open mindedness. True character. Love. Family. Made me cry a little. Loved it.,Luca
707,bestlifeever,Simple but heart-tugging!!!,8,26 June 2021,"It's really a simple story, but it had me laughing out loud at points. Just a really upbuilding story, not too serious, but has some sad moments! Just a cute and funny movie to turn on.",Luca
708,l-31892,Authentic,7,27 August 2021,"It's not as touching as Coco or as inspiring as Soul, but it's genuine and authentic and sometimes that's what matters.",Luca
709,gamerforloading,It's a good movie,10,23 June 2021,"I watched & loved this movie sometimes, Luca Friendship with his friend Alberto makes my day. I loved this storyline tho.",Luca
710,danilklimenok,Somehow reminds me of a good old Pixar times!,9,17 June 2021,"Such a good story! Honest, Kind and simply Intelligent! Nothing irrelevant, nothing boring or whatever what makes people upset about any movie. Great plot and characters, lots of valuable significations. Also, good fun, not like a lot of jokes, but when they come - it's right at the point. Moreover, lots of pleasurable warm summer feelings. And yeah, I'm here not to glorify a motion picture, I'm here since I liked and enjoyed it fully and truthfully.""Well kaka"" :)",Luca
711,rajeshr-00808,Yes I recommend to watch the Movie,9,18 June 2021,"It was really
