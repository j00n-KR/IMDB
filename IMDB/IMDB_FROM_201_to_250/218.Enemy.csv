0,MartinHafer,"Given the plot, this should have been so much better.",4,19 September 2021,"Adam is a history professor who is shocked to see a film with an actor who looks just like him. Because of this, he tries to contact the guy...only to have the man's wife think Adam IS Anthony. So, apparently they not only look identical but they sound identical as well. Where does this go next? Well, I guarantee 100% you won't guess if you've never seen the story!!To me, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most unusual and interesting actors today. So often he picks strange non-mainstream projects that are incredibly good, such as ""Donnie Darko"", ""Source Code"", ""Night Crawler"" and ""Prisoners"". Because of this, I often seek out his films as I know they will be treats.Unfortunately, while ""Enemy"" is certainly unusual, and that is a plus, the film itself didn't work all that well for me. This is because the film lacked energy and instead of action and excitement, the film nearly put me to sleep. Even worse, the music really helped lull me to semi-consciousness!",Enemy
1,TheLittleSongbird,Definitely does stay with you,7,18 October 2017,"Denis Villeneuve to me is a hugely talented director, and the six films seen of his so far have all been good to outstanding. 'Sicario', 'Incendies' and 'Blade Runner 2049' are especially good. 'Prisoners' was very good and almost great until let down by the ending and while 'Arrival' had its issues it was also well done with a lot to admire.That 'Enemy' has replaced 'Arrival' as my least favourite Villeneuve film and still manages to be a film of many admirable qualities says a lot about how talented he is and how good his best films are. Can totally understand why 'Enemy' would captivate many critics and on the flip side confound others, 'Arrival' is a very divisive film but 'Enemy' (after only seeing it recently) seems to divide people much more. It's one of Villeneuve's most ambitious films (between this and 'Sicario' as the most) and also his most puzzling and least accessible perhaps. Found a lot to admire about 'Enemy' myself, but it is one of those ""highly appreciate"" than ""love"" films.Will admit to not completely understanding some of the storytelling and symbolism/metaphors, there are parts that could have gone into much more depth with some very intriguing ideas that are not fully explored. It is not always the most consistently involving film either, some of the pacing is drawn out too much and could have done with some more tightening.Count me in too as somebody who found the ending, one of the film's most polarising elements, unsatisfying. It was unsettling sure, but it was also abrupt, incomplete feeling and left too many questions unresolved.On the other hand, 'Enemy' is exceptionally well made. The visual style is both attractive and lurid, the dark and yellow hues allure and disturb in equal measure and the whole film is expertly in its cinematography. The music is appropriately creepy and anxiety-inducing.'Enemy's' dialogue is sparse but when it appears it's thought-provoking. The symbolism and metaphors perplex at times but unsettle and fascinate every bit as much. The story has its problems, but it is a very intriguing premise that has a very creepy and wonderfully weird (drawing favourable comparisons with David Lynch, and one can see why) atmosphere, a tight structure and some of the suspense makes one bite the nails in anxiety. Regardless of what anyone's stance on the film is overall, it is hard to deny that 'Enemy' definitely does stay with you long after it's over.Villeneuve deserves a large part of the credit for his smart and suspenseful direction. Likewise with the truly incredible lead performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Sarah Gadon and Isabella Rossellini are both very well cast, particularly Gadon who to me is at her best here.In conclusion, divisive and problematic but leaves a lasting impression. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Enemy
2,SnoopyStyle,weirdly intriguing,7,3 October 2014,"Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor at UGT in Toronto. He lives a tired monotonous life with his girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent). On a recommendation, he rents a movie and finds a bit actor named Daniel Saint Claire who looks exactly like him. After some searching, he finds that Daniel's real name is Anthony Claire and he's married to the pregnant Helen (Sarah Gadon).Adam's life is tired and boring. I get that point. In fact, I get that point within the first five minutes. It needs to move faster to get to the heart of the movie. It's an unnecessarily slow start. Once it gets going, this has a nice sense of paranoia and unrealism. Everything including the setting, the props, the music, the grayish tones, and the brutal architecture gives off a weird 70s hyper-unreal feel to the movie. Then there is the spider thing. I'm fine with not able to explain it myself. It may be better that there is no easy resolution. I can live off of the mood of the movie by itself.",Enemy
3,Prismark10,The real spider man,6,17 August 2015,"Denis Villeneuve made this film before Prisoners but Enemy had a limited release after it.The clues are there regarding any possible meaning about the film and its inspirations. Some people liken it to Fight Club, which tend to be people who think film history started from 1999.Villeneuve is Canadian and so is David Cronenberg who once made a film called Dead Ringers which is about paranoia and delusion among identical twins. You can go back to 1970 with The Man Who Haunted Himself where Roger Moore had a double which appeared after he had an accident.The film opens with a telephone message from a character's mother played by Isabella Rossellini. She was once married to Martin Scorsese whose recent film is Shutter Island. She also lived with David Lynch and also appeared in some of his movies, Lynch films are well known to visit weirdsville just check out Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart and the television series Twin Peaks which also had a doppelganger.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Adam Bell, a History professor in Toronto. He looks dishevelled, his hair and beard rather unkempt. He very much has routine, the daily grind of going to work teaching the same thing to students and going back home where he lives with his girlfriend. He rents a movie based on a recommendation of a colleague and shot locally. He notices that the actor playing the bellboy looks just like him and decides to seek him out.The film opens with a scene of an underground club where people are given a key to access a sex show/orgy taking place. Think a low rent version of the orgy from Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. One of the men in this club looks like Adam. We also for the first time here see the spider motif, here a tarantula on the verge of being squashed by a lady in high heels.Adam identifies the actor as Anthony Claire who had bit parts in a few other films. Adam stalks Anthony, visiting his office and calling him at home. Everyone, including Anthony's pregnant wife Helen confuse the two men. In a separate dreamlike image, a giant spider lurks among and above the skyscrapers of Toronto. Helen is suspicious of Anthony, she suspects he is having an affair.Adam and Anthony eventually meet in a hotel room and discover they are identical which includes having a scar in the same place. Adam is reserved, intellectual. Anthony is a hot head, sexual also neater and dresses better.Of course two men can look alike, have the same voice but the same scar? This just indicates a split personality, two sides of the same coin. Is Adam the man going to the sex clubs, having an affair, a man who feels trapped like he was in a spider's web?This is a film that has a left field ending full of symbolism which means you end up watching it again in order to see the clues. Bad luck if you did not like the film the first time around and the post production grading of dark yellow, teal, murky brown that I found so off putting. Every film seems to have a similar colour scheme even straight to DVD movies with Z list stars. When cinematographers like Vilmos Zsigmond and Nestor Almendros were shooting with rays of golden hues they were using real skill and artistry not using Photoshop during post production.The real highlight was when you see the film within the film, brightly lit and colourful and you think why could not the rest of the movie look like that.Enemy, is bound to be a cult film with a cultish following. Its intriguing, its like a puzzle box and open to different interpretation, full of symbolism and pretensions. Even the title of one of the songs used is called The Cheater.The title of the movie signifies that Adam is his own worst enemy, a man destined to repeat the same mistakes over and over again, its almost farcical something he said earlier in his lectures. Even when he might have rid of his double for good we see him with a new key of the type at the beginning of the film, telling the pregnant Helen he will be going out that night. A serial adulterer who does not want to be trapped.The film is good, it burns slowly into you but never immediately grabbed my attention afterwards but its not a great film. Something about it is too heavy handed like the murky colours and the garish yellows used in the film.",Enemy
4,claudio_carvalho,"Watch It with Attention, Seek Explanation in Internet and Watch It Again",7,26 September 2014,"In Toronto, the college professor of Politics Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) lives a routine life with his girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent). One day, he watches a rented DVD and sees an obscure supporting actor very alike to him and Adam becomes obsessed find him out. He discovers that his name is Anthony Claire and he is married with Helen (Sarah Gadon), who is six-month pregnant. Adam meets Anthony but soon he realizes that it was a mistake since his counterpart has put his eyes on Mary. Soon their lives become entwined.""Enemy"" is not a good movie, but has an intriguing story by José Saramago. For me, a good movie is able to present the story with neither the need of reading the novel not researching explanation in Internet. ""Enemy"" is a movie where the viewer needs to watch with attention, seek explanation in Internet (for example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9AWkqRwd1I provides a good explanation of the movie) and watch it again. Therefore the screenwriter fails in his script. Anyway it is intriguing and when you see it for the second time, it is worthwhile. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem Duplicado"" (""The Duplicated Man"")",Enemy
5,nogodnomasters,CHAOS IS ORDER YET UNDECIPHERED,6,17 October 2018,"Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal ) is an insecure boring History Professor who lectures on ways governments control us. His world lacks color and the backgrounds are symbolically drab. He has a hot girlfriend (Mélanie Laurent) that he can't seem to satisfy. Upon watching a locally made film he sees his double. He seeks him out only to freak out upon meeting. Why? I don't know, but they both did. Mom (Isabella Rossellini) seems to know something but pretends she doesn't. Adam is her only child.There is also the symbolism of the weird opening scene involving a number of men looking at a nude masturbating woman and a big spider. There is also a large spider looming over the city where wires and broken windshields look like a web which turns a mystery thriller into a sci-fi film.i.e This is either an odd art film filled with symbolism or science fiction...or both.Or it could be that the guy is simply bonkers living a double life which makes the whole film stupid and a waste of time.F-bomb, sex, and nudity (Mélanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon)",Enemy
6,kosmasp,Keep em close ...,10,5 August 2014,"Although it doesn't seem that our main character here has any choice/saying in all this anyway. But let's backtrack a little bit and let me rather start with an advice. If you want to watch a movie and just lay back, not wanting to think about anything, this is not the movie to watch. This movie here is something that will mess with your head and you might not like that.It's not a bad thing to admit, you don't like a movie that will challenge you and confuse you. It'll be worse watching this and thinking afterward that it was a waste of time. So you've been warned, watch at own ""risk"". Talking about risks: After (although actually produced and filmed way before) Prisoners, this is as exceptional as that movie. And with Gyllenhall ""back"", we get acting at its finest. There is a lot of image trickery and a lot of guessing. I don't think the novel this is based on will put light on it, but I haven't read it, so I can't comment on it ... This is good, it not only warrants, but demands repeat viewings ... enough said",Enemy
7,lee_eisenberg,seeing double,7,11 August 2014,"What made Denis Villeneuve's ""Enemy"" most interesting was that it didn't end how I expected it to. Throughout much of the movie I kept thinking ""I know exactly where this is going,"" but it didn't go like that. It's not a great movie, but I thought that it was worth seeing. I saw a connection to Villeneuve's ""Incendies"", in which the son and daughter of an immigrant from an unidentified Arab country try to find out their family history and get an unpleasant surprise (I viewed the movie as a look at the roots of Arab Spring). The less said about Villeneuve's disgusting ""Prisoners"", the better.So while it's not a masterpiece, it's still a fun, mind-bending movie. I've never read any of José Saramago's work but now I'd like to. Jake Gyllenhaal and Mélanie Laurent (Shoshana Dreyfuss in ""Inglourious Basterds"") have been making a lot of good movies.",Enemy
8,ma-cortes,Slow-moving and weird thriller in which a history teacher meets and subsequently is stalked by a mysterious doppelganger,6,26 May 2020,"This is an intrigue/suspense film with very good cast , being well starred Jake Gyllenhaal in director Villeneuve 's thriller in which a professor feels like he's being stalked by someone who looks just like him , and who is slowly taking over her life . It deals with a normal history professor relationship with his live-in girlfriend, Mary (Melanie Laurent) . He goes to the cinema and watches a secondary actor who looks exactly like him . Then he seeks out his exact look-alike after spotting him in a movie . He learns that the actor's stage name is Daniel Saint Claire (Jake Gyllenhaal) , whose legal name is Anthony Claire . Claire is a Toronto based actor with only a few on-screen credits, and is married to a woman named Helen (Sarah Gadon) who is currently several months pregnant. Later on , he finds her perfect life upended when she's pursued by the weird double who has her eyes set on assuming her identity . Then emerging his alter-ego and turns her life into a nightmare and moving toward a fateful encounter . You can't escape Yourself from someone more sinister? From the Director of Prisoners .A gripping psychological/supernatural thriller ; dealing with a professor whose once seemingly perfect life is upended when a mysterious double begins inserting himself in his life and he then starts to fear he's being followed by someone who shares her face . The picture appeals primarily to those fascinated by Alfred Hitchcock intrigue along with ¨Twilight Zone¨ series where mystery matters most . Nice acting by Jake Gyllenhaal in a double role , both , a professor and an actor . Jake Gyllenhaal gives perhaps one of the best screen performances in this interesting chiller-thriller about a professor who finds that her life is being taken over by his ¨double¨ . There are some fantastic images about spiders , while no explanation was given for its susprising apparition , a giant spider that is walking through the city is a reference to Louise Bourgeois' sculpture which is called 'Maman' . In Enemy (2013) director Denis explores around the concept of boundaries , explaining as follows : ¨We all have multiple identities inside of us . I think it's about the power of subconscious and how our actions represent that side of the self - and who is really in control? ¨. ¨The influence of the past on our lives and the strength of the past, is something that really impressed me and terrorized me because it means that we aren't totally in control of our actions . I think you can find power over it, but it's a process¨. ¨The landscape of a movie is part of the equation that creates the meaning of the movie. On 'Enemy', the book, which takes place in a huge massive metropolitan area that's oppressive, inspires it and it creates fear and paranoia because you feel there are too many souls around you. It gives you a claustrophobic feeling. What is unique about Toronto is there aren't a lot of filmmakers that shoot Toronto for itself - David Cronenberg did and Atom Egoyan has - so in the mind of the audience, Toronto is quite fresh¨.The motion picture was professional though slowly directed by Denis Villeneuve . This filmmaker has some peculiar trademarks as graphic and realistic depictions of violence , frequently collaborates with cinematographer Roger Deakins and he shoots long establishing shots . Denis Villeneuve is a French Canadian film director and writer . He was born in 1967, in Trois-Rivières, Québec, Canada. He started his career as a filmmaker at the National Film Board of Canada. He is best known for his feature films such as : Arrival (2016), Sicario (2015), Prisioners (2013), Incendies (2010) , Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and this Enemy (2013).",Enemy
9,Quinoa1984,"""This is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history""",9,30 April 2020,"First thought: ... Actors, man.Next: Denis Villeneuve has shown through several of his films by now a succinct and total control over crrating intrigue and mystery in his work, and Enemy is an example of using the term ""Lynchian"" in a proper context (in particular David Lynch's films from the past 25 years, and notwithstanding Isabella Rossellini in a small but important role here): doubles, consistent eerie vibes and behavior, and what Id call a patience (some may call it teasing out or over teasing) to reveal the mysteries that may or may not have an explanation (oh, and a clue seen on a video). But at the same time, Villeneuve isn't Lynch, and he creates his own potent context for this foreboding tale of surrealism and what history has to teach us.I think it isn't unimportant that one of the Jake Gyllenhaal's is a history teacher, and before he gives a lesson that feels a bit nail-on-the-head in regards to talking about history repeating itself and Marxian ""first as tragedy then as farce"" (which could explain the ending, and I won't even try to on a first viewing), he talks to his class about dictatorships and how that repression also repeats and goes on and on. I don't know if or how dictators fit in to this story, but I do think this is a tale about control over oneself and knowing (or precisely not knowing) who one is or one's place in the world. This by the way connects to other Villeneuve films like Blade Runner 2049, though here it is in 90 unnerving and often awkardly/darkly funny minutes.Enemy is also about how these two characters relate (or absolutely don't) to the women in their lives. I wanted to know more about Melanie Laurent and her dissatisfaction with Adam, and it may be enough that she just likes sex (or maybe not) and that's the relationship, but it felt underwritten - at least knowing what she can do as an actress. Better is the one for Sarah Gadon, with the actor Anthony St Claire and pregnant and the first to be contacted by the double and discover him (and holy god that is one complex but visually effective scene where she sits down by him on that bench and then is on the phone with the other). She gets more to ponder and react to and it's a wonderfully restrained performance... How again it lays into that ending, Im still scratching my head (maybe Stephen King can explain it, but I digress).And if there is a reason to watch this aside from seeing a modern master filmmaker likely having delight in creating this brooding atmosphere - from a script that knows just how to give the audience enough information to keep going, but is largely visually drawn and is all the more imaginative for it, including giving Villenueve a sort of fragmentary structure that makes the surrealism work - it's of course these *two* magnetic performances. It may also be a slightly obvious point, that one is a little more downtrodden and the other more brash and confident, but Gyllenhaal brings the truth out in everything he does - no matter how BIG it has to get dramatically (and a couple of times he has to go to a Jake LaMotta ""did you f*** my wife"" delivery)and this is no exception. He also I think finds a bit more humor (for the better) than Villeneuve may have intended, if only through those phone conversations. It's an essential film in his body of work, and amazing to think he could do this just around the same time as Nightcrawler.So strap in, try to not be too distracted watching at home or wherever (currently available on Netflix), and watch out for spiders!",Enemy
10,zardoz-13,Compelling But Enigmatic,10,23 April 2015,"French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's ""Enemy"" is a relentless compelling but enigmatic art film. This low-key thriller about two guys who swap their loves but not their lives is not only a visual treat and a genuine head-scratcher, with an outstanding performance of amazing subtlety from Jake Gyllenhaal in a dual role as a history teacher and a bit player in movies. As a history professor at a university, Adam's life is largely uneventful. He lives to lecture, grade papers, and have bouts of sex with his frustrated girlfriend. Adam's apartment in the urban sprawl of the metropolis where he resides is ultimately a reflection of his life. The premises are barren with only basic creature comforts, and he doesn't have a television. One day one of his co-workers suggests that he see a movie. You see, Adam doesn't care much for movies. Indeed, until his colleague brings up the subject, he had lived without watching a movie. The colleague recommends a film produced locally, and Adam's curiosity is large enough for him to check out the film. At some point, he realizes that the guy cast as the bellhop in this apparent comedy is his doppelganger. Sure, the guy bears an uncanny resemblance to Adam, and this prompts our protagonist to investigate his other. Unlike Adam, his double Anthony lives in a well-furnished apartment with a pregnant wife. Tension arises when Adam calls Anthony but instead gets his wife. It is only a matter of time until the two meet in a motel room. Anthony asks Adam if he has a scar. Adam sees Anthony's scar and realizes that this guy is almost a mirror image of him and he leaves in haste and struggles to resume his life. Ultimately, the two wind up sleeping with each other's girlfriend and wife. Spider imagery appears fleetingly in this interesting film. Villeneuve lets his yarn unfold without hurry and he creates atmosphere galore. Even if ""Enemy"" is opaque, the film makes you think about its mystery. Clearly, Adam and Anthony are not twins separated at birth. Nicolas Bolduc's cinematography is impeccable. Long after you've watched ""Enemy,"" you will still ponder what it means and its disturbing spider imagery. This film reminded me a lot of Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni. Like Antonioni, Villeneuve doesn't seem caught up in making something obvious and easy to understand. The daunting thing about ""Enemy"" is that it is so weird it defies comprehension and yet it is some simple and uncluttered that you understand what is happening but you aren't sure why it is happening, much less where it is going. The hopelessly heavy symbolic ending will really weird you out.",Enemy
11,grantss,"Intriguing and original plot...that, unfortunately, goes nowhere",5,3 June 2015,"Intriguing and original plot...that, unfortunately, goes nowhere.The story of a man who spots someone identical to him in a movie. Puzzled and bored he tracks him down. Intrigue ensues...This initial setup gives Enemy a very interesting start. The intrigue continues throughout the movie. Unfortunately, however, it appears that the writer hit upon a great and original plot...and then didn't know what to do with it. The movie ultimately goes nowhere, ending bizarrely and anticlimactically. It starts as a Christopher Nolan movie, ends as a David Lynch movie. (Thankfully, at least it doesn't have the length or pretentiousness of Lynch's last few movies).Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a good performance in the lead role. The two identical people don't have the same personality, making his performance even more impressive, as he had to play two different people.Having written and directed the excellent Incendies in 2010 and directing the even-better Prisoners in 2013, Denis Villeneuve can be forgiven for missing the mark for once. Still one of the more exciting directors to emerge in the last few years.",Enemy
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Haunting,8,27 September 2020,"One day, a man realises that there is someone out there who appears to be his exact double. What is the connection between them?I'm not going to go into what the deeper meaning of the film is in this review. For those looking for that kind of thing, I personally found the videos by Renegade Cut and Chris Stuckmann to help in the deciphering. I will say that I already loved this film before I was sure what it meant, and my appreciation has only grown once I understood it.Denis Villeneuve's work is not for everyone. However, if you find that you like it, in my experience, the more of it you see, the greater your urge to catch everything he's behind. He is a master of tone, of planting images and ideas in your mind that you may not understand when you first watch the movie, but which you can't stop thinking about. This has a real oppressive mood. It also has excellent acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible, as usual.This contains some strong sexuality, nudity and language. I recommend this to those who enjoy solving puzzles. 8/10",Enemy
13,george.schmidt,The Two Jakes,7,22 March 2014,"ENEMY (2014) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Melanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon, Isabella Rossellini. Bizarre, creepy and ultimately nerve-wracking suspense sci-fi thriller with Gyllenhaal pulling double duty as a sad-sack history teacher who unexpectedly finds his doppleganger (again Gyllenhaal), a seedy third-rate film actor, who he winds up stalking and inevitably intertwining his life (and vice verse) with some serious f**ked up results that echo the two Davids - Lynch (to wit Rossellini as the first Jake's chilly mom) and Cronenberg (the film takes place in his native Canada). Based on Javier Gullon's novel the screenplay by Jose Saramago has a deliberately slow-paced to the point of numbness storyline while director Denis Villeneueve (who collaborated with Gyllenhaal on last year's PRISONERS) keeps the tension as taut as a spider's web (hint/spoiler alert: several arachnid metaphors and one truly heart- stopping ending that will haunt your dreams; thanks for that!) With an industrial drone score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans and a bruised palette by cinematographer Nicolas Bolduc keeps the film very bleak and captures the unhinging of its protagonists (and arguably its audience).",Enemy

Adam learns upon first sighting that he and Anthony look exactly the same, from the facial hair to a scar each has.Their lives become intertwined as Anthony's wife ends up becoming obsessed with Adam, but in a slightly different way.......Its a bizarre film for sure, very bizarre, but you have to really see this more than once to understand its narrative, and to almost be able to interpret the story.The film is all about being faithful, and not straying off the path. As soon as we see the first spider, it isn't long before Adam 'sees' Anthony, on a screen, a reflective device.As time goes on, you realise that theses two are not doppelgängers, twins, whatever. They are one and the same person, and Anthony is Adams guilty subconscious, the part of him that eats the forbidden fruit, and in time, when they meet, he begins to come as one.The spiders could represent his cheating, or now his warning not to cheat. The spider could be his weakness, and whenever we see the arachnid, this could specify his weakness almost getting the better of him.It's not and easy watch, the first time I saw it, I thought it was just trying to be another Fight Club clone, but it deserves a little but more respect than that.It's well acted, clever, and most of all, highly original.",Enemy
15,gradyharp,'Chaos is order yet undeciphered',10,27 September 2014,"Portuguese author José Saramago (1922 – 2010), whose celebrated novels can be seen as allegories and commonly present subversive perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the human factor (BLINDNESS, SEEING, THE STONE RAFT, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO Jesus Christ, DEATH WITH INTERRUPTIONS, THE CAVE, ALL THE NAMES, CAIN etc), published THE DOUBLE in 2002: it took more than 10 years before being transformed for the screen by Javier Gullón and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve. For those who remain under the spell of Saramago's strange and seductively intelligent writing this film will satisfy. For those who prefer linear story lines of everyday possibilities the film will likely not find an appreciative audience. This is a film that demands the full attention of the viewer and the acceptance of alternative ways of viewing reality and alternative reality.Living in Toronto, Adam Bell Jake Gyllenhaal) is a college history professor, a loner, routiner, whose contact with the world outside the classroom is limited to life with his live in girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent). A fellow teacher (Joshua Peace), apparently attempting to open Adam's vistas, recommends he watch films and recommends a particular film to Adam. When Adam watches the film he notes an actor playing a bellhop who looks like Adam. He becomes obsessed with finding out about this double of his. He learns that the actor's stage name is Daniel Saint Claire, whose legal name is Anthony Claire (again Jake Gyllenhaal). Claire is a Toronto based actor with only a few on-screen credits, and is married to a woman named Helen (Sarah Gadon) who is six months pregnant. Adam becomes obsessed with meeting Claire, who he learns upon first sighting that they look exactly the same, from the facial hair to a scar each has, but Claire who seemingly better adjusted than Adam. Their lives become intertwined as Claire himself ends up becoming obsessed with Adam, but in a slightly different way. Is Adam viewing his alternate real self (a married man with a child on the way) and escaping his reality with an affair with Mary? It is left for the viewer to decide. The atmosphere created by the actors (Gyllenhaal is excellent as are Laurent, Gadon, and Isabella Rossellini who plays Claire's - or Adam's? - mother), the cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc and the music score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans are stunning. The introduction of a tarantula motif adds further mystery to this vivid film. A film for adventuresome thinkers who enjoy being challenged. Grady Harp, September 14",Enemy
16,zetes,Interesting,7,17 December 2014,"Denis Villeneuve's follow-up to Prisoners appeared in Toronto around the same time Prisoners hit multiplexes last year. It wasn't widely released in theaters (and was actually on torrent sites over a month before it debuted in the US - IMDb hilariously lists its internet debut). Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a college professor and an actor, exact doubles. When the professor is recommended a movie by a colleague, he spots a bit actor who looks identical to him. He tracks his double down, but quickly realizes it's a huge mistake when the guy turns out to be kind of aggressive. Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon play their respective significant others. The film has the feeling of a nightmare (occasionally actual nightmares are depicted). I actually kind of liked this, but I'll admit up front I don't think it entirely works. It's a tad on the slow side and Villeneuve does too much to insist upon the nightmarishness of it. The score is particularly overbearing in this way, like it's saying, ""Holy crap, how weird is this stuff?"" Gyllenhaal is pretty good in it (though nowhere near hitting upon his Nightcrawler brilliance). Gadon is a real stunner - I've seen her before - Hell, this isn't even the first movie I've seen her in this week (she was also in Belle) - but her gorgeousness is hard to miss here. The other, similar movie that has been released this past year, Richard Ayoade's The Double, starring Jesse Eisenberg, is quite superior to this.",Enemy
17,Mr-Fusion,Velleneuve's mind-screw,7,10 June 2019,"Let me offer no notions of pretense here, I didn't get ""Enemy""; not even close. I had no idea what was going on with the spider, which made the ending cut-to-black all the more upsetting. All of this changed after some time to process (and with much-needed help from Chris Stuckmann's video on the matter). It's a movie that demands active participation and further consideration, and if you're up to the challenge, it's a worthwhile endeavor.But even while watching this, I appreciated the movie on its technical merits. It's beautifully shot (especially if yellow's your color), and Jake Gyllenhaal is fascinating in a dual-role.

So maybe the director here simply adopted the idea of 'the double' and ran with it fairly loosely to see where it would go. It doesn't go very far. Lots of people look like other people, nobody is the exact same but I'm not sure that makes for anything so here we must be intended to make something more of the pair played by Jake Gyllenhaal. If these were teenage boys (or more likely girls) I could understand the desperate search for self but it seems rather pathetic at this age. Perhaps this is something that is affecting a part lost generation. Too much time has been spent on drugs and electronic devices, no personality development has been possible. Could be but however sympathetically we are presented with this seeming terrible dilemma, I can't help but imagine that only those similarly 'lost' will empathise. Not being i the least at ease with this film, I also don't understand why it had to be so ugly, shot entirely in mud colours, or why Melanie Laurent's character seems to be the only one who seems to have the least grip on reality. It seemed significant that in the interviews, presented as 'extras' on the Blu-ray, she seemed the only one, director included, who seemed to have any grasp on what she was doing.",Enemy
19,namashi_1,A Challenging Thriller! Jake Gyllenhaal is Superb!,6,9 December 2014,"Loosely adapted by Javier Gullón from José Saramago's 2002 novel The Double, 'Enemy' is A Challenging Thriller, that arrests & shocks you. But, this isn't a fast-moving thrill-ride with heart-pounding sequences, this one's a dark, lazily paced psychological thriller, that demands you to be patient & focused. 'Enemy' Synopsis: A disturbed man seeks out his exact look-alike after spotting him in a movie. 'Enemy' is about finding answers within yourself. Javier Gullón's Adapted Screenplay tells us a complicated story about a man's search for his own madness. And to be honest, the narrative begins well, but somewhere in the second-act, the pace just begins to lose. I wasn't engaged all through, thanks to the leisurely pace. But I was more than shocked by the time it culminated. The climax is shocking, to say the least. Denis Villeneuve's Direction is grim, adapting the film's bleak mood, superbly. Cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc is beautifully dark. Editing by Matthew Hannam is slow-moving, but he shapes up & ends the film at a crisp 88-minutes, nonetheless.Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal is Superb. He enacts both the parts, with terrific diversity. He's emerged into such a fine, versatile actor! Mélanie Laurent is restrained. Sarah Gadon is excellent. Isabella Rossellini shines in a tiny cameo. On the whole, 'Enemy' isn't a perfect film, but it definitely makes you think beyond your imagination.",Enemy
20,lasttimeisaw,A brilliant head-scratcher,8,19 July 2014,"ENEMY is Denis Villeneuve's back-to-back psychological drama with PRISONER (2013, 8/10), treads the water of a doppelgänger sub-genre, it is a neatly gripping head-scratcher hoisted by its jaw-dropping anti-climax (literally the flabbergasted final scene), and confidently beckons for repeated viewings, running succinctly within 90 minutes, Villeneuve knows how to play his game perfectly. Critics calls it Lynchesque or Cronenbergian, not in the least because of its copious spider- related metaphor, I don't like to put a label on it, but indeed it is a film leaves you to ruminate on what is going on and more brilliantly, the clues are actually quite approachable if one's memory serves well. I only watched it once by the time I am writing this review, I will be as frank as possible to let my understandings flow. Some may call ENEMY is a pretentious grandstander since it deliberately breaks loose the narrative consistence and uses eye-catching images to lure audience in. It might be true in some level, but compared to Shane Carruth's more oblique UPSTREAM COLOR (2013, 7/10), ENEMY is immensely forthcoming, Jake Gyllenhaal plays two characters, the college professor Adam and the third-rate actor Anthony, Laurent is Adam's girlfriend and Gadon is Anthony's pregnant wife, and the unification of Adam and Anthony strikes quite clearly in the middle-point of the film when they finally meet each other, they are not twins, they are the same person, the question now remains, which one is real if there is no clone-technology involved? Or perhaps more mystifying, neither of them, it is the product of a mental malfunction, such as schizophrenia, resolves into two difference personalities.One thing is for sure, Jake (I refer him as Jake since both Adam and Anthony are part of his id) is under some serious mental pressure, maybe it is his upcoming fatherhood puts him in cold feet, he has severe commitment issues, or his compulsive cheating with his wife, near the end, the car-crash is a manifest to terminate his adultery and in a parallel time, his wife finally accepts him and welcome him back, everything goes clear. The next morning, his own demon is released again when Jake finally opens the envelope, it is the new key to the sex club (shown in the surreal opening scenes), an invitation to resume his sex-addictive life pattern, as he refers in his lecture, Hegel says the pattern always repeats itself, the first time as a tragedy and the second time it is a farce, so in the coda, when he accepts the invitation, it initiates the same pattern again, and what he encounters in the bedroom is a total farce, eventually he cannot outrun his deep-rooted dependency. Gyllenhaal is sterling here as in PRISONER, fully emanates the nuances although Adam and Anthony have literally the same person, the only distinction can tell them apart from appearance hinges on that Anthony is more well-dressed and Adam is sloppier. But characteristically, Anthony is aggressive and Adam is a put-upon, initially you can always sense the difference, but soon you will question which Jake is on-screen since some rather eerie signals popping up, and the otherworldly score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans boosts the mystery too. Gadon is another key player in the game (and Mélanie Laurent is criminally under-utilized here as in many of her English-speaking projects), it is her unusual reaction towards the situation arises our alert. She is the one knows crystal clear what is happening to her husband, she plays along meticulously in order to lead him back to the normal life, she almost succeeds. Gadon acts out splendidly to unremittingly remind us things are not what they look, acutely corresponds to the pivotal maxim shows on screen in the beginning ""chaos is order yet undeciphered"". Denis Villeneuve's ENEMY is an intricate mind game sets in a muted palette, its magnetism peaks at the highest volume when you finish it for the first time, it is an exceedingly welcome experience any cinephile is seeking for, better, at night.",Enemy
21,KineticSeoul,Thought provoking without being pretentious,7,23 May 2014,"This is a drawn out film that tells a simple story with clever imagery, twist and turns. You have to really focus on everything to figure out what is going on. I did like the cinematography and music, which adds creepy and psychedelic imagery throughout the story. I like these types of movies that keeps the audiences thinking on what is going on through it's progression. However I have seen it done in a more intriguing and entertaining manner in other films. This just didn't seem to lack the thrills and suspense. After the first watch through, I could get the gist of this movie. But it just didn't have that push to get me interested in seeing it twice or more like ""Fight Club"" or ""Triangle"" which are films that deals with the subconscious as well. And that is what this movie is about, the subconscious of Jake Gyllenhaal. It took a few readings to figure out what this movie is exactly about and I thought it was clever, but nothing mind-blowing. I just wasn't all that amazed with the final design, it's cool but nothing groundbreaking. The cool factor comes not from the total package, but because of the subtle hints. And I did like how this isn't a super pretentious art house movie with random things going on, but most of the imagery in this has relevance to the story. This isn't a movie I want to see twice to find all the bread crumbs. It's still a well executed film and it's thought provoking without pretentious crap thrown in. Just because it's a movie riddled with puzzles and because finding out how the puzzles fit together doesn't necessary make it a great movie for me. The main aspect I found interesting about this movie though, is how it delves into the mind of many men. Thus making the character relatable in that sense.7.5/10",Enemy
22,Hellmant,Directed with great Hitchcockian style!,9,3 April 2014,"'ENEMY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Jake Gyllenhaal stars in this Hitchcock style thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Javier Gullón. It's based on the 2002 book ('The Double') by José Saramago. The story revolves around a school teacher who becomes obsessed with finding his doppelganger, after seeing him in a movie. Gyllenhaal plays both characters and it's his second time working with Villeneuve; after last year's critically acclaimed 'PRISONERS'. The movie also costars Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon (who are both beautiful and good in the film). I found the movie to be very compelling and extremely involving; highlighted by another stellar performance from Jake Gyllenhaal (one of my favorite actors).Gyllenhaal plays Adam Bell and Anthony St. Claire in the film. Adam is a college history teacher and Anthony is an aspiring actor and the two are physical doppelgangers of each other (looking and sounding exactly alike). Adam discovers Anthony as an extra in a film he rents one night (due to a recommendation from another professor). After internet searching his apparent double Adam becomes obsessed with Anthony and begins stalking him. He calls him several times, causing Anthony to threaten to call the police, but eventually he persuades him to meet. When the two do meet their lives are suddenly forever changed and so are their loved ones (Laurent and Gadon).The film doesn't have a lot of action or any conventional suspense but it always seems gloomy and dramatically intense. It's directed with great Hitchcockian style and the performances are all good (especially Gyllenhaal). I can't say the story is really that interesting but the way it's presented is totally intriguing (thanks largely to the fact that I cared so much about the characters). That's what truly makes it memorable; how much you become obsessed with the people in the movie (just like they become obsessed with each other). There are some truly classic images as well and it's a film I can't wait to see again. It leaves you with a lot to think about and figure out, and you'll probably never quite do it, but you'll love trying to!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ",Enemy
23,Buddy-51,Thought-provoking existentialist thriller,8,1 November 2014,"What would it be like if you could swap identities with another person and have no one be the wiser?That's the opportunity Adam Bell has handed to him in ""Enemy,"" a psychological thriller based on the novel ""The Double"" by Jose Saramago.Bell is a history professor living in Quebec whose day-to-day existence could not be more humdrum and mundane. He's as bored by the rote lectures he delivers to his benumbed students as he is by the woman he's currently dating. Then one day he espies what appears to be his doppelganger acting in a bit part in a movie he's rented. Bell suddenly becomes obsessed with meeting his double, a feeling that becomes strangely mutual after Bell makes contact with the initially suspicious actor, Anthony Clare, who eventually becomes as intrigued by their uncanny similarity as Bell is.With its tale of two strangers whose lives become inextricably entwined due to an incredible fluke of nature, ""Enemy"" draws upon such diverse sources as Kafka, Pirandello, Hitchcock, De Palma and Cronenberg for its inspiration and style - and throws in some subtle little homages to ""Through a Glass Darkly"" (in the penultimate shot) and ""Blow-Up""( in the intense rustling of the trees), for added flavor. And writer Javier Gullon and director Denis Villenueve do full justice to those sources.It's an existential thriller that delves into such issues as alternate universes, schizophrenia, and the possibility of personality and identity transference. The last is a theme that has been explored in such movies as Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona,"" as well as Robert Altman's ""Images"" and ""Three Women,"" to name just a few. ""Enemy"" never allows us to accept anything we see at face value. We're never entirely sure that what is taking place on screen is really happening or whether it's all just the result of an elaborate form of mental illness, a possibility made all the more plausible by the shocking and perplexing final moment of the movie. And can two identical objects occupy space in the same universe, or does one have to eliminate the other in order to survive? And who will be the victor in the end?Jake Gyllenhaal gives a nervy performance in the dual role of the professor and the actor, with the distaff side represented by Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon as the women in the men's lives and Isabella Rossellini as Bell's mother in what amounts to little more than a cameo appearance in the movie.With its stark surrealism and air of off-kilter creepiness, ""Enemy"""" has a way of insinuating itself into your subconscious and leaving you a bit rattled after its over. It sure makes you look at the world in a different way. And what more could you ask from a movie?",Enemy

25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Make friends with your enemy.,9,11 July 2018,"This enigmatic and ominous art-house thriller is nothing short of an experience. 'Enemy (2013)' is an incredibly nuanced and involving mystery that requires work to unravel but rewards your attention (and analysis) with a multitude of meanings and a plethora of possible interpretations each as valid as the last, building to become quite the conundrum of a film considering it can be two (almost) entirely different events depending on whether or not you've seen it before and whether or not you're willing to take things on more than just their face value - which, incidentally, also work wonderfully well even without the, arguably, intended 'double meaning' applied. Regardless of your interpretation, the amount of allegory and intrigue is astonishing and the fact that it gets so under your skin is nothing short of admirable, as is its ability to stay there and make you contemplate it for literal days on end.

26,dromasca,mirror games,9,4 May 2021,"I like Denis Villeneuve's movies. He is one of the directors who manages to combine quality and audience success. I had not seen before 'Enemy' (filmed in 2013) and now, after watching it, I got a favourite among the Canadian director's films. At least so far. At only 90 minutes, 'Enemy' is somewhat of an exception in Villeneuve's career, a film that can baffle and disappoint part of the audiences who applaud his highly successful films. Not me. Starting from a novel by Portuguese writer Jose Saramago, Villeneuve created a psychological and erotic thriller that can be interpreted in different ways not only by each viewer but also by the same viewer every time it is watched, or every time we think about it. It is one of those movies that accompanies their viewers even after watching. There are quite a lot of decoding variants of the film and explanations of some scenes or metaphors present in 'Enemy' that can be read on the Internet. I can also add a few different ones that came to my mind during or after watching.What happens on screen? Apparently, it's a simple story. Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor at a university in Toronto, a not-so-enthusiastic and not-so-inspired professor who teaches courses on the history of dictatorships and mental control over the population of these societies. He lives in a not very tidy apartment and maintains a relationship which seems mainly based on sex and not too happy with a beautiful blonde. He is not a fan of cinema (lack of time? Lack of enthusiasm?) but a colleague recommends him a movie to watch on DVD. With this occasion, he discovers the existence of an actor, Anthony, who seems to be his perfect copy. Anthony is not a very successful actor, but he seems well placed materially (his house is much more luxurious and tidy than Adam's), he also has a relationship with a beautiful blonde with whom he is married, who is also pregnant, and to whom he is not very faithful. The two will meet. I stop here, not only because I don't want to commit the sin of revealing the plot of a thriller, but also because whatever I tell, even what I've written so far, is just one of the many possible interpretations of what viewers see. The movie is a combination of dream and reality, with surreal symbols and thriller elements, a game of mirrors but not with a single mirror (the hero and his copy) but several, each creating a possible reality.Denis Villeneuve managed to make a special and mysterious film, which is interpreted and lived differently by each of its viewers. He is helped not only by the clever writing of the script but also by the impeccable acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, an actor I really like, and whose double role Adam / Anthony allows him to perform a recital of ambiguity, insecurity, confrontation between real and imaginary. Appearing in a supporting role is an actress that I love a lot, from another generation, Isabella Rossellini. Hers is a role that includes one single scene and one phone call, both providing possible keys to interpreting the story. There are a few horror moments and horror props (borrowed from the art of Louise Bourgeois) in the film, but the most hallucinatory effect is created by the cinematography combining the functional grey of the urban environment with a yellow reminding the sandstorms from the Sahara, for those who experienced such events. 'Enemy' is a film that deserves to be watched and watched again, but which also deserves to be lived again in the imagination and thought about after watching.",Enemy
27,ThomasDrufke,Twisted Psychological Thriller,6,27 August 2014,"I initially heard about Enemy due to it being the same director that had just done Prisoners the year before. After seeing Prisoners in theater it became clear that Villeneuve was great a directing thrilling and shocking scenes. I watched the schmoes review of Enemy and heard it was just as shocking and strangely intriguing as Prisoners so I gave it a shot. It is much more of a psychological thriller than I had expected. And much like Prisoners, the film is led by the brilliant performances of its lead actors.Jake Gyllenhaal was astounding in Prisoners and he was just as great in Enemy. His ability to play both characters differently but also keep them similar enough to bend our minds was a pleasure to watch. The girlfriend and the wife were also well played. Unfortunately that's about it in terms of actors. Because of how the movie ends, it's very hard for me to write this review without accidentally spoiling something. There are many interpretations going around about what the true meaning of this film is and what the heck are all those spiders doing in the movie. But I have done my research and just began to understand the deeper meaning.This is definitely a film which will take a few watches to fully understand, unfortunately for me I don't think I enjoyed it enough to want to sit through it again. The performances are top notch, the directing is captivating and I appreciate the hidden clues. But sometimes a film can be just a little bit too confusing for me. When I watch a film I like to be enlightened on a particular subject and at the same time be entertained in whatever genre is present. Enemy just about confused me more than any other film.

28,g-bodyl,A Crafty Psychological Thriller!,8,1 March 2015,"Denis Villeneuve made a name for himself in my book after the fantastic 2013 thriller, Prisoners. Enemy is a different kind of thriller, more of a sub-conscious, psychological thriller. The movie itself is well-made and features strong acting. But in order to truly understand the movie, it may warrant multiple viewings. There are some confusing portions, and one may ask about the spider scenes. These spider scenes, I believe, show the lack of commitment our main character has and how influential it is to the story. Villeneuve's latest film is about a history professor named Adam Bell, who leads a depressed life. He becomes obsessed when he watches a movie that features a man who looks exactly like him named Daniel. As he is trying to figure out who Daniel is, he becomes even more obsessed with meeting him. Daniel feels the same way, but for different reasons. The film is well-acted. Jake Gyllenhaal, in the prime of his career, tackles another challenging role where he plays dual personalities. He does a fine job sorting through a plethora of emotions in both roles, mainly obsession. I also liked Sarah Gadon as Daniel's confused pregnant wife and Melanie Laurent as Adam's live-in girlfriend. Overall, Enemy is a solid thriller that may offer different views of the films reality each time you watch it. The movie also shows how the mind works and how it can affect the reality of a person. It's a confusing movie, but it's smart and it may need another screening or two to fully understand the concepts of the movie. My Grade: B+",Enemy
29,secondtake,Only mind boggling if you haven't seen very many movies...a dull affair!!,4,21 July 2014,"Enemy (2013)A simple clever idea—that a man discovers another man exactly like him out there —that gets pulled to the breaking point. And then becomes indulgent and disappointing. Finally, the plot turns into a huge sham—on purpose—and if you suspected this even slightly earlier on you'll be angry at all the wasted time. On top of everything, the plot is slow, and the acting beyond the solid performance(s) by Jake Gyllenhaal is wobbly at best.So does anything recommend this movie? Maybe not! Not with much better mind game movies out there, from ""Memento"" and ""Fight Club"" on down. Yes, this is in that category, but don't be fooled into thinking it has the energy or inventiveness of either. If ""Memento"" is quiet and searching as it gets willfully confusing (and wonderfully so), ""Enemy"" is just plain slow. This is meant to draw you into the tension of the main character(s) as he(they) figure out what's going on. But it just gets needlessly heavy. The filming might have rescued this somewhat, but the director chose to go low- key and dull, as if emphasizing the dullness of the character(s). Director Denis Villeneuve has for me been a mixed bag. His direct and slightly sensational ""Prisoners"" is solid, if overrated, and his ""Incendies"" is (to me) underrated, but both of these (and this current film) are striving to go places, and that's worth a lot in my book. In the end, the idea in ""Enemy"" isn't such a big deal after all. Even the attempt at depth in the title (if you care to figure it out once done) is thin.

30,A_Different_Drummer,Imagine you have a gift...,7,3 May 2014,"Hollywood has become so predictable and so formulaic over the last few decades -- take a franchise and beat it to death until it becomes unrecognizable, put the same star in every possible role until even his fans can't stand him anymore -- that we occasionally forget there are real film makers out there with real talent, film makers who have the ability to impact their audience without the need for formula or name talent. Clearly, one such talent is Villeneuve, who can literally take the most mundane action (drinking coffee, looking out a window, writing on a blackboard) and imbue it with multiple shades of meaning. This is not a common skill. Hitchcock had it. De Palma had it (for all the good it did him). So, assuming you have this gift, what do you do with it? It is interesting to note another recent release, Blue Ruin, where we have yet another director with a very special talent. But there the similarity ends. In Blue Ruin, the director ultimately produced a spectacular piece of entertainment, the audience is hooked until the final scene. Villeneuve has gone a different route. The source material and indeed the movie itself are shockingly self-indulgent and, at the end of the day, not especially satisfying. Sure Gyllenhaal does a great job but that is not enough. At the end of the film, the audience has more in common with a passing motorist who ""rubbernecks"" a crash site (double meaning intended) than a film-goer who has just been entertained.",Enemy

Which will also lead to disappointment for the majority because it was detached from entertainment in the far distance. You can call it an art movie, but the materials used for the story were somehow stronger. I mean for the grown ups and especially for a man with patience. It deal about a middle aged man and his world of desires towards sex and irresponsibility in the life he lives.It was adapted from a novel called 'The Double'. Looks like the title was not available then changed it to 'Enemy'. Not a bad title either, but slightly misleads especially after watcher 'Prisoners'. Adam is a history professor and his life is a less joyous. His mother is worried about him for being careless.

Both were symbolically exposed its identity and rest of the things leaves for the audience to observe closely, otherwise you will miss the important point.I yet to watch 'The Double', the description kind of match to this. Nowadays this thing keeps happening frequently like recently ones 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'White House Down'. Anyway, Jake Gyllenhaal was awesome in this movie. Almost 90 per cent of the movie frames had captured his presence. Without a doubt its a one man show. He's becoming a great personality in Hollywood, but it was not a Hollywood flick.

35,zkonedog,The Greatest Puzzle-Narrative Film I've Ever Seen,10,4 March 2017,"Before I start this review, there is a very specific caveat that must be made: Are you the movie-goer who likes to mentally check out for your cinematic entertainment? If so, there's nothing wrong with that. However, If that describes your film taste, run as fast as you can in the other direction right now! This is not the movie for you. In fact, it will likely be one of the worst movie you have ever seen.Conversely, if you enjoy a movie that requires a great deal of thought and contemplation to truly be enjoyed, ""Enemy"" will be akin to catnip.For a very basic overview (if such a thing is possible for a film like this), ""Enemy"" tells the story of Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a college professor who one night, while watching a flick, discovers his doppleganger Anthony (also Gyllenhaal) within it. Adam tracks down Anthony, the two meet, and the tension/mystery continues to build, especially when a girlfriend (Melanie Laurent) and wife (Sarah Gadon), respectively, become part of the odd proceedings.Like I said, this is a movie for deep-thinkers. I'm not trying sound pretentious, but rather just stating a simple fact in this case. It was released to primarily art-house theaters and has no interest in appealing to a mass, generic audience. That is simply built into the equation. If you are not ""dialed in"" at all times (no texting, multi-tasking, or distractions of any kind), the whole thing will be indecipherable. Every detail could be (and likely is) important when all is said and done.Of course, all of the above isn't to say that this is a ponderous or dull film in any sense. The production value is high (any Dennis Villeneuve effort will feature that), the acting is great, the cinematography is unique, and the music is brilliantly quirky. There are a lot of auxiliary pleasures here, but again: to even try and understand the plot takes a great deal of thought.I've now seen ""Enemy"" 3-4 times, and with every viewing comes a slightly different interpretation of its events/themes. I'm convinced it cannot be ""figured out"" in any traditional sense. So much is left up to viewer interpretation, yet that is never a disappointment if one is playing along.Overall, ""Enemy"" is the type of film that may have to grow on you a bit. The first time I watched it? No way would I consider giving it 10 stars. But after much thought and multiple viewings, I've been able to suss out the remarkable craftsmanship put into the effort. There are not too many movies floating around that can prompt such deep thought and evaluation, and if you are up for that sort of thing, this one will quickly become a crown jewel in your collection.",Enemy

He's the sum of two men!). Adam is a professor. In a class of few students, he writes ""chaos"" onto a blackboard and other important words spring from that organized source: ""chaos."" Adam circles them and talks of history repeating itself.",Enemy
37,eddie_baggins,"A slowburning gem, a must watch",10,6 July 2014,"Mysterious, meticulously made and acted, moodily scored and movie making at it's finest and most daring; upon watching Enemy you get the sense that what you are witnessing is a great film, but just how great a film you will decipher after the shocking ending and subsequent credits have finished rolling around in your head. Don't doubt those willing to accept Denis Villeneuve's film for what it is, as I very quickly established after exiting the cinema we have a new genre classic on our hands and therefore one of the years best but sadly lesser seen movies.To talk too much about Enemy's finely woven plot would be a huge disservice to the film and its makers and also viewers yet to partake in it's unique and quite boundless intricacies. Enemy works on many levels and it's steering hand is the ever amazing Denis Villeneuve, who after this effort and his previous films Prisoners and Incendies has quickly established himself as one of the most gifted and brave directors working today. Villeneuve's Enemy is filmed articulately and with great sense of purpose, giving the film the oft sought after vibe of a 1970′s thriller that works to great effect with the story of Adam and his quest for answers in a mysterious web that you will be wholly caught up in. With the character of Adam, Villeneuve needed an actor on top of his game and after their great collaboration in Prisoners its fantastic to see a new director/actor partnership building with himself and the arguably never better Jake Gyllenhaal.Playing two roles at once has never been an easy acting task, yet here Gyllenhaal can not be faulted in what is a performance that with the right marketing (and in lieu of movie politics) is certainly award worthy. Gyllenhaal inhabits both his roles with a vigour scarcely seen in acting these days, and the places in which his Adam goes to and we the audience discover with him are completely and utterly brilliantly played by the actor. It would of been easy for an actor to get lost in material that is not afraid to mess with logic and time, use symbolism as not only a red herring but a solidified story component and take audiences off guard with some downright confronting subject matters. It's a credit to all involved that Enemy works the way in which it does without giving off an easy-to-read explanations or conformance to what we expect as a modern day movie loving public.An absolute gem of a movie that is destined for a long life in the echelons of cult movie fandom, Enemy is a movie worthy of all the praise it may get and unquestionably more than it will receive thanks to its low key release and heavy subject. One of the most unique and downright masterful movies you're likely to witness this year with an ending that surely must go down as an all time classic, Enemy is a film that should be on your must-watch list and if you find yourself unsure of what it's all about upon conclusion research into this tale will only increase your appreciation for what is an extremely smart and near perfectly executed tale dealing with issues that in the modern day and age are all too familiar.5 mysterious envelopes out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Enemy
38,leonblackwood,Storyline was all over the place! 3/10,3,22 February 2015,"Review: At first, I didn't have a clue were this film was going, especially with the weird beginning and when the whole plot starts to unfold, I was still totally lost. I think that it's about a man who cheats on his wife and has a hard time dealing with his sub-consciousness but I might be totally wrong. It could be about a man who has a look-a-like and tries to find out more about this mysterious person.When they finally come face to face they realise that they look exactly like each other and from there I got totally lost. On top of that, there's these weird scenes with big spiders and a key, which I sill don't understand and their's these 2 ladies in his life which also complicate the storyline. As I was busy concentrating on something else whilst watching the movie, I might have missed some important bits of the storyline which might of explained what the hell was going on but I personally think that the director was trying to be over clever with the whole thing. I didn't like the seedy dark tone that was set from the very beginning but Jake Gyllenhaal played his part well even though I was lost throughout the movie. At the end of the day, I don't think that I have the patience to sit through the movie again to try and understand what was going on so it has to go down as a big disappointment from my point of view. If there is someone out there that thinks that I have missed something special, then please let me know because I honestly thought that it was a total waste of time. Over complicated and pretty boring!    Round-Up: I don't think that I have honestly seen Jake Gyllenhaal play any interesting roles that would make him stand out from the rest. His claim to fame has to be Donnie Darko, which made him a household name, and with movies like Brokeback Mountain and the great End Of Watch, he has definitely picked some versatile roles which will get him more work in the future. The problem is that he acts the same in most of his movies, even though he has had the chance to really shine in films like Jarhead and Zodiac. Thats not to say that he's a bad actor or that he doesn't put in good performances, it's just that he hasn't really come out of his shell yet. In this film I don't think that he had the chance to make an old time classic but he could have made his character a bit more interesting, which is probably down to the director. He did give it a go in the awful Prince Of Persia and the watchable Prisoner but I personally think that his best performance to date has to be his role in End Of Watch. At 34, he still has a chance to become a proper A-Lister so if he carries on picking the right roles, I'm sure that it will happen soon.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $3.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their mysterious dramas about a school teacher who sees his double on TV and gets obsessed with tracking the man down. 3/10",Enemy
39,Ed-Shullivan,Horror-able artsy fartsy crappola,3,19 May 2020,"A very disappointing film that delivered one of the worst endings I have ever watched. I wish I could convince other people to not waste their time watching this piece of junk but eh', sometimes like driving by a tragic ten (10) car pile up on the freeway most people can't look away, they just have to see it for themselves.I could see where this film was taking its audience after the first opening thirty (30) minutes but I insisted to Mrs. Shullivan to just hang in there because of the high IMDB rating of 6.9 from over 157 thousand IMDB ratings.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a dual role who apparently witnesses his own doppleganger in a movie scene he is watching on TV so he goes to extreme lengths to confront his doppleganger that results in an over dramatic confrontation between the two Jake Gyllenhaal's.The irritating music score is continual throughout the film and the horrible ending could not have come soon enough. How can so many IMDB reviewers have scored this piece of crap so high as to provide an average IMDB rating of 6.9 is beyond my understanding.Heck even the artsy fartsy crowd who rated the abysmal 1977 David Lynch film Eraserhead a 7.4 IMDB rating had enough sense to rate Enemy at least a bit lower at 6.9, but eh who am I to judge. If you like staring at bad car accidents than this crap film Enemy should be right up your alley.As for my own taste in films, I cannot with good conscience rate it any higher than a poorly rated IMDB 3.0 out of 10.0. It was horror-able!",Enemy
40,Vartiainen,We are forever trapped within our own lives,7,29 July 2019,"Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an unassuming history teacher that lives a monotonous life with few expectations. But then his calm life is shattered into pieces when he spots his exact lookalike in a rented feature film. He makes the effort to find this man and in the process throws his life into turmoil.Denis Villeneuve has always been very much a hit-or-miss director film for me. I've loved his forays into science fiction genre with Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, but I've also actively hated his drama films, such as Prisoners or Sicario. There's a very distinct difference between them, at least in my mind. As such it was something of a shock for me to watch this film, because it was so good. While still being very much a drama. Sure, it has some surrealist elements to it, but I still wouldn't classify it as science fiction.And it's not like the film is all that different from Villeneuve's other drama films. The colour palate is still very muted, very washed, while still being amazingly expressive and striking. The camera work is still top notch, from framing to angles.The story is also pretty bleak, but there is one key difference to his other drama films. Enemy doesn't seem to actively hate humanity. It's not a happy film, but neither is it a nihilistic one.I also really like the surrealist elements of the film. It's a film about identities, about boundaries that we build to keep the different aspects of our life separate. And it handles it all with aplomb and guile. Very much a film where a second viewing will only help.Worth a watch if you're a Villeneuve fan, but also if you've not liked his other features. This just might convince you.",Enemy
41,robert-temple-1,"Really sinister and creepy, and very pretentious",2,13 July 2017,"This is a very disturbing and 'dark' film. It is based upon the novel THE DOUBLE by the Portuguese writer José Saramago (1922-2010), who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998. Before seeing the film I had tried to read the novel, but gave it up because I found Saramago's style so suffocatingly affected and false that I took against him as a writer, believing him to be a 'pseud'. This film is even worse than the book. It is really, really dark. And I mean in the literal sense as well as in the metaphorical sense. So many of the interior scenes are lit by only a single lamp, shot through what seems to have been a thick yellow filter, that the action seems to be taking place at the bottom of a fish tank. This must definitely have been due to an intentional desire to portray an all-pervading gloom, and thus create 'atmosphere'. But how can you have breathable atmosphere at the bottom of a fish tank? It gets worse. The theme is of a man, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who sees an extra in a film who seems to be his double. He tracks him down and speaks to him on the phone and realizes that their voices are also identical. Eventually they meet. Naturally, Gyllenhaal plays both characters. He does very well in differentiating between them in terms of his walk and his body language. That was very clever. Well done, Gyllenhaal! Not an easy thing to do in a subtle fashion! But the film is simply an exercise in gloom and doom all the way through, in the pursuit of the French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's mistaken conception for this project of 'atmosphere' (something about which Arletty could tell him a thing or two, to help him along). Villeneuve is a very talented director, as he has shown with INCENDIES (2010) and SICARIO (2015, see my review). But here he has sunk to the bottom of the fish tank in thick murk. (Murk is not a word which I often get to use, nice to dust it off.) The film is clearly meant to be surrealistic, though surrealistic in a bad sense. Ultimately, I view both the story and the film as pointless and pretentious. Saramago is such a disappointment. What a decline he represents from the high points of Portuguese literature, Luis de Camões, Fernando Pessoa (with his 103 personalities), Camilo Castel Branco, and Eça de Queirós! This film is definitely not worth bothering with.",Enemy
42,jtindahouse,Almost too brilliant for its own good,9,21 October 2016,"Occasinally you come a across a film, much like 'Eyes Wide Shut' or 'Memento', that simply demands multiple viewings to fully understand and appreciate it in its entirety. Or if you're like me and don't have the time to watch it over and over, you read endless analysis of it until you understand it to a satisfying degree. 'Enemy' is certainly one of those films. Interestingly, I notice its score on IMDb isn't overly high, again much like 'Eyes Wide Shut'. I suspect a lot of that is down to people who simply don't have the time or energy to analyse a film, and therefore see only the top layer and never get the chance to fully appreciate the genius that is behind it all. That's an unfortunate, yet understandable side effect of incredibly complex films.What I like most about 'Enemy' (which also happens to be the one thing 'Eyes Wide Shut' was lacking) is that it has a fascinating mystery at the centre of it, which anyone will be be able to appreciate and find absorbing. Then from there you delve into the deeper layers. What's real, what's not, what does 'x' mean, what does 'y' mean. It's all there and it all makes sense, there's no doubt about that. It's an intricate ""web"" (couldn't resist) that all fits together perfectly to make for a sensational film.",Enemy
43,tadpole-596-918256,Donnie Dorko . . .,8,27 March 2014,". . . without ""Tears for Fears"" to back him up. Based on a Kafkaesque novel, ENEMY serves primary to rip the cover off Canada. Boldly proclaiming its Canadian-Ness, this flick is filmed in a Toronto which could be mistaken for any Eastern Bloc eyesore of the 1980s. The filmmakers' ""warts and all"" approach to the setting blankets nearly every outdoor scene in a thick pall of smoggy pollution that makes Beijing look good by contrast. One of Jake Gyllenhaal's characters is a semi-articulate junior college history prof who senses his homeland swirling down the toilet of entropy, or--as he perceives it--chaos. He is obsessed with dictators, since everyone born in his milieu is doomed to a sterile, concrete-bound existence which would make the heyday of Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia preferable for the lively excitement. Gyllenhaal's other character is perfectly content playing roles such as ""Bellboy #1"" in the endless stream of mediocre screen fare churned out in Toronto (two genres of which are highlighted here in movies-within-the-movie: the mindless farce and the unintelligible art house trash; too bad there wasn't enough time to also spoof the ubiquitous Toronto-pretending-to-be a-huge-American-city with-insanely-dim-law-enforcement-people). Two main messages seem to be percolating here: First, that a Canadian life is barely worth living (as the bellboy character drives his car into a wall at high speed as soon as he's forced to scratch the surface of his circumstances). And secondly, if you ARE condemned to Toronto (through birth or bad choice), take what excitement is offered, whether it's watching nude women killing giant spiders with their spike heels, or swapping mates (even given the high prevalence of serial kills ""up North"").",Enemy
44,alindsay-al,An above average bizarre film,6,6 October 2015,"With sicario coming out tomorrow in the UK I thought I would see enemy which is directed by the same guy. Now the premise of this film sees a history teacher find his identical double and attempt to track him down. Jake gyllenhall is a fantastic actor and he plays both Adam and Anthony in this film. He does a fantastic job portraying the twisted personalities of these characters and it is pretty fascinating. I didn't really care for anybody else in the film though which was a bit of a disappointment. The story is interesting and you care to see what happens in this tense scenario. However, this film is shot very unconventionaly and it makes it quite hard to follow. The script has some pretty interesting dialogue but sometimes it doesn't really work. The style of the film is shot beautifly with all the cinematography looking great. But there is the use of spiders in this film and it just seems incredibly weird and forced. Overall this is an alright movie but I just found it pretty bizarre.",Enemy
45,estebangonzalez10,A surreal psychological thriller from Villeneuve,8,29 April 2014,"""Chaos is order yet undeciphered.""Denis Villeneuve's latest film, Enemy, opens with this very interesting quote about chaos and I can't think of a better one to explain this intense and intriguing film. Enemy is a movie that requires your full attention and it is definitely not for the casual viewer. At first glance the story may seem chaotic, but Villeneuve is reminding us to pay close attention because there is an order to this surreal film if you decipher the symbolisms and meanings behind each scene. There have been many different interpretations as to what this film is trying to say, but I believe Villeneuve has made it possible for the viewers to put the clues together and understand the true meaning of his film. He has stated that it is a film about Jake's subconscious and the poster also points to that so I am not entering into spoiler territory when I make these claims. Enemy will be a divisive film because it doesn't follow a classical narrative structure and many people might find that misleading, but others will absolutely love trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together and solving this intriguing thriller. I think that the most important element for the audience is what they interpret the spiders to be since they play an important role in this film. However, even if you don't understand the chaos at first (which I didn't) Villeneuve sets such an eerie and creepy atmosphere with the cinematography and score that the film can still be enjoyed. The mystery completely sucked me in and I loved all the twists. I never saw the ending coming either and it left me completely perplexed, but after thinking about the story and reading some interpretations I was fascinated by the resolution. Enemy will either make you want to go back and rewatch it immediately to pick up on the clues, or it will turn you off completely and make you want to wipe out your memory. Enemy in my opinion is a great film and Villeneuve continues to show his versatility as a director.The screenplay was adapted by Javier Gullon from Jose Saramago's novel (The Double) although he included some clever surrealist elements like the addition of spiders which aren't part of the novel. We are introduced to Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) giving one of his lectures as a history professor. He gives a speech about totalitarian governments and how events repeat themselves over the course of time. His life is pretty dull as is his relationship with his girlfriend, Mary (Melanie Laurent), but things take an interesting turn when he watches a movie that a friend has recommended. After watching the film, he realizes that there was an actor in the background that looks exactly like him. He looks the actor up on the internet and decides to call his number. A woman answers the phone and believes it is her husband that is on the other line. Not only does Adam resemble this other actor, but they have the same voice as well. Adam tries to explain who he is, but the woman named Helen (Sarah Gadon) seems to be deeply disturbed. Her husband, Anthony (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrives and finds Helen troubled so he asks what's going on. After she explains to him the situation Anthony decides to meet with Adam in a hotel room and that is where the psychological thriller picks up and the mystery thickens. I've been a huge fan of Villeneuve ever since I saw his Canadian film, Incendies. It still remains my favorite film of his, but he has shown an impressive range with his latest films. Prisoners sort of felt like a conventional thriller with a straightforward narrative although the cinematography and the performances made it stand out. Enemy on the other hand is very different and audiences expecting a similar thriller will be disappointed because it is more of a psychological surreal thriller resembling some of the films from David Lynch. Enemy succeeds in most part thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant performance as he plays two distinct characters giving each one different depth. It also benefits from an ending that some have called the scariest they've seen on film. I wouldn't go that far, but I thought it was shocking and unique. Villeneuve has really messed with his audience, but he did it in a positive way because it makes you want to go back and watch what you missed (unless you hated it and thought it was silly which is also a possibility with films like this). The tone of the film completely captured me and I was engaged once I got past those disturbing opening minutes. The entire film has a lot to do with the lecture Adam gives and whether you liked this film or not it does have order once you decipher all the chaos. Enemy is a clever film that will stick with you and it is so unique that it's hard to compare it to other films.",Enemy

This had an outstanding core plot point of a strange young professor who spots a guy that is his exact double in a movie he watched and he starts to track him down. The track down is very awkward and not how I would approach it (as a director or in reality) but nevertheless they meet up and are way more uneasy, negative and scared of each other even before they discover they are even more than twins as they have the exact same scar!! But why are they so adversarial toward each other? I would not have steered the story in that direction. As the story progresses, more questions are asked and fewer answered. Is there a point trying to be made about one's spirit as truly unique vs its visual appearance? Or is he battling his inner persona? The film is set with moody and dramatic lighting much is told through visuals and actions. There were sparse creepy moments, a slow-paced visual-focused story but sadly the two guys were super unlikable and off-putting.",Enemy
47,jimbo-53-186511,A frustrating experience (however you look at it),4,15 August 2015,"Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history teacher stuck in a mundane day to day routine. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he watches a film and discovers that there is an actor who looks exactly like him. Out of curiosity, Adam sets about finding out more about his 'doppelganger'.Based on the novel 'The Double' by Jose Saramago (which I haven't read) Enemy has a very interesting concept - the idea of dual identity throws up endless possibilities for an exciting film. Sadly, Enemy is only interesting as a concept and never really engaged me to be honest.I think that the problem here is that having not read the book I wasn't really sure what to expect. I thought it might have been about a 'Doppelganger' committing ID fraud against his innocent double OR perhaps a 'Doppelganger' committing various crimes and again framing the innocent double. However, with this film it uses possibly the least interesting 'Doppelganger' scenario to set up the film - a 'Doppelganger' who's a film star...It just doesn't amount to much and for much of its running time it's just a dull film consisting of dull conversations and dull scenarios. The first 20 minutes seemed to flit between Adam teaching at school to having sex with his missus (about 3 times in a row). I'm assuming this was done to give the audience an insight into the monotony of Adam's life, but the trouble with this is that it also makes it monotonous for the audience. Others may see it differently, but I just found most of this film boring.Then we come to what the film was really about; Villeneuve ends the film in a rather bizarre way and never really offers any real resolution. Personally, my theory is that Adam's doppelganger was a figment of his imagination (it's the most logical explanation and is also the scenario that throws up the least flaws).Gyllenhaal is convincing here as both of his respective personas and the more films of his that I see the more I'm gaining respect for him as an actor. It's a shame that the story just didn't click with me and it just wasn't as good or interesting as I expected it to be. Although it clearly leaves the audience with something to think about in the end, this does not excuse the screenplay which for the most was dull, convoluted and not particularly interesting.",Enemy

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Dense, elliptical and supremely unsettling",7,11 May 2016,"Denis Villeneuve's Enemy is one of the most unsettling film experiences you will ever sit through, and the damn thing is only 90 minutes. It's disconcerting, ambiguous and seems to exist simply to spin the viewer's anxiety reflex into a storm and make our stomach turn loops. It's a trim entry into the psychological upset sub genre, and puts a frazzled looking Jake Gyllenhaal through a wringer as he pursues a mysterious doppelgänger through the streets of Toronto, a bustling city that feels oddly desolate as glanced upon by Villeneuve's camera, adding to the themes of paranoia and mental unrest. Gyllenhaal plays a twitchy college professor who is stuck in a closed loop routine: he gives lectures at the local university, drives home to his emotionally inaccessible girlfriend (Melanie Laurant), rinse and repeat. A chink appears in the chain when he becomes aware of another man in the city who appears to be his identical twin. The other man is a small time actor with a pregnant wife (Sarah Gadon) and a decidedly more nasty approach to the situation than the professor. The two of them circle each other in a disturbing game of not so much cat and mouse, but Jake and Jake, both of them having not a clue as to what is going on, the edges of madness inching closer to both of their perception. Are they twins? Are there even two? Is it just one of them, losing their mind? There's very freaky dream sequences with the constant imagery of spiders, both large and small, and what do they mean? Who's to tell? Denis has stated in interviews that there is both rhyme and reason to his creation here, but whether he will ever divulge them remains to be seen. Perhaps it's better left illusory, a formula for entrancing audiences that has already proved to work well for David Lynch. The moment that the man behind the curtain reveals the conscious meaning of his very subconscious efforts, the spell is no doubt broken. In any case, it's a very hard film to process or focus on, our nerves jittering constantly and sabotaging any modicum of rational though that we might employ in deciphering the piece. This may be called style and atmosphere over substance by some, but even in not comprehending what's going on, we feel deeply that there is some sort of cryptic cohesion if we are able to feel between the lines, maybe coming up empty handed ultimately, but knowing within us that we've attained wealth to our soul simply by bearing witness. I can't say it's a film that I love, or that I would watch again, but it's certainly one that won't leave my memories any time soon, and that is an achievement no matter how you look at it. It's also got one of the scariest and most unexpected endings to any film I've ever seen, taking you so off guard that you feel like you're going to have a coronary. It's filmed in sickening yellow saturation which adds to the overall disconcerting nature, and quite the striking colour choice as well. I can see why this one was released with little fanfare or marketing, despite the presence of heavyweights Villeneuve and Gylenhaal. It's difficult stuff, a movie that frustratingly soars above your head, onward towards its intensely personal and psychological destination. It's up to us to jump, grasp and attempt to reach as high as the piece in order to get what we will out of it. Good luck.",Enemy

What follows is a tangled discovery where you find yourself wondering all the time whether there are indeed two persons or that these two individuals are fused into a schizophrenic person with apparently an identity disorder .It wasn't a totally confusing story for me. I took into account that Adam might possibly have some psychological problems. The behavior and phenomena that were shown like regular headaches (frequently depicted), mood swings, sexual dysfunction (Yes after the third time his girlfriend kicks off it was obvious) and lose sight of the time, were an indication. The metaphors that were used at the end were also evident. That in the end it was nothing else than leaving the past behind in a psychological way and start fresh in the present, was clear to me onto the end.Gyllenhaal gets the most out here and plays an excellent character role. The portrayal of Sarah Gadon was at times simply breathtaking brilliant. The look on her face as she glances at Adam and you clearly can see the suspicion and confusion on her face appearing, is simply masterful. The film editing was sometimes really ingenious worked out. Stopping and restarting images at the rhythm of the music. The delusions were sometimes quite hallucinatory. The beginning with the perverted show gave you immediately a tightness. Applying the teaching material (about the pattern and the repeating) on reality, so that recurrent sequences were used in the beginning, was ingenious. The end which is a compound with the beginning. If you think about it more deeply you'll notice it's highly elaborated.And yet it it left me indifferent. For me it's just a movie to spawn ""the experts"" of the better movie and give them something to entertain (as the Romans did with the common people) so they can analyze the different layers of this film and discuss it in detail. For me, it was a slow and boring movie with a straightforward story in which eventually someone wants to leave his ""cheating days"" behind him. I love a well-prepared mind twist, but in this movie I was like, ""Yeah guys tell me the denouement so I finally know how it fits together."" And this already fairly early in the movie. Too bad, if you look at the acting performance of Gyllenhaal. More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Enemy
54,questl-18592,My Own Worst Enemy,7,26 September 2020,"I'm pretty sure this movie is brilliant but I have no idea why. I remember thinking to myself around the 30 minute mark, ""What in the world is happening?!"" and that feeling never really dissipates. The acting is really great, it's visually captivating and it is endlessly captivating. ""What is happening?"" ""What am I watching?"" These are the kinds of questions I imagine most people to ask at least once during this experience. It's so layered though, so complex and filled with subtext and visual cues that it's hard to look away and absolutely demands rewatching and deciphering.I'm really looking forward to watching this again sometime. On first viewing I thought it was making an fascinating portrayal of bi-polar disorder but I think there's a lot more here and I look forward to exploring it again. This is absolutely not a background movie though. I made the mistake of not giving it enough attention at first and definitely wont make that mistake again. This needs your attention, undivided and laser focused to pick up on everything but it is absolutely worth it.",Enemy
55,aidanratesmovies,Well...that happened,7,27 August 2020,"A confusing blend of storylines, editing, and storytelling- makes for this quite unique, although somewhat satisfying thriller- that I can't help but feel there has to be more to. I usually don't like to spoil films in my reviews, but this one is very hard to talk about on its own merit, and i'd like to give all my thoughts on it the best way I can. This film, as many people believe and interpret it, as a metaphorical journey of a broken man with two different lives. One life is of regret and mistake, and another is of family, and anger. Both tend to blend together as the film goes on, before you can realize truly what is what, who is who, and which is which. I wish Javier Gullón could find a better way to tell this tale in some comprehensible way, because it makes the film seem largely incoherent and messy, when it truly doesn't have to be. Granted, I am fortunate that the people involved with this film didn't dumb it down for audiences like i'm sure many companies would be eager to do (a reason why i'm glad A24 was involved). However, I feel that providing only questions with no answers, and confusing the audience to the point where they don't care as much about what is going on is a truly damaging effect to a film. I believe there is a deeper reality to this film, and I would like to have it shown someday and or explained, but thus, I don't think I am the right man to do it. Jake Gyllenhaal shines in this film, as well as Sarah Gadon. The film can be interesting, but convoluted and slow, and I honestly felt a bit cheated at the end of it all. It is an interesting mindboggler, but there are better films with similar concepts that are a better use of your time and energy.
My Rating: 7/10",Enemy
56,I_Ailurophile,"Not perfect, but quietly captivating",8,7 November 2021,"I love the score from composers Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, lending an air of disquiet to the picture and gradually rising as the film runs on. It's a swell complement to a slowly building, subdued narrative that relies foremost on subtlety. Even halfway through the movie, it feels like very little has happened at all, but 'Enemy' is nonetheless quietly riveting as the bizarre circumstances of Adam and Anthony's resemblance leads to peculiar tension. A24's penchant for oddball art films never fails to dazzle, and this illustrates how the production company has had that slant from the beginning.The supporting cast is great, bringing understated simmering emotional turmoil to the story with performances of fine poise. I haven't seen many movies with Sarah Gadon to date, but I'm excited to find more; Mélanie Laurent I'm slightly more familiar with, though it feels strange to watch her in a part while totally dispensing with her natural French accent. By all means, however, of course Jake Gyllenhaal is the primary star - twice over. With dual roles as Adam and Anthony, Gyllenhaal is given a unique opportunity to demonstrate the dexterity and nuance in his skill set as he shifts from one character to the other from scene to scene, or from shot to shot - and he handles himself most ably, showing that the acclaim he began to garner in even his earliest performances was no mistake.Even with the strangeness indicated in the premise, on the surface 'Enemy' seems like a very straightforward feature. That appearance is undone above all by two specific, brief shots that portend another level to the narrative laid before us. What that level actually reflects is open to interpretation, and even as I sit to write this I'm still turning the film over in my mind. With or without considering that further quality, I don't think the picture comes together with perfect storytelling integrity - and as we ruminate on what it all means, absolute comportment likewise breaks down. I rather wonder if I'm not being too generous in my regard for it. Still, even if it doesn't entirely land on its feet, this is greatly enjoyable more than it is not.Any viewer seeking a simple cinematic experience - easily digestible, exciting, with a ready payoff - may be best served looking elsewhere. If you're receptive to the more cerebral, far-out side of film, though, this is worth checking out. I rather wish the writing were a bit tighter, and perhaps marginally more transparent, but this is just my subjective perception of what the feature needed, and surely others feel otherwise. One way or the other, 'Enemy' is an intriguing, beguiling, low-key mystery thriller that is a tickling ponder, if one has the chance to watch it.",Enemy
57,Samiam3,"Phoney, contrived, unscary, miscalculated",4,29 May 2017,"Enemy fails because Denis Villeneuve attempts to milk horror from a scenario that has absolutely no horror potential at all. A hapless chap goes looking for his doppelganger. After he makes contact with his wife, the doppelganger (an actor) decides to shadow our guy, and later his girlfriend.The acting is surprisingly inept, partially because the script never gives the characters anything resembling motivation. Their behaviours are phoney and the dialog is tedious and under written.Vieneuvre handles the camera better than the cast, bringing an apocalyptic eeriness (even in bright daylight) to the city of Toronto where the story is set. His wide shots draw your attention to the screen by urging you to look where there is little to see. Then there is a memorable surrealist moment of a giant spegetti-legged spider towering over the downtown area.

From my understanding, the whole film is a flashback, but the main plot happens in the memory. The dividing line between reality and memory is picture matching. What is particularly bright is reality, while what is dark and yellowish is memories.

60,brando647,An Addicting Mind-Bender from the Director of PRISONERS,8,17 October 2014,"Denis Villeneuve garnered a lot of attention for his mainstream success with PRISONERS, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, but it was it smaller, more obscure release that I wanted to see. ENEMY was released around the same time as PRISONERS but never saw a national release and I had to wait for the home video release to finally catch it. Watching it, I figured out why it never went mainstream. Most general audiences don't like something they can't understand, and ENEMY is probably best described as a mental cluster fumess. It has a surface plot that's easy enough to understand but the film is loaded with symbolism and deeper themes. Most of which can't be discussed without entering spoiler territory so I won't touch on it much, but this is a movie that inspires discussion orat the very leastwill leave you contemplating it long after it ends. I know my first viewing led to two days of thought trying to decipher what I'd seen and it wasn't until I scoured the Internet, reading over the frustration of others and the myriad of proposed meanings, that I felt I'd come to an understanding. But that's me and my obsessive nature, and others can do their own research. On the surface, ENEMY is about history teacher Adam Bell (Gyllenhaal). Adam is suggested a film from a work colleague that he might enjoy and becomes obsessed when an extra in the film looks exactly like him. He tracks the actor down, Anthony (also Gyllenhaal), and discovers they're physically identical in every way. And then it gets weird.At first impression, ENEMY is a very depressing film. It's incredibly dark with lots of shadows and harsh lighting, and the entire movie has this bizarre yellow tint to it. Everything is has an unnerving yellow sickness to it. And the characterswell, no one is happy here. Adam is a depressing little man. He doesn't say much and he's very socially awkward. He's got a beautiful girlfriend named Mary (Mélanie Laurent) but there's some unknown tension between the two of them. She seems to come to his barren apartment every night and the two of them spend a minimal amount of time together before moving to the bedroom, and she always seems to leave in anger or exasperation when it's through. Anthony is more outgoing, more confident. He's married to a beautiful woman (Sarah Gadon) in a crumbling marriage racked with previous infidelities on his part. She seems hopeful that he's changed but the recent events where he hides his meeting with Adam have her wondering if he's returned to old habits. Everyone's pretty miserable but Adam finds hope for something interesting when he encounters his doppelganger. Whatever it was that piqued his interest, it fades fast as the two come face-to-face and Adam immediately regrets it. Anthony immediately moves to do what pretty much any one of us would probably do if we discovered we had an exact duplicate somewhere in the world with a beautiful girlfriend.The surface plot is simple enough but there is so much more boiling beneath the surface of ENEMY. Honestly, I'd seen it twice and couldn't quite piece it together on my own. I only came to full understanding after doing some additional searching around the web for interpretations. I didn't have to do all the supplemental research. The movie's was perfectly fine as a piece of head-scratcher entertainment. I wanted to do it. I found ENEMY so enthralling that I wanted to know more. It's a very slow moving movie and spends most of the first half establishing the atmosphere and building the suspension but then it grabs you and you can't stop watching because you're so interested in seeing how it'll all play out. At least, I was. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing in the dual role. I was impressed with Sam Rockwell in Duncan Jones' MOON but Rockwell was essentially playing the same character interacting with itself. Gyllenhaal invests such seamless separate personalities into Adam and Anthony that they truly feel like two individual men. He's done an incredible job with ENEMY and I hope he gets some accolades for it. Mélanie Laurent isn't given much as Mary, but Sarah Gadon is undeniably sympathetic as Anthony's pregnant, hopeful wife Helen. Every involved brings their best to the table, making ENEMY one of the better hidden gems I've found in the past year's independent film selection. It's not going to be a film for everyone but anyone who enjoys a film that leaves you contemplating it after the credits roll should give ENEMY a chance.",Enemy
61,Sergeant_Tibbs,Great mysterious thriller. Beats Prisoners.,8,14 August 2014,"Last year, Denis Villeneuve made a name for himself in Hollywood with the overcelebrated and bloated crime film Prisoners. It was a disjointed piece with many things to appreciate, but also a lot that was troubling. Following up that success, he collaborated with Jake Gyllenhaal again with a small scale film Enemy, a film that's polarised viewers since its debut at film festivals. It's a very pleasant surprise that Enemy is a better film than Prisoners in every way. It's a much tighter and small scale story, one that benefits Villeneuve's sensibilities much more. Here he teases the camera round corners, taking advantage of the suspense of cinema in the mystery genre in a way I haven't seen for too long. As nice as beloved cinematographer Roger Deakins' photography is in Prisoners, I'd rather Enemy's atmospheric golden brown air. It's a story of an anxious man and Jake Gyllenhaal brilliantly toes the line between his two parts making both characters convincing and human with a welcome sense of humour, perhaps moreso than Jesse Eisenberg did for this year's The Double. The film is only a few missteps away from being a favourite as its plot sometimes wears thin or grows unnecessarily contrived. Perhaps I'm enthusiastic about Enemy in the wake of Prisoners, but it's a great film in its own right. I must watch Incendies soon.8/10",Enemy

63,tomsview,Deciphering chaos,8,31 July 2014,"A fascinating film, but I must admit it confused me, especially the ending - the first time I saw it that is. It's a film that demands a second viewing, and then you can really appreciate its power.My initial reaction was that the plot got so tricky it had nowhere left to go. Oddly enough, the ending of the novel on which the film is based does have more closure - a ""Twilight Zone-ish"" never-ending cycle. However the director, Denis Villeneuve, takes the film to a whole different level.""Enemy"" is based on an intriguing idea. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Adam Bell, a jaded history teacher with a beautiful blonde girlfriend, Mary (Melanie Laurent). When Adam sees an actor in a movie, Anthony Claire, who is his exact double even down to the scar on his chest, he becomes fixated with tracking him down.He asks his mother (Isabella Rossellini) if they were perhaps twins separated at birth - she is offended at the suggestion and the audience would be too if that had turned out to be the resolution to the mystery - it isn't. When Adam meets Anthony he discovers that he has a wife, Helen (Sarah Gadon), also blonde, but pregnant.Things get mixed up as their identities become intertwined and they hop into bed with each other's partners. After one of the sets of couples exits the movie, it ends abruptly. Then there is the spider, a big tarantula, which pops up at odd times and right at the end. Interpreting the symbolism of that arachnid could drive film pundits even crazier than Jake Gyllenhaal's character.In an interview, Villeneuve indicated that everything is in the mind of Adam Bell. Adam and Anthony are the same person. One theory is that it's all about his lack of commitment, and mental anguish at leaving his mistress, Mary, to go back to his pregnant wife, Helen. The spider represents the women in Adam's life and his sense of entrapment. After all, female spiders often eat the male of the species.There was an era when filmmakers fell back on a simple plot device to save themselves when the story totally defied logic - it was all just a dream. These days, the device, as Villeneuve says, is usually that it is all in someone's head à la Lynch's ""Mulholland Dr."" and Pawlikowski's ""The Woman in the Fifth"".In truth, ""Enemy"" is actually more like a dream. Dreams have those crazy plots; abstractions of the things we experience in our daily lives. They are our personal movies, which out-Lynch David Lynch for weirdness - sometimes they make sense, but often they don't. I think Freud would have loved this movie.""Enemy"" gets you in as each clue takes us further and further into the mystery, helped by a mesmerising, almost Herrmann-esque score. It is a film that sparks a lot of YouTubing to find the various theories as to what it all means. The film opens with the line 'Chaos is order yet undeciphered' - and we strive to decipher it.",Enemy
64,michaeltrivedi,Interesting,7,13 November 2019,"I really like Jake Gyllenhall, even though sometimes he makes movies you wouldn't expect. The creepy dark ones are among the best out there, and given it's from one actor alone, it makes it all the more special.Enemy is about a professor who discovers that there is an actor who looks just like him. The professor at first tries to make contact with the actor, and eventually their live intermingle, where one takes the place of the other.There is no major consequence in this movie, and nothing is really resolved. It's basically a story of what would happen if two similar looking people met. They both are a little twisted, and their partners are both attractive. There's lot of weird Lynch type stuff going on as well, which I hardly understand.But it's one good one. I'd recommend it. One of my favorite JG films.7 stars",Enemy
65,frankde-jong,Film with a very open (and surprising) end,7,15 October 2020,"""Enemy"" is one of the smaller projects of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, but also one of the more interesting ones . It is a film with an open end that allows multiple interpretations, so it is not a film to everybody's taste.At the beginning of the movie different associations with other films came to my mind. The exclusive sexclub made me think of ""Eyes wide shut"" (1999, Stanley Kubrick). The monotony of the days of Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal), existing of giving lectures and going to bed with his girlfriend Mary, reminded me of ""Groundhog day"" (1993, Harold Ramis).The most important association I had was however with the story of ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" (1886, Robert Louis Stevenson). With this association I had in effect already chosen for an interpretation that is by no means the only one. In ""Enemy"" a man meets his double. The similarity goes on in the smallest possible details. Is this double real or is it just a projection? By relating ""Enemy"" to the story of Jekyll and Hyde I apparantly chose the interpretation of a prejection.I cannot prove that this interpretation is the right one. In effect I cannot even explain why I chose this interpretation, it just happened while watching. Following this interpretation it is remarkable that in Jekyll and Hyde there is an opposition between good (Dr Jekyll) and bad (mr Hyde), while in ""Enemy"" there is an opposition between introverted (Adam Bell) and extrovert (Anthony Claire). The last form of opposition has much less of a value judgement.",Enemy
66,napierslogs,An overly abstract psychological relationship drama that is not the thriller it's supposed to be,4,17 March 2014,"Presented as a psychological thriller, ""Enemy"" stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Adam Bell, a University professor of political history. Adam isn't a particularly happy individual – he has hurtful sex with his girlfriend (Melanie Laurent) and avoids conversations with coworkers. But one unsuccessful avoidance leads him to an interesting discovery. When watching a recommended movie (even though he doesn't like watching movies), he sees a small bit actor who is identical to himself.Thus begins the tracking down, or hunting (if you will), of Anthony Clair (also Jake Gyllenhaal) — A rather angry man who drives a motorcycle and has a pregnant wife (Sarah Gadon). I liked Gyllenhaal playing both parts as I never once got confused if we were with Anthony or Adam even though they looked identical. The big problem with the movie is that it's not a thriller. It's a psychological relationship drama structured (with corresponding creepy music) as a thriller with no suspenseful or thrilling moments. And it doesn't lead anywhere thrilling. Relationship dramas don't need to lead anywhere per se, but if they're presented as a thriller, then they probably should.Part of the intrigue of this movie is figuring it out. When the final scene fades to black, the predominant question will be, ""What the &^$#% was that?"" Occam's razor suggests the simplest explanation is the correct one. I feel that applies in this case as there really is only two possibilities of what was going on and the clues lead to only one solution. That is the correct one. Some clues to help you out are the thankfully small number of characters in the film, and the small number of character interactions, and spiders.It's the type of movie that is told abstractly and symbolically. Just keep in mind some of the meanings behind spider symbolism: they can refer to the illusory nature of appearances and protection against storms. And yes, I know I'm being abstract and cursory, but the filmmakers wouldn't want it any other way. Because if you already know what the movie means or what it's about, then there is absolutely no point to it.The handful of other people who saw ""Enemy"" and understood it, loved it. I did not. Other than two crucial scenes to help me understand what was going on – the first of which was muffled and the second one came really late in the film, nothing was happening. Or at least nothing if you never cared about Adam. I was too busy trying to figure out if this took place on Earth and what supernatural elements were in play to really get to know Adam. But even on reflection, Adam was an unhappy person who had hurtful sex and didn't like people, places or things.The other problem with the movie is that it's not ""Prisoners 2"". It stars Jake Gyllenhaal and it's directed by Denis Villeneuve, but the comparisons end there. It's not photographed by master cinematographer Roger Deakins and the muted sepia tones get annoying. Villeneuve decided to go abstract rather than interesting, and Gyllenhaal decided to return to his acting roots where strange doesn't always equate with good.""Enemy"" starts out really slow with a strange, overly intense fascination with orgy sex and weird symbolism of spiders and creatures. It finally looks like it's going to lead somewhere with the introduction of Anthony, but it just doesn't. Probably because it's not a thriller. The figuring out of what is going on can provide you with some entertainment for awhile, but then it's over.",Enemy

Nothing about it is predictable, which is refreshing. The direction is very well-handled, and Jake Gyllenhaal gives two great performances (or is it just one?). I also thought that the cinematography and the score added a lot to the overall atmosphere, with a dingy yellow tint on most of the scenes and moments punctuated with dissonant strings. It all contributed to an aura of mystery and disorientation, which I loved. Since the movie is quite ambiguous, it seems that the viewer will be rewarded with multiple viewings.

It all turns dark when they get involved with other's partners, and we have a dark movie which utilises sex heavily.This is a very well done film.

75,bryank-04844,"'Enemy' is quite an amazing film, one that will haunt you for weeks on end.",8,17 August 2015,"Director Denis Villeneuve is on a roll here. Denis worked with Jake Gyllenhaal on the hit movie last year called 'Prisoners', which starred Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano, and Terrence Howard. But not a lot of people know that Denis and Gyllenhaal filmed a movie right before they started 'Prisoners', but has not been released until now. That film is called 'Enemy', and it completely hypnotized me for the entire 90 minutes.Based on the 2002 novel called 'The Double' by Jose Saramago, 'Enemy' is a very haunting film and will leave you guessing as to what you just watched. Add to that, you won't be able to get it out of your head as this doppelganger thriller will hook you in its unforgettable opening scene and never let you go. The tone is dark and brooding as are the characters. Hell, even the setting, which is Toronto, Canada has a mysterious and ominous glow to it as if monsters were to live there. I really wish this movie had a wider release schedule, but unfortunately it does not. But that's not all bad, as if you can't find this playing at a theater in your hometown, you can most certainly find it on VOD. I highly suggest you do so.The opening scene is straight from Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut', as we focus in on a bearded yet suave man (Gyllenhaal), who is sitting with several other men while women perform sexual acts on stage. One of the women brings out a covered silver platter dish, and when she removes the top, a big hairy tarantula crawls out, only to be squished by a woman in high heels. The entire scene didn't seem real. We cut to Gyllenhaal again, who is now called Adam Bell, who is a nervous and quiet history professor, who seems to just go through the motions with his students, but never takes an active role in their lives. He seems to be depressed as he comes home to his almost empty apartment, grades papers, has boring sex with his girlfriend Mary (Melanie Laurent), and never smiles. This is his routine day in and day out.One of his colleagues recommends a romantic comedy film for him to see, and when he watches the film, he notices that one of the actors looks very similar to himself. In fact, they look identical. This of course seems odd so Adam writes down the actor's name, which is Anthony St. Claire does some research and eventually finds his number and address. Adam calls Anthony to have his wife Helen (Sarah Gordon) answer the phone, thinking it's her husband Anthony, as they have the exact same voice.Helen then tracks down Adam and is shocked at how similar the two are, and we the audience are surprised on how much Mary and Helen look alike despite one of them being very pregnant. Eventually, Anthony and Adam meet up and find out they are indeed similar from their hair to their scars on their bodies. And when Adam visits his domineering mother (Isabella Rossellini), she lets us in to some very vague clues as what is at work here, which is something much bigger than we could have imagined.For us as an audience, we must navigate Adam's puzzle through his monstrous nightmares and sexual dreams. It might not make sense, but it all seems very familiar and with a complete shock ending that would make every cult director giddy, 'Enemy' will not soon leave you mind. Gyllenhaal plays double duty here very well as he plays a nervous wreck of a man who may or may not be on the verge of climbing a clock tower if you know what I mean. On the other hand, he also plays a suave slime ball here too who can talk his way out of anything. And Denis's camera is like an acid trip as we journey through this dark and twisted maze of identity and truth.The score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans is similar to 'The Shining' with a very eerie and scary sound throughout the entire film that constantly reminds us there is no good that can come of these characters and that there is something evil lurking around every corner. 'Enemy' is quite an amazing film, one that will haunt you for weeks on end.",Enemy
76,Ben_Cheshire,Like Antonioni passed off as Hitchcock,2,18 May 2015,"A bunch of weird dark scenes happen, you think you spy Jake Gyllenhall, and the ghost of a mistaken identity caper, but it couldn't be because its too slow and dark.OK, so straight off the bat, the cinematography here is too dark. The opening 10 minutes is virtually indecipherable. And another problem I had right away in the dialogue scenes is that its got that awkwardness of a script that's been written in another language (Spanish) and translated into English.Then the darkness comes back; this low-light cinematography really doesn't look good in less than HD resolution. Maybe on film, but I can't speak to that. When the movie does finally get to some daylight, it is watchable, but then you have the problem of speed.It has the slow deliberate pace of an art-house film, with the subject matter of a Hitchcock caper. Antonioni did actually make a few movies like this, one called The Passenger, and another called Identification of a Woman. Since Antonioni is not most people's cup of tea, I'll guess this movie also may not appeal to most.",Enemy

This time tho, with some prior knowledge, I was able to see a lot of the symbolism that dictated almost every aspect of this movie.The theme of order and dictatorship was explicitly mentioned through the lectures from our main character. I loved how the queen spider was used to represent the themes as well as the perspectives of the main character. The monotonous and dreading color of the city and apartments further supported the themes. There were more nuances that revolves around and the theme.And the last shot.

I've not read his ""The Double"" but have read several others (including ""Blindness"" which I would heartily recommend *reading* and from what others have said, skipping the movie).Possibly for this as well. Definitely I wish I had tried the book first, so mentioning that for others who align with my tastes.There were two films this year I recently watched, which felt like Twilight Zone episodes, or short stories, stretched out a bit too far. This one and ""The One I Love."" Each a doppelganger's delight I would say.In this one the omnipresent tension came more from the movie's score than the story in my mind. Many of the reviews here (including the cleverly named ""The Two Jakes"") tromped the movie, and at a fraction of its time.Of course suspending a sense of reality is fine, no problem. And parts of this film are jarringly disconnected, an odd shot of the city stands out as one such instance...and yeah it ""makes sense"" later, still not a deal-breaker. But trouble arose for me with what compelled Adam (the first Jake, often clad in white, so the ""good"" one maybe) through so many of his actions... And even in an unreal situation, one hopes for decision/character development than one can connect with, or understand.At least the characters weren't called Cain and Abel.Perhaps in the book, an internal monologue provides more insight, so maybe I'll read that in the distant future. For you with a fresh slate, I'd say try the book first.Or at least take a good look in the mirror before watching this...Isabella Rosellini is under-used here by the way.

83,dfa120374,Interesting Story But Far Too Slow & Tedious,4,5 October 2015,"Enemy is another mind-bender of a film that is very much along similar lines to that of Donnie Darko, Coherence, and Stay, so if you like movies that make you stop and actually think about what's going on, and films where you have to piece together the story line to understand things rather than spelling it all out for you as they play out, then you might enjoy this film.I'll start off by saying that Enemy is a well acted out film, with Gyllenhaal doing a great job of playing a double role with the characters of Adam & Anthony...two people who live worlds apart but are brought together because they look exactly the same. The way he manages to play one character as kind of quiet, private, and somewhat retiring (Adam), to the more full on, abrupt, and somewhat more confident & 'in your face' character (Anthony) is pretty impressive. I think it's him that holds the film together for me, because if it wasn't well acted I think I would have lost interest long before the ending.Which brings me to my next point. The film is VERY slow. There's obviously not a lot of action given the type of film Enemy is, and for me that's OK because I enjoy all types of movies, but the pace of this film does get very tedious. There's also far too many smaller cut scenes interlinking the longer ones i.e. a few seconds of Gyllenhaal looking off into space or just standing in his classroom. People will call these ""artsy"" scenes, but I'm not a fan when directors do things like this.This is a movie that is full of metaphors (the spiders & webs being two main ones) and you'll need to read up on it or watch it again to get the full jist of what's happening as it is most definitely not a straightforward film. The ending has a very good WTF moment too, and I think you'll probably say something like that when the film finishes. I certainly did.He done a good job, but this isn't one of the better films Gyllenhaal's starred in. Interesting story, but just too 'out there' for my liking.",Enemy
84,billygoat1071,Game of Nonsense,6,3 August 2014,"The key background of Enemy is having a dreary world where its characters cannot get their satisfaction. The doppelganger discovery will turn that mode into a twisted place that you couldn't really understand what danger it might present. That is the strongest part of the movie, the mystery itself is some sort of a test that wants to give plenty of surprises and hide a large meaning beneath its odd events, but that is the only thing the movie can offer and for some reason it doesn't feel enough for the intriguing experience.The film does have a compelling first half, even though the main character's first move happens too quick and too confident. Before it all, it just paints a doomed world that chains its people in their loop cycling lifestyle. The sudden discovery brings the unknown fear in their ordinary living. The very first scene of the film already shows the plan, the only question is what exactly is the outcome of it. The film doesn't give away too much; it instead sprinkles with MacGuffins to help throwing some obvious clues from crumb to crumb. However, this game of playing their minds has a cloudy purpose, in spite of their well fleshed out characters and environment. Not sure if it's for their women or accepting lifestyle, but it all leads to a pretty strange ending to perplex people's minds even more.The craft at least makes it thoroughly interesting. The director concentrates with the characters and their mysteries. Most of the time, it's fun and gripping to watch. The cinematography perfectly reflects the haunting world they're trying to survive in. The film spreads that atmosphere, even when we don't exactly what we should be terrified at. The performance is also great: the main man is definitely Jake Gyllenhaal playing the two men who are strung together. Gyllenhaal gives each of those roles an effective character study to root for.There is too many theories to think of, but it's a lot more difficult to see what's the point of this mind game, even stranger is the final picture, it feels like a forced overwhelming revelation, except it's rather absurd than a creeper. Mindbending films are meant to be this great for sure, but they always have a definite center beneath its secrets even when the puzzle can be pretty hard to figure out, but this one seems to only want to show off the surface and probably left everything else as a total mystery. So basically, it must be just a cruel game, taking the concept too far. There is a great effort to spare, but everything else turned out to be a pretension, a cool one at least.",Enemy

Let's talk about spiders, spiders represent women in the life of our protagonist, the spider metaphor is to say that the women in his life keeps you stuck in a web, these are women: the mother, represented by a giant spider, because the same for him is sovereign and has power over all, the lover is represented by the spider corridor, which shows exactly what the lover is for our protagonist, the woman's body (what matters in lover), but its spider head to show that he's stuck to it, and before speaking of his wife, I have to explain the scene in the club at the beginning of the film, which is apparently a club to satisfy desires, and his desire is to see one spider be crushed, just to break this prison, so being in the final scene he gets the key to return to the club and when you will talk to his wife sees it as the spider, this is what really scares him, and reminds he is attached to it by the son of the link, this arrest can be seen as a form of dictatorship, as he explains in his classes. Worth a note, I do not have a conclusion to say if his mistress it really exists or not, they always had sex in the dark, when they went to the course she notices the alliance brand, but at the same time, the accident leads me to think that is all of his head, to the casting choice, the Mélanie Laurent that would be an ideal lover view its immeasurable beauty.Forgive my English translator google.",Enemy

And it is intended to be this way.Denis Villleneuve's downbeat account of a downtrodden guy and his egocentric doppelganger is exceedingly hard to plug into. Personal fave Jake Gyllenhaal does especially difficult double duty here. His enigmatic performance(s) is/are a prime example of the multi-faceted actor's consistent and admirable choice to portray deeply complex, often objectionable, characters over the course of his remarkable career.And while both Gyllenhaal's work and, by extension, Villleneuve's film, are for the most part worthy of examination, the sordid story unfortunately falls victim to itself, becoming helplessly bogged down by aspirations which manifest as overly esoteric and distant. The muted sienna-stained cinematographic tone, combined with the repetitive and hauntingly ominous shots of a dreary smog-shrouded Toronto skyline, only serve to magnify the merciless vibe of dismal and dread we are relentlessly pounded with.I could offer my own dime store psychology analysis of the grotesquely mortifying final frame of ""Enemy"". However, except to say that I can't imagine how you could ever see it coming (even with the trail of prophetic ""Easter Eggs"" Villeneuve drops in throughout the proceedings), this is undeniably one of those instances where it's all in the eye of the beholder.

90,shawneofthedead,"Smart and intriguing, but so resolutely oblique that it's hard to really care about how (oddly) it ends.",5,10 April 2014,"From The Prince And The Pauper through to Sweet Valley High, literature and fiction has held a particular fascination with the notion of doppelgangers: two (or more) individuals who are physically identical and yet fundamentally different, whether in personality or social station. Denis Villeneuve's Enemy, a psychologically-charged mystery that's more thoughtful than thrilling, explores the idea that there's someone else in the world who shares your face but has, seemingly, nothing else to do with you. It's fascinating, mostly, but also slow- moving and, ultimately, frustrating.History professor Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) leads a dull, repetitive life: he lectures unappreciative kids about totalitarian dictatorships, has bursts of largely uncommunicative sex with his maybe-girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent), and otherwise shuffles through the day in a lethargic haze. But everything in his humdrum existence changes when he watches an obscure movie in which, for a brief moment, he spots himself. Turns out he has a doppelganger: a not entirely successful actor by the name of Anthony St. Claire. Adam becomes obsessed with meeting Anthony, and soon their lives become irretrievably entangled.There are many ways to play a scenario like this one: Enemy could easily have been a broad farce (just add in pratfalls and double-takes), or a heart-stopping thrill ride (mix in life-threatening cases of mistaken identity). But Villeneuve has chosen a determinedly glum, very philosophical approach to Adam's dilemma. He frets to his mother (a nicely-cast Isabella Rossellini) about the possibility that he has a twin, and finds himself in a worryingly intimate situation with Anthony's pregnant wife Helen (Sarah Gadon), but high drama proves elusive until the final ten minutes or so. The resulting film, soaked in shades of yellow, is moody and considered, its pace bordering on the languid as Adam stumbles through his existential crisis. Anyone looking for easy answers or a clear message will be disappointed. Enemy is very much what you make of it: it's packed with ideas that are never fully explored, about lives never lived and the notion of identity, which audiences can pick apart at their own leisure. In fact, the film ends just when a more mainstream, accessible version of this story might begin. The final shot is less cathartic than outright puzzling, underscoring the completely alien life into which Adam has stumbled once he chose to hunt down Anthony.Whatever you make of the film, there's no denying that this is some of the best work Gyllenhaal has done in his career to date. He inhabits his two characters very well, slipping into Adam's despondent skin as easily as he finds Anthony's brash confidence. This is really his film, but he receives capable support from Laurent, who breathes personality into a paper-thin character. She helps make it particularly intriguing that, when it really matters, Mary - despite having a less apparently happy relationship with Adam - proves better able to tell the two men apart than Helen.Almost boldly, Enemy refuses to go down any of the routes you might expect when a man stumbles upon his exact double by chance. It doesn't plunge into sci-fi territory, suggesting they're clones; nor does it dip into the melodrama of hinting that they might be twins separated at birth. Instead, it baldly states the fact - there are two men with Gyllenhaal's face in the world - and drifts after the revelation in a determinedly art-house manner, refusing to tie up any loose ends or offer any simple conclusions. It makes for a compelling film, if not a particularly satisfying one.",Enemy
91,doug_park2001,"""Did you have a good day at school?""",7,14 July 2014,"I enjoyed ENEMY but can still understand the negative reviews. Those who want a really solid storyline that makes complete sense will definitely NOT enjoy it.ENEMY is a strange, solipsistic, rather Kafkaesque Canadian production based on a novel by Portuguese author José Saramago. Introverted history professor Adam Bell, well-played by Jake Gyllenhaal, discovers his apparent doppelganger in B-movie actor Anthony ""Daniel"" St. Claire. Bell's girlfriend and St. Claire's pregnant wife--similarly well-played by Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon respectively--also bear a more-than-passing ""incidental"" resemblance to each other. After a brief stalking by Bell, the two men meet and discover that they are indeed perfect facsimiles of each other. They both try to keep things congenial and then go their own ways, but that, of course, simply cannot happen. The first hour of this dark, humorless film is pretty draggy, but some weird and unexpected stuff happens in the last 30-40 minutes. A lot's open to interpretation, but ENEMY's whole conflict, it seems, has two basic possibilities that I won't give away.A sort of poor man's FIGHT CLUB, ENEMY raises the questions, ""What if I were to meet someone who looks and talks exactly like me, with certain personality likenesses as well as certain differences, who's led a completely different life than me? Would we like each other? (And how much do we like ourselves?) Would we want to trade places?"" While definitely not for all tastes, ENEMY is nothing if not different. Though the budget was obviously low and the scope is limited, it's generally well-produced. One final thing: I can't make up my mind about the constant synthesized drum-rolls and ""mm-MMMMB!"" sounds.

Adam finds Anthony through passages of his subconscious, opening up a can of psychological worms. When they eventually meet they ignite stressful dilemmas. It's an exasperating fruition trying to guess the outcome. The confines of their relationship and the partnership with their other halves are interwoven beautifully; Gyllenhaal's characters may look the same but their psyches are opposite. Open, trivial paradoxes. They are amongst his greatest performances to date. Laurent and Gadon are partners of the lookalikes, their personalities matching the wrong man.

Though I didn't like his previous film 'Prisoners' much, his work before that was quite interesting. With 'Enemy', a loose adaptation of Jose Saramago's novel 'The Double', Villeneuve constructs such a fascinating political/psychological thriller. The movie is woven in such a surrealistic way that one may find more than one story in it. Linearly, it's a dystopian political thriller about dual identity and fascism, and non-linearly, it's a psychological thriller about a man with commitment issues fighting his inner demons (multiple personality disorder). If the movie is understood for what it is, its brilliance can't be neglected.Jake Gyllenhaal talentedly captures the two different characters he plays; he helps us be interested in him and the story. He gives quite a performance. Supporting actors Sarah Gadon and Melanie Laurent are commendable as well.Villeneve skillfully uses symbolism and metaphors through spiders and web imagery. The film has a dark feel reminiscent of both Lynch and Cronenberg, and coincidentally (or on purpose), the film has one of each of their muses, Isabella Rossellini and Sarah Gadon respectively.The cinematography and background score are quite eerie and intriguing, and helps us get into the world of the characters. It helps us witness everything from lead character Adam's point-of-view.I had an amazing time deciphering it. It's one of those movies which might confuse the viewer in their first viewing, but a rewatch or two could reveal its excellence; like 2001, Mulholland Drive, Donnie Darko, etc. You can't get it out of your head for a while.If anyone is left confused by the film, they can go through my In-Depth Analysis of it here: akashsebastian.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/",Enemy

As his investigation deepens, the mystery thickens and he is thrown into a fray way above his head. What works in Enemy is Gyllenhaal's fearless performance as a man who is searching to find who he really is. There are a couple scenes that he has where is truly riveting and it becomes so hard to take your eyes off the screen. It really is an explosive yet very contained performance that I feel needs a lot of recognition. Enemy marks itself as a film about identity and never knowing who you truly are and the pressures of wanting to become something you're not. While it remains as a heavy message, it still makes for a film that almost demands repeat viewings. At 90 minutes even, the film moves and never slows down enough for us to even breathe. Before we can even question what is going on in one scene, Villeneuve throws us another curve ball to contend with. While that may bring confusion to many people, it is very welcoming to a viewer in the mood to do some serious thinking. Anything beyond that, it may garner some negative responses especially if you're not paying close attention. Enemy works well as a psychological thriller, bringing some of the most disturbing images I've seen on screen in recent years. This film is NOT scary, but it is extremely uneasy and very creepy, especially towards the last twenty minutes of the film, which had me holding my breath as we finally discover the truth of what is going on.Overall, this is one hell of a film that really does almost require a second (and possibly a third) viewing. I highly recommend it, especially to fans of David Lynch's Eraserhead. The images are memorable, the performances are very well rounded and this is just a very very well done film.",Enemy
98,MikesIDhasbeentaken,shpitspingboya,7,24 May 2014,"I don't usually like these kind of 'arty' films, where the director just sits back after trying to be so abstract that nobody knows what they meant in the first place, and people start to create ideas that were better than what the director had ever thought of. And when this film finished, that's exactly what I thought, what the hell just happened? I had a good idea of what was happening through most of the film, but then the ending happened... at first I was annoyed, but then i watched the last scene again, and realized it gives a lot more away than I thought, and actually reveals the true story... I think. To be honest I still don't know what happens in this film, In fact if what I think happened, then a lot of the scenes in the film should never have happened, and are pointless. But it's still enjoyable, and a film you'll be discussing with others that have watched it for some time. you'll probably want to watch this again to make sense of a lot of things. Though it's not really action packed, so a second viewing isn't too appealing.",Enemy
99,ghost_dog86,"Enemy: A Lynchian episode of ""Wife Swap""",8,19 April 2014,"Viewer Discretion Advised. This is going to be a movie that many will hate. In fact, during my showing I sat across from a couple who walked out during the first act. That said, I am now going to explain to you why I thought ""Enemy"" was one of the more terrifically mind-bending movies of the year so far, while in the same breath letting everyone unfamiliar with writer/director David Lynch (he did not direct this movie) know that they are better off steering clear of this Jake Gyllenhaal/Denis Villeneuve collaboration.Liken to a Lynchian episode of ""Wipe Swap"" or a Cronenberg retelling of Mark Twain's ""The Prince and the Pauper"", ""Enemy"" was adapted from Jose Saramgo's critically acclaimed novel by screenwriter Javier Gullon, but ultimately brought to the screen by Denis Villeneuve, who you may know as the director of last year's ""Prisoners"". The film follows an awkward history professor (Gyllenhaal) who by happenstance discovers he has a doubleor a twinor a copy (also played by Gyllenhaal). It takes him a while, but the professor eventually decides to confront this man who shares an uncanny resemblance to himself, which leads him down an abstract and quite disturbing road. While this Twilight Zone-esque plot does sound interesting, the key to understanding the movie lies more within its images; images which range from the macabre, to the voyeuristic, to the dreamlike and sometimes even to the visually indecipherable. That's right, there are scenes in this movie which are purposefully too dark to make out any sort of clear action, but with just enough light to see figures and shapes. OK, so I realize that I'm not doing a very good job selling this movie to people with eyes, but let me assure you that this ""dimly lit"" effect only happens a few times during the movie; so don't worry, Villeneuve does an excellent job of showing what is relevant. In fact, I'll take it a step further and say ""Enemy"" does stand as my favorite directorial attempt of the year so far.Side Note: Gyllenhaal's performance should not be undersold. He is very good here playing dual characters with vastly differing personalities. And the few bits of cryptic dialogue amidst this well constructed screenplay (especially the things that are said during classroom sequences) do act as the pinch of metaphysical spice thrown into the stew. But the images are and should be the focal point.Still, as silly as this is to say in regards to a film this surreal, there is actually an illogical moment that happens in the latter half of this story, which sets the bizarre but wildly interesting final act into motion. For that reason and the forced pacing in the first act (I had no idea what was even happening for the first 30 minutes) I did take away a star.Another Side Note: There is supposed to be a dark comedy called ""Double"" adapted from the Dostoyevsky novella of the same name, coming out later this year, which even though I haven't read, supposedly has a similar premise. When all is said and done, it should be interesting to compare and contrast these two films.Final Thought: For many ""Enemy"" may be a movie that doesn't work unless you see it twice, which is a tough sell. If ""Prisoners"" has a touch of an homage to David Lynch or David Cronenberg encased in a sort of big budget, big name, pill pocket (if only to make the film more palatable for the masses) then ""Enemy"" (even though it also stars Jake Gyllenhaal) is just the opposite; a total surrealist waking-dream that is on the surface hard to swallow, then slowly lures you into its web (like a spider would a fly). Only to shock everyone in the theater with a final shot that will either have you running to the box-office demanding your money back or demanding to buy a ticket to the next showing, knowing that you won't be able to shake that final image until you figure out what it meanseven though I can't say for sure that that this ending has a clear cut meaning. If that sounds horrible, again, this is not the movie for you.",Enemy

101,Gresh854,Villeneuve's Most Unconventional,8,26 September 2018,"Enemy is Denis Villeneuve's Under the Skin. It's his most unorthodox, ""restrained from the mainstream"" piece. Even though, Enemy isn't one of my favorites of his, it's the one I respect the most out of his entire filmography. Here he has crafted a tale that incorporates rarely any exposition, which only lingers on the audience's attention to detail. It's horror told in an idiosyncratic manner, and realism told with excessively fictionalized context, resulting with me-in no surprise-adoring this. (Verdict: A-)",Enemy
102,fung0,Artistically crafted but not worth it,4,13 March 2016,"Any movie that needs footnotes to explain it is simply too obscure for its own good. But the real problem with Enemy is that it can't make up its mind what it's trying to be.It's pretty obvious early on that we're watching a battle between two aspects of the same personality. But the film spends most of its length debating the irrelevant mechanics of that duality, rather than deepening its metaphorical interpretation. Why does the hero have a duplicate? How exact is the similarity? Where does the doppelganger live? Does he like blueberries? Such details build our impression that there's some fascinating real-world explanation for what's happening. Then the film hits us with a symbolic ending that invalidates most of what we've seen.This fundamental switcheroo leaves audiences not enlightened, or thoughtful, but merely confused and annoyed.What's more, Enemy stretches to 90 minutes a plot that would barely suffice for a half-hour Twilight Zone episode. Every take in the film is interminable. Every conversation consists largely of endless silences. This excitement is further padded out by extensive travelog views of Toronto. Now, I like a slow-moving art film as much as anyone. (I loved Revanche, for instance.) But in Enemy all the slow pace does is prevent us from learning anything interesting about the main character.If you'd care to see the same 'alternate life' theme worked out far more successfully, try the brilliant Australian film Me Myself I. It wastes no time on discussions of its fantasy framework, and gets on with amusing and thought-provoking revelations about the protagonist's inner struggle. It also finds time to pack in a number of endearing secondary characters, while Enemy merely tries to entertain us with lingering shots of empty rooms.",Enemy
103,niutta-enrico,Enemy: not a bad movie but you have to love tension.,7,20 June 2014,"Frankly I hadn't understood what this movie was about: I had to read Eliajh Chaffins' review (to whom I am grateful for his thoughtful and convincing explanation) to realize what the meaning was. Then I wondered what could be the point of making a movie so hard to decipher and I concluded that if there was something to gain from this, it was surely not for me or anyone else in the audience.I'm not saying that this was a bad or a cheap movie but I didn't feel that the matter was so delicate to deserve an allusive treatment instead of a plain narration. If the Authors wished us to empathize with the main character they had to make us feel guilty, not thrilled. Thus it sounded to me as if the film was deceiving on purpose and Authors' aim was to create pointless tension. Which is something I don't like, either in life or in movies.",Enemy
104,clintstevens,They All Lived Happily Ever After...,1,21 July 2018,"NOT!First off, there are a few major spoilers here, so if you plan on watching this, go no further.Second, I don't want to watch a movie where I must read a 1000 word review by some 'intellectual' on what the movie was about, what the symbolism was, and why it is a 'masterpiece'. Also, I don't want to have to watch it two or three times to 'get it'. I may not be the smartest movie fan out there, but if you are like me, you watch a film to be entertained and enjoyed from start to finish; not to say to yourself ""What the hell was THAT all about?""This started out as a promising thriller (if you don't count the scene in the private club where naked women present huge spiders to the audience...but more on that in a minute). A mild mannered teacher sees a man in a movie who looks identical to him. He is determined to find the man and meet him. Turns out they ARE identical, down to a scar on their chest. When the teacher's mother hears him tell the story, she asks him if he had seen the other man naked. Right then, I'm thinking 'Ah hah, one of them is circumcised!' Nope, wrong.When the expectant wife finds the man who claims to look exactly like her husband, she appears to take it in stride. After sleeping with him, knowing it isn't her husband, she asks him to stay (apparently, she isn't too crazy about her real mate). The other doppelganger's live in girlfriend realizes the man who has taken her out for a romantic weekend isn't her boyfriend when she realizes he doesn't have the telltale sign of a wedding ring on his finger, so she freaks out and demands he let her out of their speeding car. As he tries to open the door and push her out, he loses control, killing them both. Following this? Now for the major spoiler, and the dumbest ending ever. The teacher follows the pregnant wife into the bedroom and she has turned into a giant SPIDER!

105,blakiepeterson,An Atmospheric Mind-Boggler,6,2 May 2015,"Calling Enemy Lynchian would be lazy writing on my part, yet I find myself traveling back to the term after veering away from it so many times in a row. True, David Lynch and Denis Villenueve hardly have any filmmaking commonalities, but Enemy has a sort of Lynchian (there that label is again!) way of hurling a myriad of symbols, disturbing images, and dastardly motifs at us and telling us to figure it all out. A film like Enemy sometimes feels like a high school English assignment where the teacher hands you a nearly incoherent novel and asks you to annotate and analyze the cryptic passages.Based on José Saramago's novel The Double, Enemy is stabbed by the dreaded doppelgänger hook (Adaptation, Lost Highway) with messy results. Photographed with a yellowy saturation and surrounded by city smog and overcast skies, the film has a claustrophobic chill that mirrors the incoherence of a nightmare; only a few minutes in do we feel like a twitching fly trapped in a glaze of paralyzing honey.Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a morose and blatantly dissatisfied college professor who mopes around his day to day life with his head down. Even with a beautiful girlfriend (Mélanie Laurent) at home, he seems to take interest in next to nothing, continuously losing the shreds of optimism that rarely confront him. Hungry for a source of feel-good entertainment to lift his spirits, he watches Where There's a Will, There's a Way, a movie recommended to him by a colleague. Much to his surprise, he notices his exact double in one of the scenes.Curious, he decides to track him down. His mirror image, Anthony Claire, is a failing actor with a pregnant wife at home. When the two meet, however, things prove to be harmful, their lives interlacing in the most unnerving of ways.Through Bell's role as a history teacher, Villenueve is able to sneak in several allusions to totalitarianism, transfixing on its components and how its sneaky movements explode with brute force over time. The landscapes of Enemy are rounded out by apartment buildings, duplexes, and narrow streets, colored only with the most neutral of blacks, grays, browns, and tans. A red is like something from another planet. The film looks as if it were photographed in a totalitarian setting, making complexes and citizens seem unimportant. Individuality is stripped and strewn about.Bell, who is the more sympathetic double, discusses the idea of a dictator tightly governing a society by, at first, distracting his population through entertainment and other purposes until he reaches the top of ladder by pushing censorship and the dissolving of idiosyncrasy. Bell is the dictator of his own life, whether he would like to admit it or not. He is able to fog out what he doesn't want to hear, surrounding himself in an invisible cocoon that gives him the option to make his life whatever he wants it to be. But when Claire enters the scene, everything he has come to understand over the years is curbed; Claire is the revolution to Bell's reign.Though Enemy is just cerebral enough to be thought-provoking, it still contains factors that makes things much too difficult to truly deduce. The imagery, while delectably mounted, is often times awkward; movements pulse with stiffness, as if every twitch and flicker is supposed to have some kind of deeper meaning. As a result, the film has a tendency to lean towards the pretentious side. Villenueve directs in a way that suggests that we should be in on the twisty commotion. In truth, we're lost, scattered in a labyrinth of startling illustration.Last year's The Double, with Jesse Eisenberg and Mia Wasikowska, had a similar premise but gave its surface a tickle that hid its existential questions; it developed its leading character so well that the discovery of the double became all the more upsetting because society ignores him already with such a harsh scoff. But Enemy only has portions that are truly affecting, and those are the scenes that are more straightforward than others. Horror films like Under the Skin and Suspiria are able to get away with unintelligibility because they set themselves in an alternate reality consisting only of bright, nightmarish textures. Enemy wants to be an art film, but it also wants to be a think piece. The two personalities never quite mix, but the film's successes, including Gyllenhaal's seamless portrayals, are strong enough to make me unable to write it completely off the map. It's a faint misstep from the work of geniuses.",Enemy
106,hrkepler,You Are Your Own Worst Enemy,7,11 June 2018,"'Enemy' is tense psychological thriller. Jake Gyllenhaal gives powerful performance as a neurotic school teacher who, after getting a recommendation from a colleague, watches a movie and notices that one of the bit players looks exactly like him. He decides to look for the actor to meet the guy. Then Gyllenhaal gives another powerful performance as a narcissistic film actor. Yes - doppelganger - how original. But wait, 'Enemy' is kind of film that needs to be watched twice (at least), and many scenes or elements that seem random at first time, are very cleverly all tied together and by the end it all makes sense.

Enemy is directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has directed Prisoners released in 2013; this movie was one of my favourite film of last year. However Enemy was shouted directly before Prisoners. This film is much smaller and seemed not to be a stereotypical kind of film. It has nothing traditional. I felt this urgent necessity when it ended: to go online, do some research, read what other people were thinking and their theories on the story. Then I watched it again. This time properly enjoying the film, enjoying the beautiful shots, the great score and Jake Gyllenhaal; who was great playing both parts. In fact I found it hard to grasp at time and it lessen a bit my enjoyment of the movie. Enemy appeared like Hitchcock meeting Nicolas Winding Refn. On the one hand Enemy is really affecting as the movie roles along you start to connect things that you didn't see coming millions miles away. There is no giant revelation and big stupid twists. I'm really impressed. On the other hand the imagery is disturbing and hunting as well. This film begin with a small and simple story but as it begins to grow and expand I really get invested in what this guy's doing. Overall, Enemy is an interesting movie, beautifully shot, with really good acting. If you're a movie lover or just want some hint on direction, writing or even acting you should go see it.",Enemy
108,WubsTheFadger,Enemy,8,19 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerDenis Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. Blade Runner 2049, Prisoners and Arrival are three of my favorite films. I went into this film with high hopes.First off, Villeneuve has created an extremely complex and detailed story full of symbolism and metaphors. After a third viewing, I finally understood the entire film. The story is dark, somewhat disturbing, and most importantly real. The ending is stunning and disturbing which is great. The only downside about the plot is that it is very complex so it is hard to keep up with.The acting is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a stunning performance. Gyllenhaal perfectly plays two completely different characters with conflicting ideals, personalities, and morals. Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon also perform well. Isabella Rossellini performs the worst.The pacing is a little slow but the runtime is very short.I would recommend watching an explanation video after watching the film. I watched one on YouTube by Nick Snow that really cleared things up.Pros: Complex story with a lot of symbols and metaphors, great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, good acting by the supporting characters, great directing by Denis Villeneuve, a short runtime, and a stunning endingCons: The story can be too complex and hard to follow, slow pacing, and a poor performance by Isabella Rossellini",Enemy

110,Semisonic,A sophisticated yet not really engaging mind game,5,25 August 2014,"First of all, i wanna state that all the movies that i watch i do with an open mind. No prejudice of any kind, no expectations of a shallow popcorn entertainment. I entrust myself to the movie completely, and all i want in return is to be carried away.Well, sometimes it just doesn't happen.If you watch this movie unprepared - you'll be like ""what the heck did i just watch"". But if you're stubborn enough, you may try to find the key to this movie and decipher its hidden message. This board is full of reviews that provide both the key and the ""true meaning"" the movie may be bearing. So if you're into such games, you might even like it afterwards.The point is, sometimes the game is still boring and not engaging even despite the complex rules and heavy ciphers being used. You probably know that all that must matter something, but you can't care enough to dig into it, to ""do research"", like some pretentious all-so-smart people call it here.So i wasn't too surprised when i found out that the director of Enemy is the same guy who directed Prisoners. Here we have the same tendency to fill the movie to the brim with symbols and secret messages intended for those who care to play these charades. Yet Prisoners was a very solid movie. Not a masterpiece, but something i found both substantial and gripping. That movie, despite trying to lure you into playing games and ""doing research"", awards you with some value even if you just want to give up the wheel and let it slide to whatever outcome there will be.Enemy, on the other hand, is hardly enjoyable if you're not that type of person who can't give up a newspaper or an entertainment magazine without solving all the crosswords or whatever puzzles they publish there on the last page these days. Unless you DO want to put some extra time into trying to get any meaning out of it, this movie will remain nothing more than a bizarre set of awkward scenes.This reminds me of the Renaissance art of painting. It's not enough to just look at it to really ""understand"" it, you need a knowledge of a special cultural code to read the symbols hidden in that sort of art. It might get exciting for a little while, but it's really hard to follow all the details if you're not a culturologist or if it's not Dan Brown who's telling you the story.I guess it's what modern art is these days. Either you play by the rules, look for the symbols and keys to solve the riddles in which such art speaks, or you're left completely untouched by it and therefore do not even see an artistic value in it.What i value in movies is the emotional feedback, and this movie gave me none. Yet i don't think watching it was completely pointless, since even you don't get along with modern art - it's another reason to at least think about it and about how artists tend to interact with audience these days.",Enemy

This is a film that felt very different to other mystery/thriller type films, it paces itself out really slowly but that really allows you to assess what just happened and what is happening before it throws a curve ball at you. This was one of the most confusing and unpredictable movies i have ever seen right up to the very last scene which has to be one of the most mind boggling endings to a film. The film was helped by another great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal who is quickly rising to be one of the great modern actors with amazing roles in Prisoners and Nightcrawler. What this very different and ambitious film does best is make you wonder what was going on at different points during the film and also why some things were happening.

It makes the viewer feel smarter than the average Joe, and this absurd feeling of superiority propagates an opinion of greatness. But sometimes these second meanings and general obtuseness don't make for a great film, even with the meanings understood. Scene by scene the film should work, should at least feel like growth and story in service of something. This isn't quite that. There are moments of great cinema in here, but even with an even interpretation, there are still long-winded scenes of ponderousness that don't further any sort of feeling for the story, outside of trying to provide some out of reach meaning.What I mean is this: David Lynch makes great films with plots that can't be explained are are looped in some dream logic.

114,priyantha-bandara,"Has one of the most twisted ""WTF"" endings",9,5 July 2014,"In my opinion a good psychological thriller has to have 3 strong elements. 1. It should be a story that's close to everyday situations where most viewers can relate to. 2. It should have the capacity to grab the viewer from the throat and squeeze in to their brains without much effort. 3. It should have and ending without an ending that's so mysterious that different viewers should have different opinions about it. In short a good psychological thriller is a movie that some would despise and some would break their brains to get right. And Enemy has all those qualities and I was stricken by its force. After many days of watching it and reading ample material on the net about what it really is still I don't know if I got it right or not.Abad Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor who lives a mundane and a very routine life. He teaches in day time and has no interests of anything else as such. He has a girlfriend but her visits and time spent also part of his dull routine. But one day after recommended by someone he goes out of his routine and rents a movie. After watching the movie he realizes that there was a minor character actor that just looks exactly like him. Abad get obsessed with meeting this look alike actor.Though the plot sounds neat and tidy the representation of it is mind scattering. There are skeptical twists that wraps the whole story and deeper it goes complicated it becomes. As there are only few words spoken and it seems like every line has its contribution towards a twisted meaning. And the peculiar cinematography always concentrates on cityscapes and shapes which are most of the time have less people and seemed isolated just like our main character. And when it's combined with the eerie music the movie creates a mysterious atmosphere amongst the vastly seeing urban landscapes. All in all the look and feel of Enemy itself is a psychological mystery.Performance wise Jake brings back his Donny Darko (2001) mood and it's very good. His facial expressions contributes to his powerful character (or should I say characters) and his confusion over his own behavior is clearly shown. Jake makes Enemy even better. Enemy is directed by Denis Villeneuve who was recently well known for Incendies (2010) and Prisoners (2013). Being a big fan of both, Enemy is another valued addition to Denis's high marks in my book.Sadly the irony of writing a review about a psychologically thriller is that very less can be told about its plot unless you tend to reveal lot and spoil it for many. Therefore, other than saying Enemy is a piece of cinema that fried my brain cells more than ones and has one of the most twisted ""WTF"" endings I will not say anything further - See more at: http://www.flickshout.blogspot.com/#sthash.a7mKDaHk.dpuf",Enemy

Suffice it to say, I was quite satisfied with the whole film - and as you don't know me that should leave you happily in the dark! :)Good film, the art of mystery writing is not dead.

116,Tehmeh,An intensive mesh of symbolism and hidden meanings.,10,21 December 2014,"I am not the smartest guy.I don't fully understand David Lynch's movies, for example. But I do like a story that allows you to think and ponder. There is a fine line to me with movies that are either ambiguous or heavily symbolic - does the movie invite you to think or does it kick you in the face and at the same time scream ""THINK, IDIOT!""? With Enemy, it's the former. It could easily be the latter, but Gyllenhaal's performance, eerie cinematography and the intense music keep you hooked no matter how you feel about what's going on.Gyllenhaal became one of my favorite working actors with this movie, as well as Villeneuve became one of my favorite working directors. I loved them both in Prisoners, and I love them even more now. With Enemy, Villeneuve proved that he is not only talented, but a very versatile director. Gyllenhaal also proved that his few good performances in the past were not accidents.Sarah Gadon also gets points for her performance. There is one scene in particular where she nailed it, she carried the emotional weight so well. Of course she is beautiful to look at too.Enemy is...I don't want to say that it's complicated, even though you probably will arrive to that conclusion. I did too, at first. I think that Enemy is a very simple story that is told in a non-conventional way by means of symbolism and various clues. There is obvious symbolism, but don't be fooled - it's not just the obvious, it's everywhere. Almost every scene has something to it that has a deeper meaning.Enemy feels like a movie that is so carefully constructed that after you have chewed on it for a while, you want to see it again. At least I do. Sometimes a film is made to be ambiguous for the wrong reasons, as if the filmmakers didn't have an idea what they were doing and were just playing with some ""weird"" imagery or ambiguous methods of story-telling to disguise their own failures. With Enemy it's the exact opposite - it really does seem like everything is thought out, and you get to make up the puzzle in the end.I watched this film on blu-ray (sadly no commentary track, at least on my version) tonight with a friend. We are now creating our own theories and planning to watch it again, soon. Despite this, I would recommend watching Enemy alone. Just when you're in that peculiar and ponderous state of mind, turn off the lights and give it a go.I would recommend this movie for everyone. I know it is definitely not for everyone, but I want everyone to experience it nonetheless. It's a weird but very intense slow-burn, and requires that certain state of mind to fully appreciate it - as well as repeated viewings.I am glad that these movies are still made. I'm not an art movie snob at all, but I have to love it when I see the art and craft of cinema represented like this. The impact this film had on me was certainly huge. Well done, sirs and madams.",Enemy
117,schroeder-gustavo,Enemy,10,28 February 2016,"Enemy is most likely the most enigmatic, confusing movie I have ever seen. There are other movies like ""Only God Forgives"" that may be more confusing perhaps, but this movie actually felt like it led somewhere. Like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Enemy had a great setup and a great payoff, if one can understand what the movie is trying to say.""Chaos is order, yet undeciphered."" Nothing could be more true. These are the first words we see on screen, right after a shot of the city of Toronto. Enemy is deep on symbolism, especially with spiders.So what does it all mean? Spiders represent women in the way our main character sees them. He has a deep fear of commitment and likes to cheat on his wife. Spiders catch their prey in their webs and then eat them The film is trying to say that the main character feels like he has lost his freedom and he feels ""trapped"" in the web of his marriage. He does not like the idea of commitment nor of having to take care of his soon to be born child. Dictatorship and being unwillingly ruled are important themes in the story. The lectures he gives on the subject are basically Jake telling the audience how he feels about his marriage, he feels oppressed. In the opening of the film, in the sex club we see a woman about to squash a spider. This represents that Jake wishes to squash his wife (women are spiders) through his own unfaithfulness. The short dream sequence where he sees a woman with a spider head supports that spiders represent women, Now the next spider is pretty interesting: Directly after the scene where he meets his mother, we see a huge spider roaming Toronto. Well, it turns out there is a monument in Ontario called the ""Mother Spider"" which looks almost exactly the same as the one we see in the film (only smaller, of course). So the huge spider represents his mother and how he feels she is trying to control his life. When his wife turns into a huge spider at the end, why does it react in fear? This means she was afraid of being squashed by her husband. She was afraid that her love would be ""squashed"" by his unfaithfulness. This happens immediately after he feels tempted to go to the sex club again. Everything in the movie supports the idea that the main character is unfaithful and is ""a spider killer"" and hates the idea of being ""oppressed"". When he walks home after work at school he walks by some wall art of people doing the Roman salute. Every one is painted black, except the one in the middle who is painted red. This means two things: Jake is lost in his subconscious and he opposes the idea of being oppressed. Later, when he rents the movie, two interesting things are happening in the store: 1) There is a poster of ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" and 2) The song playing is called ""The Cheater"", a song about a man who cannot control his impulses and can't remain faithful. These are all manifestations of his fears of commitment and marriage. We constantly see low shots of street wires that look a lot like spider webs all over the city and at the end of the film when Anthony and Mary crash, the broken window of the car looks like a spider web, which for me represents the moment his wife ""catches"" him cheating. He is once again ""caught in her web"". But at the end of the actual storyline, at the sex club the woman symbolically squashes the spider and Jake breaks free of his wife's clasp.Jake Gyllenhaal delivers an amazing performance, especially because he has to portray two very different characters. The overall cast is pretty good as well. I love the cinematography in the movie, too. Every shot looks very Grey and dark which is the overall tone of the movie. Something I did not expect to love was the score. It is very tense and it adds so much to the overall tension of the film and I loved it. Enemy is not a conventional film and it is not for everyone, I can understand that. However, Enemy is one of the few films I consider to be ""perfect"". There is not a single thing I would change in it. Every time I watch it I get new things out of it. Enemy is a great example on a movie working on every level possible, the difficult thing is to understand what the movie is trying to say. ""Chaos is order, yet undeciphered.""10/10",Enemy
118,ajit2106,"A Captivating ride, interpretable and debatable",7,14 April 2014,"""Enemy"" is a film adaptation of the Novel ""The Double"" by José Saramago. The subversive and perverse idea, a history professor who finds a person physically identical to him in every minute detail, combined with an intriguing visual style. ""Enemy"" is a psychological thriller with introspective. It is a haunting and disturbing journey through the mind, which skirts the limits of terror, by the obsessions and self-knowledge of two very specific characters that share physical appearance and are almost mirror opposites.The dreamlike images that delve into the feeling, reaching the end at the end of the film, one of the most daring, powerful and frightening than have been seen in modern cinema. And perhaps all this leads to the quasi-experimental film which will not satisfy all its viewers. But even those, who reject such an extreme film, will have to admit the enormous impact that the film generates. Enemy is one of those movies that linger in the mind, for one or many reasons, but last.It would be easy to seek references from David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick. But perhaps it is best not to dispense it with any reference.Enemy terminates after 90 minutes, but only on the screen. The film follows in the memory because it is interpretable and debatable, but especially hypnotic. Fascinated by the characters, the film techniques, sounds, history, pictures, metaphors ... and finally, it resonates in our own subconscious. What would we do in that situation? ""Enemy"" is a land of symbolism, imagery with Jake Gyllenhaal, he is at the peak of his performance in the challenging dual role. But the star here is the direction of Villeneuve, who creates a real under the skin atmosphere. Sometimes you will be overloaded as a spectator with images and motifs.Nevertheless Enemy is deeply disturbing and captivating, it will leave you confused, scared, angry, surprised and shocked.",Enemy
119,TheFilmGuy1,An Extremely Smart And Original Film,9,3 August 2014,"Enemy has to be one of the smartest films I have seen in a while. It's about a university professor who notices a man who looks exactly like him who is an extra in a movie. Trust me, this is not what the movie is actually about. First I think I should get my interpretation out of the way. To me, this movie is taking place in the mind of one man. He is struggling with control of his life, and has issues with things such as infidelity. The two versions of Jake Gyllenhaal are the same man, possibly at different points in his life. I won't go too deep into this because I don't want to spoil it, but there's a lot of stuff here to look at, and I think i'm on the right track with my interpretation of this. There are little details that can be easily missed, such as a reference to blueberries, a spider in Toronto coming right after the mother scene, or even details such as who is on top during sex scenes (which is actually something that I noticed but I haven't seen anyone else say anything about it, but I think is related to the main theme.)Jake Gyllenhaal gives a really great performance. He plays the two characters in a way where you can tell who is who without needing to know who we are supposed to be watching. One is more timid and scared, the other is more confident and knows exactly what he's doing. The film relies on him playing these characters well, and he completely pulls it off. The film is also interestingly shot. It is simple yet visually appealing. It sometimes feels like a dream, which if my interpretation is correct, then that was done on purpose. It feels less like reality and more like some kind of alternate world. I also though it was cool seeing Toronto shown in a movie where it's actually supposed to be Toronto, since I go to school there. This is certainly a film for people who like to think. If you want everything solved in the end and wrapped up with a pretty bow, you will hate this, but if you love analyzing films like I do, you will be in absolute heaven. You could spend an hour talking about this film with people, and you may have a different interpretation than I do. In the end, it's a great film that challenges its viewer, and doesn't try to confuse you just to make you think it's smart. The film knows exactly what it's doing.",Enemy
120,LiamBlackburn,The spider,8,10 April 2014,"I have had lucid dreams of spiders. The imagery in this movie is incredibly surreal yet realistic. For some reason, the spider is a very powerful subconscious image that is ingrained in all of our minds. Personally, I think the spider represents the woman in relation to man. In this movie, he finally realizes he has been spun into the black widows web of commitment and having kids and the fancy apartment. Though the whole movie he was fighting this outcome. Inevitably, he ends up succumbing to the spiders sticky webs. THere are a lot of scenes where it's tough to to tell exactly which ones are real and which ones are taking place in his mind. Overall, they did a good job in sustaining tension. Unfortunately, the music was a little overdone at times. They kept playing the same three notes over again in a Minor progression. I've lived in downtown Toronto for a long time and they did a interesting take on the city. You would have to watch this movie a couple times to make full sense of it.",Enemy

Well, I call it arty-lite because it is not too arty that it bores people to death but it is quite interesting and has a lot of things which are not clearly explained. It is more Hollywood than art film. The movie is about a guy who discovers that there is an actor who resembles him and he goes on to contact him and so on.

After a while, students/viewers/critics are just making stuff up.Whatever director Denis wanted to say, he missed.

But sometimes they also give you too little, and the inevitable source is a rather entitled director. Could this be the case with Enemy? I don't really know. Really I don't. What I do know is that a great movie with an awesome cast was in part reduced to rubble due to the misguided efforts of the writers, producers, director et. al. What does the big giant spider symbolize? A vagina? The main character's fear of intimacy? Is it one mind with two personalities or the opposite? Is it an allegory for totalitarian regimes that cut off the population so effectively they do not even know they are being controlled, such as is the case with North Korea? I actually really enjoyed the first hour of Enemy, which earned it 5 stars.

If you can imagine David Lynch adapting a Kafka novel, then you will be in the right neighborhood! In Incendies and Prisoners,Villeneuve inserted serious moral and social issues in the context of first rate thrillers' Here he follows the same tradition but the tone is more abstract and absurd. Neverherless, Enemy, adapted from a novel by the Nobel prize winner Jose Saramago, is always gripping and totally fascinating.

136,midas-jacobs,Not your ordinary movie,8,13 March 2016,"Enemy is one of the most underrated movies of 2013, and I'll explain why in this review.In the end I will also give my own interpretation of the movie. In Enemy we meet Adam, the history teacher if I remember correctly. He finds out about Anthony, an actor, who just looks like him. Adam starts to create an obsession to find Adam, what he is up to and why they look so much alike.The director of this movie is the same person who has directed also a underappriciated movie, which is called ""Prisoners"" also starring Jake Gyllenhaal. The director is called Denis Villeneuve. He is a fantastic director and has again proved that he does perfectly what he does. There are impressive scenes in this movie, and let's take one as an example. When Adam calls to the house of Anthony, and he get's the wife of Anthony on the other side of the line. Nut let me talk about the walking to the cellphone part. We first see Jake on the right of the screen, but it is directed the way that our eyes just have to follow the main character, and that our eyes don't have to switch position. In Mad Max: Fury Road this is done too. It is a very impressive technique, and has a very beautiful effect as well. The next shot he still is on our right, but then he goes to the middle of the screen, where after we see a note in the middle of the screen. The cinematography is very pretty. This also ads on to the thing that I have just mentioned. The editing was less good at moments, that actors jump to a complete different pose between cuts. But the soundtrack was very good, it was tense full, and fitted the movie very well.The acting is really good. Luckkily. Otherwise the movie would have been a whole lot worse. Jake Gyllenhaal played two characters in this movie, which is an impressive thing. Not a lot of actors are capable of doing this. But Gyllenhaal is a very good actor, and he proves this a lot of times. Recently in ""Nightcrawler"", but also in the lesser good ""Southpaw"". In this movie he is very good. He both plays Anthony and Adam. Anthony being the actor, who is full of himself, and has problems to keep a relationship. Then you have Adam. The confused history teacher, who has problems keeping a relationship... But more on that later. He was good as these characters, and the characters were also very good. Due to Jakes acting you could see the difference between both characters. There were of course also some visual aspects that they put into the movie so you could see the difference between them (clothing, ring, etc.) Gyllenhaal is by far the best actor in the movie, but there are also some other actors who were good. The first supporting actress I will discuss is Mélanie Laurent. She plays the girlfriend of Adam. She was good, especially towards the end of the movie. The second one is Sarah Gadon. Sarah was the wife of Anthony. She was really good as well. The fake pregnant belly looked real that they put on her. And the last person I am going to talk about was the less good one. She had some bad line deliveries, but also bad acting moments. She was the mother of Adam, played by Isabella Rossellini. Like I have said. She was less good then the rest of the cast.Now the screenplay. One of the most important parts of the movie. Especially in this movie. The movie is build well, with a solid story. The dialogue was a less good part at times. It was just not too well written at moments. Another problem that I have with the screenplay is that you really slide through the story in the first 30 minutes. It felt like it was sped up. This is also due to the editing. But after the 30 minute mark (more or less) this starts to slow down, which is a good thing.But now let's get to the most interesting part of the movie. No, not the characters, even though they are a part of what I am going to discuss. It's the story. It is confusing as hell, but when you think about it, it starts to become mere clear. The following thing that I am going to say is MY interpretation of it it may be INCORRECT, as I think it is, because I have seen a way better explanation on the channel of 'Chris Stuckmann'. But I think that Anthony and Adam are in fact the same person. But that Jake (let's refer to the name of the actor when I mean the two of them combined) has a split personality. The actor version doesn't really exists. It's the history teacher. The spider thing, also confirms this. The spiders resemble him. And my logic of this may sound stupid to you, but here it is simplified: He resembles the spiders, because they make webs, so does he, but not webs made out of well, the thing spiders make webs of, but a web made of lies. Also at the end of the movie, we see The actor, with Laurent. Here they have a car crash, where the camera zooms in on the window, that looks like a web. A web of lies. I also think that Laurent is the one with which he is cheating, and that Gadon is his real wife. The crash I think takes place in the mind of Jake, just like a lot of other things.I hope that my explanation was clear, and maybe correct. But thank you for reading this review. I think that this was a weird, but good movie. It is not a ordinary movie, but it was fun to watch and to think about.8.5/10",Enemy

The fact is, I have seen and understood hundreds of great films, and this is not one of them. It is not even in the same area code as those films. I had figured out by the 30 minute mark where this film was heading. If you've seen twist movies like The Sixth Sense or Fight Club, you will also. Just because the writer and director shovel on the symbolism and shoot scenes in almost black rooms with red filters making it difficult to see what is transpiring, it doesn't make this an exercise in high intellect.I will try to say something nice about this movie: the acting seems good, though the actors are given very little to do beyond standing around or sitting looking confused and/or upset. The cinematography is nice as are the views of the city. There, I've stated the positives.To add insult to injury, the end of the film provides no answers, just more questions, as if shying away from revealing its plot twist, afraid that viewers like myself will have seen it coming and look upon the entire endeavor as low-rent Shyamalan.In the extras, the writer speaks about how he purposely wanted to leave the ending open to interpretation.

Underneath the simple plot there lies a wealth of little elements which put together yield a message about humans as fallen beings.Enemy is one of those movies which captivate you after having watched them. Watching this movie isn't very entertaining (that's why I vote seven), but thinking about it afterwards is rewarding and interesting. This is Jakes' genre so his acting is great. Plot may be confusing and hard to follow but is nevertheless logically valid no matter how hard it may be to make something sound out of it. These are most important considerations to help you have better first impressions. Mentioning more would harm your first watch.Conclusion: If you're looking for a movie in which subtle details matter a lot, don't mind depressing tone and quaint plot and, most importantly, you're willing to carefully think about all elements and assemble them together to get a whole picture (which in this case can take days) and read other peoples interpretations, go for it.

This is its greatest failure, as it expects a lot of the viewers and it is fair to say - the conclusion can be far from fulfilling.The acting is good, the characters are somewhat interesting, but the number of characters were lacking a bit, as they felt very isolated from the world.This very much a ""hit-or-miss"", there's nothing really intriguing about this movie, and the aspects that are, can actually give the completely opposite feeling.",Enemy

It is also served by a fantastic cast - Jake G. is simply incredible. It is also short enough to keep your attention. Anything more can easily become pompous and pretentious.

Viewers have to guess what it is all move.The type of good mystery or twilight zone movie is it will reveal at the end and users will get shocked or surprised because of the ending and understands the whole show.This on the contrary, will just play out the things that the movie writer wants to show. It may imply some thing, but it is very confusing to many viewers.Like at the very end, there is a big spider showing.. It may symbolize something, but if for you just view that as trailer, you think it is a sci-fi movie. It completely makes no sense at all.

151,nikashvili,Enemy is a mesmerizing piece of art with Gyllenhaal's amazing performance,8,21 January 2015,"Adam Bell (Jake) is a history teacher, has a girlfriend Helen (Sarah Gadon) and lives a quiet life. His life mostly takes place between school, where he teaches and home, where he merely has sex with Helen. Once his co-worker very randomly suggests a movie and he decides to give a try. The movie turns out to be as plain and not really special. But it does not end here, since he's seeing scenes from that movie in dreams and he sees himself in some episodes, or a guy who just looks like him. It turns out that this guy is Anthony St. Claire (also Jake) - an actor and exact copy of history teacher. This is where life gets messed.In fact, Adam and Anthony are the same person, more precisely two different identities of the same person. First of all, because if they were two different people that would be sorta very simple and second of all, because so many symbolism in the film would not make sense. This theory is proved by either behavior of those characters or Helen (Anthony's wife) - who actually knows that her husband has personal identity problems (let me get back to this later).At the beginning, when Adam finds out that he's got a ""twin"", he is shocked, obsessed, terrified and reacts mostly negatively. So does Anthony, who is even more not willing to see alleged ""brother"" anymore. My first, very sincere, reaction was why would anyone react to this kind of fact in a not nice way?! I mean what is wrong with having a brother, who just looks like you?! Later, when Helen meets Adam and tells about this meeting to Anthony, she seems really scared and emotional. Then actor Jake says that he has no idea what she is talking about to which she replies that ""I think you know"". My guess is that she in fact guesses that those two people are the same person - her husband. In reality, if you found out that your spouse has an identical twin, would it bother you so much that you get depressed?! But this is not what happens here, Helen is trying to accept the fact that her husband has an identity problems and he's living two different lives.There is a scene with his mother, where she tells that he's got a respectable job and he has to quit his acting fantasy. It makes me think that he unsuccessfully tried to act in those films and then went back to teaching. It seems that Anthony has not been to his agency for six months and Helen is also six month pregnant. It clearly shows that for last half an year, he switched to school, trying to make things work in the life.It turns out that actor Jake had been unfaithful to his wife, because he is a type of guy who easily sleeps around. He is not capable of keeping things too serious, taking responsibilities and does not definitely enjoy being controlled by someone. And his wife and a little baby in her is definitely trying to control or censor him. Opening scene shows him being in a strip club, where men can watch women masturbating and doing anything to satisfy their thirst. This is the place where Anthony feels great, because he is free, no obligations, no control, no censor.Speech of professor Adam Bell about dictatorship, control and censorship clearly echoes how he feels in reality. He says that control is possible only by lowering education and that's why he started to teach - to resist the control two women have on him - mother and wife.Spiders in the movie are women. The first spider - in strip club, a stripper is about to step on and kill - is wife. Because this is to where Anthony escapes from marriage responsibilities. The other spider roaming over Toronto is mother (played by Isabella Rossellini). She only appears only for three minutes and still she tries to control son in her own way - dictate what to eat, where to work, how to live. She also says that he (Anthony) had always had trouble to stay with one woman, which confirms my doubt that those two characters are the same person.In this scene, she offers some blueberries, Adam rejects it saying that he does not love it. Then mother replies ""of course, you love it"". In fact, Anthony loves blueberry and the reason why Bell refuses to like it that he wants so much to run from mom that he refuses anything she suggests.Basically, the movie is about one person trying to fight his own demons. Car crash in the end of the movie is a symbol of end of this fight, killing the bad part of main character's personality and Adam Bell finally stays with his wife, saying her sorry. It definitely implies that he kind of let go his passions and decided to commit to family. However, it did not stay unchanged for a long time. Earlier while giving a lecture, Adam said that history repeats itself and it is neverending circle. And when he finds a key to that strip club, he once again decides to cheat, this is why Bell tells wife that he has to go out at night. Then wife does not respond and entering the room we see a huge spider in the room. It is Helen, who feels that her husband is going to be unfaithful again and wants to attack him as means of self-defense.To conclude, Adam/Anthony was a man who tried to escape reality of family, responsibilities and control. That's why he decided to invent another him. One part lived that hard life and another easier one. But in the end, he realized that all this is farce and his life turned into a big mess. And then he panics.",Enemy
152,tao902,Intriguing but not satisfying.,5,25 May 2015,"Adam notices his double in a DVD he is viewing and decides to find and meet the actor. A well made film. However, the premise that a man becomes obsessed with tracking down his double is weak. Building a whole movie on such a concept is risky and ultimately fails here. The film is stylish, well acted and intriguing but doesn't draw the viewer in as a quality film does.The occasionally surreal moments are well done but perhaps mainly cover for the implausibility of the plot. Or perhaps the real story is that there is only one main character with a split personality who is gradually coming to terms with his two selves. Either way, ultimately it's not a satisfying film.

This is one of those films.There is no awesome way to describe this movie without giving away my interpretation of the entire thing. It's not a film that you watch and then you're done. It's going to keep you thinking. After I finished it, I hunted down a interview with the director to confirm or deny my take away. I was glad to learn I'd gotten the whole of the story in my own mind!If you want a giggle, pause the film 4:22 seconds before it ends and record yourself watching the ending no one expects.Brilliant.

154,j-madej,"""ENEMY"" is a dark, dramatic study of a character in somewhat mundane yet surreal circumstances",8,19 May 2014,"I pretty much guaranty that you might want to review the ""ENEMY"" for a second time to make sure that you've understood the story correctly and second time around you are looking for clues director Denis Villeneuve left behind to discover it's correct meaning. Based on the novel by Javier Gullón ""ENEMY"" is a dark, dramatic study of a character in somewhat mundane yet surreal circumstances. Adam Bell (subdued Jake Gyllenhaal) is a glum, disheveled history professor, who seems disinterested even in his beautiful girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent). Watching a movie on the recommendation of a work colleague, Adam spots his double, a B-class actor named Anthony Clair, and decides to track him down. The identical men meet and their lives become bizarrely and irrevocably intertwined. They can not see a physical differences between each other, but the question is if their wives can. Gyllenhaal is transfixing as both Adam and Anthony, provoking empathy as well as disapproval while embodying two distinct personas. This type of dual performance in one movie is not easy to play, however Gyllenhaal finds specific physical (walk) and emotional devisions between both characters (insecurity vs confidence), that to the viewer sets them clearly apart. The whole style of ENEMY from the filmmaking side has this meditative visual form to it, that pools you in, despite of lack of action, in combination with a continues score that sets the hypnotic tempo of the film, creating uneasy suspense. You as the viewer are trying to empathize with the main character asking ourself, what we would have done in the same situation. There are also scenes of pure surreal abstract David Lynch like symbology (the spider symbolizing the trap of marriage and parenthood) Adam feels in his marriage, as well as very Stanley Kubbrick ""Eyes Wide Shut"" scenes in the underground strip club that offers note of a erotic longing of our protagonist for freedom. Less intellectual audience will be deeply disappointed with the ending, that seems open and is hard to explain in an ordinary fashion. However the second you will understand the full depth of the main character, you might be luck enough to try to see this film only twice, to make a full easement of what unfolded here. I do not want to say too much about the twist in the end, to not spoil it for you, so all will I say is that the ""ENEMY"" is everything it appears to be and nothing at the same time.

155,TheMovieSnob247,What begins as a captivating thriller ends up making no sense whatsoever,4,3 July 2014,"Huh? I was really disappointed in this film as I had no idea what I just watched. I had heard good things leading up to it and it's filmed in my city (Toronto) so I was fairly excited to see it. Jake Gyllenhaal (who is serviceable at best here) teams up once again with Denis Villeneuve (the director of Prisoners) for what initially appears to be a captivating mystery (the kind of which I haven't seen in some time). In a nutshell, Jake is a professor who's life is turned upside down when he sees and pursues someone from a movie who looks exactly like him. The first two thirds of the film were very well done as I was intrigued by the story and the mysterious plot elements that were being developed; as the film progressed my curiosity grew and grew.The film had a really haunting score that gave it an eerie vibe and that only added to the excitement of a puzzle that I had to piece together (Villeneuve clearly has talent for creating the appropriate mood in his films, he did a fantastic job of this in Prisoners). All was well until it got to the last third of the film, where it takes a turn that while plausible considering the plot, made no sense whatsoever. Unfortunately, this event is the trigger for the final, pivotal events of the film and leads to an ending which was just left me totally bewildered and there was no real closure to the story. I have a general rule for movies; if I have to go on IMDb message boards after seeing a film just so I can get some sort of idea of what I just watched, it's a bad movie. And that is most definitely the case here, you can pass on this one.Was my review not horrible? Great!

For me this was an instantly forgettable flick.It sounded like a film with an interesting premise, but the art-house direction the film takes, put me off quite a bit, I also disliked the palette of the film. I only stayed with it to its conclusion to see what direction the film would choose to go.I found the acting performance of Jake Gyllenhaal one of the plus points of the film, but the pace and the way the story unfolds was very unsatisfying for me.I have read other reviews here on the meaning of the movie, so I get that it was not meant to be a conventional thriller as such, but a more abstract one. But here is where I lost interest as it was difficult to care what was happening to the characters.I really did not care for this film, other than the acting there was nothing here that would make me recommend the film, unless you are a fan of David Lynch or similar such directors, which I am most definitely NOT.I would give it 6/10 overall due to its artistic merits and acting, but purely for entertainment it would get less.",Enemy
157,sashamyshkina,Just because something is psychological and artsy doesn't mean it's good.,5,6 May 2021,"I was a massive fan of Villeneuve's take on Blade Runner so I decided to explore some of his other films. And there are lots of words I can use to describe Enemy, but unfortunately I don't think 'good' is one of them.Please note that this review contains spoilers.Enemy is an interesting movie. I sensed immediately that this was one of those movies that seemed normal at first, but were bizarre and surreal the further you looked. And usually I'm a massive fan of movies like that, but because of that I know that it's very hard to do right. And Enemy just misses the mark.The biggest problem with the movie is that there's simply not enough for you to realise there is that deeper level. Villeneuve keeps dropping random hints which aren't followed through, to the point that I thought it was just some drama movie with the occasional giant spider instead of the intended nightmarish thriller. The most interesting drama is saved for the last few minutes, with the rest of the movie being slowed down to a languidly paced, uncomfortably colour-keyed drawl.I mean, there wasn't exactly much linkage between the spider stuff and the main story. I didn't connect that it was a metaphor until I came here. The idea of an identical double could have got so many ways - identity mix-ups causing potentially life-threatening scenarios, crumbling of sanity, science-fiction-esque explanations, philosophical ideas. However, Villeneuve didn't go very far with the reasoning behind this, chalking it up to a coincidence that there just happened to be two Jake Gyllenhaals and skipping over to slow conversation in painfully yellow hotel rooms.Speaking of whom, Jake Gyllenhaal was clearly the highlight of this movie. He pretty much carried Enemy in its entirety, to the point that I completely forgot that there was one person playing both Adam and Anthony.The ending was good in theory but poor in execution. Again, there just wasn't enough buildup to make it particularly satisfying. If Villeneuve had infused the theme of the insects into the 'main' storyline a little more - dreams? Hallucinations? - then the ending would have been somewhat more complete-feeling, but instead you're left thinking 'what?', but unfortunately not in a good way.This could have been good. It was a compelling movie on some levels, but it generally missed the mark.-Sasha.",Enemy

159,rblenheim,Brilliant surrealist thriller that will keep you up at night thinking,10,20 February 2015,"Denis Villeneuve is the French-Canadian genius who gave us the Academy Award nominee ""Incendies"" in 2010 and the brilliant thriller ""Prisoners"" in 2013. Actually filmed before ""Prisoners"" but released after it, ""Enemy"" -- an adaptation of Portuguese Nobel prize-winning author Jose Saramago's novel, ""The Double"" -- is a great and beautiful work of cinematic surrealism requiring the viewer to constantly discern its reality from its allegorical images and sounds.This haunting and seductive film adds to the long respected explorations of the doppelgänger theme (taken up by artists like Poe, Conrad, Dostoyevsky, Borges, Harlan Ellison and countless more), and tells of a history teacher named Adam Bell who rents a film from a local video store and discovers in it a film extra named Anthony who looks exactly like himself to the point he decides to find and confront him face-to-face. The film develops into both an erotic thriller utilizing Freudian spider symbolism, and a parable of a totalitarian state.Jake Gyllenhaal gives us what seems to me the most versatile performance of his career playing both roles, each requiring subtle differences of character behavior. The director has called it a ""one way trip to the subconscious of a man struggling with issues regarding intimacy,"" but each viewer may have drastically different interpretations, especially after the film's last shot which has been called one of the most shocking in all cinema. I've seen ""Enemy"" four times already, and its images are unshakeable. One of the year's best.",Enemy
160,david-546,Strange Provocative Film,6,2 January 2015,"*****This may contain spoilers*****Enemy is a strange provocative film. Not everyone is going to like this film. It can and will be dismissed as boring crap while many others will just be baffled by it. And no doubt the film is off- putting. Dialogue is sparse. The plot seemingly does not make a lot of sense. It does go back and forth in time and that can be very off-putting. But if you live in Toronto as I do you will see a view of the city you have rarely if ever seen. Brooding, moody, mysterious. And who would have thought of Mississauga as brooding and mysterious. The Marilyn Monroe towers never looked so good. Such are Canadian films. Why imitate Hollywood when Hollywood mostly does movies with lots of things that blow up or they do bad comedies. Instead Canada actually does well with what are basically European or indie films. And few do it better than Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners). However, those looking for another Incendies or Prisoners are bound to be disappointed. If one thought Incendies complex, Enemy can be more so. Jake Gyllenhaal is an interesting actor willing to take on Indies projects like Enemy. Many Hollywood actors wouldn't do that. And here Jake plays two people. The key is to get your head around the fact that only one of the characters is real while the other one is his imagination as he wishes to escape his marriage (the spiders represent how he is trapped) and possibly his job which he seems to find boring (he is a University lecturer) as it contains repetition. He would rather be his other self - an actor. But as his mother notes - he should stop trying to be a third rate actor. One of the interesting aspects is and I am not sure that Villeneuve meant this intentionally but he does pay some homage to David Cronenberg in particular and Hitchcock in general. Cronenberg's Spider is represented by the spiders. Dead Ringers is represented by the dual characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Finally Crash is represented by the crash scene under the Gardiner expressway on Lakeshore Blvd. You might even say that the Fly is represented by Gyllenhaal's desire to transpose himself but remain the same. The Hitchcock connection is more tenuous but I couldn't help but notice that both the female leads were blonds. Hitchcock had a thing for blonds in his films - Doris Day, Kim Novak, Tippi Hedren, Grace Kelly amongst others. Enemy is a strange provocative film. You almost need to see it a second time to really get a grasp on what it is all about. It was a difficult subject to deal with and while Villeneuve wasn't perfect at it by any stretch it is still fascinating and worth seeing if you have the patience.",Enemy
161,mgulev,Poor alien invasion story,4,9 January 2019,"There seems to be a lot of confusion as to what this movie is really about. Well, it´s quite simply a weirdly told story of an alien invasion. The movie starts with us seeing a spider get crushed. Alien bugs (think Men in Black) will of course not stand for this, so they send an army of spiders to infest the earth. The spiders don´t just appear as spiders, though. That would be too obvious, so they disguise themselves as humans infiltrating us (think Body Snatchers!). Adam finds his spider-double (Anthony) by accident and seeks him out. Big mistake! Anthony has already impregnated a human (Helen) with his spider off-spring and is looking for more incubators. Adams wife (Mary) is perfect, since he can impregnate her under the guise that he is Adam. She discovers his vile plot and he is forced to kill both her and himself to keep the invasion secret. Adam all too late discovers the truth and can only gawk in wonder at the huge spider (Helen in her last transformative state) in the bedroom covering up her nest of spider eggs.
All in all a pretty boring movie that could have won a broader audience with more explosions and gore.",Enemy
162,Zulfmanauthor,A Mindbending Masterpiece !!,9,22 June 2014,"This film based on a classic novel called 'The Double', is everything true cinema should be; intelligent, fascinating, compelling and thought provoking. The film focuses on a teacher whose obsession with a man who seems identical to him, leads to an uneasy search for reality. The concept of reality is based on our own perception, this is what the film portrays as Adam searches for Anthony. The truth of this movie is deep and each viewer will interpret the events that unfold in different ways, this is why a masterpiece like this comes along so rarely. Jake Gylenhall who plays Adam/Anthony, seems to get better with each performance, and what he does here is remarkable. Playing two characters who are a complete contrast to each other, yet ensuring he remains convincing as both. There are many clues but no answers as we the audience have to find our own version of what really happened. I would also recommend viewers to watch the short documentary 'Lucid Dreams', where the cast talk about this great movie. However watch the movie before seeing the documentary.

There was nothing believable about the story or plot whatsoever.

164,xtian_durden,It challenges viewers to use their mind and speculate,8,9 October 2014,"I admired its complex structure, surreal imagery, elegant symbolic photography, and Jake Gyllenhaal's dual performance. The film is well- thought and meticulously aligned, and it feels like every scene is important as it leaves you pieces of clues to whatever the real meaning of the film is. The use of dialogue, and hidden symbolism throughout the film is difficult to notice and it might leave audiences perplexed when the obvious symbols are revealed, much like the ending, which in my opinion was more confusing than scary during my first viewing.The first time I watched Enemy, I dismissed it as artsy-fartsy because of one of the weirdest ending in the history of cinema and I've found no resolution and meaning to the story of the film. But, attempting to try it again the second time knowing what to expect and having an open mind made it exponentially less confusing. And so I've learned that it's a battle of the subconscious mind of an unfaithful lover who is afraid of a committed relationship and how he's trying to eradicate his negative self to restore balance in his life. So I eliminated my presumption that there are two Jakes and concluded that those scenes that shows them conversing to one another only happened in his subconscious.I will not try to explain the whole film and every hidden meanings it has but I'm sure that I fully understand it now. But then, I still found plot holes and even though I try to disregard them due to the nature of the film, I asks myself ""Is it exempted from rational questions just because it is an art film?"" Mystery, fantasy and science-fiction films are often plagued with plot holes, and art films doesn't care about rules and conventions. So, does Enemy escapes any of its flaws?I concluded that it's too confusing to recognize what it is really about when you watch it the first time. But I praise it because it challenges viewers to use their mind and speculate, and it is rare to find a film that is smartly directed these days.",Enemy
165,i_ianchev,Men's Chaos,9,30 December 2014,"I tried to avoid this movie, but after some serious recommendations I watched it in the end. And the result is mind blowing insight into every man's nature...So let me explain again - I didn't want to watch this film at the very beginning, because it radiated darkness so much, that I felt it would definitely affect me. And I like my movies like my every other art form - to enjoy it when I am in the proper mood for it. I will always think that an art piece (no matter if music, movie, literature, painting, sculpture, etc.) has to be perceived when in the proper emotional condition. But after all I was impressed by the fact that so many reviewers who's opinion I value have recommended it. I have the similar case with the movie ""Under the skin"", but I will deal with that film later. So here's what I think of it...First of all - I discovered Denis Villeneuve as a director. Wow! A great line of movies which will surely build up my expectations for his next works. Second - Jake Gyllenhaal is in a winning streak... I cannot remember if I have watched a ""not so good"" movie with him. Every single film he has done in the last years is almost perfect - Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Source code, Love & Other Drugs, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Zodiac...way back to Donnie Darko - all of them are pretty decent to great, almost perfect movies! The script - amazing! Metaphors, Symbols, Analogues, etc. - almost every single stylistic device is used in this movie. Coming as an adaptation of the book ""The Double"" by José Saramago this movie is truly a masterpiece of cinema. Maybe I didn't give it 10/10 only because the style of the atmosphere was not what I like most, but it truly fits the psychosis emotions of the main character(s). The music was also fitting - I really liked how Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans embodied the characters' emotional transitions between guilt, angst, rage, curiosity, depression, disappointment, relief and frustration. The conscious and subconscious war going on between Adam and Anthony is on purpose and leads indeed to a repetitive rejection and susceptibility to lustful yearnings. Yes, maybe the main character feels as if the spiders - his wife and his mother (maybe it all comes from her?) try to take his freedom, but the decision to keep the key at the end of the movie is all his farce. And as we think - it is in men's nature to always be yearning, conquering and obsessive. So the solitary side of the main character is representing the man's will to set things right and not fall into the pit of desires. And the egoistic and hypocritical, always evasive, side is constantly interrupting, trying to prevail at any given chance and sign of hesitation.Overall this movie is a very good character study and brilliant example of questions being asked directly to the viewer without being answered before that. This piece of cinematography is a genius acting lesson and an ideal example of the classical regret and shamelessness altogether. And is all this circle of dissatisfaction and regret sane? No, it's rather whimsical... After all it seems that men are whimsical even more than women. The process of interpersonal alienation has never been more accelerated than in the 21 Century.",Enemy

It tells the story about a man (Gyllenhaal) who finds someone who looks exactly like him and seeks him out. It's hard to say more about it without spoiling things.This is an artsy film. I wasn't expecting it to be like that, which hindered my viewing experience. It's also a very dark film with a lot of crusty yellow colors. Make sure you watch the film in a dark room. It can be hard to see anything on the screen at times.When you watch this film, look for the use of spiders and question what and who is real and isn't real. These motifs and ideas play an important role in understanding the film and its ending. You can interpret them in many ways. I'm not sure if the film has one clear answer.Gyllenhaal does a great job playing both Adam and Anthony. He carries the film well with these two clashing identities. The story, though, has some plot holes that make it hard to come up with a clear understanding to this puzzle of a film. I think I understood what Villeneuve is trying to do at times, but maybe I'm wrong. It's up to you to interpret the film. Go into this film with an open mind.

Upon doing so he quickly realizes it was a mistake and becomes a little afraid realizing they don't just look exactly alike but also have a similar scar. Adam is a calmer more polite but subdued man he spots Anthony the actor who is more arrogant and aggressive.What this is about on a deeper level is the loss of individualism in a totalitarian state. How they convey this is something you have to find out for yourself, this really isn't a film that can be discussed too deeply before hand. Its almost like there should be reviews for those who have seen this and reviews for those who haven't.",Enemy
168,anthonymora2,Enemy Review,9,29 September 2014,"Summer 2014 has come and gone and with it we got stories of superheroes,dragons,and of course apes on horses!However with the end of the scorcher season comes Autumn,a darker time where darker movies come out and to send of thr summer I end it with a review of a film that tackles adultery,self-conflict,totalitarianism and other much darker themes.The film is called Enemy,and it might be the most compelling film I have seen in 2014.Enemy is the story of history teacher,Adam Bell (JAKE GYLLENHAAL) who,one day out of the blue,gets a movie recommendation EH😃 from a coworker.So he finds the movie at a local rental store and upon a rewatch,discovers that a certain actor in the movie looks exactly like him,minus an awesome beard.So Adam discovers the man is Anthony Claire(ALSO played by GYLLENHAAL),who's a small time actor,who actually happens to live in the same neighborhood himself,and the two look alikes to unravel just what the hell is going on and as a person who really supports going into these kinds of movies as oblivious as possible that's really all I wanna say about the plot.It's a pretty...riveting film to say the least.That being said,this is NOT by any means a movie for everyone!Not just because of the unconventional way the film or the story are crafted,but just because of the touchy subject matter that the movie portrays.The simple story of JAKE GYLLENHAAL'S twin characters may sound like a Lindsay Lohan style,quircky time but let me tell you guys that the story of Enemy,when really looked into,is really a well written and acted story of a man who's trying to overcome his inner demons and personal problems that are wrecking his life and loved ones.It's a hard movie to review and more of a movie for discussion.And THAT ladies and gentlemen is why I like this movie WAY more than most people might!The symbology and images used to tell the story like the use of spiders is great.I love when a movie can tell a story by mere images and scenes that contain very little dialog,it's credit to director,DENIS VILLENEUVE'S excellent vision and the strong cast performances.Which brings me to Mr.JAKE GYLLENHAAL,his performance in this movie is terrific.May I remind you that he plays two roles,which means two different characters,both with their own unique physical trademarks,ways of speaking,even walking posture and that's why I was so blown away by how good,JAKE pulled of his roles.His career has really blossomed as of late and with NIGHTCRAWLER releasing in a few months I've got this guy on my top actors to watch list.There is a supporting cast as well,with MELANIE LAURENT and SARAH GADON both who are really great opposite the two Jakes.I really enjoyed their characters and the raw emotion that they showcase.The movie is technically flawless to me,some people might get turned off by the simple color palette but it really gave the movie the right look and tone.The musical score is also fantastic,you can tell a lot of it may have been inspired by the movies of ALFRED HITCHCOCK like VERTIGO'S classic score.Actually a lot of this entire movie really feels influenced by HITCHCOCK'S work.ENEMY is my favorite kind of movie,one that promotes thought,discussion,and really shows that movies can be SOOO much more than MEGAN FOX running in slo-mo or constant reboots and sequels.There are unique stories that can be told by talented story tellers in ways that may not be told in a traditional,movie way.ENEMY is a movie that sucks you in with it's characters,performances,and sheer mystery at what might happen in the next scene.It's a powerful character study,a really suspenseful psychological thriller and I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! BUY THIS MOVIE!Unless you can't stand art films,just don't bother. 8/10What about you guys? Have you seen or even heard of ENEMY? Are you interested? Let me know what you think,drop a comment,and LET'S TALK MOVIES!",Enemy

172,BrentHankins,"A hypnotic, hyper-sexualized head trip.",6,20 March 2014,"After last year's critically acclaimed thriller Prisoners, director  Denis Villeneuve once again finds himself working alongside Jame  Gyllenhaal for Enemy (although to be fair, this film was actually  filmed first). Gyllenhaal plays Adam, a bored history professor who  resides in a trashy, dimly lit apartment and seems disenchanted with  just about every aspect of his own existence, including his rapidly  declining relationship with his girlfriend (Melanie Laurent).  Adam's life received an unexpected jolt of excitement when he discovers  that he has a doppelgänger, a local actor named Anthony Clair. Adam  quickly becomes obsessed with learning everything about this stranger  that shares his face and his voice, and eventually works up the courage  to contact him and suggest a meeting. Anthony is understandably  suspicious at first, but ultimately allows his curiosity to get the  better of him and agrees to the rendezvous, with neither man suspecting  how irrevocably their lives are about to be changed.  Inspired by José Saramago's 2004 novel The Double, Enemy is less a  literal retelling of the same events than a dreamlike, existential  examination of similar themes. While the novel is a fairly  straightforward affair, Villeneuve takes a much more ambiguous approach  to Enemy's storytelling, leaving plenty of room for each viewer to  formulate their own interpretation of the on screen events.  Gyllenhaal is marvelous as Adam and Anthony, his performance differing  distinctly so that the audience remains acutely aware of which  character they're observing, but the film is hampered by Villeneuve's  decision to craft a hypnotic, hyper-sexualized head trip rather than a  clear, concise narrative. He's trying his best to channel the likes of  Lynch and Cronenberg - and for the most part, succeeding - but the  film's lack of clarity and baffling final shot leave the audience with  more questions than answers.  -- Brent Hankins",Enemy
173,rsj624,"Perhaps the Best Psychological Thriller ever, but can it be explained?",10,5 March 2015,"**spoilers ahead**I'll admit that I was a little lost and left scratching my head after this film and did some research into what the meaning behind the film was and came up with some very interesting results. Mainly a lot of different takes exist, but what I found most interesting upon analyzing the film myself, was that all these views are not only right in their own regard, but could also each be smaller pieces to a much bigger and very involved puzzle. So before I actually review this film, albeit briefly, below is an analysis mixing these beliefs and findings with my own take upon re-watching key moments of the film armed with this new knowledge.For one thing, Adam is a history teacher whose focus in the film is on Totalitarian societies. Interestingly enough the film itself is heavily themed in Totalitarianism as Adam is ignorant to the fact that he belongs to the very type of repressive and controlling society that he teaches to his classes. This is supported by the heavy atmosphere in the film depicting a claustrophobic, borderline colorless, and hazy city that appears to be confined within its own space. Adam's double Anthony exists to shock Adam out of his individualism, and Anthony's existence further strips Adam of his identity within this rouse of a free world. Also highlighted in the film is the presence of spiders everywhere, which suggest that they are the ones that run society. This is where the film travels into surreal territory as the ending suggests that Adam has become the victim of a body snatcher, and that the spiders enforce this illusion of control within society by taking on the identities of humans rather than eradicating them. This also hints at Adam being a cinema buff, which his character leads us against believing at first. If you choose to interpret the film from this point as one big dream that Adam is having, then Anthony would be his mental manifestation of this obsession with Cinema; seeing as Anthony is an actor, as well as indulges in a more pleasure-centric life style. When Adam enters the rental store, we see an ""Attack of the 50 ft. Woman"" poster in the background, adding further weight to the possibility of the body snatchers being drempt up, and also further supported by a brief surreal segment showing a giant spider roaming the city; very ""War of the Worlds"" like. Also, even further supporting the film being a dream Adams is having can be finalized by the title of the film's special feature within the DVD: ""Lucid Dreams"". But the body snatchers angle from what I've figured out is actually an elaborate red herring, a part of Adam's subconscious that works its way into his dream along with his history lessons in attempt to distract him from making sense of the guilt and regret he feels for cheating on his pregnant wife and killing his other girlfriend in a car accident. This is supported by Anthony's wife seeming to know who Adam is near the end using suggestive dialog, and never really dismissing or rejecting his character. She even takes jabs at Anthony knowing why there is a double of himself saying ""I think you know...""; further suggesting they are one in the same. Both Adam and Anthony also share a scar in the same spot, which could have been caused by the car accident and also indicating that Adam had survived the car accident. These realities of Adam's life work together in his dream through the creation of Anthony, his mental manifestations of his wife and his deceased girlfriend to further push him towards what his dream is actually trying to make him aware of. The fantasy world of the spiders and having an actual double is used to throw us as viewers off as well as showcase Adam's inability to deal with his trauma. Like most dream worlds tend to do; things feel fragmented, consisting of recycled thoughts, dreary, disconnected imagery that confusing rather than directly explaining to ones self what's going on, much like the film itself chooses not to do. In the after Adam officially assumes Anthony's life, Adam's wife reveals herself to be a massive spider. She is afraid of Adam due to his cinematic mind making it seem like he has figured out that the spiders are body snatchers, when in fact it's hinting to us viewers that everything is a dream and that Adam will continue to escape and assume the mentality of Anthony rather than deal his mistakes. Anthony dying in the car crash can be seen as Adam's attempt to rid himself mentally of Anthony and his wrong doing, but the film's ending suggests he will only continue to fail at ridding himself of his repressed guilt through escapism. WITH ALL OF THAT MASSIVE ANALYSIS BEING SAID this movie is perhaps one of the best films I've watched in recent memory. It's such a risk to make a movie that is so layered and so fragmented, yet makes perfect sense one you manage to piece everything together. Part of the great lure to such a psychological thriller is not truly knowing what's going on. Everything from the lighting, to the use of overly dramatic and eerie music, to the placement of the camera, dialog, actors; everything whether planned or not allows for this film to prompt an interpretation of the events and their relevance within the world of Enemy. Few films can demand so much from it's viewers and give us such a playground of information to formulate an opinion on. Perhaps the greatest beauty is how it all seems so possible, none of it too far fetched. That's the mark of a truly well done film. When you know it's fragmented and confusing, but not due to being poorly constructed or made by amateurs. Cheers to you Enemy, job well done!",Enemy
174,grantbullert,A Thrilling Slow-Burn,8,7 October 2018,"""Enemy"" is a brilliant film visiting the idea of ourselves being our own worst enemy. It is not an easy film to understand. The story is not presented at face value, but when the true meaning is discovered it is something truly special.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: ""Enemy"" is one of the most well written films in recent years. It depicts a man who thinks he has met his twin or possibly even clone, but in reality he is in two states of mind. Denis Villeneuve delivers another fantastic film from the director's chair. He gets the most out of his actors and has a full command of the pacing of the story. He lets the audience in to just enough information to get them thinking, but not enough to make things bland. *Cinematography/Editing: The cinematography gives off an artificial vibe all throughout the film. Nicolas Bolduc captures the sense of loneliness and isolation Gyllenhaal's character faces throughout the film. There is a dark and brooding tone which matches the story wonderfully. The editing is incredible all throughout the picture. There are hints dropped all throughout the film that some viewers will be able to pick up in order to understand what the film is trying to communicate. *Dialogue/Acting: The interactions between characters are either one of power or powerlessness when side characters come into contact with Gyllenhaal's character. It shows who Gyllenhaal's character is trying to be at the moment. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an incredible performance. He pulls the focus toward himself at all times. The supporting actors are strong as well, accenting Gyllenhaal's performance. *Music/Sound: The music is adequate for the film. It heightens the drama in many scenes to give it a more powerful feeling. The sound design is very typical and does not draw attention to itself. *Production Design/Special Effects: These are very impressive parts of the film. The contrasts of Gyllenhaal's characters are very stark in the costumes they wear. Their clothing says much about them. The sets of the characters' homes are also well contrasted. One feels open, free and full of possibility. The other feels cramped and lifeless. The special effects are spotless. Gyllenhaal plays opposite himself in a few scenes and it is impossible to tell it is not real. Absolutely seamless work.*Conclusion: ""Enemy"" delivers a captivating story of a broken man who searches to find who he is. In many ways he is a representative of all of us. Who are we in comparison to who we choose to make people think we are?",Enemy

177,MarcoLara,It is all in the details,8,31 January 2015,"A man sees a guy in a movie that looks just like him, and so he embarks in a quest to find him, so even before you start watching this film the first question that pops into your head is whether you are going to see a movie about twin brothers separated at birth, a movie about some sort of psychopath with split personality, or a movie about someone trying to steal the life of someone else.To find what really happen you need to pay attention to the details and / or watch this movie several times. Saving the great distances between the two, think about it as ""Donnie Darko-esque"" sort of film, not because it could be a dream or delusion of the main character, but because it is one of this sort of movies that you need to pay attention to savor it.You may find yourself thinking that you would react in a completely different way if the things that happens to the main actor happened to you. If so, you did not pay enough attention, because once you understand what is going on you will realize that you, too, walking on his shoes would probably do the same thing.Another thing about this movie is the imaginary. There is something unreal in this movie, but you need to see it not for what it is, but for what it represents.The movie is really good, once you get the grip of it. Otherwise you will think that the movie makes no sense and its silly.The only reason why I did not give it higher marks is because I found some scenes to be a bit slow for my liking, but don't let that discourage you.

When this film ends, you kinda just sit there with absolutely no clue as to what you just watched... But I sorta love that feeling. This film is filled with metaphors and symbolism, as well as unique storytelling. The runtime of the film is around 90 mins, but for me this was followed by an hour of explanation videos and fan theory reviews. Enemy is such a unique film experience. It really challenges the viewer, as it intentionally doesn't provide a resolved conclusion. Jake Gyllenhaal, as usual is perfect in this film. He really sells the unusual plot of the film. This movie is definitely not for everybody, although those who really love film will appreciate its incredible uniqueness. Enemy is a film which doesn't give you everything on the surface. It requires investigation by the audience in order to develop our own version of the full story. Watching Enemy was such a memorable experience so therefore I give it an 8.",Enemy
179,Steve-Zoicks,What? Enemy? Man in the Mirror?,1,16 November 2018,"It wasn't until I read the reviews of others that this movie made sense. Taking the liberty to read the reviews of others and slowly watch the movie again, I now see it. It was a story similar to the lyrics of the Late Michael Jackson ""Man in the Mirror"". Enemy is true about ones own demons or sub-conscious views that drive our thoughts.There are certain scenes that for me had no relevance to the movie (as the upside room with what appeared to be an alien) however when you connect this with the many thousands of reviews it makes sense. Nonetheless while the idea is well thought out, the application of trying to get it across the screen lacks stability in portraying the inner demon that Jake G character experiences. There is nothing wrong with the acting however unless you have the time to observe all the Easter eggs to make sense of this movie then the movie starts no where, takes you no where and ends with you being asleep and likely not seeing the whole movie.Enemy is a movie where you have to be willing to think and make connections.

180,davidjkobb,Not Smart Enough to Be Called Pretentious,1,18 June 2019,"There are reviews of this movie that boggle my mind, giving it far more credit than it deserves. You can't dangle disjointed, languid nonsense and call it art. It's its too boring to be called farcical, too stupid to be called pretentious, and too apathetic to be called disappointing.The reviews giving this mistake of a movie more credit than it deserves is a prime case of reviewers being too cowardly to say, ""This movie makes no sense and has no redeeming qualities."" They're too scared that they might be missing some artistic merit to say ""This film is meritless."" They're too worried they'll be called out by the pseudo-intellectual crowd as ignorant. No, it's thee pretend auteurs that are ignorant. One such IMDB reviewer mentions ""the ingenious casting to Isabella Rossellini"" as Gyllenhaal's character's mother, but there's nothing ingenious about it. The character Rossellini plays had three minutes of screen time, and five lines. The part could have been player by a mop and had been just as inspired of a casting choice.As for the movie itself, imagine watching paint dry, but every once in a while a spider crawls across the paint and then crawls out of sight, leaving no trace behind it, but infinitely more boring than that scenario.It's like the writer of this film asked a friend at a bar, ""Hey, what if you met your doppelganger?"" and that friend replied, ""I don't know. That'd be weird."" and the writer used that as the entire script of the movie. I haven't read the book the film is based on, and I'm too scared I'll kill myself out of boredom to do so.",Enemy

I did appreciate the slow paced build-up, yet was a bit disappointed at the amount of plot closure the film gave us. French-Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve's use of intense sounds and music with summer blockbuster-like camera shots contrasted greatly with the slow character driven and psychologically oriented story. It seemed as if the director was unsure of what kind of a movie he was making. The screenplay was very simple, yet very complicated, and that is greatly credited to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, or should I say performances? The Toronto skyline setting added a suspenseful and ghost-town atmosphere to the movie, which is peculiar as Toronto is a loud and busy metropolis in reality.

191,blakestachel,Sore Thumbs,9,13 April 2020,"For me, Enemy is about struggling with control. It deals with the universality of an individual struggling with agency and feeling powerless in an oppressive reality. We believe that our lives are authentic to us, a thought that makes us understand our own existence as being unique and separate from everyone else's. But what if one day you met yourself? (Is probably where the concept originated), and how would you react to this? Would you want to get to know yourself or would you feel threatened?The spiders depicted in the film are like sore thumbs that stick out in places they don't belong. Their alien-ness symbolizes the deep-seeding, existential and parasitic feelings that we all feel; that we don't belong or that our differences make us ugly and unlovable; and the idea of having a twin or a clone that looks exactly like us, but is in fact still very different, if not the complete opposite of us, like 2 sides of the same personality (id, superego), would make us feel like we matter even less. It is this fracturing of personality, and the dangers which come from attempting to understand and question ourselves and our consciousness that exacerbate these existential feelings and projects them as something TANGIBLE and similarly ugly in the form of giant, recoiling spiders. We attempt to step on (repress) these feelings, like the escort at the beginning who places her high heel over the initial spider. However, in doing so, these feelings are ignored and only become bigger and more ugly, until they ultimately invade and take over our entire psyche.*If you want to understand this film on a deeper level I would suggest reading some of Jacques Lacan's writing on the psyche",Enemy
192,alain-kapel5,A fantastic experience,9,30 April 2014,"This is a great surreal thriller reminiscent of David Lynch's movie-making style. It's got a simple, yet intriguing premise (based on Saramago's novel The Double) and features Jake Gyllenhaal in a role which just might mark his career as the best since Donnie Darko.Actually, I am a big fan of director Villeneuve whose previous two films (Incendies and Prisoners) impressed the hell outta me. I am also fond of Gyllenhaal and that was enough to make me anticipate this like a small, excited child about to get a new toy. It's evident from the score I gave it that I was not disappointed, to say the least.It's a film that's hard to describe and will probably appeal to only a limited audience of art-house film lovers (or to those who enjoy psychological thrillers and aren't afraid to suspend disbelief when it's required). It delves into themes of sexual repression, obsession and the darkest fears that lurk in our minds. I guess it's like Lynch's dark, dreamlike atmosphere coupled with Kafka's existentialism, with a bit of eroticism to spice things up. The film is frequently tense, captivating and unpredictable, but it's also got its share of bizarre imagery which could easily fit a horror movie. I won't give away any plot points, but be prepared to have your brain challenged (so don't watch this movie if you're not in a mood to think for a bit). The ending is a story of its own and lingers long in your mind, but also makes you want to watch the whole thing again.I guess I've said everything I wanted to say, so if any of this piques your interest, go see Enemy.

193,Oliveraandreasson,"Odd and frustrating, but well acted and very interesting",7,7 January 2020,"This movie is very very frustrating. Both in how it doesn't give me clear answers about anything at all, and in how incredibly hard it is for me to review it. Because, while I'm convinced it is absolutely genius in its writing and direction, it it almost too complicated and abstract for me to really enjoy the reveals and underlying meanings. This leaves me very conflicted after seeing the film, something that will keep it in my head for a long time but not necessarily in a good way.Standout of the movie is of course Jake Gyllenhaal's acting and how he always seems to surprise me with yet another masterful performance. The other really good thing about the film is the mystery that presents and the feeling of satisfaction that comes when you truly understand it. This did, however, take a long time for me to figure and before that, I was nothing but frustrated at the lack of proper answers.Another bad but great element of the film is the odd design choices made regarding its environment and coloration. Every scene, every building, every moment, was all showed through a very yellow and depressing lens. This puts the viewer in a mood that suits the story very well, but at the same time it makes the visuals uninteresting and, dare I say, boring.In conclusion, the movie is best summarized with the sentence ""Bad but great"".

And i stop watching when the wife of the actor meets the teacher alone in his university, and then being sad about it. I mean, me, personally, if a stranger calls me and tells me that we look alike twins, and asks to meet, i'd probably will bring my partner and my friend with me to prove that we're really look alike, instead of being sad and doubtful to my spouse.

198,tankjonah,"Brilliant, tense battle between the Id, Ego and Superego",9,8 November 2015,"A History professor (Jake Gyllenhaal) becomes aware of a bit-part actor who is his exact double. When he decides to contact and meet him, the actor's pregnant wife (Sarah Gadon) becomes suspicious given her husband's philandering past and the professor begins to have second thoughts. An astonishing film by Denis Villeneuve this is brilliantly tense throughout and a genuine mystery that deserves multiple viewings.The acting is impressive (particularly Gadon whose dawning horror that her husband may have a split personality is brilliantly conveyed) and there's enough symbolism and seemingly random scenes that deserve scrutiny.Ultimately, I read the film as, among other things (e.g masculinity's fear of control/domestication), a clash between Gyllenhaal's Id, Ego and Superego that have manifested with the actor representing the Id who is trying to be reigned in by the Ego and, especially, the Superego. The Id represents the selfish, wandering male who can't bear to be tied down to the one woman and the Ego wants the Id to experience his sexual desire to be/see other women in 'socially acceptable' ways; hence the sex/gentleman's club represents a necessarily crucial element where attendance is far more forgivable than cheating on your wife/girlfriend. Then there's the Superego of professor Jake who is trying to guide actor Jake to the morally appropriate action of staying with his wife, avoiding sex clubs and especially avoiding his true desire to stray.Does his girlfriend (played by Melanie Laurent) even actually exist or is she merely a fantasy of actor Jake's desire to escape the web of marriage/domestication? I think she ultimately does exist on some level; his wife has strongly implied that he's cheated on her in the past (perhaps with Laurent). However, when he does take this bait again it ends disastrously, the car crash's shattered windscreen is, not coincidentally, just like a spiderweb as it symbolises his trapped life. His wife, at the end, symbolised by the giant tarantula (ironically, they don't spin webs) epitomises his fear of what marriage and fatherhood will mean, but interestingly the tarantula strongly recoils against him when he walks in as she perhaps fears his inability to remain faithful and not hurt her (emotionally) again. This is a great, or close to great, film. It's an intelligent and cynical look at fidelity and masculinity and to top it off, its creepiness and mood of unease throughout, pushes it into the horror genre.",Enemy
199,spaceman88,Interesting surreal mystery,8,7 July 2014,"I'm not sure how to review ""Enemy"". It's wonderfully directed, with smooth cinematography and moody music, the acting is good but there are several more-or-less surreal elements that made me question the whole plot.While the tone is as serious as it can get, the ending left me stunned, and then laughing as the credits rolled by. This movie is a puzzle and I feel the need to watch it again.My only complaint is the exaggerated color saturation of the film. I have to say I prefer Villenvenue's ""Prisoners"" over this one, but it's not really fair to compare them.Watch it with an open mind, this is certainly no popcorn flick.",Enemy

202,bloodclay,'Enemy' is a fascinating mystery,9,18 April 2014,"There are very few actors that can continue to surprise me in every role they take on, reinventing themselves each time they're on screen, and Jake Gyllenhaal is nearing the top of that list. The name alone may not be something you recognize, but you've probably seen him as the exhilarating lead in ""Source Code"" and several other films like ""End of Watch"" and last year's ""Prisoners"". He's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and almost always provides an impeccable performance that won't let you forget his face. His latest part in the mind- bending mystery 'Enemy' does just the same, and he proves once again how spectacular he can be. This slow burning thriller follows a depressed history professor named Adam (Gyllenhaal) who unexpectedly, while watching a movie, discovers an actor who could be his twin. On a mission to meet this man, he stalks, and eventually finds him. We see their lives quickly become intertwined, even if it may not be in the greatest of ways. Intriguing and ultimately fascinating, this is one of the most interesting and odd movies of the year. It certainly isn't for everyone, with a 'love it or hate it' type of response, but I was totally engaged and couldn't take my eyes off of it. It may not be universally loved, but I found it to be a daring movie that needs to be watched more than once to completely grasp. Rated R for language and sexual content, ""Enemy"" needs to be seen to be believed.",Enemy
203,edgereviews,"An intense, thought provoking thriller...",8,23 April 2014,"It's been over a week since I've seen this movie yet I still don't feel like I'm qualified enough to write this review, because I still haven't managed to wrap my head around exactly what I saw. I haven't read many online theories, and have been trying to decide for myself exactly what this movie is but I can't do it. It's very rare that a movie will manage to confuse me, I usually understand movies that are traditionally considered confusing like 'Inception' and 'Donnie Darko', but with this I still honestly have no idea.The movie is actually straightforward for the most part, it's just the ending that is completely mind-boggling. The story is very engaging and tense, and I never found myself becoming bored. The characters are excellently written and the whole plot is very, very unpredictable. This movie has made me think about it a lot, I can't stop coming back to it because it's such a fascinating piece of cinema. 'Enemy' managed to do another thing that most other movies fail to do as well, and that is scare me. It was the ending again to cause this, because what happens is so sudden, shocking and bizarre that it scared the hell out of me and made me jump out of my skin.The acting in this movie is great as well. Jake Gyllenhaal is phenomenal in the lead two roles, he carries the whole movie and has great screen presence. There are only two other noteworthy performances and they are from Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon, but the real star on show here is Jake Gyllenhaal.I went into 'Enemy' knowing as little about it as possible, and I think that's the best way to do it. I didn't even know the movie was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who directed one of last years best movies, 'Prisoners'. Had I known he was the director I probably would have had different expectations, but I'm glad I didn't see the movie hoping for anything too much because if I had then I doubt I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Villeneuve is a master at building tension, there's a constant sense of impending doom throughout the movie just as there was in 'Prisoners', so he clearly knows how to give a movie a good tone. I will definitely watch 'Enemy' many more times in the future. It's the type of movie where it's to impossible to understand everything on the first watch, and I applaud it for being such an intelligent thriller.",Enemy

205,robbieclaravall,Enemy lurks into the back of your mind and stays there.,8,15 May 2016,"Enemy is a spellbinding psychological mystery. It manages to intrigue since the subject of doppelgangers is enough to spark interest into our minds. It is a surreal experience that poses many questions but never bothers to answer any of them; it makes us sit back and think. This film is gorgeously produced; there seems to be an orange sort of hue throughout the entire duration of the film (and it manages to stay like that even in the credits) and that creates the tone and the atmosphere of the whole mystery. The soundtrack and the crescendo violin pitch forms suspense behind the beautiful cinematography and direction. A lot of the shots truly look great. This film combines elements from Lynch's films and molds it into something new and authentic. There's that magical realism popping up a couple of times and it really makes you question that. Albeit this film is slow and not much happens within the plot, I was still captivated by this journey of finding out your exact identity. This film slowly sneaks up behind you and allures you with its beautiful shots, exceptional characters and an intriguing air of mystery; it keeps your eyes glued on the screen and it doesn't let go. This is a quiet film with occasional outbreaks; I wouldn't call this a thriller even with some suspenseful scenes sprinkled throughout. The length of this film is blissfully short so it doesn't manage to bore the viewer; instead it really makes us think as the credits roll by. This film is not to be taken lightly and must really have deep and serious thinking in order to comprehend what's truly going on just underneath the surface.",Enemy
206,mrstrangerjones,A Mind-Bending Thriller That Still Stays With Me,9,13 April 2018,"I was absolutely blown away by Villeneuve's previous film, ""Prisoners"", but this movie is what cements him as one of the greats. However, there will be people that will disagree with this, considering its complexity and strong ambiguity. In all honesty, I had no idea what was going throughout the entirety of me watching this film. I was completely confused, all though I was able to put some pieces together. To understand a gist (and this is just a theory), I watched Chris Stuckmann's analysis, and it made a lot of sense. The things that I can really praise are the visuals and the dual performance from Jake Gyllenhaal (who was in ""Prisoners""). This is an extremely good looking film, but visuals don't make a movie, and neither does acting. The thing that cemented the quality of this movie was its use of symbolism (SPIDERS, SPIDERS, EVERYWHERE). Like I said, this is a very confusing movie, and it will take a while for you to be able to wrap your head around it. Unless you're smart. Or not me.""Enemy"" is a fantastic film that cemented Villeneuve's astounding directing talent, and I'm very excited to watch ""Blade Runner 2049"" and the upcoming ""Dune"".",Enemy
207,connorwburnett,A real mind explosion,9,17 August 2021,"After lots of thinking, I've decided not to include spoilers in this review. For me, the most entertaining aspect of Enemy was making my own interpretations, and I think it would be unfair to strip this ability from anyone else through the reading of my ideas. Enemy truly is a film best watched with an open mind and should be treated more as a piece of art rather than a film.The plot of enemy revolves around Jake Gyllenhaal's character working as a history teacher. He spots an exact look-alike of himself in a movie and then attempts to find him in reality.The visuals of Enemy are by far it's most appreciated aspect. The lighting, colouration, cinematography and setting all work in harmony to reflect the themes on screen and the internal struggles of the main protagonist. There is so much to analyse when it comes to visuals, I had a lot of fun trying to understand the meaning of the film as I watched.In terms of the main protagonist, Jake Gyllenhaal is honestly starting to become one of my favourite actors. He seems to always deliver a stellar performance and this is not absent in Enemy. His performance was doubled in a literal sense due to the fact of him having to play two characters in the film conversing in the same scene multiple times, making his acting even more commendable.Another terrific aspect of Enemy is the editing. Many films these days seem to forget about editing as a way to convey meaning, usually resulting in static shot reverse shot. However, Enemy's mixture of fluid editing and knowing when and when not to cut, paired with it's cinematography, propels the meaning you can derive from the film even further.So what are the negatives? Through my solo watch of the film I didn't pick up on anything too noticeable. I think that the most common complaint people will have for enemy is that they find it too slow paced or repetitive and I can see where they're coming from. However whenever I thought the pacing was turned down a little bit too low it just gave me more room to make my own interpretations of the film.Obviously this isn't a film for everyone, I'm sure many people will find it disturbing however this doesn't change the fact that I highly recommend everyone to watch Enemy. It's very under appreciated and not enough people know about so give it a watch if you have the time.",Enemy

210,JoshuaHarryMurphy,An Intense Exploration into Control and Spiders,8,1 August 2014,"Enemy is a Canadian psychological thriller film directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners). The film was loosely adapted by screenwriter Javier Gullón from José Saramago's 2002 novel The Double. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal playing a college history professor Adam who seeks out his doppelgänger (also played by Gyllenhaal) after spotting him in a movie recommended by a work colleague. Mélanie Laurent, Isabella Rossellini, Sarah Gadon, Stephen R. Hart and Jane Moffat also appear in the film. Enemy has already earned five Canadian Screen Awards; Best Director for Denis Villeneuve, as well as a Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Picture. Undoubtedly these decorations will continue, as Villeneuve has managed to craft an intense, rich and memorable film littered with profound symbolism. Despite the maintained enigmatic tone of the film, Villeneuve's assured and unrestricted approach to the script means that the experience of watching the film is rewarding rather than frustrating. Whilst numerous interpretations of the film have been suggested, the complexity of the narrative itself means that readings of the film are ultimately subjective. However; what is clear is that Villeneuve attempts to explore conflict on both a physical and subconscious level. The sequences which depict the two identical 'Adam's' together are extraordinarily tense, but just as engaging are the sequences which depict Adam alone or with his wife, as the true intricacy and dysfunction of his psyche become evident. The premise of the film naturally cries of for a strong lead performance which, not for the first time in a Villeneuve film, Gyllenhaal provides. Entirely engrossing and interesting, Gyllenhaal manages to seamlessly integrate confusion, panic and horror into a performance of a character who is fully aware of what it means to have control. Furthermore, his performance of Adam's 'twin' is distinctive enough to clearly establish the two characters differences despite their identical appearance. Enemy is a marvellous film, constructed with smart direction and excellent performances. The multifaceted themes which run throughout the narrative are challenging enough that any re-watch will be just as satisfying and engrossing as upon first viewing.",Enemy
211,ggmcheartagram,Bizarre But Very Interesting Movie,7,21 September 2015,"I'll start off by saying that when this film ended, i turned to my husband and said, ""Eh? I don't get it!"" and he replied ""I don't have a clue either"". Now this would usually result in me getting annoyed and hate on a movie but i can't, because i still actually enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to go searching on the internet for answers and when i found a very helpful analysis, i appreciated the movie more than i initially did. The acting was brilliant and i thought the film's styling and the music worked very well (The music had a Hitchcockian vibe to it, i felt, and it worked very well). I had just watched Prisoners, which i absolutely loved and watched this because it was the same director. If i hadn't known it was the same director then i wouldn't have been able to tell because both films are so different in style. Enemy is pretty raunchy and has quite a lot of nudity this isn't a bad thing, i just wasn't expecting it to be like that. Also be warned if you are terrified of spiders and really want to see this movie then prepare yourself before hand to be freaked out. I'm definitely going to give this movie another go in the future and i'm also going to have a read of the book. I am desperate to make sense of this movie.",Enemy

A couple words are exchanged here and there between characters but the dialogue is so dull and one-note and the lines reveal so little about the people speaking they might as well be conversing in grunts for all the difference it would make.Are any of the ""plot points"" that are brought up ever resolved?

213,anteksw,Alluring & Distinctive Character Study,10,21 March 2015,"I remember a while back being extremely intrigued by this film during the release of the trailer, and also by the fact that one of my favourite actors (the flawless Jake Gyllenhaal) stars in it. It looked like a stylishly enticing thriller flick, it seemed as if it would pay homage to the classics while simultaneously bringing something new to the table... and it most definitely brought something new to the table. Having recently re-watched 'Enemy' for the fourth time not only strengthened the praise I gave the film upon the first viewing... but also underpinned the certainty that this film completely deserves a spot in the list of my favourite films of all time. Yes, I would go as far as to call this film a masterpiece.I realised it would be hard to write a decent review for this film without giving any spoilers... therefore, the best way I can decipher 'Enemy' here is to say that it creates a world of its own. The way this film looks, sounds and ""feels"" is just truly captivating; the consistent dark yellow-ish colour palette, the disturbingly alluring soundtrack and the truly phenomenal performances from Gyllenhaal, Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon combine perfectly to create this immaculately distinctive character study. I must however stress the ""immaculate"" construction of this film, the screenplay for 'Enemy' is evidently expertly written... and thus the film requires an incredibly attentive approach (or alternatively a second viewing) when it comes to overall dialogue and imagery - as both provide cleverly hidden meanings throughout.To conclude, 'Enemy' is a masterpiece that showcases more than you'd think, in all terms. On top of that, the film spawned arguably one of the best performances by Jake Gyllenhaal up to date... this actor is continuously impressing me and 'Enemy' is undoubtedly another great achievement in his filmography. Speaking of great achievements, the director, Denis Villeneuve, has previously impressed me with 'Prisoners' - which means I will definitely be checking out more of his work whilst staying observant of any upcoming projects. I'm giving 'Enemy' a perfect 10 out of 10, it is a bravely distinctive and compelling character study that'll entrap you in its own world from start to finish.",Enemy
214,scenematica,be ready for the puzzle,8,27 September 2019,"Watching movies is like arranging puzzles. That's the experience you will feel when watching Enemy (2013) by Denis Villeneuve. Actually the narrative used in this film will look simple when you've managed to arrange the puzzle in the order, because the duration of the film is only 91 minutes. For the plot itself, walk slowly and thrillingly. The plot of Enemy runs linearly, but viewers will often be fooled by flashback scenes that are suddenly and unnoticed.Another intelligence of Enemy is the use of allegories and metaphors everywhere. Starting from the spider, twin characters seemed to look doppelganger, and the damaged city order.Enemy doesn't seem like a movie that can be enjoyed immediately.

And perhaps it might be necessary to explain 'pleasant' here: the word does not necessarily mean that one is comforted, has fun in the usual meaning. Film-wise it means, at its best, to be challenged. Challenged, here, meant to be glued to the screen. It's a little difficult to write a review on it. I've read through some of the others and saw that almost all reviewers had problems. Some were trying to solve the riddle (the more confidence displayed, the less successful they were). Perhaps it's best to paraphrase what one of the reviewers wrote: try and go through this film as if through a dream, through reality enhanced. Enhanced reality feels very much like the opposite, and this is the feel of the film. From the choice of colours to acting to ambivalence about identity, the result is as hypnotic as it's unsettling. The very simple story is told very plainly, but underlying is the intricacy of a nightmare. The discomfort feels like a single, stretched emotion. Something about this film works wonderfully, and as with the best of literature that narrates between the lines I wasn't always able to tell why (that went the same way for me with the spider-theme: it worked before I understood). The music is an inseparable part of the film. The film wouldn't have been the same with another soundtrack, a large part of what works in it isn't merely carried by it, but co-created. Pleasant also, albeit in a more common sense, to be finally able after quite some time to give a best vote for an achieved fusion of everything that makes a film for the viewer, unsettling, challenging and deeply rewarding. 10 out of 10 Theraphosae.",Enemy

220,TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready,A Qualified 8-Star 'Art House' Quasi-Noir Metaphor,8,25 February 2018,"Okay, so the pretentious psuedo-intellectual sounding review headline notwithstanding, I offer a qualified recommendation for ""Enemy"". I won't go on at length. This was a slow-to-develop film with great attention paid to mundane details and a well crafted atmosphere of isolation, suspense and puzzlement - each of which is characteristic of Villenueve's various films. Cinematography and acting were great, and Gyllenhaal does a very passable job of playing two characters that interact with one another on several occasions. The ending will seem as though it's out of left field - and to some it may even be ridiculous or maddening - but taken with the whole, it provides for a thought provoking metaphor or allegory on aspects of modern life in a Western country. As is probably deducible from the 6.9 aggregate IMDB score, this film is slightly polarizing - and I would guess even more so to American audiences who were not expecting an atmospheric art house movie without any loud, flashy effects or a huge cast. It burns slow and steady and, against my own preconceptions, tells a very convincing story.Temper or limit your expectations going in - and don't read any spoilers or detailed reviews - and you'll be pleasantly surprised once you take some time to think about it.",Enemy

222,tetraslash,A symbolic movie which is a total hit-or-miss for viewers,5,29 November 2014,"Summary: This movie is based on symbolism. If you are poor with figuring out symbolism, do NOT watch this movie. It will only bore you from start to finish, no matter how much you hope you will find something to justify watching it. You have been warned.The rest of the review: I'll start by saying that this movie shouldn't really have a rating, as it's contingent on whether you understand the symbolism in the movie.Being heavily rooted in symbolism, if you are poor with that field of analysis, you won't enjoy the movie at all. It's a total hit-or-miss; if you can understand the symbolism within the first 30 minutes of the movie, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise.Otherwise, if by that time you still have no idea what is happening and just find it highly confusing, I suggest you stop watching and move on. This movie clearly isn't for you. If you make it to the end, you'll just end up wondering, ""Why did I waste 90 minutes watching this?""Unlike other movies based on symbolism, this movie doesn't go the extra mile to provide you with easy-to-grasp clues. The symbolism is there in plain sight, but the explanations for them are not. You either catch on really early, or you don't catch on at all, which will hinder the movie's enjoyability.From the threads I've read on IMDb thus far, most people had to resort to watching an explanation on YouTube just to understand what the movie was about. That should give you an idea of the degree of symbolism in this movie. And that explanation video is 25 minutes long by itself.When I personally watched the movie, I was unable to discern the symbolism within. I was bored all the way until the end, and I could not watch it in one sitting. I ultimately understood the gist of it, after reading some spoilers about what the symbolism meant.There are better ways to provide symbolism AND enjoyment in a movie, but this movie focuses solely on symbolism. It doesn't try in any fashion to keep your attention, nor is it even remotely interesting. It's meant to be depicted and analyzed, like a school research project.Anyway, long story short, I didn't really enjoy the movie, but if you don't mind trying it out, then I hope you understand it early on. If not, then as I mentioned, consider dropping it and move on. You won't miss out on this movie by not watching it.P.S. You do get to see both female actors topless.

224,OBXconsumer,Enemy - my reaction,8,11 October 2015,"I gave it an 8 just for the acting.I am writing this from my perspective - being a woman. Whereas it is sufficiently creepy, disturbing, and interesting, I didn't really like the movie. I could figure it out for myself as far as the message and what was going through the mindset of ADAM/ANTHONY, but just have to say I left this movie really NOT liking these guys. I say these guys - either one - it is really hard not to spoil this movie with any discussion whatsoever otherwise. The fact that men get off on watching women squish large spiders - well, it just creeped me out. Spiders are gross and most women don't like to be around them or be compared to them. The attempt to make the ""Sex club"" appealing in any way totally escaped me. The fact that he/they saw women as bloodsucking arachnids, who are hideous in spirit, tells me that he/they were mentally ill, selfish, lazy, unkempt/narcissistic men. If I have to choose between the two, Adam is the nicest but he is a slob, boring, and a lousy lover. Whereas Anthony was a better lover, he was just a prick. He/they did not deserve either of these beautiful women. If he was my teacher, I would want my money back. If he was my husband, I would get a divorce. Don't try to explain - I GET IT - I GOT IT - blah, blah, blah - dream state or subconscious - the point was made - just not something I wanted to cozy up to on a Saturday night because of the steal - using something that is already severely off-putting to creep someone out. Jake Gyllenhaal is really good at playing creeps - he needs to find another role because I am starting to shy away from his movies. I did enjoy the movie Prisoner, but I did not enjoy his creepy character in Nightcrawler - yes - though he does a great acting job and I guess that is the point in the end. Was it scary? Yes Was it creepy? Yes Was it sufficiently a psychological thriller? Yes but no closure.",Enemy
225,hugorocksmy,That Ending..!,8,28 May 2014,"This is one of the strangest and more head-scratching movies I've seen, mostly because of the ending. This said, it's one of the most disturbing and shocking endings I've seen in a movie, but somehow made the movie better. Because even though I agree with the review from the Hollywood Reporter, that the movie set itself to failure, I think that was because of the route it was taking and by being frustrating and without any direction or explanation. But thankfully, in the last scenes it managed to capture my attention more than ever and simply twist the whole story in many different ways that it wasn't enable to to do in the whole first 3/4 of the movie. Also, the acting was really good, I did really believe in Jake Gyllenhaal performances as both or should I say one, I really don't know, but also Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon were great. That being said, at first I wasn't sure if I was liking the movie because of how the story was unfolding, but because of the last 10 minutes or so, it changed my perspective and it intrigued me more than ever. Therefore, as a result of the ending, because I know that it's one I will always have on my mind, this movie was extremely mind-bending and a very complex one.",Enemy

Having read all those enthused reviews with all those desperate attempts to analyze the plot, I am astonished about all that helplessness concerning the meaning of the narrative.
The film was tediously stretched out with endless pauses,had no real structure, lacked dramatic development (at least in those 70 minutes I watched it) end even the great Gyllenhaal couldn't save it.

230,dangent280,You Only Live Twice...,8,2 January 2015,"A film starring Jake Gyllenhaal always seems to attract me, and it always will do, due to the knowledge that Gyllenhaal portrayed one of my favourite characters in one of my all-time favourite films. That film was Donnie Darko, a film so unlike anything i had seen before in my lifetime when it was released, a film that had endless meaning, a film which featured an awesome soundtrack, capped off with a perfect performance by Gyllenhaal as the titular character. Now we have Enemy, the second film from the Gyllenhaal/Villeneuve partnership, filmed instantly after the completion of their first effort, Prisoners, in 2013, and boy, is it a weird one. In terms of the plot, Gyllenhaal plays history teacher, Adam Bell, a man whose life seems to be going nowhere and is stuck on repeat, whilst his relationship with Melanie Laurent's character, Mary, follows suit, and is seemingly only held together by the physical aspect it brings with it. During one evening, Bell watches a film recommended to him by another teacher, named, Where There's a Will There's a Way, and sees someone physically identical to him starring in the film. That's where i will end the plot synopsis, as what follows is a film laced with mystery, suspense and downright creepiness, in a vein which reminded me of works by David Lynch, particularly Mulholland Dr., bubble-wrapped with notions of identity, totalitarianism and arachnophobia, particularly for me. Features of the film include top-notch performances, particularly from Gyllenhaal, who practically has to play two completely different roles, a heavy sense of surrealism, accompanied by an almost grunge-esque feel to the film, and an ending which freaked me out so much, i had to lie down and digest slowly what had occurred before my eyes. On the bad side, the film obviously won't appeal to a mass audience, with its' ambiguous tone throughout leaving a range of questions unanswered, whilst the dark colours of the film sometimes required me to peer nose-first into my screen in order to figure out what was happening and bring clarity to the situation. Overall, Enemy is dark, bizarre, and features an ending that will shock almost everyone. Honestly, i'm still shaking. I believe it is a better film than Prisoners and will take some beating to not be in my Films of the Year List for 2015. Please feel free to comment on your feelings, ideas, and meaning of the film and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did and remember, ""chaos is order yet undeciphered."" Overall Score: 9/10",Enemy

It's not supposed to be an action packed flick.The idea is very different than most. Makes you think. Very Artistic. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the more underrated actors of his generation. His performance is great.The story line may leave something to be diaries, but it's worth the watch.

Well that won't become any clearer while you watch. This is the most confusing, addled, muddled screenplay in recent memory.I think that Jake is unhappy and he imagines spider imagery to represent his feelings. Or something. Who cares?

You kinda understand what's going on in the movie and unless you really don't pay attention you'll get most of the plot but since it's a really psycological plot you'll miss some key elements that will overall ruin your viewing experience.

235,llsee,Arachnophobia for the Pseudo-Intellectual,2,4 August 2014,"What was this movie about? I don't know, but plenty of reviewers here seem to think they know, and they all have different interpretations. Clearly this movie appeals to those who think they are smarter than the average movie watcher. While I enjoy a movie that makes the viewer think, or leaves an unresolved ending, I never claimed to be above average.So many reviews refer to the many dark ""plot twists"". Sorry, but a plot twist is when an action or character turns the direction of the plot in an unexpected way. A plot twist is not a thread that is left dangling abruptly, never to be resolved or even referred to again. Nor is it when characters act in completely incomprehensible ways that defy common sense. But yes, this movie is dark, so dark that even on a big screen 1080P television or monitor, the action is often difficult to discern.So, if you think you are smarter than the average movie watcher, and you like to find the hidden meaning in the most ridiculous situations, then this movie is for you.

236,souplipton,A Surreal Puzzle Film in the Mode of David Lynch,8,6 January 2016,"Denis Villeneuve's Enemy is a surreal thriller that shares more DNA with some David Lynch productions than with other films in Villeneuve's canon.I'm going to keep this review short, as I don't wish to give anything away about the film. No specific spoilers are included within the review, but I'm checking the spoilers box just to play this one safe.Mixing noirish elements with surrealism, Enemy is a story of a man's splintered identity as told from the viewpoint of his subconsciousness. The world that we are shown is not the truth as it exists, but filtered through the lens of our main character's mind, and the surreal elements are his inner views on what he sees. In this way, it reminded me of three of my favourite works of film surrealism; Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr, and Inland Empire. I view these films as constituting a trilogy on the volatile nature of identity, and this film fits in the same vein as those films. This film, like those ones, left me hungry for an answer to what I'd seen, and, also like those films, Enemy was incredible fun to watch. Even before I had my own interpretation of what I'd seen, I truly enjoyed the experience of watching it, and the search for meaning is extremely fun as well.As for the technical aspects of the film, they are superb, something very much in line with Villeneuve's canon. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent in both roles, and the contrast between them makes the two performances even more impressive. The supporting roles are all played very well, particularly Sarah Gadon as the wife. The colour scheme emphasizes yellows, giving the world a unwell, sickly appearance, perhaps indicative of the protagonists unhealthy mental state. The score creates an aura of tension whenever it appears, a feeling also brought out in the camera-work and editing. The special effects work in the film is also worth noting, as they blend nicely with the filmed elements, creating frightening images that seem as though part of the world's reality.For those who enjoy films of that nature and who enjoy trying to decipher the meaning behind the mystery, this film is a must see. For those who find these films confusing and irritating, I would steer clear. I belong to the former group, and thus truly enjoyed it.",Enemy
237,icanbeaghost,Simply an Amazing Piece of Art,10,16 June 2018,"The best films are the ones that haunt you, that make you scratch your head in oblivious confusion and leave you reaching for even a minuscule inkling of an answer. Enemy is one of those films. Describing it is a daunting task, as it's in a class of its own. You need to have an appreciation for this sort of artistry in order to enjoy it. And by ""this sort of artistry"" I mean that it is psychologically complex, self manipulative and borderline demented. Our main character is struggling with a sense of disillusioned longing and once he starts to nurture it, (and his environment begins to reflect the true nature of it), he can no longer be sure of who he even is. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his finest performances and the supporting cast is stunning. The film achieves it all: a perfectly written script, convincing acting, gorgeous, (albeit creepy), cinematography and a good old fashioned element of suspenseful anticipation that will keep your eyes glued to the screen and your butt glued to the chair. Take my word for it. Watch Enemy with an open mind and savor its seductive facade. Then revisit it once you've reflected on its intended meaning, which you no doubt will do. Upon subsequent viewings it will engage you all over again in a different way and you will appreciate its initial purposeful misdirection. It is one of my all time favorites and has been since the first time I was graced by its presence. Whenever I feel like getting weird, Enemy is my starting point. A must see for Gyllenhaal fans and a true experience for those who are into the macabre.",Enemy
238,Foxbot,"Wow! Deep, thought provoking and multiple interpretations",8,24 June 2014,"I blind bought this because I liked Prisoners and the trailer very much appealed to my style of film. It is a very deep and thought provoking film. There is a lot to take in, much to view and even times to pause and think about what is happening. In the end, I let the credits roll and just sat and thought. Then I understood what the film was all about. Very cool style and brilliantly filmed and acted by all involved.The PQ is decent, but a little inconsistent at times. There are some extremely sharp shots, however some of the darker scenes seem cloudy or not as dark as they should be. There were a lot of filtered shots, hazing and other film techniques used, so much of that could have been intentional. The audio is decent, however even when blasting there were a few lines which seemed muffled or too low. Again, maybe intentional.The extras are short and simple, which I am fine with for a movie like this. There is simply a behind the scenes documentary.This movie is very odd and probably not like anything you've seen before. again, it can be taken many ways. Some may not be able to get through half of it because it's just too weird, however I loved it an couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I feel this movie is geared more toward men, and I can relate to both Jake Gyllenhaal characters. Women, which have been with men who have been in these situation may also be able to relate. There are two strong female characters in this as well as a wonderful performance by Isabella Rossellini as the mother.Rated R for nudity/sex and some language.As usual, NEVER watch the behind the scenes or making of before the movie, only after!!!

The first I read was Saramago's because there was a film ready to be watched.The book is awesome, but the film ruins it.I understand Villeneuve wanted to give his interpretation of the novel, but there are too many differences, some of them also change the meaning of the book.I can overlook some details (e.g. how Adam - the teacher - discovers the actual name of the actor - in the book he has to do a huge job of research, watching several films, to deduce his name; then he phones to the production to get his address and he writes a letter to the actor, signing it with his girlfriend's name) which aren't much essential, but some things should have been more similar. Adam's girlfriend in the book is definitely nagging, she wants to marry him, but he is insecure because he has a failed marriage behind him.The ending is substantially the same, even though in the novel the teacher and the actor's wife learn about the car accident where their respective partners die and they decide to live together, pretending the teacher is the actor (because everyone thinks that the bodies in the car are the teacher and his girlfriend).Obviously in the novel there are no spiders.Technically the film is okay.

249,reelscreenreviews,A Strong Film Visually but Confusing None the Less,7,22 September 2013,"*********This May Contain Spoilers******** ""The Enemy"" debuted at TIFF 2013 and stars the on screen talents of Jake Gyllenhaal, Melanie Laurent, Sarah Gadon, & Isabella Rossellini. This film comes to us from director Denis Villeneuve. He is the director of ""The Prisoner"" which also debuted in Toronto and also stars Gyllenhaal, and the well-regarded ""Incendies"" from a few years back.This tale tells of two separate individuals that have absolutely nothing to do with each other, which is until one of them discovers that they look and sound exactly alike. One of these guys is an actor & one is a professor, and one night while watching a DVD the professor realizes that he has a doppelganger. The face and the voice of the two gentlemen are a spot on match for one another, and after they come together and become acquainted with each other the movie gets a little bit weird. They begin an almost covert agreement that will place each other in the opposite's life, and will this add to an existence of intrigue or will it compound an already complex storyline.I actually find myself split on this one, but the more that I think about this one the more I guess that I enjoyed it. I do have many things to complement when it comes to this movie, but unfortunately whenever a filmmaker sets out to make a confusing or interpretive film they usually succeed in doing so.Well people I will begin with the positives and I must start with double lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal who does a fantastic job in this dual role. He has the quirks and mannerisms down to a science, and he brings these characteristics to life in two different people. One is a very unkempt looking and unconfident college professor, and the other is a cock-sure actor that always knows what he is doing. Gyllenhaal shines on screen because you can tell which guy it is just by looking at him, and I mean down to the posture. He very much reminded me of Michael Keaton from the over-looked gem ""Multiplicity"", because there as well Keaton had the personalities down rock solid.I also need complement Melanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon who are the girlfriend/wife of the duo, and each is a real person in this small cast. Each one of these women is 10 times smarter than most love interests in film today, and it was cool to see such solid work from such a small group of actors. Watching ""The Enemy"" the interior shots felt like I was viewing a live stage or theater production, and that is until we get to see the beautiful city of Toronto as the backdrop for ""The Enemy"". Credit director of photography Nicholas Bolduc for brilliantly capturing this Canadian Metropolis, and after walking around this city for a week and half let me tell yahe did in fact represent the city of Toronto brilliantly. He added an orange tint or a sepia tone to the wide exterior shots, and it gave the city almost a warmer feel. Ironically it was 95 degrees in the city on the day that I saw this film, and not only did it look like the hottest day of the year on screen but it actually was the hottest day of the year outside as well.The filmmaker Denis Villeneuve definitely has a talent behind the camera, and he very much gets the best out of his actors. It's just that he so very much reminds me of the 2 eccentric directors David Cronenberg & David Lynch. This film has ""Naked Lunch"" & ""Dead Ringers"" written all over itand you can without question see many tributes to David Lynch every now and again.This takes me to the film's one drawback, and that is that I really didn't know exactly what was going on probably for more than half the movie. There are things that happen at the beginning of this film and you're like ""Alright"", but then it is never fully explained. This plot point that I'm talking about is revisited in the middle of the film and there is something in the film's finale about it, but I have no idea why it is there or what it even means? Then I don't believe that these 2 lead personalities are twins because they cover that in the story with one of guy's mothers, but in my opinion they still leave that open to some sort of interpretation. There are many spots in this film that feel like the end of ""Lost in Translation"", where you're not supposed to know specifically what it is, but it leaves itself open to analysis.At 90 minutes some will also complain about the ""The Enemy's"" abrupt ending, but that is another reason that I enjoyed it, because it was abrupt. This film was short, sweet, and to the point, and you could have watched it 2 times in a row back-to-back and it still would've been 15 minutes shorter than ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby"". I listened to the filmmaker explain that basically there is no explanation, which means I can't wait for someone's YouTube video about ""The Real Clarification of 'The Enemy'"" or ""'The Enemy' Explained"". This is one of those movies that if you caught it on the right night, and were under the influence of the correct substances, well you're probably going to enjoy this one. However I know for sure that the non-certainties of the film will turn off quite a few. I am still very torn between 2 ½ stars and 3 stars out of 4, but I am going to go with the artistic value of the film and up it to 3 stars out of 4. That solid recommendation is for the muddled but still technically smooth drama ""The Enemy"".",Enemy
250,Chrismeister,A Disturbing Look Inside the Subconsciousness,8,8 October 2014,"Before I write anything about this masterpiece, I have to tell you this. Don't read anything about the film, watch it blind. It is the only way to truly appreciate the narrative. Denis Villeneuve is an incredibly versatile director. His other 2013 film, Prisoners was fantastic at delving deep into the fine line between good and bad. Enemy, well this delves into the mind of a man who is struggling with commitment and women in general. There is much going on under the surface of this film, it demands multiple viewings. It will leave you with many questions. Were Anthony and Adam related or just doppelgangers? Why did everyone get so emotional over this strange situation? And what was with the spiders? Well I cannot hope to be an authority on what all the true meanings are behind this film, you will have to seek the answers for yourself. Yet in terms of surface value this film is excellently presented. Jake Gyllenhaal gives outstanding performances as Adam and Anthony. Particularly as Adam, the crumbling, paranoid, and enclosed history lecturer, this could be his finest work yet. The cinematography was also just as engaging. Brown hues engulf every shot, combined with an incredibly airy score creates disturbing, tension filled scenes that were unforgettable. Enemy is not a horror film, but it most definitely has the tone of one. This combined with one of the most shocking and unnerving conclusions to a film I have ever seen, makes it just as unsettling as any horror. Enemy proves that cinematic storytelling can be just as compelling as ever. Enter the subconsciousness and face your inner demons. The only enemy you face, is yourself.",Enemy

Wife goes to see the guy - epic drama, and cutting scenes like it was the end of the world. with crying and agony, when in real life it would just be ""you know you look so similar to my husband""Crap movie, -5 that's my score.Do not waste your time watching this",Enemy
252,tarantino_feet_pics,Thoughts on Enemy,7,21 April 2020,"Enemy is a very good psychological thriller. Jake Gyllenhaal plays two great
subtle characters. The muted colour palette and eerie score give a great atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve purposely leaves it vague and open ended. It's very strange had hard to decipher. I found it to be a lot more enjoyable upon trying to uncover its meaning and narrative. Upon a passive viewing and likely a first viewing Enemy is hard to understand and seems a bit nonsensical or chaotic. But as the opening card says 'chaos is order yet undeciphered.' So let me try:Anthony and Adam are the same person, just two different personalities of the same person suffering from multiple personally disorder. There are several clues the allude to MPD instead of simply just a doppelganger. Firstly, apart from both men looking exactly the same they also share the same voice and even have the same scar on their chest. Although not directly shown it's apparent from Adam's reaction that they both share the scar. Secondly is the blueberries. Adam supposedly hates blueberries while Anthony enjoys them. And while in a scene with Adam's mother she insists that he does enjoy blueberries, further blurring the lines between the two. Lastly Adam and Anthony have the exact same photo with Helen. Adam's copy of the photo has Helen's half ripped off.Adam and Helen seem to be the original couple. He has a fear of commitment maybe brought on or at least amplified by Helen's pregnancy. Adam protests against the restrictions his relationship puts on him. In response he's created this other personality trying escape his commitment. Anthony is living out the life that Adam is not. Anthony is domineering, drives a motorcycle, is pursuing Adam's ambitions to have an acting career and is living life with another women.The spider I believe is a visual representation of fear. Adam has an intense fear of commitment. One of the most common fears is Arachnophobia, the fear of spiders. The spider is meant to personify fear and specifically Adam's fear of commitment. It's also interesting to note that in the sex club that Jake Gyllenhaal attends a spider is showcased. This spider however is stepped on, symbolizing his apathy for commitment.The two personalities play out a war for dominance. Anthony is subsequently killed when Helen shows affection toward Adam and tell him ""I want you to stay."" The Anthony part of Adam's psyche dies in the car wreck.We are lead to believe that Adam has had some sort of resolution but Hegel's words ring true as Adam unveils a key to the sex club and says ""I think I have to go out.""""All the worlds greatest events happen twice. The first time as tragedy, the second as farce.""

Most importantly, we are given no reason to get emotionally invested in the characters. They slog through scenes in a dull, unbelievable manner, against a depressing sepia-style color scheme.

257,Taylor_Gillen,Yet Another Doppelgänger Film with Unanswered Questions,6,28 December 2015,"The concept of the Doppelgänger is nothing new, and yet it is still so interesting. If you found out that one exists (and you knew you weren't related), what would you do? I think any curious person would find that person and figure out what's going on, and that's what happens in ""Enemy"". However, like many other art-house film, convoluted plots yield few answers, and the ending leaves you tongue-tied and a bittersweet taste.A note to readers: there is no problem with a movie that makes you think. In fact, we need more of those. We need movies that encourage you to open a conversation with people after the credits roll. We need movies that make you think twice about what you saw, and thereby give you a greater understanding of human life. The sad thing is that ""Enemy"" doesn't give you a greater understanding about anything; really, it just exists to make you wonder what the heck is going on. Perhaps that is supposed to extend to its message, stating that life is confusing and doesn't yield answers. But who wants to watch a movie like that?Here's the plot: a man named Adam is bored with his life, and he finds out that there is someone that looks exactly like him in a movie. He tracks him down, they meet, and they try to figure out their connection.Here's why it doesn't work: They spend little time exploring the fact that a doppelgänger exists and what that could mean. Instead, they spend most of the time fleeing (or stalking) each other -- they take turns -- and thereby spins the plot into a spiraling circle of boredom. It's like the filmmakers are trying to turn this movie into a ""game of cat-and-mouse"" without giving viewers the satisfaction of making it comprehensible. There was a question I kept asking myself: if they're so immersed in each other's existence, why do they keep fleeing each other and then hurting each other?There were few questions answered by the end. For a movie that is supposed to be about a possible twin, there is too much time spent on other things. And the characters don't really change throughout. Instead, they just become less relatable.Here's what works: the idea is pretty cool, and the first thirty minutes kept my interest. The set-up was good, even if the execution of the second and third acts were disappointing. The performances were fine, and there was a good soundtrack.If you like experimental films (with a big budget) that leave you with unanswered questions, you'll like this movie. If you are someone that needs something more, don't bother.",Enemy

It could mean anything from Deception and second chances, a Man leading a double life, to a mad man that killed his wife in a car accident and is in denial...I kept waiting for some clever writing. The acting was great!!! Excellent talent gone to waste on this one though. The only reason I watched it was because of the movie Prisoner. I was hoping for some more of the same fantastic writing and plot twist.I got the feeling the main character lived alone from the start. Most of the talking between the character and his wife/girlfriend seemed more like he was talking to himself. Yet the writer gave off the impression some sinister plot or mind boggling event was about to take place. It never transpires. So one felt cheated at the end, and the funky 70's type credit format was a fail.The spider was lame and like I said it could mean so many different things and was a terrible ending to an already boring movie that had about 30 minutes of good writing but the rest, well, it is a just a tangled web to deceive...He was his own worst enemy...Pretty simple in the end yet could have been a fantastic movie.",Enemy

It's not stupid, it's strange and if you haven't got any information about what you are getting into, it is unexpected. Other than my obvious happiness about my own revelations, i have to mention some downsides the movie has.

I was really disappointed with this pointless movie.""Mysterious"" is something else than ""unclear"". I am very open to movies that inspire my imagination, but not when the result is a big question mark. Well, the latter was the case. The movie is also not ""thrilling"" in any sense, it was actually quite boring. I have nothing against slow movies, they can be very good and build up suspense on a deep level, but i could not feel any suspense in this movie, neither on the surface, nor below it. I also do not see the ""artfull"" qualities of this movie. Art is about shaping a certain content in a creative way, but i could not find any coherent content in this movie. The story line is very shallow and nothing is really happening. The symbolism with the spiders also did not fit into the movie in any way, besides from the fact that it is totally unclear to me what is meant by it.I like Jake Gyllenhaal as an actor, but the roles he played here are so superficial that his qualities did not come out.I recently watched ""Prisoners"", also directed by Denis Villeneuve and featuring Jake Gyllenhaal, and i really liked it, so i am surprised about the poor quality of ""Enemy"".

266,bxuser,Read a synopsis before you see it,7,29 February 2020,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays as Adam Bell, a mild mannered college professor who suffers from split personality disorder. The film is an exploration of moments in his life without telling the audience about his mental illness. It centers in the impact of his illness on his wife Mary (Melanie Laurent), and Adam's inability to identify and resolve his own demons. Great acting and cinematography allowed me to enjoy this film without even understanding what was happening.Full of symbolism, I would classify this primarily as an art film, which has some difficulty transitioning over to the main stream. After reading about the imagery and plot, I have since gone back and watched the film again to great delight.
The closest film I can compare this to is Memento. Unlike the lightbulb moment at the end of Memento however, Enemy resolves in a way that might still leave the audience confused. Perhaps this is the point, to experience how difficult it would be to live life as the main character. The second time through was much more enjoyable than the first, and I would encourage any film buff to see this piece of art.",Enemy

268,AmandaSage,"Denis Villeneuve spins a beautiful, twisted tale with Enemy",9,14 April 2014,"If you read my Prisoners review from September 2013, you'll know how much I've been looking forward to the release of Denis Villeneuve's subsequent film, Enemy. In anticipation, I read José Saramago's novel The Double, on which the movie is based. This was my second exploration of a film adaptation of one of Saramago's works, having read and seen Blindness years before. But unlike with the first experience, this time I had trouble getting through the book. In writing Blindness, Saramago took liberties with punctuation (i.e., he didn't use much of it), but it's even more extreme in The Double, where he spends countless pages detailing inanities in a confusing, repetitive manner. All that made for a bit of a tedious read.Still, The Double does delve into interesting ideas about identity, perception, purpose and our very existence. So it was worth exploring. But for me, those ideas were better presented in Villeneuve's film adaptation than in its source material.In Enemy, as with most film adaptations, the story is pared down from the novel, offering a leaner, and in this case meaner, version of events. Enemy cuts to the chase—even if that chase leads you in circles, after your own tail.So what's the movie about? Well, that's a little complicated, but I'll start with what happens in the movie. We're introduced to Toronto-based history professor Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal), who goes about his dreary, repetitive life, trapped in a cycle of routine lectures (on the ways totalitarian states keep people down), mundane sex (with his girlfriend, Mary, played by Mélanie Laurent) and restless nights. His pattern is shaken up when Adam rents a movie, on a colleague's recommendation, and discovers an actor who looks just like him.Adam tracks down the actor, a man named Anthony Claire (also Gyllenhaal), who already operates under a dual identity, having the stage name Daniel Saint Claire. Anthony's exterior matches Adam's, but his interior harbours a much darker side.The men confirm they are one another's exact double, complete with matching scars. From there, things really start to unravel, particularly when the men swap women without consulting their partners (Anthony has a six-months pregnant wife named Helen, played by Sarah Gadon).Enemy does more than tighten The Double's plot points; it takes liberties with events, trimming some here, adding others there. But it hits all the unmissable points.The film also nails the novel's creepy tone, capturing the feeling of being caught up in the minutia of daily life, of endlessness, pointlessness and powerlessness. Capitalizing on the poignancy of the visual image, as opposed to the written word, Enemy's cinematography depicts a bleak, dingy cityscape, one that's yellowed out somehow, like faded images—relics of the past, or a history destined to repeat itself.Beyond its cinematography, Enemy incorporates a visual metaphor and representation of The Double's twisted surrealism and sense of being trapped in a web. From the low-angle shots of streetcar wires that hang over the city like spindles, to the appearance of actual arachnids (for example, at an elite sex club, where men stare vacantly as naked women release live tarantulas from captivity), spiders are a recurring symbol in the film.I don't want to break Enemy down too much, both because I want to avoid spoilers and because I should watch the movie a second time before trying to really analyze it—the film bears repeating. But it's definitely not for a lack of material to explore. Enemy, like Drive, is another great candidate for a film essay. Its script is loaded with double meaning and leaves even more open to interpretation than does The Double.Whereas the book treats the two men, Tertuliano and António Claro, as being quite separate, the movie drops hints that they may actually represent two sides of the same person. We're given clear evidence that they are two different people, but there are also suggestions to the contrary, letting the complexity and ambiguity of the novel's themes emerge from the cluttered prose to rise to the surface.Then there's the significance of changing the title from The Double to Enemy. The focus is directed away from the notion of a doppelganger and toward the threat it represents, but who is the enemy here—the state? the self? There's a lot to uncover, and it all culminates in a staggering ending; the final shot is a total WTF moment (and another departure from the novel, although it does bring to mind a line from The Double: "" sometimes dreams do step out of the brain that dreamed them""). But after the initial shock wore off, I found it to be perfectly fitting with Enemy's themes, absurdity and apparent quest to get the neurons firing. A more conventional conclusion might have been clearer, but it likely would have felt trite or unsatisfying. As it is, Enemy keeps its viewers dangling, and I think that's exactly what the filmmakers intended.Enemy is an interesting study in the possibilities of moving from page to screen. And while its tone, cinematography and trippy dream sequences are reminiscent of the Davids (Cronenberg and Lynch), more than anything else, the artistic choices behind Enemy demonstrate Villeneuve's own astonishing range; to go from Maelstrom to Incendies to Prisoners to this is quite incredible.Enemy also features another of Villeneuve's fantastic casts. Laurent and Gadon are excellent as ever. Still, the film rests on Gyllenhaal's shoulders, requiring him to do double duty as both protagonist and antagonist (or are they one and the same?). He's more than up to the task, proving yet again that he's one of the finest actors working today.With Enemy, Gyllenhaal also reinforces what a remarkable duo he makes with Villeneuve. I look forward to their next collaboration; what form it will take is anybody's guess.",Enemy

270,karan-virgo92,You are your own Enemy if you Do not Watch This!,8,2 June 2014,"First, a warning for all. This review contains Heavy Spoilers. So read further only if you have seen the movie.There are many who think the movie is about Spiders taking on the world and the survival of human beings unaware of the growing ""Dictatorship"" that the unmarried Professor Jake Gyllenhall talks about in the movie.But the perception is far-fetched and not entirely true. The movie is about the banality of human relations that exist as controlling regime, keeping humans busy with ideas of love and companionship and just like ""bread and entertainment"" that Professor Jake says were used by Greeks to keep populace busy.If you are going on a path that there are two different Jake Gyllenhall in the film, actor Jake and Professor Jake, you are already treading on the wrong road. The movie is a psychological struggle of struggling actor (as Jake's mother says ""you've got a respectable job...quit the fantasy of being a third grade movie actor); who starts working as a professor to meet ends meet without telling his wife (as evident by the reaction given by his wife when she sees him at college and at last asks him ""how was school""); goes to exotic clubs (first scene) and cheats on his pregnant wife (His wife asking ""are you seeing her ""AGAIN""). In his mind, Jake Gyllenhall creates an imagination of himself as a different identity to escape the realities of his existing situation with his pregnant wife whom he sees as a ""Spider"" (evident by his dreams of women as spiders) exerting absolute ""CONTROL"" (the word he uses in his lecture).The Giant Spider shown in the movie immediately after Jake Gyllenhall visits his mother also signifying another controlling woman of his life: his mother. Coincidentally, in Canada, where the movie is shot, there is a similar looking spider monument called as ""Mother Spider"".The story is his mental struggle to be loyal to his wife and at the end he crushes his cheating side by going back in the arms of his wife and psychologically he dreams about a car accident of his cheating actor self.And at last the big twist. In the end he receives the key to the exotic club and he again lies to his wife thinking about going to the club. This is when his wife turns into a giant spider. Jake Gyllenhall looks at her, gives a wry smile and sighs knowing that he will never escape the bondage of relationship as ""it is a pattern that repeats itself"" as he says in his lecture.This is a movie worthy of watching as the memory of this movie haunts the watcher for many days. The intriguing and bizarre ending makes one watch the movie again and again. And also it is a movie that showcases the pessimistic yet realistic idea of how relationships destroy independence, identity and self-respect of a human being.

271,dannyinformal,An inner battle against promiscuity,8,16 June 2014,"Enemy describes how Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a history teacher and aspiring actor, battles his adulterous urges by subconsciously creating and alter-ego.At some point in her life, Adam's wife discovers her husband's infidelity. This puts a lot of pressure on Adam's already troubled existence. He feels he's losing his already limited freedom, tangled in the web of married life. He takes off and misses 6 months of his wife's pregnancy. Pressured by his duties as a husband and father, which conflict with his need to be free and in control, he suffers a psychosis. At this point, Anthony is created.Adam fights and eventually destroys his alter-ego in a futile attempt to better his life. At this point he returns to his pregnant wife, who's aware of his psychosis.The story is packed with subtle messages which allow the observer to grasp its meaning. Symbolism plays a prominent role and although it might not be obvious at first, it does make sense. The spiders symbolize women, which tangle Adam in a web of responsibility and renouncement. The large spider, I believe symbolizes his mother who actively dismisses his dream of becoming an actor, thus limiting his freedom of choice. Throughout the story, other subtle messages are sent to underline Adam's struggle with his inner need to be free. The final scene of the story, clarifies the vicious circle Adam's in. He destroys his adulterous self, but falls prey to his old ways at the slightest sign of temptation. When he does, his wife turns into a spider that cowers in his presence, out of fear to be killed.Adam smiles and recognizes the futility of his efforts, for history repeats itself. All greatest world events happen twice. The first time it's a tragedy, the second time it's a farce.The smile, symbolizes tragic acceptance.Truly a great film.",Enemy

273,Nanosecond,Where's Waldo?,4,9 May 2014,"Enemy must have been a nice acting exercise for Jake Gyllenhaal but for many, including myself, it turned out to be a puzzle I wish I never spent the time to solve.This will remain a spoiler-free review but if I were to spoil anything...nothing would be spoiled for you, if that makes any sense. There's nothing original about the story. It's been done before in other films with better execution. The twist is something seen immediately from the trailer but when actually viewing the film that notion is quickly thrown away...until it once again is brought up again. The tediousness in maintaining vague outlines of the film's plot is something this review shares with this film.The cinematography was spectacular and meshed well with the psychosis of the protagonist. The soundtrack was on point with harrowing melodies. The acting from the cast was strong considering there was very little to work with on the page and relied more on what was boiling inside a character instead of what skimmed the surface, a talent very few actors/actresses can pull off without seeming pretentious.But with all that going for it, the sum of all its parts added to nothing. I liken it to a 90's kids' puzzle book ""Where's Waldo?"" where the object is to find bespectacled Waldo, who wears a distinctive red and white striped sweater and cap, among hundreds of other colorful characters and objects. In other words, find the needle in the haystack. Once done, you immediately get the sense of great accomplishment until you take a step back and realize the reality of the situation. Enemy was a nice looking puzzle with colorful characters but, at the end of the day, it's just child's play.""Where's Jake?...Ah, found him!...now what...""",Enemy

Lets just face it, it should have been just a Short! What it has to offer? Almost nothing! Adding to this it is completely ABSURD the amount of mystery that these guys tried to sell us.

After that, well, there were some interesting approaches adding extra mystery but the movie developed just a few more steps until the end.SPOILERS:1 - At start we are presented to a bored lonely guy and his mom and another guy in a strange Club of perversions. The last one seems concerned while watching a show where a girl steps a pregnant spider. 2- The first has it's daily routine and is remembered to watch a movie. 3 - He recognizes an actor that looks exactly like him (the perverted ""twin"").4 - He starts doing everything to find him until they arrange a strange meeting (""strange"" as almost gay). 5 - He changes his mind and he doesn't want to know more about the other one. The pervert ""twin"" wants more... after having seen the his girlfriend. 6 - One f*cks his girlfriend (she started to appear as a call-girl but it is his girlfriend). The perverted doesn't seem to f*ck his pregnant wife and has a reputation of a past affair. 7 - The perverted arranged an exchange of roles where they end up switching ""wives"". 8 - It doesn't work well since one forgets the wedding ring small detail and the other one, the pervert, takes his wedding ring that leaves a white mark on the finger. 9 - The perverted wife, even though she knew, she wants to f*ck him. 10 - The girlfriend doesn't want to f*ck when she sees the white mark. 11 - The movie ends with a way to allude to the pregnant spider from the beginning.Just that.Bottom line.

An obsession that gives him situations that he never would have expected.If I say like this - Eyes Wide Shut and Mulholland Drive met a dark evening around 2002, one thing led to another and suddenly they were a couple. Time passed and their love grew stronger over the years. Soon addition was expected to the family and the other year the young and beautiful Enemy was added to the family Shut/Drive.This are the kind of slow agonizing, mysterious, dreamlike - psychologically manipulative movies, which I so deeply adore. I am so sold on this film that I can kneel and clap night long, if I had been able wolf-whistle I would have done it too. Wow, damn - this is good.Last time we were visited by a great film of the slow , agonizing mysterious kind, was in Polanski's The Ghost Writer from 2010, but the movie is not what makes Enemy like that little extra awesome - the surreal mystery that makes us never really know what happens - we get so incredibly deep mind-blown through the entire film that we do not even know what happened in reality.The ending is open to interpretation - there is an interpretation that is circulating on the internet that could be true, I'm not going to mention this here, as it spoilers the movie, but I say that it is just a well analyzed interpretation - which may well be true, but not necessarily need to be. For this is the movie that you after-wards to sit and feel unsure of what the outcome really was - if one directly after the movie, ""says"" that you understood it completely , so you are probably just a cocky culture geek who is trying to be pretentious.I don't even wan't to comment so incredibly mundane things as acting and photo, after this kind of experience - those are things that I usually really like to comment in my reviews. I'll make it short - the photo is dreamy incredible, fantastic and wonderful. The acting is excellent on all sides - from the protagonist/s Jack Gyllenhaal to Isabella Rossellini's mini roll. Mélanie Laurent and Sarah Gadon does really good acting and are wonderfully phenomenal and sexy.This movie has what I want, I want this movie. A rating is so useless and overrated, why do movies have to be classified by grades to be good? No I'm just kidding, I love to rate my movies. Strong 8/10, with a proximity for a nine so strong, that I can almost touch it.",Enemy
276,vicksel,Chaos remains as 2 unstructured story lines evolve,5,23 July 2016,"This interesting, film noir-like movie passes by gently like a summer breeze filled with exhilarating ambiance until you get stung by a bee. The feel of the movie is wonderful, as is the contribution of all actors. If you like movies that leaves 2 contradicting plot lines, then watch it, else you may want to skip it. Perhaps reconsider not continue reading this review as I will continue explaining both plots.The reason I voted a 5 out of 10, is me questioning why the director did not choose one plot. I am annoyed by that as both of them are intertwined and leaving gaps of the mistaking kind. Plot 1, which feels to me as the most likely one the director/writer is telling us, is where Adam and Antony are both the same person. In this story the main character just has to come to ease with him stuck in the web of life whereas his wife is pregnant and him saying goodbye to his adventures with Mary. The wife than represents a spider making a web, the colour of the shots him dreaming away of what other life he could have and partially lived by sleeping around with Mary and the crack in the car window in the end of the movie is the spiderweb which holds/ brings everything together. Sounds great right? To me, It does not make any sense that his mum than just hushed him at the kitchen table 'oh let go of your dream of becoming an actor' while he explained her a the duplicated man theory and should have left his mother worried about his mental state. The other alarming gap was when Mary steps in the car of Adam, while realizing he is not Adam. Why on earth would you step in a car of such a creep? You just don't. You'd run. Plot 2 however, has my preference above the other one, as it shows the cycle of life with history repeating itself with the first time it happens it's a tragedy and the second time being sort of slapstick (as referred to in the movie but I can't remember the latter one). Adam is an unhappy teacher with a dreadful relationship. The wife of Anthony figures out about Adam, meets him and therefore knows about the second Anthony which isn't Adam at all. Helen is puzzled and scared about of what will happen. Her husband sleeps around and she is everything but happy with their current relationship. Then, one night, she comes home and finds Anthony at home while he was supposed to be out. In bed she takes a few lines long glances at Anthony and realizes it's actually Adam. Before going to sleep she even gently asks him how school was and quickly says never mind after his awkward response asking the what question (if he wanted to keep the face up he should have immediately asked in return if she was mistaken him for Adam) it saddens her heart as she realizes that her husband has most likely taken Adams' place instead to chase a woman. He has done it once again. When she wakes up in the middle of the night she finds Adam crying on the couch being unable to look at her nor the situation. This is the moment she makes the decision. No more Anthony. Helen says to Adam 'please stay'. The next day she is the spider again and Adam stares at her, not scared nor surprised, just knowing he'd be happier in this web of life. The gaps in this plot are more subtle as this plot is yet undefined. They have not yet found out about the deaths of Anthony and Mary (the radio message is a mere coincidence). Helen chooses Adam over Anthony, she does not know him at all, despite Anthony being a giant prick, it is Weird. And than... A giant question remains, will history repeat itself? Will another Antony/Adam show up? In the end, Adams' search started with looking for a Daniel... Substituting it within the search to Anthony, a stage name was implied. And I call this an implication, as I think there are many more Adams without having any clue where they come from and especially the why... If only the second plot were true, how intriguing would that be (well, except the giant spider images which have no addition in this plot). As history is repeating itself...chaos remains... which is than the pattern itself.",Enemy
277,jerobalalva,Those damn spiders!,10,6 August 2017,"When I read this movie had spiders I was scared, see I have this thing called arachnophobia (fear of spiders). I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this film, but I saw those amazing reviews and I remembered I remembered Denis Villeneuve directed it and Jake Gyllenhaal starred in the leading role so I had to see it. The movie revolves around a man that while watching a movie finds something rather odd, a look alike, so he soon seeks to find him. The movie is a mind bending experience that will require multiple viewings to fully grasp all the meanings. There is very few lighting in the film it is very dark literally, so it makes it hard to see in some scenes. Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance he is up there with Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix. This movie has excellent editing and cinematography, the film is very dark as the director imagines. The script really nailed it, it was only written for Jake Gyllenhaal I cannot imagine any other actor. What I love about this movie the most is its surrealist look even though I hate spiders, there's one short sequence where we can see an enormous spider crawling through the city, I loved it! Denis Villeneuve proves he is one of the best directors working today, by his incredible dark vision to this movie. Overall it is a movie for film lovers, but it isn't for everyone.",Enemy

288,OblivionInAtlantis,Deciphering the chaos: start with the tagline...,8,19 March 2015,"and what an order we find from there. It's really funny to let all these clues come together and let the opening quote come true, with a little help from my fellow-IMDb'ers and the Trivia. 1. The tagline: You can't run from yourself! immediately takes away any doubt about whether it are too different guys or not. Not. For me this made it almost more chaotic, because he then has to be really messed up in the head, have the strongest personality disorder ever, since the majority of the film is about one half of his personality being obsessed with finding the other. But I think the teacher-half wants it to end, and is unconsciously already planning to let both halves meet to let them put an end to it in some way. That could also be the case because his affair isn't that great anymore, and he starts looking (it's no coincidence he watches his own movie) for himself, and right there and then he is already saying no to sex with her. Btw, his girlfriend said that she thought she knew what was going on, so he probably has a history with the disorder, too. Then one might ask, Why? It seems to be because of his affair, of which he can't let go. He unconsciously splits himself up (in his mind) to morally be able to keep his affair going while also staying with his very pregnant girlfriend (whom he doesn't seem to like that much anymore). This also seemed a bit implausible to me, but that's where the spiders come in. He cannot resist beautiful women, has a huge weakness for them, and most of all of course for the affair woman. The spiders represent that (see Trivia) probably. And he links the spiders to that because of the crazy strip club hotel room we see in the beginning of the film. For me the spiders were the last puzzle piece, filling up that gap of why someone would be able to split himself up (although he's got talent for it) for a simple affair. Still , it seems to be more logical if they were two persons: he's got two jobs, two houses, two mothers... Well, one house isn't really a house, because they all say ""do you live here?!"", it looks like it's a hotel room for his affair I guess. The mothers are a bit weird though, 'cause in the beginning her voice mail says she's worried about his room, and when he really meets her, she says he has a nice apartment (that was his mother, right?). She also says he should stop trying to be an actor and he is being recognized at the talent-actor place where he gets the envelope. So in real life he is an actor, not a history teacher, and probably not both (because I don't believe that combination). Moreover, he walks into an empty lecture room...In the end, in his mind, he kind of sends the actor-half of himself away (he might have planned it like that all the time unconsciously), while the real him actually goes home before ever meeting her. She wanted the teacher half to stay, so in his mind he kills the woman and the actor in a car crash. At home he is confronted with his obsession for women again, finding the key to the spider-strip club thing in the envelope. And it seems like it will start over all again then: an unhappy ending. Then he goes to his girlfriend in the bedroom, and he sees her naked and pregnant sitting on the bed, I know this because that's an image from the first part of the film, and it's absolutely irresistible for him...so what HE sees in his mind: is a gigantic spider, a happy ending indeed...",Enemy

296,BigDick3,The weirdest yet most enjoyable movie experience I have had in years.,8,9 May 2014,"Villeneuve has came out and produced another brilliant film, I love that he has used Jake Gyllenhall again after Prisoners. He owns this film with a wonderful performance.There is a lot of confusion about the film and what the spiders represent, was there really 2 Jakes or were they the same guy? I have read some pretty interesting ideas from other people, I don't claim to completely understand it but would like to throw something out there for consideration.The movie opens with the biggest clue of how to understand what your about to see when the message ""Chaos is order yet undeciphered"" appears. The whole movie is like a jigsaw puzzle that will make sense if you can put it together in the correct order.I have not read every review or theory on it but from the ones I have read all seem to believe that the scene in the ""Sex Club"" we see at the beginning happens before most of the other scenes and that the scene at the end where he tells the wife he plans on going out before she turns into a giant spider is him repeating the cycle all over again.In my opinion the ""Sex Club"" scene takes place afterwards, we see him walking down the corridor with the caretaker and only Jake has a key, he lets the caretaker in. We hear in the elevator the caretaker has been before but does not think he will get a new key. So it's my opinion that the key in the envelope is the new keys that were being sent out and he as a favour allows the caretaker to tag along.There are some clues throughout the film though that go along with the theme of history repeating himself for example when we hear Jake give a lecture and then the same lecture slightly mumbled and less enthusiastic. I have read people say this represents his day to day life however my opinion is that they are actually a year apart. He was giving the same lecture to the next generation of students. I believe that most of the story takes place over a period of a year based on the 2 incidents where ""6 months"" is mentioned. The first is when he goes to the talent agency and the security guard has not seen him in 6 months, and then again when his wife says she is 6 months pregnant.I won't go through every scene and tell you my opinion of what goes where as part of the fun is figuring it out for yourself by watching it a second and even third time.I could be way off with all of this and completely wrong, but in my opinion that is the beauty of this movie.",Enemy

The author has nicely presented it using a thrilling storyline. I watched pulp fiction yesterday and suddenly realised that Enemy has been under rated so badly on IMDb compared to that. If pulp is rated as 8.9, Enemy must have at least 9.2 in my opinion.Men naturally are meant to be free and independent souls, yet they unknowingly get bound to the spider webs of women. It's not that women are always bad or a statement that spread hatred on women for any reason. It is the way that the life is designed and cultures are formed. That spider web is something that exists are men fly into by themselves with feelings such as love, desire, attraction and responsibility. First they live under love and CONTROL of the mother and then fly into the web of love & CONTROL of another woman with the marriage. You feel happy the moment you enter and you believe that you are happy and settled in life as you have someone of your own by your side; but you also feel the discomfort of suffocation underneath and still unknowingly believe yourself to be a happy person. The dreams you had in life are controlled and restricted by the commitments you carry bound to the spider web, and that imaginary version of yourself inside your mind, lives the life you wish for in your dreams. But, NO; now you can't really think of it in your real life and you happen to live the boring 'high school teacher' life repeating the same lesson everyday. Even if you have mastered the knowledge of how world-politics play, you are just a person who has an opinion, yet not someone who could make a difference! The woman you love is not a bad person, of course she worries about you are being happy in life, and she would truly wish if you live being the happiest man ever. But, she doesn't know how to make it happen; because it's the way that the life and culture has been designed. Women wish their sons/husbands to be happy WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES they enforce. But sadly the soul of a man never becomes a happy one when there are BOUNDARIES/DEPENDENCIES to worry about. Some men therefore tend to have a secret key which opens a door to a hidden life of Thiers which also may consist of spider webs and spiders, yet, they may see them as an inverted/up-side-down version of the spiders/web they daily deal with in life. Time to time, you realise that you need to break the imagination and force yourself to be happy on the spider web which you have chosen! But again you look for that secret key at some point in life, which makes even the spider is one worried person!Tell me why this movie doesn't deserve over 9.2 on IMDb?",Enemy
308,Donhagneone,An Underrated Film.,9,6 July 2015,"The Good: +Dialogue +Story +Acting +Script+CinematographyThe Weak: Some people will get confused when they watch ""Enemy"" because of its very interesting way of telling the story. But that wasn't a problem for me.With last year's big and successful thriller Prisoners, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve made a name for himself among word wide moviegoers. Almost year later after the release of Prisoners is the release of Enemy a mind bending and deep film which was filmed before ""Prisoners"". The impact Villeneuve has left us with after these films doesn't seem to be going anywhere soon.There are viewers who urgently asks for an 'explanation' of the last scene, I suggest that they should re-watch the movie and try to analyze it, the ending has a lot of meanings. A more appropriate answer should be ""how does the final scene magnify the emotional and dramatic values we've been experiencing throughout this whole film?"" The question can only be answered by each individual viewer, and no one else.",Enemy
309,Griff5516,Not a Film for the Everyday Moviegoer!!,10,12 April 2014,"I definitely do not usually take the time to write a review about movies I've seen, simply just rate them to keep a record. However, I believe that this film deserves to have one written, and I hope people take the time to read it.I believe that this film will only be truly enjoyed and appreciated by those who are willing to look deeper into the meaning and not just look at it at face value and then get frustrated when they can't figure out what it's saying. I must give most credit to Slate.com staff writer Forrest Wickman for saving me the time of doing the research.I've come to the conclusion that this film is (clearly) meant to be more than your run-of-the- mill thriller. I believe it circulates around the idea that so many people are oblivious to the fact that parts of the world are falling ruin to a Totalitarian state. The idea of Individual expression is becoming lost as Society is being censored through propaganda and entertainment. In this film, Adam Bell represents this Individual expression that is either oblivious or choosing to ignore what society around him is falling victim to. His double, Anthony Claire, represents an essentially alternate form of himself that is the 'lost individual', consumed by the world of entertainment and his own ego. As the movie progresses, we begin to see them turn into one another, struggling to find their identity with the apparent knowledge that they have an identical form of themselves elsewhere. It seems as though Anthony is representing Adam's attempt to erase memories of his regrets. His struggling marriage and lingering affair are aspects of Adam's life that he needs to rid himself of. This leads finally to this idea of the spiders. The author of the The Double, the book upon which the movie is based, is José Saramago. José wrote strongly and lived through regimes overpowered by fascism. This idea is seen here, as gradually Adam sees spiders in his dream replacing humans in form. This is almost reminiscent of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where everybody is replaced by emotionless beings. The spiders are these dark memories of Adam that are taking over, that he sees in his dreams. They continue to become larger and more prominent the more he sees them. This is, until finally he rids himself of them completely (represented by the crash). I still have yet to figure out why Villeneuve chose these replacements to be spiders, but this quote by José Saramago (from a different work) may explain something:""There is no lack of spiders' webs in the world, from some you escape, in others you die. The fugitive will find shelter in a boardinghouse under an assumed name, thinking he is safe, he has no idea that his spider will be the daughter of the landlady  a dedicated nationalist who will regenerate his heart and mind.""Subtle representations of spider's webs are seen throughout the film, adding another element by suggesting that the main character doesn't even see this 'Totalitarian Web' (if you will) taking over the city until he was already trapped in it. As far as the ending goes, use your imagination!! But I believe that when Adam opens the envelope to reveal the key to the Strip Club from the beginning of the film, this brings the memories back and he can't resist the urge. He tells Helen he may have plans that evening, and he walks in to see she has become a spider. He sighs sadly, realizing what's happened.Themes of Identity, Compulsion, and Totalitarianism are just three that could be deduced from this fascinating film. Sorry for such a wordy review, but I love movies that make me think and look deeper, and Denis Villeneuve truly created an amazing film with 'Enemy.'10/10 stars.",Enemy
310,info-3268,Not quite a thriller...,7,31 March 2014,"Expected to see a good thriller and instead ended up watching an art house flick. The opening sequence was terrific, but the rest of the movie, in my opinion, did not hold up.""Enemy"" had a poetic feel to it, with some hints of Lynch here and there, and it did not lack originality, though it still felt like a parody on good movie making.Another problem I had was the pacing -- I usually am patient when it comes to contemplative films, but found this one to be a bit too draggy.

311,mvpharmcon,Chris Stuckmann nailed the meaning; read his review AFTER seeing the movie,9,26 August 2014,"I watched the movie Enemy for the first time last night and loved it. Enemy is a modern masterpiece in crafting psychological tension. Hitchcock plus Burroughs. Yes, there is a very tight meaning in this movie, and if you watch the many hints dropped here and there, you'll marvel at how tidy it is. Its also a wonderful romp around Toronto's skyline, and in and through its many diversified architectural battlegrounds. Even the colour tone of the film is dark and smoky, very surreal. The actors play their roles coolly, leaving Jake to absorb us into his world of doubt and pain. I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy film noire, psychological thrillers, and the bold metaphor. After seeing the film, if you are still pondering about the dangling bits and pieces, I recommend that you read Chris Stuckmann's brilliant little review online. He really captures the essence of the story but remember, only after seeing the film first.",Enemy

313,Justin-Kemp,enemy: very interesting perspective from José Saramago's 'The Double',8,30 October 2014,"Head-scratching, mysterious & gloriously enigmatic! hard to grasp, but by reading José Saramago's The Double it becomes clear what its all about. its one of them movies where once its over you go away a little confused and wondering whether you enjoyed it or not. I myself enjoy the fact you leave feeling lost and need to research the film premise after, by either reading the book or by just plain google'n it. a very interesting (body snatchers) concept in this movie, also a quiet film with a slow start, and more of a indie film feel to it. The ending is quite scary and very unexpected but overall a must watch. one of the best performances I've seen by jake gyllenhaal. very impressed!justin kemp",Enemy
314,jt6626,An Audacious Masterpiece,10,6 February 2015,"At a myopic glance, this movie doesn't seem like it offers too much (except for maybe the scariest scene in all of movie history). However, apart from that scene, the movie isn't scary. It also isn't very exciting or captivating, and it's definitely not lucid. This movie drags you along in a schizophrenic state for about an hour, then, in the last 20 minutes or so, smashes your dazed mind to pieces. This movie isn't just an ending though. At one and a half hours long, the plot is anything but spread thin. Mild scrutiny will reveal the density and meticulousness of each scene and though the film may be dull to watch, its ten times more profound and imaginative.That being said, this movie isn't for the inexperienced, it'd be enjoyed far more by the seasoned cinephile. For those of you who thought Inception was clever, who thought Fight Club was meticulous, who thought The Matrix or Memento or Shutter Island were mind-twisting, this is just a step above. It is that good.Still, you may be disappointed or eternally confused after watching it. Luckily there are more blog posts about this movie than any other I've encountered. The sheer quantity and variety of ideas cultivating from this film is impressive in its own right. This movie will give you chills long after viewing it.",Enemy

There are moments in the film that are genuinely unnerving, but they flatten quickly. 90 minutes of characters staring into space does not itself suspense make.

In the first level this is a psychological drama about an insecure teacher realizing he has a look-alike who is an actor. It is enjoyable, although a bit confusing, to watch the teacher attempt contact with his look-alike while also maintaining his relationships with 3 women in his life: wife, mistress and mother A casual movie-goer will catch on to the basic premise while being confused about some of the specific interactions. At this level the movie is great watching for Gylenhaal and his 3 supporting women: wife, mistress, mother (Rossellini). A more observant movie goer will discover more of the underlying psychology of the movie.But if you're like me in that you enjoy a hint about things to watch for, here is my subtle attempt. Spoilers: This movie gets into aspects similar to Fight Club and Mulholland Drive. If you loved those movies you'll love this one. Like those movies, there are 2 realities and you'll have to pay attention to which reality you are in at the moment. Listen and you'll hear the many clues spoken by the characters.

326,ataturkman,Here is the interpration of the movie,8,5 February 2015,"I am writing this because i am sick of people hating on this. So hear me out and read my explanation and what i took from it and if you still think it is superficial contunie to hate.This movie does not follow a certain time line. Every event is mixed up. He is an actor and he is not faithful to his wife. He has sex with his girlfriend and he just does that with her. When she comes home her wife is always questioning him. He talks to the phone with his other personality and his wife asks if he is talking to ""her"" again. Here we see that he has betrayed her before.So, the bottomline is he was an actor, he cheated on his wife and had a accident. His girlfriend died, his dream of being an actor has died and that accident gave him that scar. He doesn't go to the agency for 6 months and his wife is 6 month pregnant. He has a photo that is torn at the beginning because as we see it in the end, the photo is him with a different woman. So after the accident he stops trying to be an actor and he becomes a history teacher that's why his mother says that he should forget his acting dreams. And even though he is married he again cheats on his wife which results in a problem that his girlfriend understands he is married. These 2 personalities are created by himself and it is in his mind. Her wife asks how is school so you clearly can see that he is the same person.When he comes from the run she says i met the guy and he looks just like you. And when he says he doesn't know she says i think you do. She understands that he is losing it. Spiders represents women. Spide catch prey like women does. Our guy lost his freedom. In the start a woman squashes a spider. That's his wife's control. In there he is free. So about the end? When he took out the new key, he realizes that it is the key to sex club. He tells his wife he is going. And when she doesn't answer he goes in and she is a spider but the spider is scared because she is afraid of being squashed. He eliminates his other side.

There are more Canadian movies being produced now more than ever, and I would consider this to be one which will qualify under CRTC regulations. On this side of the border it seems to me that there is a conspiracy (likely an exaggeration on my part, but a feeling) to rate Canadian movies (and those that qualify as such) higher than they should be to get Canadians to watch them. (By the way I am not a conspiracy theorist). Frankly, this movie is a good example of a movie rated high for the sole purpose of attracting Canadian viewers. IMDb is far too credible to be behind this. I am not questioning the integrity of IMDb. It appears to me that some people must be writing on behalf of the CRTC in order to obtain higher ratings for Canadian movies. CRTC = Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commision.

Boy was I wrong.The movie wastes one hour just going through the main characters paranoia in the face of the discovery of his duplicate. The scenes are slow and most of them could be cut out without the movie losing any informational value. Considering this is a one and a half hour movie this shouldn't be happening.The director tries to imitate an art house style of filmmaking but doesn't go further from imitating. Usually in slow films the pace is used to lure you in to the films atmosphere so you can submerge into the characters psyche. None of this happened here. The movie managed to be terribly slow and at the same time maintain the cliche aesthetic of a Hollywood thriller. Quite an achievement!Anyway heard the book is better might check it out.

After about 30 min suffering, I was hoping that I am wrong about the plot, that there are some awesome scenes or explanations await me, to blow my mind. I suffered and suffered, finally the big ending came. And it is nothing but more disappointment. OMG, Mr. Villeneuve, you can show us all the chaos you want.

Even if you've done your homework on this movie, like they say you must if you want to enjoy this one, there's ABSOLUTELY NO FUN to watch! There is no suspense, no puzzle solving, no wisdom sharing, nothing.

340,sergioarmenta95,Perfect example of what a psychological thriller should be,10,16 February 2016,"Enemy is directed by Denis Villenueve and stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Adam, a history teacher who comes across what might be his doppelgänger. This is one of those movies that leaves a lot to decipher and interpret. So if you're one of those people who expects a movie to tell a complete and clear story, this might not be for you. While many films try to have a deeper meaning, they either lack substance or become lost in their own world of metaphors and meanings. This movie strikes a perfect balance for me. I'll get into my interpretation of the movie at the end of this review.Enemy explores themes about commitment, infidelity, addiction, repetition, and mental disorders in a very unique way. It delves into human behavior, and it's nature to make the same mistakes. Adam and Anthony represent how far people could be willing to go in order to repress the truth. It poses many interesting questions and while it may not answer everything, it stays on your mind long after watching it.The style and cinematography of the movie adds a lot to the story and its mysteries. The movie seems to have the same warm color filter all throughout, giving it a dream like feel to it. It's also sprinkled with somewhat disturbing dream sequences involving spiders. It also contains some of the strangest opening and closing scenes I've seen.I found the score to be eerie and unsettling. It's very subtle but it adds suspense to the film when needed.Jake's performance as Adam and Anthony is fantastic. It's not flashy at any point, most of the genius is in the subtle differences between the two characters. Adam is portrayed as a nervous, messy, awkward history teacher. The repetition in the beginning of the movie shows how monotonous his life is. Anthony on the other hand, is very sleek and confident. Due to details in the characters posture, walk, voice and facial expressions, I never had difficulties knowing who was who. Melanie Laurent plays the girlfriend well for the few lines and screen time she has. Sarah Gadon does a great job as the wife, portraying confusion and fear very well. She nails the emotional scenes. SPOILER ALERTNow I'm gonna give my interpretation of the film. To be honest, I didn't get it the first time I watched it. It wasn't until a couple more viewings and reading other people's interpretations that I got an idea of what everything meant. Adam and Anthony are the same person. He seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder. As the director and Jake have said, the movie is about a man's subconscious as he deals with commitment. Anthony is a manifestation of Adam's desires to be unfaithful to his wife. We first get a clue when the guy is talking to his mom and she mentions about him having a good job and apartment, and to give up his career as an actor. This shows that he is both the history teacher and the actor. The other clue is the ripped photo Adam has, which matches Anthony's photo with his wife. The spiders seem to mean his lust for women and the danger they represent for him. He goes after them yet fears he will get trapped in their web as he has with his pregnant wife. Adam has built Anthony to be able to get rid of him, his unfaithful tendencies. Regarding the end, the spider reacting scared by Adam represents his wife knowing that he is falling yet again to temptation. The wife tells Adam that his mother called, which seems to coincide with the voicemail left by his mom in the beginning. History repeats, as mentioned by Adam himself in his lectures as a teacher. Going back to the photograph, it might show that Adam is the result of of his past self, Anthony. Anthony has the whole photograph, showing he's still with his wife while Adam has the one with his wife missing, hinting at a divorce, which would explain his empty apartment and boxes.Enemy is a perfect example of what a psychological thriller should be. While slow at times, it always kept me wondering and wanting to know more. 9/10",Enemy

Now like I said this movie is NOT FOR EVERYONE enemy is one of those movies that you have to keep up with and will make you think a lot, i mean there are people who understand it but don't like it and there are people who both don't like it nor do they understand it and there are people who like it.

In my opinion a more exciting evening can be had licking the living room carpet, at least then you are offered a chance of something interesting happening( the ER or a long forgotten chocolate , followed by the ER). Don't waste your time hoping for any sense of meaning at the end, or even hoping that the journey itself might be worthwhile, it isn't.

The two versions of Jake Gyllenhaal are actually one guy only. When he was the actor he doesn't want to be that responsible husband and couldn't control his sexual urges which explains while he lectures the students about ""Control"".When he was the History Teacher, he tries to control his urges and practices to be a responsible person by eliminating the negative things he held as actor and reunite with his wife.His wife and mother have always known he is mentally disturbed. That is why his wife asks him to stay at the movie end as he was staying separated from her as the history teacher.Then the final scene with spiders, it explains he, in his mind, incorporates women as spiders and that is why the spider in the final scene is afraid of him as he watches a spider getting squashed in the sex club at the beginning of the film and his reaction tells us that it is going to be repeated as he teaches the students.I haven't seen any film with such plots and twists and everything intact and related.This is a mind-blowing film.",Enemy
346,Jacobee,Enemy?,4,14 June 2014,"This film just caught me completely unprepared. It actually was my fault watching the film wholly unaware of cast, storyline, type of movie or any further details. I love psychological movies, but this one was just too much. There were so many silent scenes and unreasonable behaviors going on. Why the hell should I be scared of my double that much? Yeah sure he may be my lost twin, or he may be even me from other dimension. Yeah, whatever, but during the entire film I kept asking myself what would you have done if you met your double? And the only thing I could have thought about was inviting him for a cup of coffee, maybe get to know each other and talk things through? Why should we meet in some rented room one hour away from city? And what is wrong with all the spiders? I definitely must have missed something. Enough with all the criticism. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors and he played it just remarkably well as everything though. I also love Denis Villeneuves Prisoners and the atmosphere there is a bit comparable to Enemy. Depressed, stuffy and heavy. These are the only things I appreciated on this film. I apologize to everyone who went through a new psychological enlightenment with this movie but for me my double is not a person I want to be afraid of. 40%",Enemy
347,ashorocetus,Mysterious but not in an interesting way,3,11 May 2020,"Fails to entertain but it succeeds at holding your attention. I would say, mysterious to a fault. I don't have a problem with movies that defy explanation, but such a film ought to at least be entertaining or interesting - this one is masterfully suspenseful but there's not really anything else good I can say. The plot is not interesting and the characters are not appealing, nor are they unappealing in interesting ways. The only reason I did not decide to stop watching midway was because it successfully maintained high-suspense throughout. The music is extremely effective and keeps you on edge until the last scene. Unfortunately, the climax and final scene failed to resolve the tension in any way and only further inundate the viewer with confusion. Though I am sure this movie would benefit from multiple viewings, and further musing on its symbolism etc., I am not at all convinced that it is worth the time to do so.In sum: it is highly enigmatic, yet offers no incentive to viewers to even attempt to solve the enigma, and comes off in the end as a bland-yet-tense hour and a half that will leave you with no sense of resolution but also no desire to re-watch and try to understand what it was about.",Enemy

It is never stated what the women do for work or interests outside of their husbands/boyfriends.Desperately slow dialogue, I never figure out where screenwriters and directors get the idea that people never make jokes and always wait several seconds before responding to anything.

352,luxcatz,A Different Interpretation,8,28 July 2020,"Great movie, very interesting! I would recommend to anyone who loves a good mind bending mystery. I do not claim this is the true meaning but I want to share,The first thing that I noticed when it came to the beginning was the quote ""chaos is order undeciphered"", I took a lot of mental notes on the opening scenes because the dialogue seemed so utterly important.I believe that the film is a metaphor for history repeating itself and the damaging effects of political control. Adam is teaching a class about dictatorship and it's oppressions and in this moment he mentions that they control people by limiting their education and feeding them entertainment. I believe that Adam represents the controlling present and Anthony is the natural future. The theme of concrete is everywhere in this movie, and I think that exemplifies a type of accepted oppression.I also noticed how Adam's apartment is completely dry, meaning he can not be entertained anymore. It's done and the illusion has lost its meaning for him. He doesn't seem to enjoy things anymore and the fancy distractions aren't working as well as they used to. The spider represents the creator of the web that is spun around reality. It represents the lies that we are told.I also noticed how there was a theme of individual expression and that no one except for Anthony is really expressing any kind of truth or emotion, at least not as easily as he can. Individual expression is the means of breaking the cycle of oppression and lies. Once Adam realizes there is something out there that looks just like him (A new era) he needs to find it and try to contain and control it. Slowly, throughout the movie Adam begins to take all of Anthonys characteristics and life. He crawls into Anthonys skin, as Anthony falls for the promise of new flesh (entertainment/ Adams wife).Once Anthony leaves, Adam has completely taken his identity, yet he is the same person he always was (The old era crawling into new skin and pretending to be something different). When the massive spider is revealed at the end, I believe it symbolizes the final birthing stage of the cycle of history and oppression. It crawls away from Adam in fear, because he weaves its webs and creates the reality that we all know.The absence of any type of father in his life also represents the low expectations of fatherhood in society and his stiff relationship with his mother, who seems very judgmental and not accepting.I do believe this movie has multiple meanings so I do think there's so much going on in this movie that you can interpret in a different perspective which is really awesome. I might be COMPLETELY off the mark on this one, but I figured... Why not express myself?",Enemy

355,supermgv,A movie about compulsions we can't control,10,21 September 2017,"First of all, I strongly believe that Jake Gyllenhall does not have an identical twin. It is not possible, and the film seems to be about Jake Gyllenhall subconscious rather than some ""alien super huge spiders invading earth"" sci-fi movieWe see the film from Jake's subconscious point of view and therefore the events are portrayed out of chronological order. It seems that a direct causality pattern of the events featured is not be followed. For instance Adam gave a call to Anthony. After they hung up Helen (Sarah Gadon) the pregnant wife of Anthony asks him who was on the telephone: Helen: Who was on the phone? That's who was on the phone. I told you that. Why I would tell you any differently - Anthony: Helen, the same guy who called before. The same guy. - Helen: Are you lying to me? You are lying to me. - Anthony: You are acting crazy. - Helen: I am not crazy. Who was on the phone? - Anthony: I told you it was a man who was on the phone. - Helen: Are you seeing her? (Probably his now ex-mistress Mary, before the crash, before they stop seeing each other. The scene with the car crash is way after that dialog) - Anthony: Helen, I don't want to get into this. - Helen: Are you seeing her again? (so Mary survived the car crash. They both survived the car crash because Anthony-Adam got away with only a scar on the ribs) My personal opinion on how did Anthony-Adam and Mary, his mistress, separated. Just before the end of the movie, Anthony-Adam and Mary are making love when Mary notices Anthony-Adam finger. She cries out and she gets off the bed. Anthony: whoa whoa. What's wrong? (he seems honest, he really doesn't know what happening, another hint that Anthony and Adam is the same person) - Mary: The ring, the mark on your finger. (So she noticed for the first time that there is a mark on his finger. She realized that he is married, something that apparently she didn't know, and thus she decided to end their relationship. Poor acting by Mélanie Laurent. She said the line unnaturally. She said it like an Eastern European character of an erotic movie) - Anthony: What are you talking about. I have always had this. (he did, because he was married, and because he see that movie from his subconscious point of view. He is not lying)Mary: No, no, no (yes yes yes, he is a married man)He drives her home. They are fighting and then,  The car crashes. I think that event had happened before the Helen got pregnant. Interesting detail: His name is Adam, like the first man. And he has a scar on his rib. I think that his real name is Anthony, and his subconscious name is Adam. Archetypally he is a man, and as a man, is there any name more suitable than Adam?I noticed that Adam's apartment is completely empty. He has only a bed, a bench, an armchair and a laptop. That's all. I believe that he uses that apartment as a secret place to meet with his mistresses. The enemy is himself. His fear of commitment, his freedom being endanger by the pregnancy of his wife, his visits to sex clubs (opening scene). He is afraid of the responsibility of a decent affair. He can't move with his life because of his fears, and he is unfaithful in order to mitigate the stress of responsibilities (Adam is very nervous).The movie is about the war between those two selves, Adam and Anthony. Anthony is the narcissistic, unfaithful guy who is afraid of commitments. At some point, Adam decided to meet Anthony, to learn more about him and then the battle begun. Anthony was his subconscious enemy (thus the title). They settled down to an agreement. Adam allowed Anthony to take out his girlfriend Mary. Anthony said that he will leave forever after that. And he left. I think that the spiders symbolize the responsibilities, subconsciously speaking. He feels trapped because of them, like being trapped on a spider web. And as Adam, the history teacher, tells us in the begging ""That is a pattern that repeats itself throughout history"". Even with Anthony gone, Adam kept feeling trapped by the responsibilities. That is what last scene supposed to tell us. He said that he will be go out that night, starring the key for the sex club. Even with Antony eliminated he gave up to temptation at once. And then he sees his wife as a spider and their relationship as web, once again. 10/10",Enemy

I'd want to find out how this happened, how deep the similarities run etc. But these two are antagonistic to each other right off the bat - an attitude that is totally unrealistic.

There he sees an actor who looks exactly like him.Adam is handsome, has a gorgeous, pregnant wife and a personality, unlike Anthony.

Somehow, even a sex scene longer than 10 seconds should have some substance or meaning to the plot. While watching this particular flick last night, I thought it was doing exactly that; depriving me of my valuable sleep. I couldn't get a grasp of the whole thing. I only made sense of bits and pieces here and there and it certainly seemed like it was merely «trying» to be clever but was failing tremendously.I thought that all the way up until the last half hour of the movie. WARNING! SPOILER ALERT: (After watching the bed scene where she asks him «how was school» and then the car crash - I was convinced I knew what was going on. The key and the big spider at the end certainly confirmed my assumptions.)So, I checked online to see if I was wrong on my understandings of the movie and it seems that I wasn't. This movie is definitely well made. It seems like a mess at first, but if you are patient enough, you will see that everything is connected and that both the atmosphere, the people involved, the shady illusions/dreams all makes sense in the end. A very dark movie with elements at times that seem bizarre and a bit disturbing. These elements all play a significant role to the plot so do not brush them off.This is one of the few movies where whether a person personally likes it or not is completely irrelevant. The mind behind this production undoubtedly deserves an applause and one should definitely watch it because of that. I would never watch it again, but, man what a trip!

361,PopCornReporter,Enemy-Popcorn Reporter,9,11 February 2015,"I've first heard of this movie after watching Prisoners, which is a very good movie by the way (go and watch it if you haven't, go on, off you go). Anyhow, where was I? Ah! Well, after watching Prisoners I read some interviews with the director Denis Villeneuve and Jake Gyllenhall, and they have been talking about how they got drunk and then decided to make Prisoners. Also, the director noted that he didn't feel free while making Prisoners, that he wanted more artistic freedom to fully express what he wanted.Well he bloody did that in Enemy, let me tell you.Let's take a look at the names behind the movie. The movie is based on a novel The Double (2002) by Jose Saramago. Sadly I haven't read the novel, but I've done some research on it so I know what it's about.So okay, we have a great writer and his novel that is the base for the movie. Off to a good start. The director has also proved that he can do a very good job, as he did with Prisoners.Jake Gyllenhaal on the other hand I wasn't so sure about before. When you look at his bio actually I shouldn't be worried. He has done great work in movies such as Donnie Darko, Zodiac, Source Code and even Prince of Persia. No, I haven't seen Brokeback Mountain so I can't comment on that. I should probably see it.Whenever I see Jake's face I always get reminded of some Hollywood playboys who only look good and don't act very well, but that's not the case here. Jake has done a marvellous job yet again.It's really hard to review this movie, because if you would go on and ask me what the movie is about I couldn't actually tell you in a precise manner. I guess IMDb's summary would do a fair job but then again, the movie is something completely different than that.IMDb's summary:A man seeks out his exact look-alike after spotting him in a movie.Okay, so we might have another doppelganger movie with some mystery and suspense. Well, that's just if you scratch the surface.First off I have to commend the music score in this movie. In every moment you can hear very quiet music that builds the suspension and has me sitting on the edge of my seat. It also freaks the hell out of me at times.The photography in the movie is also spot on. The scenery it shows you is always, and I do mean always, connected to plot and it tries to deliver yet another piece of the puzzle. A puzzle I cannot solve. And I don't think it's meant to be solved easily, or at all.The acting is really good here. We have Gyllenhaal who does a splendid job at portraying two people and I must say I really felt the difference between them. It wasn't one of those bland performances where the movie has to tell you it's two different people, you can really feel the performance of both people, by the same actor. On one hand we have a wine-drinking, girlfriend-loving professor that has some really interesting (!) lessons, and on the other hand we have a third-grade actor, who cheats on his wife, visits really weird sex shows and basically lives completely differently than his doppelganger.There is a lot to note from these differences and performances, some stuff that are really crucial for the story, for which I'll be offering my theory soon.Aside from great acting, great directing and photography I must say the movie overall is a really good one. It's just one of those movies that has you sitting on the edge of your seat, constantly trying to soak in every scene and just fills your head with questions. Oh so many questions. Almost made my head explode. here are also so many metaphors in the movie, it just riddles your head to watch them all. Oh and the ending. A fabulous ending. Made me spill juice in my lap as well.

Makes me think this could have been a short film, say 40 minutes. Even then, that would not have changed the fact that ultimately it was pointless, there was weirdness for no reason, strange imagery which was not referred to again and an ending which was very unsatisfactory. I'm sure that some people, associated with the film perhaps, would coin it ""thought provoking"" but really, it is weird for the sake of weird without any spark of humanity or genius to engage the audience.

363,kakarontzas,My take on the story,10,4 May 2014,"There is a history teacher wannabe actor that is married and has an affair at the same time. When his wife got pregnant (7 months ago) he decided to breakup with his girlfriend. He went as usual at a hotel with her telling his wife as usual that he's visiting his mother. At the hotel he tells his girlfriend that he is married and he wants to stop seeing her. She didn't know and they fight. On their way back in the car the fight continues and he loses control of the car. The girl dies and he gets away with a scar. After that to cope with the loss and the tragedy he invents another personality. He is really an actor leaving with his wife whereas the history teacher still has an affair with the (still alive) girlfriend and he's another guy looking and talking just like him. His wife is the only person that knows that something is wrong. She thinks he has another affair, but when she visits him at the school and he clearly doesn't recognize her she understands the serious problem and she's helpless. I think the spiders and the inconsistencies here and there are meant to be indications to the viewer that we view the inconsistent reality through the eyes of the lead actor and nothing makes sense because he is crazy.",Enemy

369,dsa42,Jake Gyllenhaal gives a powerful performance on both sides,10,29 March 2014,"This is a great movie although the end caught me by surprise which is not a bad thing. Just like Prisoners, Denis Villeneuve creates a thriller that is full of tension and suspense. Our main character, Adam, is a disheveled history teacher who watches a recommended film. After he finishes it, he goes to bed but realizes that he has to rewind the movie because he remembers that he saw someone who looks exactly like him in a scene. From then on, he tries to find his double (and eventually does) and it is a thriller with suspense and tension that promises to keep you eyes glued to the screen throughout the whole film. This movie's runtime is very short (90 minutes) but it is just enough to develop the characters and plot. This is one of the best movies so far this year. With strong direction, head-scratcher symbols, and a great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, Enemy is a very Hitchcock type of film. NOW I WILL TALK ABOUT THE ENDING DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN""T SEEN ENEMY: At the end of the film, the last shot is a huge spider that looks scared of Adam. Adam looks back at the spider with a sort of smile and the movie cuts to credits. I feel (not sure it's just my interpretation) that the black widow at the end meant that Adam was going to be killed because black widows kill the ones that they mate with. Just saying that this movie isn't for everyone. I loved Enemy and it is probably the best movie so far this year! I am going to give it the highest honors... of an A+!!!! SEE IT!!!!",Enemy
370,Ariaaanrex,Underrated Storytelling Masterpiece...,9,27 February 2017,"Denis Villeneuve's 2013 film ENEMY is a psychological mystery- thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the leading role as a history teacher who stumbles upon a person in a movie who looks disturbingly identical to himself. He tries to get in contact with the actor, who is also played by Gyllenhaal, and is later on rapidly regretful of their encounters with each other. They are physically identical but possess quite different personalities.Shortly after the success of the acclaimed crime-drama PRISONERS, Denis Villeneuve went on to direct a smaller picture with lead starring actor Jake Gyllenhaal (who also appeared in PRISONERS). ENEMY was released widely in over 120 theatres and grossed internationally and domestically to nearly four million dollars.ENEMY is brilliantly and elegantly crafted and directed by Villeneuve in nearly every single shot. It keeps a subtle yellow color- consistency throughout the whole movie, which suitably sets the exhausting and weary mood of the film. The performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Sarah Gadon are great, especially by Gyllenhaal who manages to play these two different characters with subtlety to near perfection.With a run time of one hour and 30 minutes, this movie is short. But it's almost guaranteed that it will stay in your mind for a considerably longer time. ENEMY is mostly held up by its truly unique and complex storytelling. The writing in this film is certainly most clever and uses several metaphorical writing tricks that challenges the audience. ENEMY is highly thought-provoking that may require to be viewed several times to truly understand the deeper underlying story. Because of this matter, it may not be for everyone.To conclude, ENEMY by Denis Villeneuve is a highly underrated film that I believe will grow in years to come. It contains great acting performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and a highly complex and unique story that leads to thought-provoking scenes.",Enemy

It turns out David Lynch is incredibly talented, and throwing a few surreal elements into a stilted and turgid narrative doesn't result in Mulholland Drive, or anything like it.As for the ""split personality"" trope, I can't do better than recommend the speech given by a character in the movie Adaptation about what a hackneyed and lazy device that is.One thing I'll say for this is that Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent – you never have any doubt which of the two he's playing.

I love Jake Gyllenhaal and I love esoteric type films so obviously I was excited. This film was a little difficult to find but it is on Itunes and at Redbox locations (finally)!!! First off, the acting was great. The hidden ""open to interpretation"" meanings were interesting and feasible. But, it was dull. The lack of music and lighting were a little off. The spiders were......well they're spiders. Freaky. I get why they were used, but I was expecting more.. Appropriate for ages 15+ due to frequent nudity (but never genitalia), language, and sexual content. Definitely check this out if you are up for mind-blowing awesome weirdness.",Enemy

People who know something about movies gave it a low rating - they are the 'call a spade a spade' crowd. The movie was slow, and the subject matter, well just boring. Why make a movie about a comfortable middle class professor and his trying to forget his past lover when there are so much more interesting things happening in the real world today.

376,t_trujillo,A beautiful journey into the self,8,26 July 2014,What the absolute reason or end game of this movie is may be subjective. Its that subjectivity of control and self-centrism that move this piece through to an outcome of inner disappointment. Jake works magic on screen as he nearly always does. His ability to play against himself so convincingly is a gift to be enjoyed. The small almost cameo roles outside of his performance never make it past a gesture but are beautifully executed. To come back to the premise of being controlled from the macro to the micro it begs the notion that when one thinks that he has complete control he actually has lost all. A very simple notion that may have such reach that grasping that in a controlled environment and displaying this to an audience may be a loss at its own game.,Enemy
377,trecchion08,Review of Enemy,8,30 June 2014,"Tense, hypnotic and inventive are all words that perfectly encapsulate the latest mind bending thriller, Enemy, starring Jake Gyllenhaal. This is a film that is extremely original, throwing out a lot of questions but never fully answering them and it's one that demands a second, possibly even a third viewing. This is one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best roles, showcasing his superb acting abilities, playing dual roles as two people with completely different personalities. Denis Villeneuve, director of last year's exceptional Prisoners, expands his directorial talents yet again with Enemy, another remarkable example that shows just how great he is at building suspense and tension. Enemy runs a tight 90 minutes and perfectly so, there isn't a minute wasted. We're kept engrossed from the first frame until the perplexing last frame. Villeneuve gives the film a washed out, antiquated, yellow look making it appear like something out of the 70s; just another innovative technique he adds to the film. Enemy definitely isn't a movie for everyone. Some may feel that the head scratcher of an ending and unanswered questions just doesn't work. For others, myself included, Enemy is one of the smartest, most original films of the year and one that demands numerous viewings.",Enemy
378,garyalexander-14001,Trying to figure out what you just watched?,8,15 November 2020,"I have just finished my first viewing and have some thoughts for those who are trying to interpret what is going on. This is my guess and after some thought I think this really makes sense of the movie.I believe Adam Bell (the professor) is a made up personality of Anthony's (the actor). The movie is littered with clues throughout. I think Anthony desperately wants to be more than a third rate actor. His relationship with his pregnant wife is bad, she knows he's been cheating on her. When she goes to the school to see Adam she's disturbed almost to tears. This is not because he looks like her husband. Also, a pregnant woman isn't going to go across town over a strange guy calling her husband; no she went because she knows her husband is mental...that's why she was questioning him so much at home. She sees Adam at school and sits down next to him. Her husband doesn't recognize her...she's upset and the scene is tense because she now knows he's mental and faking being a teacher.More on Adam, at the beginning, he teaches the exact same class over and over, has the exact same sex with his girlfriend over and over...this is Anthony getting lost in his Adam character.The mom, Isabella Rossellini, is the key to understanding. She leaves Adam a message at the beginning that his apartment is crap and how could he live there. That is Adam's apartment...Anthony has taken to fake teaching and an apartment to research his character of Adam...mom's worried. Adam goes to the mom to tell her about his doppelgänger, and she tells him there is no other, she's the only mom, and he is the only son.The ending: Adam has now completely taken over Anthony's personality. He dreams up that Anthony will take Adam's girlfriend for the weekend...this is all in Adam's head as he kills off Anthony. And this leaves Adam to enter into Anthony's life. The big clue is when his wife asks him how school was today...she knows that her a-hole husband is mentally gone and is picking up on the vibe of Adam...she goes along with it and likes the Adam personality better than the personality of her husband Anthony. She also tells him to call his mom...this is the detail telling you Anthony has the same mom as Adam. The wife knows Anthony and Adam are the same person, and Adam doesn't know it.
At the end, the spider from his dreams eats his wife, this is Adam/Anthony realizing he's mental and lost all touch with reality.",Enemy
379,hendricksstephanie,Two movies in one!,8,14 February 2016,"This movie got me so excited that I had to sit down and write about it. It played like a really well-executed thriller... until the very last second. Up until the last second of the film, I thought, ""wow, cool take on an interesting concept; I'm looking forward to thinking more about it later."" When I saw the end, however, not only did my heart nearly jump out of my chest, but I knew that I had to learn more and think more deeply about the film. I realized that this movie is meant to be enjoyed both literally and figuratively. In the literal version, the professor lives at the end, and in the figurative one, he dies, literally. In the literal sense, everything that the audience sees does happen and, just as the professor double was actually a spider in human dress, so was the double's wife. And the double integrated into society in part by interacting with the real self's family as the real self. The car accident happens because the spiders are sensitive about appearing human and are unprepared for the intensity of actual human emotion. So when his date questions his manhood, he cannot handle the intense emotions and he loses control of the car and they both die. In the figurative sense, both men are actually the same man.The real person is the actor. He is feeling trapped by his marriage and by the mediocrity of his life and career as an actor. In his mind, he is being victimized by his wife and his life. So he attempts to escape by becoming a bookish, hot, professor with a hot girlfriend, who doesn't care about movies, and who is really deep with his knowledge about large world things like dictatorships and totalitarianism. This guy can escape anything no matter what. He takes on the professor character so deeply that he rents an apartment (but does not really furnish it because the deepest and realest part of himself knows it's a temporary situation) and gets a girlfriend who happens to look almost identically to his wife, but who likes the professor version of himself and who is not really interested in knowing who he really is deep down inside. This is why she runs when he is aggressive in bed (his real self cannot be hidden here). His wife finds out about her, which is why she keeps asking him if it is ""her"" when he is telling his wife adamantly on the phone in the motel scene that he is speaking to the guy that says he looks just like him. His adoption of this professor persona is so intense that he does not even recognize his own wife when he sees her at the school on the bench. She knows there is no other 'identical' person to her husband from the beginning and is wondering how crazy he has become. As for the real/fake self's professorship, the actor clearly, from conversation with his mother, has been extremely well-educated, so that job was not a challenge to get. But he is recognized from a movie by a co-worker and he finds the movie as if he has no idea about his alter ego. At his apartment later, he nonchalantly watches the movie, which is when, as his act, he sees his real self out in the real world, but he views his real self as an impostor he wants to confront.When he gets the 'confrontation', he realizes subconsciously that the professor is the fake and cannot withstand a confrontation with his real self, which is why the professor must leave quickly. It is when at some point he decides, as his real self, to go to the apartment where the fake self lives that he sees the professor's girlfriend and realizes that he wants to have sex with her as himself and not the professor. He tells the professor that this is how it is going to be, and the professor realizes during this conversation that, inherently, he cannot survive. And this feeling is confirmed by what his mother said earlier when she suggested that he give up that acting hobby. So the professor acquiesces as he must to his real self, and, in the process, takes on some of the characteristics of his real self, while his real self does the same with respect to the professor. This is where the statement about chaos and order at the beginning really matters because the reality/time-line is actually as follows: (1) sees mother after first confrontation with self and mother introduces idea that self and other are the same; (2) second visit with self and demand regarding sex with girlfriend from real self; (3) realization that professor loses but that he can incorporate some professor in real life; (4) goes home to wife as professor pretending to be himself (5) goes to the bedroom and sees her as the spider in the morning, or trap, but he is okay with it because he is finally ready to accept his life; (6) goes to show we see at beginning (7) he later goes out with the girlfriend as his real self pretending to be the professor; (8) she finds his real self to be super hot and sexy, but in seeing him really for the first time, she sees for the first time that he is also married; (9) she freaks out and questions his manhood in the car; and, sadly (10) because he is not ready to face personal criticism in his vulnerable state, he becomes uncontrollably angry, and they die. In the end, the web the real person tried to escape was escapable, but the web he created in deceit to himself and others was lethal and he had no idea.",Enemy
380,cchen-63362,A man find someone who looks just like him while watching a movie with his girlfriend and became obsessed to finding his double.,9,6 November 2016,"Enemy is one of the most unique film I seen.The shots were spectacular especially when trying to convey a message throughout the movie. I noticed how the shots were taken at the beginning of the movie which gives the audience a hint that something unusual were to happen. The lighting that were used for this film was somewhat dark and spooky in certain scenes to also hint out that this movie is strange, and different. Some shots I also noticed were slow paneling up shots that go into a scene that panel to another. Besides from the shots, some part of this movie that really make Enemy a great movie was the music. The music had a eerie feeling that were used throughout the movie, Enemy. In a particular scene, the audience would get a spooky feeling that foreshadow something evil would to happen any time soon. The movie, Enemy really did a great job at hinting something unexpected would to happen which really moved the story structure of the movie forward. Since the way the camera panel from a character to the other character. Enemy is a movie that I would recommend to be watch a few time to understand the overall meaning of the movie, Enemy. If you're interested in mystery, thrillers and a few disturbing scene in a interesting way this movie, Enemy would be perfect for you. Although, I expected this movie to be more scary but it was more creepy than scary which was something I disliked.

388,mattmanticello,Enemy Analysis,9,19 February 2020,"Whatever people says, I loved this movie. And it's important before arguing about it to set the record straight. Denis Villeneuve said that he was inspired by Mulholland Drive and 2001 A Space Odyssey for this movie. He also said that for him the Antony is the subconscious of Adam. Please note that I will use this information for my interpretation.Enemy, One of the best movie of Denis Villeneuve by far. Before talking interpretation let's talk about the movie itself. The 2 mains characters are played by 2 fantastic actors: Jake Gyllenhaal and Jake Gyllenhaal. This performance just adds this odd confusion into this atmosphere, atmosphere probably inspired by David Fincher, with a single yellow color pallet, non-contrasted and greyish. Denis Villeneuve managed to create a world within a world. We have many shots showing a huge city, a college, big districts, but with all of this we feel like we're alone, in the head of Adam, even when there's people in the background the focus stays on him. If he was truly alone it would have been the same.
The sound design is also a success, This Ambient noises and the continue oppressing soundtracks are putting us into his head, most of the shots are noiseless, or really low volume, but all of them are accompanied by these songs. The fact that these songs doesn't stops makes transitions between sequences, like it will never stop, everywhere he goes, he overthinks, always haunted by his issues. Obviously it is really well written, scenes are following each other's in a suspenseful way, giving hint more we advance in it.Now comes the interpretation. 2 Main protagonists are introduced, Adam and Anthony. As he said Anthony is the subconscious of Adam. But why?
Adam is frustrated by his life, at the beginning there's this succession of shots showing the actual routine of Adam: Giving classes, doing love, sleeping. In his classes he is talking about control and repetition. An easy way to control is by entertaining people and giving them bread. Or lowering the education, limiting culture. And everything is a cycle, even today it happens. By saying this, I think that he wants us to understand that Adam is oppressed by himself, his subconscious is the one he fears, because he has no control over it. He cannot escape his desire of infidelity, sex, famousness... Anthony is what he wishes he was, A famous actor, with a pregnant woman, great apartment, charismatic... Unfortunately, he is only a school teacher. Adam is cheating on his wife, with a mistress, he's going to strip club that relaxes him. So why is the strip club relaxing him?
It's time to talk about the spiders. I think that the spiders represent his fears, we see a spider after his mom called, we see a nude woman with a spider head (meaning that he fears his relationship with females in general). A spider got crushed by the strip club woman, and finally his wife is becoming a spider, and this very spider is afraid of Adam. This scene shows that Adam freaking his responsibility and that his wife is also worried about it, about the future of the son. The instability of Adam, she's aware of it, she said ""How was your classes"" means she know he's deranged.To accented this pressure on the character, many scenery hint are there, the wires above the road looks like spider web, the city is foggy, and the corridor he goes through everyday has fascist graffiti. As a fan of David Lynch, I can tell that this is a modern David lynch, a film that mingle your senses while keeping you tied to it. A film able to lost your mind but hold your attention.",Enemy

None of the characters reacted believably to most happenings, and the spider came across as a red herring to pass the buck onto the viewer to make sense of it all.The score was elegantly composed but used in a manner that lacked suspense. The editing was slow and overused long tired close-ups as a substitute for revealing anything.

399,d-schreier,Enlightenment rather than fun,9,15 June 2014,"Enemy by Denis Villeneuve is a depressing piece of art, which is not so much experimental as it might seem. Frankly, the plot is difficult to follow from its very beginning and it gets more and more complex as the story progresses. It is the last provoking shot where it all suddenly encloses and starts to make sense.Even though this piece doesn't battle for viewer's attention, it is worth watching the screen closely because everything then pays back; long after the credits are gone all connections begin to appear. There is a lot of junk in this world but this is luckily one of very rare exceptions, which goes its own distinctive way and makes every of its significant aspects work. The film concerns itself with a timeless issue: person's deep struggle of self-awareness. The more I am thinking about this topic, the less I can think of any other movie that goes into such depth of an ordinary life and succeeds so well. Unfortunately I doubt, but secretly hope, this movie will make it to a broader audience. From my point of view it deserves to be talked about and be taken an example from in terms of high quality filmography.If you are about to see this movie then I could only recommend to open your mind and accept all the fundamental questions rising from this remarkable piece of art because it faultlessly fulfills its purpose and hits back and hits hard.",Enemy

401,jovanovicslo,Psychological masterpiece - a movie for every man's mind.,9,28 April 2014,"First thing that came to mind about this movie is, how much it reminds me of Kubrick's: Eyes Wide Shut. It's surrealism, it's ambiance, atmosphere and the theme nonetheless. The movie is beautifully woven together into a magical and complete world of it's own. In which some people who saw the film lost themselves and found it frustrating, and others found a magical way of portraying the character's mind. I must admit, I am one of the latter.MY TAKE ON THE MOVIE:1. THEME: The man lost in a world of his own choices, his own desires and vices. A constant struggle in every man's life, mind, heart. A world in which every man watching it, realizes, it is he himself, who is his worst enemy. 2. CHARACTERS: It is one person and two faces of the same man, as the poster itself portrays. The story itself tells you that in the scar aspect of the confrontation, where there is no doubt that they are no twins, that there is no way of thinking it can be a different person. Also his mother tells him to ""stop dreaming about that acting hobby of yours"". 3. ""REALITY"": What people watching want to do first, is construct a realistic world of it. And it's not. Watch it as a dream. Plenty of those tips and leads are left by the director to take you there (note for example the giant spiders strutting about the city landscape, the photography of the movie, etc.).4. STORY: The beginning of the movie shows a pregnant wife, that of a man (both men/main characters)! It is a part of him that wants to escape. That webbed, trapped part and therefore create an alter ego, another self in which he can try to live out a different reality. A reality of a free sexual drive and ego. A reality without his wife. And in that urge and desire, the visuals of a crushed spider is always appear. (spiders being a symbol of his wife and the symbol of his relationship and commitment). Therefore the teacher part is that part in which he can freely cheat on the wife. Note that the teacher's girlfriend is always leaving him in the middle of the night, never staying for the night. There is also mention of his cheating by his wife, when she asks him ""you're seeing her again, aren't you"", after he was on the phone.He can be a free man without any guilt, but with that also comes the aftermath of such a life, no real purpose in his life, no satisfaction (his appearance and his almost depressed psychological state portray this part). His apartment also tells the story of this, empty, unfurnished, almost as a hotel room, just a usable space.So his free, able to cheat part is seeking something more in life, someone that he can relate to, in effect, seeking his other self's wife and life. And the other part of him, married and bound is searching for the sexual adventures, ego and freedom. That's why the switch comes to place.In the end, as one part of a man dies, the other is left with a ""chosen reality"". A choice every man has to make. He makes love to his wife, takes the place of a married man, and becomes solely that. And with that, he chose to confront the spider that is his commitment and his wife. But the lure of the key left behind is always there...",Enemy
402,RoyFilmgeek,What!?,6,23 May 2014,"It took a while to get into the film. I eventually liked the atmosphere and was intrigued by the story. However I would have liked to have seen where the plot had led us instead of the vague and sudden ending. Perhaps I'm just not susceptible for its subtlety. For instance what was the thing with the spiders!? Lighting and settings were artsy but a bit depressing at times. I considered pulling the plug after a couple of minutes due to the tone. Jake's performance was as good as always. I still don't know if he was schizo or if he has a twin brother. I rated this movie 6 out of 10 stars, because even though it started out slow and depressing, once Jake's character finds out about his doubleganger the plot gets interesting.

405,earnest967,"""Enemy"" - Remarkable, Mysterious, Provocative",9,31 May 2014,"A previous review by Andrew Ellington has thoughts about ""Enemy"" that echo my own. Ellington's incisive observations about ""...the struggle for self-identity..."" are, I believe, the key to the power of the film. I am reminded of ""Fight Club,"" another film which has that same issue at its center. And, of course, the parallels to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" resonate as well. There is exceptionally fine work by Jake Gyllenhaal (always an extraordinary actor in both drama and comedy), Sarah Gadon (her intensity is remarkable), and director Denis Villeneuve.But the most compelling aspects of the film for me were threefold: the extraordinary music by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans, a spare, evocative score that deepens the mystery of the narrative; the hauntingly somber grayish-yellow cinematography by Nicolas Bolduc; and the exquisitely paced editing by Matthew Hannam. For those viewers who urgently ask for an 'explanation' of the last scene, I suggest that they are asking the wrong question. A more appropriate question is ""how does the final scene magnify the emotional and dramatic values we've been experiencing throughout the film?"" The question can only be answered by each individual viewer, or not at all.But for me, the impact of the last scene is not about WHAT Adam/Anthony sees in the bedroom, but the final shot itself: his REACTION to what he sees. He doesn't look terrified. Rather, he looks bewildered, baffled, and puzzled, with even a trace of disappointment and sadness in his expression. It's a stunning piece of non-verbal communication from Gyllenhaal.John David Earnest",Enemy
406,dawglet,The True Epic Movie,9,8 November 2014,"If you're as much of a film enthusiast as I am than I'm sure that you're familiar with Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's 2007 blockbuster comedy Epic Movie. Well I've got something to tell you fellow cinema heads, Epic Movie is unfortunately not the true epic movie. Denis Villeneuve's Enemy is undoubtedly the purest form of the Epic Movie and I hold a very strong belief that Villeneuve would of titled this film Epic Movie if it wasn't already taken. Jake Gyllenhaal vastly out performs the entire cast of Epic Movie and for that reason alone it easily cements its place as the superior Epic Movie. This is a truly epic movie that has numerous epic elements such as a spiders and a very thematically dense plot told in a non linear style that I personally enjoyed very much. If there is any negative aspect to this film it is that it is a very easy film for not smart people to hate and if you're not smart you probably won't like this film. I however enjoy this aspect because it works as a great tool for alerting myself to the friends I have that are actually undesirables. So in closing Denis Villeneuve's Enemy is a very epic film and if you meet anyone that says otherwise I would highly recommend you remove them from your life.",Enemy

I read the book a few years ago and when I finished reading it I thought it would make a great movie. How disappointed! Saramago probably rolled over in his grave! The only thing that reminds the book is the duplicated man - that's all! Nothing else resembles the complexity and intensity of the book. I liked the leading actor though. He was really good. What was that with a stupid spider?? What about that Antony's ""second hidden life""?? I had the feeling they wanted the viewers to think that they were actually the same person. Is that it? Was Antony supposed to be Adam's alter-ego?? That has absolutely nothing to do with Saramago's book. If you, like me, want to watch this movie because you loved the book, just don't.

It's the attention to detail that the director clearly has thought of. Yes the battle is all in his mind but it makes you really think "" what is going on here?

It is one of those that someone wants to see again and again, in order to explain and connect every word said and every scene watched. It is a real piece of art. Hidden messages are all over the movie. The director, using this greenish film, makes you concentrate not in what you actually see, but in what you are supposed to see in the film. My husband and I were analyzing the film for some time after the film. We both understood from the beginning that both men are the same person. The puzzling thing was the sequence of events and what exactly spiders represented. I initially thought that he was a married actor that he disliked his life with his pregnant wife. Therefore he left her (cut photo) and lead another life (teacher). His lectures led me to hypothesize that its a net of society, that made him have a routine in his life (teaching, home, girlfriend), he did not want. When he decided to go back to his wife, he felt again trapped besides the ""spider"". But no. That is not exactly what the movie says. Finally, I concluded to the notion that spiders are the women in his life. The man feels trapped among women. Whatever he does, married to the pregnant, or having an affair with the girl or leaving the girl to return to his wife, he is always besides a spider, which becomes bigger and bigger and traps him in her web. Congratulation! Excellent script, excellent job of the director and the actors. It is a must see, if you like this kind of psychological thrillers.",Enemy
411,lakota_cetan,amazing,8,25 February 2015,"Another 2013 Canadian gem, a psychological thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve. The screenplay was very loosely adapted by Javier Gullón from José Saramago's 2002 novel The Double, and it was an interesting approach to the story. I have some objections to details but, they were nothing major. Jake Gyllenhaal has two characters, which he did professionally enough, as well as his co-stars Mélanie Laurent, Isabella Rossellini, Sarah Gadon, Stephen R. Hart, and Jane Moffat. This film was screened in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, and earned five Canadian Screen Awards; Best Director for Villeneuve, as well as a Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role and Best Picture. Rules in Canada!Very good cinematography by Nicholas Bolduc starts from the first moments when we are confronted with a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) attending underground club erotic show and later switching to a gorgeous shot of a pregnant young woman sits on a bed, alone. Mystery starts from that moment and suspense last to the last shot! The movie starts with an opening line ""Chaos is order yet enciphered"" which is from the José Saramago's novel The Double. It is interesting that according to Slate, the Enemy is ""a parable about what it's like to live under a totalitarian state without knowing it."" Important issue for the United States and the neighbors are catching fast on it, as well! Enemy suggests that this tendency to create totalitarian regimes is part of human nature (ask Obama, Bush, Clinton...), that it comes from within us. Director Villeneuve said, ""Sometimes you have compulsions that you can't control coming from the subconscious ... they are the dictator inside ourselves.""Unusually satisfactory!",Enemy
412,fbarok5,A psychological thriller like I haven't seen in a while...,8,29 May 2014,"First of all, Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. Incendies and Prisoners were very impressive, with well-written and hard to predict plots and I also liked Polytechnique and my other reason to watch this movie was the fact that it was based in a Saramago's book, writer that Portuguese students have to read in High School. This writer already have a great adaption of one of his books: Blindness, while he was still alive.The movie reminds me of Fight Club, The Machinist and Mulholand Drive, the difference between this film and the first two is that the director doesn't spoon you the ""solution"" of the plot, and therefore, there aren't the variety of interpretation that see about this film, Enemy, and Mulholand Drive for example.The film has a depressing and haunting atmosphere most of the time, which is reinforced by the yellow tint in the photography of the film and Adam's anxiety and confusion, that can be boring if you're used to blockbusters and mainstream movies and you have to watch the film with a lot of attention to the characters behavior and dialog. But even if you pay attention you might be ""mislead"", like I did, to a different conclusion.To finish my first film review, I gave a 8/10 score, because it's a great film that I enjoyed watching very much, even if I prefer Incendies and Prisoners over this one, but still a very complex and provocative exercise by the director that everyone that enjoyed watching The Machinist, Mulholand Drive and any other psychological thriller will enjoy too.",Enemy
413,njwhiffin,"Tense acting, camera work and situations provide for an enticing experience.",8,14 December 2014,"To start, Enemy had my attention for the whole span. Right from the start a black and twisted scene draws you in, only to try to force your now tensely contorted frame of mind back into the mold of an ordinary day-in, day-out monotonous business life. Obviously, this doesn't work, and that is Villeneuve's intention. With a clinging fog now cast over the true plot, even the life-lamenting depression characterizing Adam's days becomes a little more sickening. And yet, we find some release just as he does in the passionate sex scenes that provide us the only warmth in that grey world.This intensity persists for the whole movie, through the protagonist's discovery and his treatment of it. Gyllenhaal shows us the precipice between stability and insanity, deploying short breath and shaky hands, as well as dreams akin to those of Will from the Hannibal series that make us question reality. This also hearkens back to the dream-reality friction we find in Inception.Lastly, the camera work is full of hard lines and grey colouration(don't know what's that called) that put a nicely dark, ambiguous and 'sketchy' cast on the movie's events. This nicely sums up the mood of the movie. I would recommend it for those looking for a tense experience and a worthy ending.",Enemy
414,carolesaylor,Where to begin,1,8 March 2015,"I understand movies can sometimes be dark and dreary. But listless, boring, and boring, and, did I say boring, should not accompany those two adjectives. However, this movie was certainly all those things. I kept watching, waiting for it to get interesting but it never did. This was 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. There was no reason for the man to try to contact this look-alike actor, so what was the reason? None given. And then why would the actor care about meeting the other guy? No answer given. There were too many non-answers in the movie. I know of two other people who are supposedly dead-ringers for me but I haven't tried to contact them. So right off the bat, the movie didn't have a reason for being.If you like a movie that leaves you with more questions than answers you might like the movie. But did I mention it was boring? I couldn't tell if it was the original book, the screen play, the directing, or the acting, or maybe all of the above that was terrible.I think to hook an audience the movie has to give you something to care about and then it should tie up the loose ends for you, or at least provide enough clues that you can imagine ways to tie up the loose ends. This movie did not do that. The most interesting part was why the two guys had the same scar. However, that wasn't worth 90 minutes of your life and then to not get an answer.

418,mmmorgan1960,Worth seeing but a little pretentious,7,18 November 2014,"Not a bad film but not particularly accessible to the average audience. Having read a synopsis of the book, I wondered what was the point of the changes. The book's ending seemed much more interesting. (I won't spoil that here.)I got the feeling that the script writer added his own tweaks, just to make the film seem deeper (and pretentious) than it was. Same with the weird parts about the secret spider porn and the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" type nonsense. Loved Isabella Rossellini as always. She was really the only plausible character in the film.Of course, Jake Gyllenhaal is always nice to look at but he generally suffers from the ""look, ma. I'm acting. Watch me!"" syndrome. When coupled with the moody music, the dreamy (and unexplained) clips= eegads, aliens in the motel corridors!-, the futuristic backdrops, the flatness of the colors and the minimalist dialog, it all reminds one of the bright kid in art class who keeps trying to get recognized. Basically it is trying to hard to be something it's not. Anyway, I am too practical. I kept wondering why, if the history professor wanted to put a quick end to the charade, he didn't simply shave his beard in front of his girlfriend without telling the dopey doppelganger. Say as soon as he realized that the twin was a naughty boy. (Of course, if the theories that there was only one of them are true, then all that logical stuff goes out the window.)",Enemy

426,raisingparanoia,ill explain enemy for everyone,9,3 March 2014,"nobody seems to understand enemy, I loved the movie personally and you understand it if you watch it twice and pay attention.okay ill try to explain it, it is about one man fighting with himself , while it is portrayed as two people (Anthony/Daniel and Adam) only one of them is real, and its Adam, I know this because in the beginning on the phone his mother is speaking and says ""Adam honey"" and also later on in the movie his mother also tells Adam (who is not an actor) to give up his dreams of being a third rate actor. now the story of this movie is hard to understand , its about Adam and Helens marriage and the remaining spark of an old affair, in the beginning you see it open with Jake Gyllenhaal in what is presumably a strip club, eventually you see a woman come out and step on a spider, the woman is Mary, Adam's affair , after that it opens to Adam sitting in his car as you hear his mother leave a voice mail for him. Throughout the movie you see spiders, spiders represent his affair with Mary, and how he still thinks about it, and when you see Adam with Mary he really isn't its just representing his still lasting feelings for her. you see when Adam calls Anthony it really wasn't Adam, it never happened, the whole phone call scene was his imagination, helping him realize he needs to forget about Mary. I'm gonna skip a bunch of unimportant things and try to go as chronologically as I can. At the point where Anthony tells Adam hes going to have sex with his girlfriend , that's really just Adam thinking to himself about him needing to get rid of Anthony and the memories of Mary. so when Anthony goes and takes Mary out that doesn't really happen. whats happening is Adam is thinking that up to help in the getting rid of memories, it is also revealed that Adam is the real person when Adam and Helen lay down and Helen asks how was school . the scene of Mary and Anthony having sex and Mary freaking out is Adam realizing he is married and needs to get rid of the memories, when Anthony and Mary crash the car it is Adam killing off the memories , squashing the spider per Se , this is supported when it zooms in on the crashed cars window the crack looks like a spiderweb, when Adam wakes up the radio speaks of a car crash but it says no details so It is likely that was just chance. also Helen reminds him about his mother calling him, which you should remember from the beginning of the movie. when Adam opens the letter and gets the key, it is a key to the strip club place, and he says to Helen he might have to go somewhere tonight. he goes to look at her and she is a huge spider, this represents how him going to the strip club would bring back the spider. during the movie the spider gets gradually bigger until it is huge and he cannot get it off his mind. so I hope I've explained well enough to help you understand what an amazing movie this truly is.",Enemy

Exactly. Of course, he can't resist getting in touch with him, and of course that's where trouble begins.Its twisted plot, visual features and philosophical themes have earned it a ""what the heck"" fame.This movie is total chaos.This is me trying to decipher it.NOTE: This is just a summary, for my full review please visit: bit.ly/1eVEtD6Adam and Anthony are two sides of the same person.This is a man who feels trapped by his present as a boring, married, college professor about to become a father. He remembers his old dreams of youth (being an actor, having a cool bike, being a ""man""). Spiders in the movie represent the ""woman as a trap"" in his mind, commitment that represses his individuality.He gets carried away and leaves her wife and life for an adventure with another woman. This is represented by the initial private club scene where a stripper (his instinct) crushes a spider (the burden of his marriage and child).He lives as an empty shell during this affair (memories stuffed in boxes in the back of his mind, torn pictures of his past representing the disconnect from his wife).He reminisces of his old life (represented as his finding and research of his doppelgänger and his household). He does not like what he sees when he discovers his impulsive self. We learn he left aside his dreams for his wife (six months without visiting the acting agency, six months pregnant).He is reminded by his mother (his conscience) of what really matters and what he has. Finally, he decides to return to his wife after an internal struggle where his instincts and his sense of responsibility fight to death. This death of his passionate, independent self is depicted literally as a car crash that kills his desire and ends with the close-up of a spider-web. He is trapped again.His responsible self has dominated. But he is bound to make the same mistakes all over again. He finds and decides to use the key to the private club, darker desires come back to haunt him. And the cycle starts over again, in Hegelian form, repressing the self for the collectivism.",Enemy

436,sayantani28,Come with An Open Mind. Decipher.,9,13 May 2014,"'Enemy'. The Enemy Within? Or The Unseen Enemy? You cannot possibly pick one interpretation and stick with it. More than a narrative, Enemy is a puzzle begging to be solved.I will thus not recommend this movie to anyone who does not come with an open mind. You may think that the narrator is being cryptic for the sole purpose of projecting a superior intellect, which he might as well have done. No one can be certain of the ulterior motives of the narrator. I loved the movie, more so because it seemed to me like an honest narration of a complex idea. Besides, there is a 'promise' and an 'antithesis' that the storytellers have delivered on.Promise : Chaos is Order yet Undeciphered (by a Lesser Mind)The seemingly erratic storyline coupled with outright crazy renditions seem like the product of a mind on acid. But to the one who sees through the mundane, a perfectly meaningful tale, of a man having a mid life crisis, emerges. When the pieces fit, it's brilliance.Antithesis : Why Must the Ending Have All Answers?This happened, then that happened and then that happened. No, not really. The order of events is not linear. They give you answers first and raise questions later. Time does not pass in a modulated flow. One might argue that the narration has an upside down inside out timeline. While, I am certain all of these narration styles have been tried by Storytellers before but the execution in this one made perfect sense.",Enemy

447,daycaesar,I'm not getting it.,5,31 August 2014,"Spoiler alert. Maybe I guess.I enjoyed the acting. The ring and the ring mark I think is the key to the movie. And I cannot figure it out. The director, I believe, purposely shows Jake's left hand throughout the movie to show the ring, the ring mark or the lack of a ring and the lack of a mark.Unless we are looking at several years here I don't get it.The end of the movie is close to the beginning because the doorman says he enjoyed himself the 'other night'. To me that is less than a week and probably just a few days. So we know that a few days prior Anthony was wearing a ring but there is no ring mark on Adam's ring finger when he sees the doorman. The director seems to purposely show the ring finger. No mark.The news of the accident on the radio was a cheap trick especially since the details were exactly the same as the accident that Anthony was in and of course the scene comes right after the accident. I thought maybe M Night Shyamalan might have been directing there for a moment. The phone call from his wife as he disappears behind the wall was pretty quick. So quick I didn't think he could really answer it unless he had his phone out. Another trick in my book but OK, its possible.To me the movie keeps purposely mislead the viewer. The spider metaphor I still don't fully understand. For me spiders have traditionally been viewed as fear-inducing. Here however, in the final scene, the spider is scared. So obviously he is not scared of something that is frightened of him. I get that she realizes that he is going back to the weird sex club again and that he has changed back into a non-family man. But I would think that would make her attack. And I guess she didn't know he was at the club just a few days before.And when he picks the key up I thought there was a pretty long time period that had passed but it was only a couple of days.I guess the other professor who recommended the movie was a figment of his imagination because it seems unlikely that he would recommend a movie that he was actually in.But this is weird too because this is around the time that he places the torn photo of himself up to the computer screen to compare himself with Anthony. But in the last scene the photo is not torn and in a frame. There could be two photos but that would be lame in my opinion.So it appears that most of the movie is after he has left his wife (sometime around the final scene) because there is absolutely no ring mark on Adam's hand. But in the final scene you are led to believe that he is remembering the car accident but it couldn't have happened yet because the interaction we see with Mary is after they (his wife and he) split. But this is weird too because Mary freaks out BECAUSE of the ring mark. And the director purposely showed that it was a struggle to get the ring off. To me that is trying to show that he has been wearing the wring a long time. And then of course Mary asks ""Who are you?"" But not in a ""dude, you've changed"" kind of way but in a you are a complete stranger to me that is pretending to be my boyfriend kind of way. When he is speaking to his mom and she calls him... what... how does he answer? That's not my name mom or does he assume the other character?Anyone have any answers?",Enemy

The movie takes a beating kind of rhythm to get there before the revelatory end. I've read some of the psycho intellectual interpretations below and kudos to the authors for deciphering the basic plot. I however cannot put this into a ' masterpiece' class. There are too many holes. The film starts with a recorded telephone message from Mother. And another later on. Contained in these messages is the key to the truth, explained in detail by the plot theorists below. However what hasn't been explained and isn't by anybody is that Mother during her second phone message says thank you for letting me visit your apartment and how could you live in that? This doesn't support the thesis that the doppelgängers are relally the same but divided person. If the reality is Helen and Adam and their life, they live in an elegant and quite classy though sterile apartment. This does not fit with mothers message. Her remarks about the apartment seem to be referring to the empty bachelor nest which is dark and depressing and belong to the invented bachelor part of the lead character. How does mother get access to the invented part of her sons life? I think this is what confused me as I was on the schitso track till then. Still good there are good performances, though I found the script clunky and indulged in the nowadays popular script device- the extended and nauseatingly long dialogue 'pause' which frustrated this viewer. A lot of contemporary directors favour 'the pause' . You'd never see Hitchcock or De Palmer reach for this pseudo intellectual arty device.",Enemy

462,vadxxx-26555,Enemy,10,18 April 2017,"Richard Ayoade last year showed how to extract dark comedy from the doppelganger theme in his version of Dostoyevsky's The Double; Canadian film-maker Denis Villeneuve's emphasis is on neurosis and fear with this adaptation of José Saramago's 2002 novel O Homem Duplicado: The Duplicated Man. He brings a formidable atmosphere and control to this intriguing, disquieting film: the double theme is a notorious film-school cliché, and using the same actor in two roles can be a lazy shortcut to the uncanny. But Villeneuve's film earns its anxiety. Jake Gyllenhaal gives the dual performance: a depressed history lecturer in Toronto who one night watches a movie and glimpses an actor who appears to be his exact duplicate. He seeks out this mirror image; their encounter gives rise to hostility, terror, a kind of mutually agreed nervous breakdown, but a thrilling sense of possibility, an escape from the prison house of individuality. There is something of David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers here – maybe even a touch of Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train. There are coolly effective moments when Villeneuve declines to make it clear which double we are watching and whose memories and fears we are experiencing. The final shot is bizarre.

Based on Saramago's The Double, this movie explores the daily life and misadventure of a jaded history teacher. The emotional arc of the movie starts out rather weak, with Gyllenhall in a sex club with tarantulas. This dark-for-its-own-sake pretentiousness, along with the moody lighting and disquieting soundtrack seem to over-dramatize an otherwise uneventful setting. As the movie continues, though, the twists and turns lead to a cohesive atmosphere, sinister notions, interesting dilemmas, and most importantly compelling characters. When you ask ""why did this character do/think this,"" it makes sense, rather than being explained by some plot device like mind control/psychopathy/madness.

Isn't she in their own house? 3) When the teacher Jake discovers his look-alike, wouldn't a person ask that question to their mother first before going on a spying spree on the look-alike? The mother is informed way later after their meetings and conversations. 4) How can the mother just calmly discard the fact that her son has an exact look-alike? When teacher Jake informs her, she doesn't even bother to get the details of the other person from the teacher Jake (even though she thinks she knows that she gave birth to one kid only). Instead she just dismisses it casually that it's not possible. Wouldn't she even be curious to know?5) Why was Mary traveling in the same car with actor Jake after she discovered that it was not the same person? Wouldn't she just take a cab or something else instead of traveling with a stranger especially once she knew?While watching this movie, it feels like watching a regular horror movie where they are almost forcing themselves not to do the obvious in order to create an illusion of a thriller. Jake is fantastic in this movie though.",Enemy
