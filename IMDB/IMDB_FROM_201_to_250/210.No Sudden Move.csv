0,SnoopyStyle,Soderbergh and big stars,5,10 July 2021,"It's 1954 Detroit. Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle), Ronald Russo (Benicio Del Toro), and Charley (Kieran Culkin) are killers hired for an easy three hour job. They are to babysit a woman and her kids while her husband Matt Wertz (David Harbour) is forced to retrieve a document.Director Steven Soderbergh gives me a monotone feel with this movie and it really grinds me down. The music is all smoky slow jazz or no music at all. Everyone is talking in a monotone. I actually really love the first thirty minutes with this caliber of big stars doing a gangster movie but Soderbergh's deliberate visual moves and tone really saps away the intensity.There is also something about the ultimate premise which is very annoying. It comes late in the movie and Soderbergh wants to tell us all about it in the closing text. It finally occurs to me that this is a high concept premise from somebody who had this idea after smoking some weed and listening to a paranoid conspiracy theory. It's the last straw for me.",No Sudden Move
1,Prismark10,No Sudden Move,6,7 July 2021,"Steven Soderbergh has turned his back on big budget movies. He now wants to make something more personal, idiosyncratic and still attract a starry cast.No Sudden Move has crooks crossing each other to the Nth degree. It also takes potshots at the automobile industry and their attitude to environmentalism.Set in Detroit in 1955. Curt Goynes (Don Cheadle) is a hood fresh out of prison and offered an easy job. Big money for just a few hours work by a shifty man called Jones (Brendan Fraser.)Curt and two other men. Ronald (Benicio del Toro) and Charley (Kieran Culkin) need to burst into the house of Matt Wertz (David Harbour.) They will then watch over his family as Matt is taken to his office where he must retrieve an important document from his boss's safe.The easy job goes south very quickly. Both Curt and Ronald though find a way to stay ahead and make money out of it. It is just a case of who to trust as everyone has something to hide or an angle.Matt for example is having an affair with his boss's secretary. Curt has upset a lot of major people who want revenge against him. Ronald is having an affair with a gangster's wife. Nothing is what it seems.By the end you just know no one is going to end up with what they are after. It becomes the film's weakness as it gets too convoluted as more characters are introduced. Although one character who mentions he cannot stop making money turns out to be absolutely correct. He ends up with more money even though he was the one being blackmailed.Soderbergh has gone for a lo fi approach. Some scenes look slightly off with its fisheye lens. One thing is for sure Brendan Fraser looks even more porkier because of it.",No Sudden Move
2,nogodnomasters,Sometimes things get sloppy,5,6 July 2021,"The film uses (PLOT SPOILER) the suppression of the catalytic converter by the auto industry as a back story. In Detroit 1954, three men are to ""babysit"" a family while dad breaks into his boss's safe to get documents, documents that have been removed.The plot is rather jerky in how it moves taking enjoyment out of the feature. It s always nice to see Ray Liotta get beat up. Matt Damon in an uncredited role explains the workings of the world.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",No Sudden Move
3,classicsoncall,"""You're pushing more than numbers now, big guy.""",8,3 July 2021,"I was a little dismayed when the first dozen or so reviews I read here on IMDb were negative with one and two star ratings, but felt better when I pulled up the ones who liked it. I mean, what's not to like? The cast is first rate and the story line is filled with double and triple crosses that keep the viewer guessing about who the real bad, bad guys are. My guess once again, is that those with short attention spans give up after the first fifteen minutes and decide it's too difficult to follow. Not only is the cast great, but they suit their roles perfectly in a gangster flick that has elements of a heist movie, with the grand prize oddly enough, a mock up of a catalytic converter that would revolutionize the auto industry but for it's threat to the profitability of the era's vehicles. The title of the film is appropriate, save for the fact that even the most well thought out plans by the lower level gangsters turn to naught. Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro do the heavy lifting to carry the story forward with Jon Hamm and Julia Fox in surprising turns with their characters. And if I've never seen Brendan Fraser play the role of a heavy before, he does it here in more ways than one.",No Sudden Move
4,lee_eisenberg,I bet most people didn't know the story of the catalytic converter,8,6 October 2021,"I sure didn't. Not that I'm surprised. When have corporations cared about the public good over profits?But anyway, Steven Soderbergh continues to prove himself an outstanding director with ""No Sudden Move"". Throughout much of the movie, you could cut the tension with a knife.The cast includes Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, David Harbour, Jon Hamm, Brendan Fraser, Ray Liotta and Matt Damon (in other words, Paul Rusesabagina, Che Guevara, Chief Hopper, Don Draper, Encino Man, Henry Hill and Will Hunting).",No Sudden Move
5,bombersflyup,Nope.,2,2 July 2021,"No Sudden Move is a convoluted mess of a film and not compelling.Some quality actors here that I love, but given roles that don't suit and certainly not together. Fraser and Duke in particular, woeful. Damon's minor role to the contrary.",No Sudden Move
6,deloudelouvain,Good actors but a very messy story.,5,27 July 2021,"The thing with Steven Soderbergh is that you're not sure what you're going to get. Sometimes it's very good ( like The Knick, The Report, or Traffic) but on a rare occasion it can also be pretty mediocre or even really bad (like Schizopolis). No Sudden Move has a very good cast. All actors that know what they're doing so that wasn't the problem. The problem was the story. It's a complete mess, with so many twists and turns that nobody with a sane mind can understand anything about the plot. I don't know what Soderbergh was thinking. It's all much too complicated to be a good movie. It's all shot well, all acted well, but if the plot doesn't make much sense it loses all credibility. Too bad because Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle did a very good job, even with a plot that they probably didn't understand themselves. Maybe you need to watch the movie two or three times to understand everything but that seems too much of a hassle to me. I'll just wait for a better movie from Soderbergh.",No Sudden Move
7,siderite,Stellar cast and director going nowhere,7,7 July 2021,"This is a heist movie. For any heist movie, you're better off just re-watching ""One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty"". The genre is formulaic by design, often involves a cast of very well known people and movies in it should be performance pieces. I mean, no one cares about the loot or what happens in the end, they just want to be entertained by the loops and twists of the story and the way actors make you care about their characters. And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It's not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was ""inspired"" from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean's N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can't recommend it yet I can't say it was a bad movie. It was just... uninteresting.",No Sudden Move
8,ksf-2,pretty good but LONG..,7,20 August 2021,"Some pretty big names... Don Cheadle, del Toro, Matt Damon, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm. Director Soderbergh had worked with del Toro on Traffic, which is also where Soder won his oscar. I'm not familiar with Craig Grant, (Jimmy), but apparently he passed away in March of diabetes, even before this film was released. In the story, a group of guys has been hired to get a document at dad's office. But first, they stop at his family's house to hold them hostage. It's filmed in very dark light, so we miss a lot of what's going on. Very confusing. Things go massively wrong, of course, and now we watch the fall out. It's a period piece.. .the cars are from the 1950s or 1960s. This goes kind of like a Coen brothers. Dead bodies pile up. But there was an original plan that went very bad. Hamm is Finney the cop, trying to sort out what really happened at the family's house. About halfway through, we find out what they are all really after. And now and then they share a few more details. It's good, but it's overly complicated. Kind of goes on extra long. Written by Ed Solomon.",No Sudden Move
9,Cineanalyst,Rear-View Mirror,7,4 July 2021,"I was going to pan ""No Sudden Move,"" not for its contrived con or heist plotting--this being the umpteenth or whatever caper flick by Steven Soderbergh, but for its contrived stylistic choices. Upon reflection, however, and while I still think it doesn't look very good, I appreciate the felicitous symmetry of narrative and style here. Besides Soderbergh seeing other heist flicks such as, say, ""Widows"" (2018), ""Triple Frontier"" (2019), ""Da 5 Bloods"" (2020), and, perhaps, thinking he, too, should make his heists historically and socially conscious--what with the 1954 setting here and addressing issues of race, urban renewal and car monopolies polluting--it's a modern eye looking back at a period piece. It's distinctly shot with a modern eye, too, as Soderbergh has taken to using a phone camera. The extreme wide-angle lenses, as well, don't just resemble a mislocated Chicago Bean, or Cloud Gate, obscuring the period details of the picture, or offering the paradox of a narrative full of conniving crooks, doubles crosses and switcheroos while photographically there are few angles being played; it's the convex nature of automobile rearview mirrors, thus echoing the story set in America's car capital, or at least what used to be such. I'm not sure what the title, ""No Sudden Move,"" has to do with it, but at least all of the above may be argued to have a purpose.It also works for how these con/heist plots usually work, where information is withheld as we look forward and only begin to make sense in the end, if even then, as we look back and consider that objects may've appeared differently than where they actually were. Sure, the cast is stellar as usual, some of the talk-heavy set pieces are quite enjoyable in themselves, and there's some fun merely in watching all the pieces being moved--and transparently so for our entertainment, but oddly enough I especially admire how well the things I otherwise find garish--the phone camera fish-eye lenses and trying to make one of the most frivolous genres into social-problem dramas--work cohesively well in this case.",No Sudden Move
10,ops-52535,a historical document...,6,1 July 2021,"About a document, or the document that everyone wants, everyone kinda gets hold on but nobody had the benefit from for years to come. Its also a mobster crime story from the heartland u.s., with corruption and wargames like hide and seek, with some extended version of extortion at a human and not to grotesque violence level, that everyone may look at but made in a way thats very easy to loose attention to, but very well mended by the props and decoration departments that has made this like a back to the future experience to watch on the screen.The cast is fat on experienced actors, several hundred years of experience that is, and i must say that i had expected even more from them and mr soderbergh too. The easy switches and flips comes like a jesters joker, and the plotspeed are durably slow at moments, just like this review. So no more than a 6 stars from the grumpy old man, its well crafted by the whole production crew, but the thrilling thriller do lack some bait. A small recommend only but a film that you might wanna see due to the big drought of super blockbusters made lately...",No Sudden Move
11,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting movie...,6,3 November 2021,"""No Sudden Move"" is a Crime - Mystery movie in which we watch a group of criminals working together to find out the real purpose of their hiring and who is behind it. They have to work together and try not to fail otherwise there is no return.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was happily surprised by it. It had a mysterious and really interesting plot through the whole duration of the movie and the interpretations of the cast helped on that. The direction which was made by Steven Soderbergh was very good and he created a mysterious atmosphere in his movie while his main characters did their best in order to present the plot. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Don Cheadle who played as Curt Goynes and Benicio Del Toro who played as Ronald Russo were absolutely outstanding and they both made the difference. All in all, I have to say that ""No Sudden Move"" is a huge surprise and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it.",No Sudden Move
12,cruise01,Great cast ensemble but boring script and film making it a waste,4,27 August 2021,2 out of 5 stars.No Sudden Move is a bad crime thriller film. That packs a big star power cast.

13,eddie_baggins,A mid-tier crime film,6,23 September 2021,"Continuing on his return from what must surely go down as one of the shortest retirements in Hollywood history, Oscar winning director Steven Soderbergh is back to the crime genre his known so well throughout his career with the likes of the Oceans trilogy, Traffic and Logan Lucky with his new star-studded vehicle No Sudden Move, a direct to HBO Max feature that is easy to watch without ever becoming the riveting outing it thinks itself to be.Without question better than Soderbergh's previous efforts such as the diabolical Unsane and the barely noted streaming efforts such as High Flying Bird, The Laundromat and Let Them All Talk, Move is a quick moving affair that is shot in a bizarre fish eye like manner thanks to extra long lenses (a distracting way too have filmed this talk heavy affair) as we follow low end rent a criminals Curt Goynes and Ronald Russo (Done Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro) as they navigate a complicated job that goes south very quickly in Detroit of the 1950's.Not bothering with much in the way of set-up or exposition as we get introduced to Goynes and Russo accepting a job off Brendan Fraser's organiser Doug Jones, Move gets stuck into things without a fuss or worry but the travails of these two shady figures isn't always engaging enough to hold our interest, even if a late act play about what's really going on and what lays at the heart of the job at hand makes things far more interesting in the grand scheme of things, making one wish Soderbergh had allowed this too play out a little earlier to help overcome the films hump in its middle act after a solid home hold-up start.As is usually the case with a Soderbergh film in this genre, the films dialogue and delivery from a name brand cast ensures this small-scale film feels larger and more prestigious than it perhaps ought to feel like and having been long term servants of Soderbergh projects, Cheadle and Del Toro are as solid as ever as two rather generic central figures with lot of joy to be had in the supporting turns from the likes of Fraser, Ray Liotta, David Harbour and a surprise cameo from someone that may not in fact be such a surprise on second thought.Capturing the time and place of 1950's Detroit well and ensuring things keep moving even when not a whole lot is happening, Move is a polished middle of the road effort from Soderbergh but one still wonders what the whole point of his return from retirement is if his films continue to be of this generic nature, even if the technical aspects of them feel as though they're an excuse for a creative to try and find the next best thing.Final Say -Not always thrilling, No Sudden Move isn't able to match Soderbergh's best efforts in the crime cannon of films but its able cast and neat last act still make it worth a look.3 bottles of wine out of 5.",No Sudden Move

Cheadle rules, Duke towers, Fraser was SORELY missed, & Damon's one scene is a standout.

I must admit that I often didnt exactly understand the plot myself, but I still DID ENJOY it! As some other reviewers already mentioned, this movie can become even better after a second watch (when I will better understand the entire plot :)Any bad? I guess this movie is best suited for the art house movie fans of more subtle portraits instead of the older ""Ocean's Eleven"" fans, because they might get easily bored for the lack of action and straight forward jokes..., although there is humor to be found in the bizarre and hilarious plot turns.The good: there are many things good about this movie! Terrific acting performances for one, a terrific direction and a terrific intelligent plot. And I mean really terrific, because anyone who has seen (and I have seen) ALL of Steven Soderbergh's movies, he or she knows that this director is a master at portraying a suspenseful, enticing ganster plot. Soderbergh did it again!The (convoluted, but superb) story: everybody is conning everybody. 2 small time gangsters (Benicio Del Torro and Don Cheadle) think (THINK) they have hit the jackpot after having stolen a very valuable document that the powers that be are after, but things arent what they seem to be.... :)",No Sudden Move
18,paul-allaer,"Okay, but just okay, 1950s crime drama",6,3 July 2021,"As ""No Sudden Move"" (2021 release; 115 min.) opens, we are in ""Detroit, 1954"" and we are introduced.to Curt, who is hired for an unspecified ""babysitting"" job for lots of dough ($2K upfront, and another $3K afterwards). In a parallel storyline, we are introduced to Ronald. He and his girl seem like they are up to no good, and Ronald is also hired to be part of that ""babysitting"" job. At this point we are less than 10 min. Into the movie. Who is hiring Curt and Ronald? What exactly dos this ""babysitting"" job entail?Couple of comments: this is the latest film from producer-director-photographer-editor Steven Soderbergh. Here he highly stylish 1950s crime drama, in which it becomes quickly impossible to keep track as to who is double-crossing whom, then triple-crossing for good measure. The first hour is a bit tedious but things pick up in the second half. Don Cheadle (as Curt) and Benito del Torro (as Ronald) are fine in the lead roles. Keep an eye out for small parts by Ray Liotta and, most importantly, Matt Damon. The jazzy score is by David Holmes. Bottom line: this is an okay, but just okay, 1959s crime drama that is high on style (from the opening credits on) but low on pulling you in as an emotionally invested viewer. (In the movie's last scene, we learn that the vents actually happened, leading eventually to a mandatory federal reform of some practices b the auto industry.)""No Sudden Move"" was delayed by the coronavirus (of course!). It finally premiered at last month's Tribeca Film Festival, and then 2 weeks later released on HBO Max. If you are in the mood of a stylish 1950s crime drama, or simply a fan of Steven Soderbergh's work, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",No Sudden Move

21,henry8-3,No Sudden Move,6,22 October 2021,"3 for hire criminals are paid to babysit a family whilst the father collects a document. It all goes badly wrong and they are obliged to work together to extricate themselves from the mess and possibly make some money while doing so.Fun, if rather complicated comedy (with a small c) thriller set in the fifties, this is enjoyably tense in places and you're drawn into the plot keen to know what's around the next corner and indeed what is the next twist. Del Toro is the more fun of the main pair with Cheadle the more serious but more clued in.

22,jimbo-53-186511,"Stylistic, but overwritten, complex and messy",4,16 October 2021,"A group of criminals are brought together under strange circumstances and are given the relatively simple task of babysitting a family while one of the family members steals something from his employer's safe. However, as events progress mistrust begins to develop between the criminals when they become convinced that someone is setting them up...No Sudden Move oozes coolness, is stylistic, well-made and comes complete with top-drawer acting from pretty much everyone on-board and yet upon reflection I still saw it as being something of a failure.Where most of the problems lie with this film come from the writing; there are just so many characters and so many double-crosses that, at times, it becomes very difficult to follow what is going on. Some characters have so little screen time and so little dialogue that it's also difficult to see how and where they fit into the story and how far up the ladder they are so to speak. It's this messy approach to the narrative that left the film to be fairly uninvolving to me (despite being a technically well-made film).The cast do their best, but can do nothing to overcome an overly talkative and complex narrative which sadly does result in quite a dull film more often than not. Incidentally, what has happened to Brendan Fraser? I'm genuinely shocked how much weight he has put on.No Sudden Move is a film that I admire rather than love and the end result is a film that feels a little too ambitious for its own good. The sad thing is that I felt that there was an interesting story buried beneath all the clutter in this film, but I just didn't find it here.",No Sudden Move

This was made through the background music, which also created a dynamic tone that moved the story forward.As a crime story, there were many pieces and characters that worked together and double-crossed each other. It's storytelling kept certain things and characters mysterious while creating a complicated plot that requires attention from audiences. I definite enjoyed the story, although I gotta admit I became quite confused towards the end. Sometimes the middle of the story felt a bit long.Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro were great as the main unlikely duo. They had to work together due to common enemies while not trusting each other. They had to think of plans just in case the other betrayed them.Besides the twists and turns, there is a theme about greed and corruption. Many actions from the characters were motivated by passion and greed.

This film won't blow you away, but its rock-solid cast and stylish direction make it at least fairly entertaining.The fish eye lens was an odd choice to say the least and I found it to be quite distracting throughout. The story doesn't cover any new ground and gets a bit too convoluted, resulting in losing some of its impact. Soderbergh knows how to film these types of movies though and his signature kinetic style keeps things moving at a moderate pace.It definitely isn't Ocean's Eleven or Logan Lucky, but No Sudden Move is another engaging heist film to add to Soderbergh's resume.",No Sudden Move

And many of the characters didn't even need to be in it. (was Benicio del Toro an Italian in this?) And then, at the end, it seemed like it was some sort of expose about catalytic converters?

35,DeBBss,Lots of big names for a lame film,6,9 July 2021,"No Sudden Move started off great, but quickly after that first act, it all falls apart. The film felt stagnant most of the time, and because of that, the pacing is just terrible. It took forever for the film to develop the final act, and when it was nearing its end, the ending wasn't crazy or flashy, it was just really unremarkable. And the story is unnecessarily complicated. I'm supposed to remember all of the characters' names and who they are, but it gets so complicated that you'll forget who the characters are even talking about.Although the script is terrible and uninteresting, the film is technically fine. Some people complained about the fish-eyed lens, but for me, it was hardly noticeable; but why even add the fish-eye lens in the first place? The lens' didn't relate to the story or the entire film, so it was just strange why they took this direction. Other than some quirks, the film was shot well, I liked the color-grading, and the editing was smooth. Also, the sets were great, and combined with its cinematography and color palette, it creates a really neat atmosphere.In the end, the film seemed fake. It had a huge cast of big names, but honestly, those A-list actors weren't necessary. They just casted a bunch of really famous people to help with its box office and to make it look more grand than it really is. And the plot sounded like it was going to be an intense thriller with the addition of a heist, but it was mainly just talking. No Sudden Move is an okay film when it could've been something great, it's just unfortunate that it ended up becoming this.",No Sudden Move

44,Lewis_Heather787,Soderbergh has done it again!,7,18 October 2021,"I want start off by saying thank you Warner Bros. For still letting top tier directors create films they want to make. Not every film has to be a giant blockbuster, not that there is anything wrong with that I love gigantic ""popcorn"" films too. However its nice to take a break, relax and really sink your teeth into something rich, complex, slow and just as extremely entertaining. Which ""No Sudden Move"" certainly is 100% !!I was sold already when you say to me Steven Soderbergh and a heist film, what more could you ask for? Plus then you attach the quality of this cast and oh boy do you have me excited! Thankfully, I'm very happy to say that I was not disappointed by this very smart and surprisingly funny film.Lets start with the cast. Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro has absolutely fantastic chemistry. Just like the films pace, their relationship starts off slow but starts to build momentum all the way to the climatic end. It's the ""grey area"" of distrust that the two characters have of each other that is the most interesting to watch. How they deal with that and try to come together to work as a team.....really really great to watch.Other shoutouts Kieran Culkin, Ray Liotta, Jon Hamm and Brendan Fraser are all super solid in their smaller roles. However for me it was David Harbour and Julia Fox that are the other two performances that stood out with Cheadle and Del Toro. Harbour's character actually caused the most levity and laughs throughout the film, being the helpless guy trying to do the right thing but nothing going right. You do feel very sorry for him though because none of what happens is his fault, just caught up in the wrong situation. Whereas Julia Fox just jumps out of the screen exactly like she did in ""Uncut Gems"", there is so much more to her character than just the ""wife"" or ""romantic interest"".......she has probably the most shocking and amazing twist in the film!! I didn't see it it coming whatsoever!!All of the above greatness is obviously due to the writing and directing of the film by Ed Solomon and Steven Soderbergh respectively. Both of them have created such a rich, complex, emotional rollercoaster that goes at the speed of a snail..........but in a good way. Every character whether that be the main two leads or a ""c-side"" character, everyone gets their moment to shine. Not just for the sake of it too, all the characters add something to the story for one reason or another. All equally different and complete as characters, shows the care and attention that was made when creating this film.Overall 75% out of 100 I really enjoyed this film! Was I expecting it to be great....maybe. However I was expecting it to be really good at least and it 100% achieved that and some. I don't know how Soderbergh does it, somehow he always manages to brings something fresh and new to a genre that is constantly attempted and failed by others. Phenomenal cast, great performances all round, interesting/rich story that keeps you guessing and great writing and directing.PS - Oh yeah and a familiar face shows up randomly which was a very nice surprise and he was fantastic !!",No Sudden Move
45,nidhunmoviebuff,A sensational heist thriller that keeps you guessing!,8,8 July 2021,"The master of heist and suspense films, Steven Soderbergh make his presence felt this lockdown season with the hard-hitting 'No Sudden Move' which makes maximum use of its star-studded cast.Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle lead the pack as two down-on-their luck gangsters looking to make a final score before they are forced to leave town after alienating their respective mafia bosses.A mysterious stranger and an even more mysterious benefactor approach them with a seemingly simple assignment-to hold a timid accountant's family hostage as they use him to steal some documents.Based on incredibly true events on how Ford and GM conspired to keep pollution controls out of the automobile industry in the 60s and 70s, No Sudden Move keeps you guessing with top-draw acting, knife-edge confrontations and twists and turns at every juncture.Don Cheadle is in fine form as the smooth talking 'Goynes' while Benicio Del Toro is an absolute delight as the brooding, sulking 'Russo'.Jon Hamm, David Harbour, Julia Fox and Brendan Fraser are all impactful despite supporting roles with limited screen time and that in itself shows how superior the screen writing is.1960s Detroit is recreated in all its glory, with Soderbergh clearly sparing no expense to paint his canvas with as much authenticity and nostalgia as possible.

49,arabnikita,"Too much cast, too much plot and not enough energy",6,3 July 2021,"No Sudden Move (2021)When I saw the cast of this film, I didn't even bother reading the plot because this amount of big names is enough to make the head spin. Unfortunately, what actually made my head spin is the narrative and not in a good way. No Sudden Move starts off in a style that is too complicated for it's own good. The reason why it feels overwhelming is due to the lack of energy or any sort of excitement that could have made this complexity feel lively. However, the trick to this problem is to stop analyzing every word and allow the plot to gradually reveal itself.The movie is about a group of criminals who are tasked with stealing some important documents. Those documents seem like nothing special at first but they instantly draw the attention of a number of interested parties from all social stratas and as the names get bigger, so does the money. What's more, every character feels that pull of greed which forces them to spin their webs of deceit often to end up being tangled in their own strings. Surprisingly, the events are based in a true story that actually had a huge impact on the world.The huge cast was certainly an overkill as many of these big names end up pulling the focus away from the plot and the other characters; only to end up being borderline redundant. Don Cheadle felt like a huge miscast as he is not made to play bandits. The movie tried to be Pulp Fiction or Snatch but it simply lacked that snappiness and drive. Admittedly, the second half of the film does feel a lot more energetic and the story concludes in a satisfactory fashion but the road to that ending might not be for everyone.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Shows.",No Sudden Move

The ending tried to explain stuffs a bit but there are just too many questions unexplained, well as all the unclear messy characters backgrounds and connections that kind of ruins the movie. It tries to keep stuffs at minimal retaining a level of suspense but fails to explain or convince the happening of events. Also I don't really understand why they have to use a fish lens camera where all the proportions get distorted, which is somewhat a distraction in terms of viewing experience.

that is too caught up in experimenting with its convoluted plot and forgets to build character or intrigue. It plays like an office presentation where the presenter has gotten caught up with his mini-models and forgets the bigger picture. The film burns through the charm of its talented cast and towards the end, reduces itself to tedious logistical play-by-play.The cinematography, also personally shot by Steven Soderbergh, makes an odd choice by placing a fish-eye lens in the film's establishing shots. Like a funhouse mirror, actors on the edge of the frame will distractingly morph in shape as they hit their mark at the center. What was the motivator behind this aesthetic choice? It's perplexing.With its magnificent cast including Don Cheadle, Benecio Del Toro, David Harbour, Brendan Fraser, and even child actor Noah Jupe from A Quiet Place are all wasted. The actors all work hard chewing such minimal scenery provided by the script. It's hard to build a character when you're instructed to be a knob in a Rube-Goldberg machine.I don't know who I was supposed to root for. And at the end, when it was revealed who won, I proceeded to have the hiccups because I didn't care what happened next long ago.

The film gives you the chill environment vibe where you just laid back and enjoy the movie unfolding itself with every minute. Compared to other movies or competitors it is that kind of a movie where you wouldn't wanna predict anything, you would only wanna blend with the fun. The camera work feels kinda sketchy at some places but that doesn't catch the eye that much. Screenplay is quite ok and somewhat predictable at some point also. The direction could have been more polished. In terms of watching it's more watching it for just once and enjoying a type movie instead of watching it one more time.

A little morning getaway whilst having breakfast.If you like Soderbergh films (and I do), you will like this.Lots of characters, good plot (albeit lots of threads on the go) and interesting story.It manages to intertwine certain current issues into the a narrative set in the 60s.A ""heist"" movie (not your traditional type) interspersed with interesting and engaging revelations.It does, at one point, get a little preachy. That's the only downside because I'm wholly agreed with the sentiments regarding greed, power, control, race, environment etc. The scene where a character delivers a monologue, about how the world is and the rules created, I felt was a little jarring to what is, in general, a film that let's the viewer use their brains to figure out things. A scene that should have converted that monologue to something that felt natural rather than forced upon the audience.Overall, a good addition to the Soderbergh cannon.A good, interesting, enjoyable film.No 10/10 mind but solid 7/10.You will enjoy it if you like Soderbergh films.",No Sudden Move

It visible in the trailer, you can check yourselves if it's going to be an issue.Apart from that, I liked it a lot. It is my kind of movie, but it is slow and sometimes hard to follow. It never bothered me though, because we follow the main characters who know more or less what we know. When new information is revealed, is usually because they learned about it. The plot itself is simple, there are no great twists. Someone hired someone who employed someone else to do a job and it didn't go as planned. That's the gist of it. We just follow the story from the viewpoint of the bottom feeders, working their way up.I loved the characters and performances, especially the alcoholic and washed out Benicio Del Toro. Another favourite of mine was the character of Jon Hamm, plus another one who is not even credited.

92,JoelAlexanderr,A sophisticated yet fun thriller with an electric cast,9,17 July 2021,"NO SUDDEN MOVE is the newest crime thriller from director Steven Soderbergh, and he proves yet again why he is one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. This film is well-written, directed and acted for the entire duration, and always has another unexpected twist around the corner. It is never trite and always fun to see this star-studded cast bounce off each other as the mystery slowly unravels.Every performance in the entire movie is at least good to great, but the clear highlight for me is Don Cheadle as the lead role, who dons a fantastic 1950s Detroit accent and steals every scene he's in. The score and the cinematography are noteworthy as well -- the score is a jazzy and percussion-filled piece that makes viewers feel as if they are in a 50s club, and the cinematography includes an interesting fish-eye lens effect that makes one feel as if they are peering in on raw conversations.The main reason NO SUDDEN MOVE is such an intriguing and captivating watch is the script, which weaves together a wide array of characters together in a manner that leaves the audience constantly surprised as to the characters' true motivations. When this vast ensemble finally culminates near the end, it is a sight to behold and creates for a joyfully tense sequence. In the last 20-ish minutes, I felt that there were a bit too many plot twists to the point where I felt more confused than satisfied, but the movie still sends a clear message about capitalism in the end that wraps everything together.NO SUDDEN MOVE is highly recommended for those who like unconventional and low-key crime thrillers and anyone who likes to be left guessing.

This is not a matter of 'getting it' or not; it's just not a good movie.

See!), in front of a house porch sporting one of those Walmart white plastic stamp pressed lawn chairs made in China circa 2010. How embarrassing!The whole thing was filmed using the odd choice of a fish-eye lens or whatever it was. -Figures distorted near the edge of the screen. I don't know what the intent was with that, but the result felt cheap and home-made.There was another element which contributed to the whole thing feeling fake... Hard to put your finger on. I think it might have had to do with the weathering of everything. Objects and buildings erected and painted in the 1950's would look new, not like they had been taking sun and rain for 75 years...The overall effect was that it felt like one of those films shot through necessity in the director's own neighborhood, but with a budget enough to rent some extra props but not the talent and tech support needed to use them effectively.The story was interesting, the acting wasn't bad, (though there were a few fall down moments only a green film student would make.) I could have gotten through it if I'd been really determined, but I confess to being unable to get past the half-way mark before calling it quits.A stand-out try for a student film, but weak for a professional production.

Also, I'm a fan of Film Noir and this film is homage to Noir, 1950s heist and home invasion films.Soderbergh has a great cast with Benicio del Toro and Don Cheadle in lead roles. Take a look at the list of of actors and they're all excellent. Even the names you may not recognize, like Amy Seimetz, are impeccable. There are even casting surprises that are fun.I normally give the highest ratings to film's that are perfect in every way. But, occasionally I make exceptions. Soderbergh chose to film extensively use fish-eye lenses. It's a lens that I love. But, at times, in this movie, the distortions created by the lens distracted.

135,thefinalword,Somewhat Weakly Evoking Guy Ritchie and Tarantino,6,2 July 2021,"Well I would recommend the movie.It was very professionally filmed and presented. However the rolled look of the film lens is kind of annoying. I'm not sure if it increases the field of view? It just makes the film look skewed the entire time. Like you are watching it through a slightly distorted mirror. I don't get it, dont like it, and I assume it is some high brow film technique.They should have made us more aware of the importance of the item that was the focal point of the story. Until the end of the movie I didn't get how important it was (when they provided subtext/context) Perhaps because I don't understand automobiles.Consequently I went through the movie feeling as though I had no idea why the device is so significant. It would have made it much more exciting to know what it was during the film. Any of the characters could have been given a minute to expand on the significance of the device.I also thought that the story needed more character development. I didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters. Except maybe Cheadle's character because he was the only one that seemed to have a moral compass.Also, it felt like the film was inspired by Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's style. The two main characters banter reminded me of Jackie Brown a lot.I like when Guy Ritchie explains characters with a narrator as they are introduced versus this film seems to just do it without as much context and thus we're supposed to just accept them for who they are cinematically presented as. Such as Ray Liotta's character. However, Ray doesn't really need much subtext to have you believe that he is a menacing person worthy of fear and commanding power.All in all--- it was fun to watch.

But as the movie progressed, it was going from the Mississippi River (where everything was straight and one way) into the Gulf of Mexico (where everything is blending together and trying to conclude and occur unanimously). By the end of the movie, even though most of the plot lines were tied up, their conclusions felt rushed and kind of out of nowhere (especially if you haven't watched anything from the heist genre before).

I think aside from the biggest silly complaint of the fish eyed lens which it did not matter to me I enjoyed the movie. Today's reviewers are in masses and most are so critical and so nitpicking it's exhausting because at least when you had minimum reviewers you could gauge if you would like the movie or not based on the same reviewer. Bottom line just watch the movie and decide for yourself as most would like pointless action in movies but this one was more script and fun to me.

If only there were a way to make a sequel. Speaking of, I really wish (spoiler here) that when BDT got shot, she kicked him out of the car and drove off, thinking he was dead, but then we find out his flask saved him. That would have given Soderbergh an option for a pre/sequel for this solid pairing.Also - Why doesn't Ray Liotta work anymore? He was as menacing as can be (as long as he keeps his voice from getting whiny). Brendan Fraser was near unrecognizable with his weight gain (in prep for a movie where he has to get even heavier).

He can just have a vulnerability like Tony Soprano or a determination to right a wrong, like the Mel Gibson character in Payback, but without that, the film fails what is sometimes called the ""so what?"" test.

The plot is so convoluted and the editing so choppy that it is really hard to follow the story. Soderberg drops you in the middle of the story with no explanation of the character's backstory or the landscape of the setting. He just keeps throwing characters into the mix without explanation as to why they are there or how they fit into the story, then they all just kind of crash into each other at the end. The first 30 minutes are pretty good, then the rest of the movie is a mess. There are so many elements that become annoying throughout the movie: the stilted dialogue, the scenes that don't seem unnecessary and don't fit into the storyline, the fisheye lens, the bad sound quality, Don Cheadle's weird voice, the choppy editing that interrupted the flow of the movie, and the fact that this flick couldn't decide if it was a heist movie, or a movie about corporate espionage, or a movie about environmental issues, or a movie about racism and the negative effects of gentrification.

Also, there's a plot twist at every turn. Since everyone is a criminal, everyone who plans to betray another get betrayed, and those people get betrayed, and then they get betrayed. It was kinda childish, yet sort of entertaining. It's a fun movie to watch, but don't expect much from it.Also, and this was the biggest negative, the camera lense is so obnoxious.

The #1 most annoying thing about this movie is that it's unwatchable. It looks like it was shot with a $200 phone camera. The wide-angle is awful, no depth, distortion everywhere, the color correction was bad, there were scene changes from light to dark and back again, I could imagine the color correction team doing their best with this budget camera Soderbergh decided to use. I thought it was another shot on iPhone movie, but it doesn't appear to be that. You can't imagine the annoyance until you see it. As people and cars pan by in moving shots the cars get smaller, distorted, shorter-longer, just odd. In one scene Del Toro is off to the left and the lens is so distorted that he's flattened and shortened in the scene. This was by choice? Why? The rest of the movie is the standard twists, turns, and resolution at the end. At least Don Cheadle wasn't asked to do an awful British accent like he did in the Ocean's movies.

Let's darken the corners of the screen, too. (Maybe that's how fish see, I don't know.)All of this was so bad and distracting that I couldn't follow the plot. My wife wanted to go through with it, so I did, but I couldn't tell you the meaning of the ending. I even paused it to check out my screen settings on my TV, as I thought they had somehow changed; they hadn't. So, I went to another film to see if the same thing was happening, and it was not. (And now, my wife was as irritated at me as I was at Sodenburg.)And who is the genius cinematographer credited with ruining this film? ""Peter Andrews,"" aka Steven Sodenburg (another story).Also, in his attempt to be moody, Sodenburg overused bass instruments during important dialogue, which was often low and mumbling enough. So, I had to turn down the bass and up the volume, but we still missed a lot of dialogue.A lot for people liked this film despite this autuer filming, but this was a wasted two hours for me.

The pieces were there, but by the midpoint the plot is too convoluted and I've lost my motivation to care about any of the characters.I was very interested at the beginning and the tension is great right up until everything hits the fan in the kitchen scene but then the movie just goes off the rails trying to swerve the viewer over and over again but never doing it in an interesting way.

The bulk of the movie is somehow so drawn out and boring, that none of the twists that happen are interesting enough to rouse from the half-asleep state this movie will put you in. Such a shame given that it's an overall great cast.I personally barely noticed the fish-eye lens distortion, but it really bothered my wife to the point of giving her a headache.",No Sudden Move
210,Kiwi_Bandit,Boring mess,3,3 July 2021,"With a top cast, I was expecting to watch something that could become a classic in time. Instead I watched a budget, pretentious mess of a film. I think they spent most of their money on the main actors and were forced to film the movie on the terrible actioncam, GoPro 360 Max. Then they got a 12 year old to edit the footage and he didn't know how to remove the fisheye distortion. I'd strongly suggest giving this one a pass unless you need a cure for insomnia.",No Sudden Move

It seems like every single scene uses the same weird aspherical effect. I get it every now and then to amp up the paranoid feel, but every single shot? They couldn't afford a real DP?Considering it was shot on digital RED, is it even a wide angle lens or just the wide angle digital effect filter applied after the fact?

This one did such a masterful job of recreating the 1950s down to the drapes and arched doorways that you actually feel a time-shift.If you feel lost in the first half of the movie because you don't know who-done-it or even what 'it' is much less why, stay tuned.

214,schinst98,Overly Convoluted Film with Too Many Switcheroos,5,6 July 2021,"In classic Soderbergh fashion this film has several plot twists. However while his Oceans movies have one or two solid twists, this movie nears double digits with its twists to the point that it becomes completely confusing even for the most astute viewer.Although I was initially very turned off by the fish eye lens used for the film, I looked past it and did enjoy the first half. It played out like a typical crime movie where street level goons are tied up in something bigger than themselves. Yet by the second half and especially the final act the movie tries to shock audiences with twists that attempt to look more clever than they actually are. The amount of times I thought to myself ""why is he/she involved?"" and ""what is the point of this character?"" we're too many to count.My golden rule for any movie is if I constantly have to look at the plot summary more than once while watching it for the first time, then it is overly complicated and takes away from the viewing experience.On a lighter side, the cast is fantastic and everyone does well in their respective roles. I enjoyed Cheadle's rough portrayal of Curtis and liked seeing Del Toro take on an Italian gangster role. I especially liked a cameo at the end of a well known actor that shall go nameless as to not spoil the reveal.All in all, the movie had me in the first half yet lost me in this over-complicated mess of a film that unfortunately wastes the talent within it.",No Sudden Move

216,neo_20042005,No sudden moves or no moves at all!,2,4 July 2021,"This movie is a great example of an experimental style of directing which only the high tier directors can afford and get away with murder. Given the fact that the cast was stacked and the 1950s Detroit gangster scene was atmospherically well achieved - the movie itself was a let-down. The story was over-convoluted if not confusing at times. Many events, dialogues and decision making from the characters didn't make any sense and were just thrown out, I guess for the surprise effect which ultimately backfired and left the viewer confused. The fisheye-camera was out of place and achieved rather dizziness than artistic value. Very disappointing and a waste of a good cast!",No Sudden Move

218,xxforkliftermattxx,"Solid writing, good direction, and a great cast - despite the slow burn",6,4 July 2021,"As per usual, a well directed film from Steven Soderbergh. Particularly, I thought the use of a wide angle lens (my guess would be somewhere between 10mm - 14mm) throughout, even for closeups, was an unique directorial decision. The use of the wide angle lens distorted the edges of the frame, and made what should be straight lines, less straight. This adds to the 1950s Detroit he was going for. Good twists and turns, albeit a little slow occasionally. It wasn't quite as compelling as recent mystery thriller Knives Out, but it's a solid film to watch on a lazy Friday, Sat, or Sun.

Nothing is sacred, from honor amongst thieves to marital vows. Wonderful roleplaying by Cheadle and Harbour are the icing on cake of an great cast of actors. Del Toro and Hamm are faultless and the (uncredited) Matt Damon's performance is reminiscent of The Informant! A must see.",No Sudden Move

In Soderbergh's earlier works, you took away the fancy wrapping and found exquisite gifts inside. Here, however, removing the fancy wrapping revealed a gift card to your local grocery store. Sure, some of you may be thrilled with a gift card, but for me, it was a major let down.The story itself is very convoluted. How some of the characters come together and are put in certain situations are unconvincing or even not adequately explained. It seems like everyone has their own angle or play, leading to backstabbing and double/triple crossing. It's a movie about a bunch of characters (whom I could not sympathize nor empathize with) are trying to con each other. Then I realized at the end of the movie... The only sucker in this story was the audience who was conned out of 2 hours of their lives.",No Sudden Move

The acting is pretty good, but the storytelling is the problem. I can appreciate a complex plot, but when the complexity is wrapped in complexity because it is on the dialogue, and not in what is shown, then it becomes very hard to follow. You WILL need to follow the names and figure out the relationships with very sparse information. This is the ""Tenet"" of gangster movies.

This is a 1950's period movie and in those days it was Vistavision which was widescreen on 35mm with more grain that was later discarded for finer grain film during the 1970's-90's but depicting or sculpting a film look is a difficult task requiring special cameras and lenses that aid in translating what we've watching. A good example is Quentin Tarantino's ""Hateful Eight"" where he salvaged retired Ultra Panavision 70 special cameras because the lenses were still intact and would give the film that period look of old westerns and even requiring special screens. Another example is CAPOTE starring Phyllis Seymour Hoffman, directed by Bennett Miller winning a nomination for Best Director also takes place in 1959 and in that film every item, object or scene is of great detail that directs the viewers attention that you are in 1959. There is great detail in this film and the acting is superb and it takes place in the 1950's and so it's very easy to take in with a large bowl of fresh popcorn to sit back, enjoy and watch this movie unfold.No Sudden Move,

Confidential were made today it would get the same middling reviews but because that was about Hollywood and not Detroit it might fair better. It's worth the time to watch something that isn't a superhero movie or elongated over 10 episodes in the age of streaming. I appreciated the craftsmanship required to put this into a film.

It was really nice to see so many great actors taking part in small roles, something that doesn't really happen these days unless you're working with people such as Tarantino, Wes Anderson, and of course Steven Soderbergh.Really surprised to say I wanted more of Brendan Fraser. He's nothing special in this movie but he's overweight now and has this really deep and scary persona that I just wanted to see way more than I got, and was genuinely sad to see die.Matt Damon in this role was something that I didn't know I needed either.All in all, I didn't regret that I watched this, just probably won't be watching again.",No Sudden Move

For example, you can't show me tension between a detective, crime boss and some higher figure in the automobile industry(Matt Damon) without any history with them. While I watch this movie I want to be terrified of this tension and I felt we were robbed of that. Did that make the film terrible? No not in my opinion. I loved seeing Matt Damon at the end but you can't give me Matt Damon at the end of the movie and expect me to feel intimidated or outplayed by him no matter what he says. The detective comes full speed ahead in the beginning and I don't see him again until the end. I think you can see where I am going with this! Long story short, I needed more than what I got out of this film. The story on the other hand was really good and I enjoyed it overall.
