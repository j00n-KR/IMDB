0,bkoganbing,Brandon Flips Them The Bird,7,31 May 2009,"It's said that The Crow of all birds is the one charged with the special mission of bringing souls to heaven once they've departed this mortal coil. But when one soul leaves behind some business that really needs finishing The Crow can bring you back. Such is the premise of the film The Crow where Brandon Lee is brought back to the mortal coil on a vengeance quest.It's a simple plot not exactly anything original from many other vengeance films with a supernatural twist. The main problem with The Crow is that if you're not a follower of the comic strip on which it is based certain subtleties of the strip probably escaped by attention. Still the film can and was enjoyed by me on a different level.The film did spawn several sequels, sadly though Brandon Lee was not in them. His accidental death in a shooting scene on the set of The Crow has passed into legend, to eerily familiar to his father Bruce Lee's death. Apparently though enough of the film was shot so that it could be released without having to be done over as was the case with Solomon And Sheba when Tyrone Power died, also on that set.I could see also that Brandon Lee even through the pasty white makeup of his undead character Eric Draven that he was quite the charismatic fellow. That The Crow sparked a television series and several sequels is a testament to Lee's performance. Michael Wincott who played the leader of the gang of thugs who killed Lee and fiancé Sofia Shinas is also memorable as is Jon Polito as the pawnshop owner.I'd check The Crow out if I could. Brandon Lee invested a great deal of character within the character and sadly his life as well.",The Crow
1,Leofwine_draca,More a romance than revenge movie,8,29 May 2016,"At first glance, THE CROW seems to be just another revenge saga, with an added goth twist to appeal to fans of KISS and Marilyn Manson. Thankfully I was mistaken, because this is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that is both fun and moving, violent yet sensitive. It certainly strikes the viewer as a film in which opposing values gel together quite brilliantly. And, whatever critics may say, it will always be a strangely unique movie, in which the tragedy of Lee's on-set death runs parallel to the death and rebirth of his screen character. As such the movie has a spooky, almost legendary air to it, a real one-off to a film. But Lee's death – although deeply upsetting – is not a good reason to watch this movie, having nothing to do with the film itself.Director Proyas (DARK CITY) keeps things dim and shadowy throughout. The film seems to take place over the length of one hellish night, so expect brooding darkness, silent alleys and many shots of Lee's surreal, mime-painted face. The plot is simple; he dies, is reborn, and takes revenge on the bad guys, but Lee's relationship with a teenage friend heightens the emotion, as does Ernie Hudson's sympathetic cop who understands the hero's inner feelings and understanding. The bad guys are mostly psychotic rather than evil, all presided over by the sinister yet suave Michael Wincott, one of my favourite underrated actors. Others such as Candyman (Tony Todd) and Sully from COMMANDO (David Patrick Kelly) flesh out the ranks of the victims. Many stunts, explosive action sequences, violent moments and shoot-outs keep the plot moving, but I found this film to be more of an appealing, romantic and deeply sad love story than anything else. Worth catching.",The Crow
2,SnoopyStyle,nightmarish atmosphere,6,7 November 2015,"The city is burning on the night of Oct 30. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend Shelly Webster are brutally killed by a gang led by T-Bird. Sgt. Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is first on the scene and meets street kid Sarah. The couple has been taking care of her. A year later, the crow raises Draven from the dead to exact revenge on the gang, one member at a time.This is infamous for the accidental shooting death of Brandon Lee on set. I like the nightmarish atmospheric tone of the movie. The main thing missing is a fuller performance from Lee. There is a haunted feel to it. He's not nearly menacing enough but there is a small hint of Heath Ledger's Joker. He didn't do much other than The Crow so it's hard to determine if he has the same charisma as his father. The few normal interactions are competent. This cinematic world shows some promise but it's difficult to determine whether Brandon Lee held any great promise.",The Crow
3,classicsoncall,"""They're all dead. They just don't know it yet.""",8,2 July 2018,"Fans of Gothic styled revenge dramas will appreciate ""The Crow"", a film achieving something like cult status with the tragic death of it's principal star during filming. Brandon Lee is appropriately cast as the enigmatic Eric Draven, returned from the dead to avenge the murder of his girlfriend as well as his own at the hands of thugs operating under the auspices of a crime lord who keeps an entire neighborhood under his sway. Lee is charismatic in the role, ghostly white face paint notwithstanding, which lends an aura of awe and fascination to his character. Unlike his famous father Bruce Lee, Brandon doesn't indulge in choreographed martial arts to seek his revenge, though he does achieve a level of creativity in the way he dispatches his victims, leaving a unique crow style calling card each time he exacts his retribution. The picture itself is dark and foreboding in keeping with it's theme, with the villains having such descriptive names as Tin Tin, Funboy, T-Bird and Skank. Interestingly, Eric Draven himself is never referred to as The Crow of the title, as that function is performed by a mysterious black bird that heralds Draven's appearances and serves as witness to the retribution that follows. The finale sees Eric dispatch the principal villain (Michael Wincott) by inducing thirty hours of pain with a self styled claw hold. Or was that actually a caw hold?",The Crow
4,lee_eisenberg,ghosts and crows,8,14 March 2009,"Having known Ernie Hudson as one of the Ghostbusters, I thought that it made sense to cast him in ""The Crow"". The movie is of course most famous for Brandon Lee's unfortunate death during filming. Watching the movie, it gave me a real sense of the macabre, in a less than identifiable setting full of chaos. Needless to say, it adds to the feeling knowing what happened to Lee on the set. No matter how you approach it, this is a horror movie without having to be particularly scary, and definitely one that I recommend. Watch on Halloween, right before Halloween, or during any other part of the year, and it's still equally good.Also starring Ling Bai (billed as Bai Ling).",The Crow
5,jboothmillard,The Crow,6,12 August 2015,"I knew about this film because of the Gothic image of the leading actor, but more so because of the tragedy that occurred on set, I had to see if it was a worthwhile watch, and directed by Alex Proyas (I, Robot; Knowing). Basically in Detroit, Michigan, poetic guitarist and rock musician Eric Draven (Brandon Lee, Bruce's son) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) are to be married the day after Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, but Shelly is raped and beaten by thugs of city crime boss Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), while Eric is shot and pushed out of a window. A year later, in the cemetery, a crow lands on Eric's headstone, some of these birds have the power to bring the dead back to life, it taps on the stone, this awakens Eric from his grave, the bird guides him through the city to prepare himself. Eric, now also known as The Crow, has not only been granted life again, he has been given the ability to heal from any fatal injury, he is setting out to get revenge for the brutal murder of his fiancée. The crow leads him to the killers: knife thrower Tin Tin (Laurence Mason), drug addict and dealer Funboy (Michael Massee), car buff T-Bird (Commando's David Patrick Kelly), and the unsophisticated Skank (Angel David), he is determined to give them a taste of their own medicine. However leader and world-class crime lord Top Dollar, with bodyguard Grange (Tony Todd) by his side, will dispatch his enemies with a Japanese sword and make a joke about these kills, of course he soon learn of The Crow's invincibility and suffer the consequences of the legend and vigilante. Also starring Ghostbusters' Ernie Hudson as Sergeant Albrecht, Rochelle Davis as Sarah, Bai Ling as Myca, Jon Polito as Gideon, Anna Levine as Darla, Bill Raymond as Mickey and Marco Rodríguez as Torres. Lee has a recognisable image with the goth make up and does well as the rock musician brought back to life and getting vengeance, the tragic irony was that Lee was killed on set by a prop gun that was meant to fire a blank, this being his final performance will always be the one that everyone knows. As for the film itself, it is a simple enough vigilante going against crime lords and thugs, but being based on a comic book it is given a paranormal (almost zombie) and Gothic twist, there are just enough engaging sequences and bloody sequences to keep you going, overall it is a worthwhile action fantasy. Good!",The Crow
6,Tweekums,Supernatural Revenge,7,22 March 2021,"Set in an unnamed US city on the night before Halloween, which is known as 'Devil's Night', rock star Eric Draven and his Fianceé Shelly Webster are brutally murdered by a gang of thugs. A Year later, with the help of the crow that takes the souls of the dead to the afterlife, Eric returns. He will have his revenge against those who wronged him. He isn't the man he was; any injuries he receives now heal within seconds.The plot to this film is fairly straightforward; apart from the fact that Eric has returned from the dead it is a typical revenge thriller. As expected our protagonist hunts down the attackers one by one; each being killed in a fairly unpleasant way. That said it is an enjoyable film if you are a fan of the revenge drama and despite its UK-18 rating is far less disturbing than other well-known revenge films. The darkness, it is set entirely at night, and the persistent rain create an impressive atmosphere. Brandon Lee did a fine job in the lead role; it is a real tragedy that he was killed making the film. The supporting cast are solid; most notably Ernie Hudson as Sgt Albrecht; Michael Wincott as the main villain; and young Rochelle Davis as Sarah, a girl Shelley had befriended. Overall I wouldn't say this is a great film but it is worth a watch.",The Crow
7,BA_Harrison,R.I.P. Brandon,8,8 February 2015,"Based on the comic book created by James O'Barr. The Crow stars Brandon Lee as rock star Eric Draven, who, precisely one year after his murder, returns from the grave to take revenge on the vicious criminals responsible for the rape and death of his fiancée and his own untimely demise.The basic plot for this supernatural thriller is rather simplistic, holding very few surprises and delivering little in the way of genuine suspense, but a poetic screenplay charged with dark romanticism, a terrific cast (Michael Wincott is particularly memorable as head villain Top Dollar) and extremely stylish direction from Alex Proyas ensure that the film is far from forgettable. Proyas, a prolific music video director, nails the comic book aesthetic, delivering a stream of impressive visuals, with grandiose, sweeping cinematography, stunning lighting, and incredible set design, all steeped in Gothic neo-noir atmosphere and set to a cool alt-rock soundtrack.Brandon, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, gives a charismatic central performance, and would most likely have become a major star in his own right had his life not been tragically cut short by an accidental shooting on the set of this movie, a fact that only goes to make the finished article an even more tragic and haunting experience.",The Crow
8,paul_haakonsen,Very entertaining...,8,17 January 2016,"I have always enjoyed ""The Crow"" ever since the first time I watched it during the mid-1990's. And the movie is still entertaining today, and it will be so forever, as it is just a timeless movie.There are many things that work in favor of ""The Crow"". First and foremost the Brandon Lee legacy was fully established with this 1994 movie. But it was also the movie that snatched the young talent from Hollywood far too early, and this movie really would have been his stepping stone onto something far bigger.The storyline in ""The Crow"" is a solid one that is build on the foundation of a good storytelling script. The night before Halloween is known as ""Devil's Night"" and it sees the untimely death of Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (played by Sofia Shinas) at the hands of a gang of ruffians. A year later Eric returns from beyond the grave, accompanied by a raven, sent back to seek vengeance on those who killed him and his beloved fiancée.Director Alex Proyas managed to put the script and storyline quite adamantly to the screen in a very memorable manner. And the characters in ""The Crow"" were well-detailed and helped to bring the story to life quite nicely on the screen.Now, ""The Crow"" is not a massive CGI or special effects galore, which the movie does well without, as this is a story- and character-driven movie in every aspect.They had a rather good ensemble of talents for the cast list. Starting with the late Brandon Lee, of course, whom was well-cast for the role of Eric Draven, and it also had a very charismatic Michael Wincott in the role of Top Dollar - the boss of the ruffians. Bai Ling appears in a dark and very odd character named Myca. Ernie Hudson pulls off the role as police officer Sergeant Albrecht quite nicely.I have watched ""The Crow"" countless times, and will continue to watch it every now and then for as long as I continue to watch movies, because it is an entertaining movie and has a very unique dark, semi-Gothic feel to it.",The Crow
9,BandSAboutMovies,Amazing!,7,25 April 2020,"James O'Barr created The Crow as a way to deal with the death of his fiancee at the hands of a drunk driver. Today, we may know it more for the death of its lead actor Brandon Lee. Take it from someone who was 22 when the original film came out and had already been a fan of the comic - it was the perfect movie for its time, a capsule ready made to be looked back on as I am now old and have so many memories around this time.Eric Draven (Lee) has been killed after trying to save the life of his fiancee, Shelley. One year later, a crow brings him back to life as he unleashes terror on the gang of Top Dollar (Michael Wincott, Strange Days).It's an incredibly simple tale of revenge, but the gothic look and soundtrack that reflects the time of its creation drive this movie beyond its simple origins. I remember being beyond excited when My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult was actually in the film, playing at Top Dollar's club before his gang heads out to set Detroit ablaze on Devil's Night.Of course, there has long been discussion of the film being cursed. In addition to the accident where Michael Massee shot a live round - unbeknownst to the actor - a carpenter suffered serious burns, another worker was stabbed in the hand by a screwdriver, an equipment truck blew up, a stuntman broke his ribs, a rigger was electrocuted, a set sculptor flipped out and drove his car through the prop room and finally, a hurricane destroyed much of the set.Another reason for so much of this - beyond fate - was that there was plenty of cost and corner cutting, with a crew member remarking that they were ""trying to make a $30 million movie for $18 million."" As the movie was being shot in North Carolina, which is a right-to-work state, the unionized conditions of Hollywood did not exist. They switched schedules from night to day without the industry standard 24-hour break. Rumors of rampant cocaine use on set also exist.Due to Lee dying, many of the scenes had to be reshot with a double and CGI. All of the scenes with Michael Berryman's Skull Cowboy character had to be cut, too.Despite the tragic nature of its creation, The Crow remains a movie that reminds me of a different time in my life. Its influence on culture remains.",The Crow
10,Coventry,"Morbid, saddening, beautiful, haunting...",10,6 January 2006,"This is the film that'll of course always be related with the tragic death of a talented young actor on the verge of his cinematic breakthrough, but, sadly enough, we also have to acknowledge that it probably never would have been so successful in case this horrible accident wouldn't have occurred, and this regardless of how well made ""The Crow"" in fact is. What fascinates me more, however, is to what extent Brandon Lee's premature death indirectly influenced the undeniable ""softening"" of the finished product? I'm familiar with the comic strips by James O'Barr and they're definitely bloodier and more violent than this film, which merely suggests a whole lot of bloody massacres but doesn't show much. Personally, I really wonder whether or not Lee's unfortunate passing away encouraged director Alex Proyas' and his producers to make their film slightly more sentimental. This is NOT a point of criticism, mind you, as I really think ""The Crow"" is near brilliant with an overwhelming Gothic atmosphere, wonderfully dark set pieces and a genuinely moving love story! Back in 1994, Alex Proyas' ""The Crow"" dethroned ""Batman"" as the best comic book adaptation thus far and it remained the best until Robert Rodriguez came along in 2005, with his excellent interpretation of the pitch-black comic strip ""Sin City"". The story is standard-horror material, with a restless soul rising from the grave to avenge the murder of his beloved girl as well as his own. But it's decorated more beautifully, with a mythical crow representing the life force of this ""angel"" and the ultra-grim reproduction of dangerous Detroit. It is here that rock star Eric Draven and his girlfriend Shelley were brutally murdered during ""Devil's Night""; a disturbing celebration on the night before Halloween when criminal gangs set fire to random buildings. During his killing spree, Draven comes to the conclusion that the gang members that killed him are only pawns of a much larger crime syndicate. The flashbacks in which Eric relives his maudlin final moments with the love of his life are truly saddening whereas the hunt for his victims is very exciting. Apart from Brandon Lee, whose acting is really sublime, ""The Crow"" also features many other brilliant actors who're all scandalously underrated, such as Michael Wincott, Ernie Hudson, John Polito and even Tony ""Candyman"" Todd. The later sequels almost bring shame to this masterpiece, though, so avoid them at all costs!",The Crow
11,hitchcockthelegend,Can't rain all the time...,9,19 February 2015,"I hadn't seen it for about ten years and as the full moon came beaming through my apartment window late last night, it just felt right to indulge in some Proyas Gothic excellence.The question still taps away at all our doors, namely would the film be the cult classic it became without the Brandon Lee tragedy? That's a tricky one to answer because we all deep down have a morbid curiosity about us, especially with films and their stars. This is why I got a lot more from re-watching the movie after a very long period of time, namely that it may have drew many of us in years ago because of the tragedy and heart aching back story to writer James O'Barr's birthing of Eric Draven the character, but it can now enthral, thrill and shatter emotions of its own accord.The Gothic art design and the soundtrack are emo personified before such a label was invented, Lee is lithe and skillful and serving notice to what a talent we were robbed of that fateful day in March 1993. The villains are a roll call of go to guys for such roles, Kelly, Wincott, Todd, while Ernie Hudson fronts up as good cop personified. And finally Proyas, struggling with the budget even before Brandon's death, that he manages to create this world of perpetual bleakness, but still offer hope and beauty - the latter via tracking shots, pull aways and intricate frame shots of a tormented Draven, shows him to be a purveyor of considerable skills.All told, The Crow (1994) deserves to not be thought of as a cult classic, but just as a classic, period. 9.5/10",The Crow

13,Calicodreamin,The crow slays Halloween,8,4 October 2019,The crow was quite amazing. A man comes back to life to serve vigilante justice on the men who raped and murdered his fiancé (and threw him out a window). Vengeance is served with gruesome takedowns and poetic justice as the crow and his walking corpse tear up the town. The cinematography is actually kind of beautiful its dark and ominous tone. The storyline flows well and the characters well developed. A killer Halloween tale.,The Crow
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Excellent film in all respects,8,6 October 2007,"I haven't read the original comic, only the concept of it. This is the second movie by Proyas I've seen(the first being I, Robot), and it's one of the two that's been recommended and suggested to me the most(the other being Dark City). Brandon Lee's fate was lamentable, and thoughts go to Eliza Hutton, his widow. He died making an amazing film that I'm glad was released, though it is obviously an ethical choice if it should be or not. Inspired by his own experiences, James O'Barr wrote a comic(book and strip) about this character, and Proyas and Lee brought it to life(so to speak) on the big screen. The plot is well-told and engaging. The pacing may be flawless. It never moved too fast nor too slow. The writing is good, the dialog is very well-written. There were some really cool and instantly quotable lines spoken in this film. The acting is great, if Ling Bai is perhaps somewhat flat... this may have been intentional, I'm not sure. Lee(R.I.P.) did grand in his performance, both as far as action and acting go. Wincott makes a marvelous villain, as expected. The action is awesome, pure and simple. The music, rock, really works for the film. The look and feel is Gothic and neo-noir, and it fits the theme and concept perfectly. The camera-work and editing are both top-notch. The film has scenes that could have been sappy and hokey in the hands of less talented film-makers, but they work well. A film about the strength of love, about spirit and justice. The DVD features the theatrical trailer, and a commentary track with Jeff Most and John Shirley, and it is highly informative and well worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of vigilante stories, comic books, superheroes and the people involved in making it. 8/10",The Crow
15,view_and_review,Dark and Gritty,6,28 February 2015,"When I saw this movie in 1994 or '95 it was so much better. I wonder at the workings of the teenage brain. But, just like taste buds develop and change over time so do tastes in entertainment, people, conversation, etc. Now the adult me doesn't enjoy the same movies as the teenage me. Not a problem but I will have to revisit so many of those movies I considered great (Natural Born Killers I'm talking to you).Saying that The Crow is a dark movie is putting it mildly. It was a dark and gritty setting with dark and gritty characters. The Crow is basically a tale of revenge with a touch of mysticism involved. The movies attractiveness is in the raw, dirty, dark and gritty feel to it. The setting was very akin to a Mad Max, Class of 1984, Robocop and other movies with wanton lawlessness.What escaped me before -because I was so enamored with the Crow and his dismantling of his foes- was the terrible dialog and poor acting. There were some very nice lines in there but overall it was just poor dialog. Obviously, The Crow was never popular because of its Oscar-worthy script. I think it appealed and still appeals to a certain niche of hardcore followers. It's a movie that you're either into or you're not. I was into it and now I'm not.",The Crow
16,neil-476,Dark revenge,7,18 April 2010,"Alex Proyas' film takes James O'Barr's fictional but intensely personal comic, and takes a step backwards from the rawness which emanates from every page of the original.As a result, the film is more accessible to a general audience. It is still very dark - both in tone and also literally - but it doesn't hurt as much as O'Barr's. Perhaps this is because we never get to know our two murdered lovers very well. Eric is simply an agent of vengeance, an engine of death. He us driven by a need to administer justice to those who killed him and his fiancée a year before, and we never really get to know much about him before his death. As a result, we never feel his pain, and this is a flaw: if the audience had a deeper emotional investment in the protagonist, the film would have been a major success. As it is, it is simply a dark, action packed mood piece.This sounds like damning with faint praise, and is perhaps a little unfair. The cast are all good, the mood is well established, and all the action set pieces are delivered well. I just wish it had gone that one step further.",The Crow
17,Uriah43,Dark and Gloomy,6,5 January 2014,"It's ""Devil's Night"" (Oct 30th) in Detroit and arsonists are busy burning down everything they can. Meanwhile, thugs have broken into an apartment loft where a man by the name of ""Eric Draven"" (Brandon Lee) and his fiancé reside. They kill both. Fast forward a full year and suddenly a crow appears at the grave of Eric Draven. Slowly the body of Eric emerges from the grave possessed with only one desire-revenge on those who killed him and his fiancé. Anyway, rather than disclose what happens afterward and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that this was a dark and gloomy ""comic book"" movie with lots of action and pyrotechnics. Although I liked the performance of Brandon Lee at the same time I also thought he was remarkably inconsistent due largely to some weaknesses in the script rather than his acting ability. Likewise, the plot seemed to meander here and there which undermined some of overall effect. Fortunately, the supporting cast contributed solid performances and the background music was also quite good. All in all, this was a decent film and I rate it as slightly above average.",The Crow

20,Mr-Fusion,There will be blood,7,6 November 2021,"I never had a goth phase growing up and I can't stand The Cure, but god help me, I love a good revenge flick. To that end, The Crow is as pure as they come; an attractive couple with a bright future, brutalized and murdered by a street gang; a kid with an absent mother; a good cop in a rotten system.All of these characters exist in what is quite possibly the worst city there could be; an oppressively dark cesspool, somehow more dreary than Seven, more rainy than Blade Runner, cloaked in death. Just thinking about this depiction of Detroit is depressing, but it's what makes The Crow so well-realized, gives its antihero definition.This is a movie I didn't want to like but can't help it. Brandon Lee personifies the roles, his life tragically mirroring that of the title character, all of this weaving into the film's tapestry. This isn't a movie, it's a cultural artifact, morose and impactful in its own right.",The Crow

23,JamesHitchcock,Would have been long forgotten but for Brandon Lee's death,3,20 February 2021,"""The Crow"" is a film which has become notorious because of the tragic death of its star, Brandon Lee, who was killed in a shooting accident while making it. Lee was, of course, the only son of the legendary martial arts hero Bruce Lee, who also died tragically young.The film is based on a comic book, which I must admit I had never heard of. It would appear that in some American cities, including Detroit where the action takes place, October 30th, the night before Hallowe'en, is still regarded as ""Devil's Night"", an excuse for hooligans to indulge in hooliganism, up to and including arson. One Devil's Night a young rock musician named Eric Draven and his fiancée Shelly Webster are murdered by a gang of thugs. A year later to the day, Eric rises from the dead and proceeds to take revenge upon those responsible. I don't think that I need say any more about the plot except that the crow of the title is a mysterious spirit which guides Eric in his quest.""The Crow"" is sometimes regarded as a ""cult movie"", but cults, whether religious or cinematic, are often baffling to the uninitiated. The film's most striking feature is its visual style, turning Detroit into a gothic ""city of dreadful night"", with a palette dominated by blacks, whites and blood reds, but a look of this kind has become something of a cliché in superhero films so its use here is not particularly original. The acting is undistinguished; Brandon Lee is perhaps a better actor than his father, but as Bruce's martial arts skills were not matched by his acting ones that is not really high praise. The plot is no more than a standard revenge thriller, consisting of little more than one bloody killing after another, and the dialogue is banal. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the death of its star, the son of an iconic father, is the only thing that has preserved its fame and that, had Lee not died, this film would have been long forgotten. 3/10",The Crow
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A very dark, beautiful, powerful film",10,23 August 2002,"I was about 9 when I saw this in 1994, and I loved it already. And as I grew up and watched this film more and more I understood it better. It's very beautiful yet dark film about death and justice for victims. And when you watch it, there can be no way no one could hate this movie. They may not understand. Or maybe this wasn't their kind of movie. I think this was the first movie that I could look at the violence as if it were justified. Because if I could honestly say I'd do the same thing if I were in the same situation. I can't help but cry at the end. It's very powerful. And moving.
Brandon Lee's death, has to be the most disturbing fact of the movie. But I think he would look at this film today and be proud of his work. His performance is wonderful, his best, and devided him from his father's shadow. This a wonderful movie. Not a movie that you should watch with your kids.

People that enjoy crime action movies or superhero type of films can also appreciate ""The Crow"". It's not just for goths!

26,thesar-2,Rain Man Cometh Back,8,11 December 2012,"""It can't rain all the time,"" says Eric ""The Crow"" Draven.Obviously, he's not visited Seattle.Picture it, Phoenix, AZ, Black Friday, 2012. I ventured through the Fry's Electronics for BluRays when all of a sudden, I notice The Crow's on sale for $5. It's a steal for a movie I've only seen once in the mid-1990s that I recall liking. I'm so glad I picked up this film.With just a few obstacles, this movie is fantastic. Great action, good story, genuine heart, special effects well-done and one of the best cinematic soundtracks that came from the 1990s, The Crow makes for a great ride from beginning to end. And magically, it holds up solidly today.Rocker – though that's completely incidental – Eric Draven is resurrected from a thug-life death to avenge his sweetheart's brutal murder by means of a crow's guidance, no less.Seriously, that is the entire synopsis of this story, even though there's a little more.Now, that ""more"" is sometimes meh, mostly clichéd, even for 1990s standards, but it's interesting nonetheless. Especially, secondary character, Sarah (played wonderfully by Rochelle Davis,) who's yearning for a real role model, or the fantastic Michael Wincott as, ah-hem, ""Top Dollar."" You could also include the great graphics and at times fun dialogue.Nowhere goes: I understand making this dark. The 1990s were all about the dark, but this was, for about 50%, too dark. And I'm even talking about on BluRay. I get mood and I get they were trying to cover-up the stand-in for the unfortunate incident that took Brandon Lee's life (during filming) way too short, but at times, I felt like I rolled over on the remote and turned off the TV and let the speakers guide me through the scene.In addition, the movie kinda started off a little silly, with how quickly a completely disoriented newly reanimated Draven learns to be a super-hero. And don't get me started on why (the HELL) he would quote ""The Raven"" as an introduction at one point. If I were his victim, I wouldn't be able to get past that when Draven asked for what he wanted.Anyhoo, it's an extremely fun movie that, despite its clichés and shortcomings, is a thrill ride with an abundance of great action sequences, an absolute killer soundtrack and one of the best movie lines of all time: ""It can't rain all the time.""After only seeing this once before, I still use that line to date. It sums up a lot of situations we feel are too heavy with our daily lives.And don't ask me about the Lee-less sequelsI dunno – I haven't seen them, nor have any definite plans to watch them. I just know this was a treasure, I'm glad I got it and I can't wait to see it again.",The Crow
27,lost-in-limbo,A stylistic revenge piece that soars high.,9,20 April 2006,"Eric Draven, a rock guitarist is killed along with his fiancée just a day before their wedding by a group of vile criminals, but there was no hard evidence to pin the murders on anyone. A year later Eric is brought back from the dead to avenge the death of his fiancée and himself. While, on his quest to knock off the gang members one by one, he's also accompanied by a crow that's basically his eyes and soul to this world.I love this sensational flick! I just had to revisit it again, since it's definitely my favourite comic adaptation. What (debut) director Alex Proyas has come up with is a darkly, ultra-slick paradise with it's neo-expressionism touches that looks like its been lifted right out of the pages of the underground comic novel. I was speechless of the highly detailed world that was created because the experience is nothing short than incredible. The set pieces are simply awe-inspiring with such deftly, unrestrained direction to build up a dreamlike aurora from this visual feast. What made this picture even more intense had to be that the camera-work is left of the leash by taking you into the thick of the action with the sweeping movements that just take flight. The spirited execution makes its way into the full throttle action scenes where the raw energy smacks you hard in the gut as there's no waiting around. The story gets right into. Another prominent dimension is that the mucky universe design has a vigorous rock-punk vibe, therefore a cool soundtrack featuring the likes of The Cure, Violent Femmes and Stone Temple Pilots, balances out the mood rather finely. It gladly never goes overboard with its hard rock songs and there's a meaning for the song to be there than just chucking in for the sake of it. But the most formidable aspect in the sound department was the beautifully haunting, Gothic score. Whoa! It just carries you away with it's hypnotic embrace. The booming sound effects too gives the film some hiss and effectively surrounds you. The seductive images, lightning and sound are undeniably staged to perfection. Although, sadly the film will be best remembered for the accidental death of Brandon Lee. His powerhouse performance reeked of charisma and was vital to its success. The fire and warmth he brought to the character was just phenomenal. The rest of the cast; Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, Angel David and Tony Todd might've been in Lee's shadow, but they feed of his character very well. The plot is about revenge and everlasting love, no matter if there's no justice, love will always conquer all. The heartbreaking tale is pure at heart with the script being a play on words with its organic, poetic touch. The cutting flashbacks of the couple before the murder packs a powerful bite. Also the script manages to filter out some sly, morbid banter. The one and only downer about it is that the plot is rather foreseeable, but the imagination of it simply sticks in mind that the predictability of it you just sweep aside.This is one gripping comic project that comes to life with an influx of stimulating avenues. Definitely one not to be missed.",The Crow
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Its overtly Gothic tone is slightly off-putting, but it's an enjoyable and unique revenge thriller.",6,20 March 2018,"There's this pervasive and, at times, slightly off-putting overtly Gothic, madly melancholic aesthetic perforating not only every frame visually but also the story itself straight down to its core. It's this strange style that makes 'The Crow (1994)' both wholly unique and, oddly, a little too self-serious to be taken wholly seriously. There are flashes of greatness here and there, though, with the mime-faced protagonist's tender side playing well off his darker, almost scary one. The actual action sequences are relatively flashy, fast-paced and practical, though the elephant in the room of Brandon Lee's onset death remains an uncomfortable factor throughout, especially during any gun-play sequence. Overall, the flick is an enjoyable revenge thriller that does what it sets out to in its own way and, while it definitely isn't for everyone, that's an admirable thing considering its genre. 6/10",The Crow
29,bowmanblue,Every night I burn,10,4 November 2014,"'The Crow' is one of those rare films that is tragic and brilliant all at the same time. It's a great story/action movie to start with, but has the added tragedy of being Brandon Lee's last film, as he died on set during the making.Now only is it rare for a 'revenge movie' to be so perfect, but it's also based on a comic book. Before Marvel finally cracked how to make a successful comic book adaptation with its Avengers series, it was rare for anything to live up to its source material. Here, we meet Eric Draven, a rock star who was murdered brutally along with his girlfriend, Shelley Webster. Now, one year later, a mysterious crow brings him back to life to seek revenge on those nasties who wronged him.The plot isn't anything special, but the way that it's executed is. The characters are all spot on - Brandon Lee especially, as he shows that he's more than just someone who can kick people over. But all the cast are equally excellent. You'll root for the goodies and cheer when the baddies naturally fall one by one.Then you have the whole Gothic ambiance. This may not be for everyone. On the rare occasions I hear people criticising The Crow, it's because it's 'a film for Goths.' Well, The Cure do to an excellent song or two for the film and yes, it is more than just a little moody, but I think you don't have to paint your fingernails black to appreciate this one. If you like your revenge thrillers moody, brutal and full of action, then this one's for you.",The Crow

The character almost seems like a cross between Batman and Joker as he hunts down the gang one by one, a grim smile on his made-up face. As guns are regularly fired at him and Lee was tragically killed, the film has an absolutely haunting sadness to it. I wish there was more creativity in the story, but it's worth seeing.",The Crow
31,g-bodyl,A Cult Classic!,9,22 February 2015,"The Crow is a film that may be best known for the death of actor Brandon Lee during production. But somehow that unfortunate death does not hamper the overall movie. This movie is a poetic film that sails like the wind and brings forth several genres including horror, action, and romance. For one, I feel like this film is a more violent reincarnation of Batman. Our main character, Eric Draven, resembles Batman in more ways than one although he is not considered a superhero. Alex Proya's first feature is about a man named Eric Draven who was murdered along with his fiancée. One year later, he returns from the dead to bring revenge to the killers, with the help of a hypnotic crow. Once a crime lord hears existence of Eric, things may get a little interesting. Brandon Lee was fantastic here in this film. As the son of Bruce Lee, he already had the acting genes and it's a darn shame he died, because he could have had a long career. Ernie Hudson was very good as the cop who takes side with Eric. Overall, The Crow is a cult classic, but one that should have been an instant classic. It's a dark, brooding film but it is also a captivating film. It's not a superhero movie, but I can't help but the call the comparisons between this film and Batman. It's a melodic action film and the tampered production luckily did not bring the film down. It is a must-see for action/horror fans.My Grade: A",The Crow
32,ericstevenson,RIP forever,8,9 April 2017,"It was so interesting to watch one of the most infamous movies ever made. It's not infamous because of its content but because of its production. The movie stars Brandon Lee, the son of the famous Bruce Lee. There was actually an accident on the set that actually killed him in real life. Yep, really. I feel bad for not liking this movie more if only because I want to remember a film that was truly made in remembrance to someone. Of course, it's a good film for me. It was based on an Image comic that I wasn't quite aware of.I recognized Ernie Hudson which was cool because I believe he's the most prolific black actor in history. I admit that some of the story doesn't make that much sense, especially near the end. It's still great to watch a good superhero movie from the 1990's before the golden age really hit. I personally didn't care that much for ""Blade"" and think this works better as an R-rated superhero movie. Brandon Lee is of course wonderful and we get lots of great imagery and lighting effects. The mood and atmosphere are perfect in this film that doesn't get too dark. ***",The Crow
33,secondtake,"Mesmerizing visuals, puerile script...just watch and don't think too much",7,4 August 2012,"The Crow (1994)There's no question this is a vigorous, crazy-violent, youth oriented, anti-establishment movie with a heart. It's utterly romantic in an almost childish way but thank god for that because parts of the movie--more and more of it as it goes--are about exacting revenge. For me, as exaggerated and fun as it is in a way, it still only goes so far.But revenge is a good motive for action, and for bloody theatrical murder. Make no bones about it, the main character, this ""Crow"" person who has the worldly name Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) is a murderous hunk of a dude. He's an archetype of selfish lawless justice. The film is dark dark dark. The mood is dark, the lighting is dark, and the sets are made of dark things--wet pavement at night, blackish brick and empty alleyways, and dark clothes. And that's part of what works amazingly well. Amazingly. You get pulled into this nightmare of Detroit before Halloween, and if all the bad guys are like comic book awful, that's part of it, too. Thankfully it isn't too realistic. Detroit can be scary--I grew up in the outskirts, and I remember being scared for real on Devil's Night, October 30--but Detroit's nightmare isn't silly, not at all. And it's a city filled with decency, too. As one reviewer said, this makes Batman's Gotham look like the Emerald City. Not quite.It's tough to get too demanding about more ordinary things like acting, because the movie doesn't strive for realism. And it sure succeeds at avoiding it. But it succeeds also in keeping us outside of any real sympathies for the characters, except for the little girl, Sarah, who is a terrific and believable presence. Lee was obviously chosen for his body and his rock star kind of good looks (his make up is more Aerosmith than anything, which makes sense because Eric Draven is a rock star). But Lee can't act worth beans, and that's everyone's opinion. Whether you think it matters is another thing. Watch it and see. He has a following of sorts (not like his father Bruce, of course), so that might help. And it's his last film--he died at only 28 years old from an accident during the filming of the movie (a dummy or re-charged blank bullet hit him from a prop gun). Unfortunately that's part of the legend and tragedy of the movie to this day.We are overdue of a really good book overview of the comic book movies, to put their style and different intentions into perspective. Some are zany and live on their plasticky otherworldliness, like maybe the first breakthrough ""Superman"" movie (1978) which feels bright and colorful overall, or the Tim Burton ""Batman"" which isn't bright, but it's wacky. Most of these are have fakey scripts that just do the job of getting across the plot. The worst/best example of this might be the visually astonishing and ultimately boring ""Watchmen"" (which is a live-action animation). ""Then there are the very serious seeming Nolan movies, the trilogy (so far), which tries to almost make Batman possible. The Robert Downey Jr. ""Ironman"" fits into that mold. And I think ""The Crow"" is really a precursor to these dark and realistic movies. Notice that ""The Crow"" precedes the first Nolan movie (""Batman Begins"") by a decade. But the key difference now is that the believability of the main characters is worlds apart in the two movies--compare Christian Bale with Brandon Lee. Or just look at the scripts of the two movies. It's a wonder that ""The Crow"" holds up as well as it does. But it does. And it's mostly because of how it was made. Amazing, beautiful, dark visuals and moving camera and incredibly smart editing. And as one last bizarre twist--it was shot in North Carolina, not Detroit--Detroit was probably too dangerous.",The Crow

Seriously it was so devastating to hear that Brandon Lee tragically died during filming, because he was just so excellent as an actor.

39,poe426,Shocking...,10,6 June 2009,"It rained here in Wilmington, North Carolina the day Brandon Lee died. A buddy of mine called me early that day and told me that Lee had been shot on the set of THE CROW. I thought he was joking. He wasn't; the local news channels were confirming it. Not long before, another friend of mine, from out of town, had visited and we'd tried to find the location where THE CROW was being filmed. I was already a Brandon Lee fan and I loved the comic, so I was determined to see him in the flesh. On a dark, rainy day, we searched around until we found the black crow logo with an arrow indicating that the camera crew was somewhere downtown, and set off in search of Brandon Lee. My buddy grew tired of driving and searching and suggested we take in a movie (ARMY OF DARKNESS was playing, and we were both Sam Raimi fans). I insisted we keep on searching. Downtown, we drove past a group of filmmakers on a side street and I recognized Sam Raimi himself. I urged my buddy to stop. He thought I was ""full of ****."" But he stopped and we got out and watched Sam Raimi shoot second unit footage for THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Later, we saw ARMY OF DARKNESS. I never did get to see Brandon Lee. I called the offices of Fangoria magazine and told them about the accident. They didn't seem interested (this was before the internet, and there was no way for them to confirm my story, I guess). Later, when the news broke that Lee had died, I followed up with another phone call. This time around, the Fangorians had heard the news for themselves and were understandably low-key. I hung up and walked to the door and looked out. Dark clouds were rushing past overhead, and raindrops were starting to fall again. I stood there with raindrops pelting my face and I closed my eyes and, before long, I began to cry. I'd been a Bruce Lee fan and had been shocked by his death; the shock of hearing about Brandon Lee's death was just as hard to take. Not long after, at the same hospital where he had been taken, I talked to a nurse who had been there when he'd been brought in. ""He was bleedin' so bad they had to change the mattress,"" she told me: ""It was soaked clean through."" She went on, but I'd already gone numb. Sometimes, I still feel that way. It's dark out, now, so I'm going to go. It feels like rain.",The Crow
40,filipemanuelneto,The movie of the life of Brandon Lee.,6,6 November 2021,"Some time ago, I became aware of the existence of this film, but I decided to see it because of its somewhat dark and interesting theme. It turned out to be the movie I saw on my Halloween night, and I'm not exactly sorry. The film is set in a dystopian future, in which the city is dominated by organized crime and the authorities seem incapable of acting and there is a group of thugs that annually set fire to several parts of the city on purpose, in the so-called ""Devil's Night"", just for the pleasure of destroying.In the film, a totally innocent couple are attacked and killed by criminals who break into their home. However, a crow magically in charge of taking Eric's soul to heaven decides to keep it on earth in order to give him time to do what needs to be done: find and punish the killers. It's a simple, direct plot, based on a series of graphic novels that I didn't know about, but it works reasonably well. A particular note, which made this film famous, was the sad death of the main actor, Brandon Lee, as a result of an accident with the film's weapons during a scene in which his character is hit by a bullet.From the cast, it is Brandon Lee who stands out, with a charismatic and committed performance. With this film, the actor achieved the most outstanding role of his career. In addition to him, Michael Wincott also deserves particular commendation due to the dark, grim and cruel portrayal of a crime boss. Sofia Shinas and Jon Polito also show up and do a satisfying job.Technically, the film has several elements of interest, mainly in terms of visuals and special and sound effects. The cinematography is suitably dense, sober and at times gives the scenes a pleasant charge of pessimism and negativity, as if we were inside a nightmare or hallucination. The props and sets help to create the desired atmosphere, gothic and a little threatening, but it is the visual, special and sound effects that deserve the most praise. The film also has good action scenes. The soundtrack, while not memorable, works reasonably well.",The Crow

Take the loss and sorrow, twist it and then release the vengeance and the smiting!! It hits the balance perfectly.Much has been spoken about Lee's performance and this being his breakout role. I don't know about that I have seen all his other stuff and its ok but nothing that particularly grabs you. In The Crow he is perfect, but I think he, and the rest of the cast and crew hit the sweet spot, I'm not sure he could have delivered another performance such as this.

45,Vartiainen,Urban Gothic masterpiece,9,10 May 2014,"It's interesting to ponder whether or not The Crow would have received such a strong cult following if not for Brandon Lee's tragic death in the middle of the filming. It certainly bestows a certain aura of gloom over the entire film, and keeping in mind that this is supposed to a dark and brutal story about lost love and need for revenge, this is in no way a bad thing.To answer my original question, yes, I think it would have become just as popular over time had Lee survived. Because it's just such a splendid film. It's also a movie that's hard to categorize. It certainly has elements of horror in it, mostly in the visuals and the general atmosphere, but calling it just a macabre horror story seems lacking. There are elements of fantasy and mystery in it, even thriller, but even those four genres don't define it completely. Luckily, over time people have come up with terms to describe it, and one of those, namely urban Gothic, for me describes it perfectly. It's a Gothic horror fantasy story given a modern setting and twist. It deals with the themes love and loss, both of which interlock. One fuels the other and vice versa. It's a story about settling scores, giving in to your need for revenge, eye for an eye, yet it treats such a theme with sadness and melancholy, keeping in mind the human underneath the monster.It's such a shame that Brandon Lee passed away so early in his career, because this film would have launched him into stardom. His performance is everything it needs to be. He can shift from a screaming madman into a lonely, heartbroken poet faster than you can blink and every scene he is in, he absolutely dominates. Luckily the villains are able to match his performance. Michael Wincott's Top Dollar is a great main villain for this film. He's just as crazed and threatening as Lee's Eric Draven, but in a completely different way. He's a monster because he chooses to be one, not because he has been driven to become one. The secondary villains are also a delightfully mad bunch of idiots, killers and nutjobs, fitting perfectly into their world.The Crow is an unforgettable experience. It switches between blazing action, subtle emotions and heart-wrenching drama with such skill that it's no wonder it has become so popular over the years. If you like dark films with mystical elements, then this is definitely worth a watch.",The Crow
46,lisafordeay,First time watching this most talked about film of 1994,7,21 February 2021,The Crow is a 1994 Gothic Thriller starring the late Brandon Lee as the title charcther. The story is about a young man who's fiance and him were shot to death by an evil guy. Sometime later and the young man Eric(Lee) comes back to life and seeks revenge.What drew me to this film was the performance of Brandon Lee who sadly got shot by the actor who played the bad guy in the movie as well as the special effects on how the director was able to being Brandon Lee back from the dead using a stunt double by using Brandon's face onto the stuntman. Not one scene was I going oh this is fake(then again the movie was set at night so that explains it). If you love violent movies then check it out. For me it's a once off as I found it way too violent and disturbing.,The Crow
47,GOWBTW,Brandon Lee's Final Bow!,9,15 August 2008,"This is a movie which will mark a masterpiece of cinema excellence. Coming back from the dead is an experience no one wants to have. But when it comes to losing a loved one from a crime, the results is traumatic. The Crow gives the meaning of revenge and redemption. Brandon Lee plays in his final role as Eric, a musician whom he and his fiancée are brutally murdered. He gets to come back from the dead with a help of a magical crow. The Crow gives him power and he goes out for vengeance. The effects for this movie are excellent and the storyline is unbelievable. It is quite a shame that Brandon Lee didn't get to see the results of this film. A dragon wouldn't blend in very well in this movie. It is really good and the cast are fantastic.A great movie with tragic results. 4 out of 5 stars!",The Crow
48,hellraiser7,Soaring Avenger,10,13 June 2019,"Warning do not read unless seen movie.This film is one of my favorite films of all time and believe it or not my favorite live action comic book film of all time. There are many but this one I love because it really touched me on a lot of levels but also it was one of the inspirations for my writing as well. This film was a phenomenon from some of its style in music and wear which is now common place today and still continues on. But also really helped the comic book movie genre to soar a little higher and become what it is today. Let alone really gave us another way to look at movies and appreciate the people that make them even more than before.There is so much I love about his film. The production value is just fantastic, to this day it still amazes me. I really love the use of darkness and the black color, which fits as the graphic novel was in black and white. This really gave the film the feel of it coming straight out of the graphic novel. The city that is constructed it's a beautiful mix of the gothic and noir, it an alternate America where it is one step but also one step away. There are a lot of great cinematography shots, one of the sequences I like is seeing Eric Draven running and jumping up on the rooftops, much like Daredevil and this was way before that TV show. But it just looks cool because it was Eric's way of taking flight in the city.The music in this film is great, this film has the best soundtrack and score I've seen in any film. There are just so many memorable tunes that really fit and help bring out the gothic noir landscape but also emotion. From the song ""After the Flesh"" in that Night Club battle scene is just exciting as it just one that just pumps out manic fast action. But another which is the ""Return to the Grave"" which is just beautiful as it is both a tune of love but also sadness which perfectly reflect the dilemma of the crow.The action is very good it's well choregraphed, it's not like wall to wall but that's because it's a bit on the realistic side. We don't really see Brandon do much martial arts except a few flips, use of the katana, and one move or two. Most of what he is doing is street fighting and gunplay which makes sense Eric Draven is a rocker not a trained fighter. There are some memorable sequences, like the fight with Tin Tin where he does the knife catch as it goes in midair, I know that wouldn't work in real life, but it was fun to think you could do it.But of course one of my favorite battles of all time which is the battle in Top Dollar's Night Club which is similar to the drug plant shootout in ""Robocop"" as we just see there are just bad guys left and right, up top to bottom all shooting the hell out of him. But Eric is just blowing though the bullets while wasting every one of them with his fists, guns, and the katana. He then says one of my favorite quotes from the film ""You're all going to die."" mess with ""The Crow"" you will.But most of all I just really love the story which is uncannily similar toward ""Robocop"". Just like Alex Murphy, Eric Draven dies a violent death and comes back in a different kind of form and is even plagued by memories from his past which contain the joy of the past but also the doom of the present which drives him on his avenger crusade. Though with Alex he was resurrected with science and technology, here Eric is resurrected by supernatural and mystical force which is a crow. This concept goes back to Native American mythology and spirituality on spirit guides and animal totems.The story is a bit of a wishful fulfillment fantasy as Eric along with his girlfriend have been victimized. This gives the possibility of what if they or even you ever got the chance to fight back. Everyday some of us deep-down feel that anger and rage over anyone that has been wronged or victimized or even become one ourselves and we have the primordial need to deliver justice one way or another.I even like that it does something different with the revenge story motif from putting a supernatural/fantasy element to it but also that the protagonist does have something to come back to in the end, where in most revenge stories they don't.The characters are great, really like the Devil's Night villains whom are guys you just love to hate. All of them are just really colorful and each have their own specialties and persona, from the four man crew Tin Tin, Funboy, and T Bird (played well by underrated actor Patrick Kelly) these are pyromaniacs whom are all completely insane that just want to do simply kill and destroy whenever they want. There is one scene where their playing this drinking game and they are each swallowing bullets. Yeah, I know crazy, but it shows how each of them doing what they've been doing for so long, none of them think even death can't kill them; how wrong they all are.Top Dollar (played well by another underrated actor Michael Wincott) this guy is complete psycho by his nature but it's one of a passive aggressive nature. This guy doesn't really have much rime or reason for what he does, though in the graphic novel supposedly part of his motive for getting most of the city firebombed was his sick way of honoring his deceased parents as it was in the graphic novel. But most of all this guy just seems to have no rhyme or reason causing anarchy, chaos, and destruction just simply that he's bored and that's his way of having fun.I really like the character Sarah played by Rochelle Davis whom unfortunately hasn't done anything more. I like her because she's a person that is wise beyond her years despite her age. She's smart and has a spunk to her. She is a person that is still dealing with the loss of two of her best friends Eric and Shelly whom were sort of her brother and sister figures or in another sense almost segregate parent figures. This makes her relatable because any of us that have suffered loss at a certain point in our life and make sense out of living in an existence without them.But of course, I really like the main protagonist Eric Draven whom is another one of my favorite fictional protagonists. This is a protagonist you really have a sense of pathos for, as we see he is a person that is suffering deep pain eating at him inside and out.He's a protagonist that is up there with other tragic protagonists like ""Robocop"" and ""Darkman"" because they have one thing in common, they are people that had great aspirations in life, only for those aspirations to be gone in one day. I like the emotionality expressed and the physicality we see it feels like how any of us would feel if we all had to go through with this. Really like his outfit from the black leather coat, boots, paints, and shirt, I wanted to don those.But of course his face paint with the black eye and lip makeup which makes him seem like a heavy metal rocker but also a supernatural being. It really fits since it represents Eric as a person now a dark shadow of whom he formally was. Really like how with ""The Crow"" alter ego he is sort of a dark mischief as we see him sort of joking around a little with the villains, sort of a poetic justice redirecting the awful taunts they threw at him before destroying his and his girlfriend's lives.There are also some really touching moments, from the scenes when he is remembering most of his past which we see as flashes. That reflects how we remember things, because it's never always specific dialog but visual moments in time. Those moments really deepen the emotional weight because they display what life is made of but also how none of us truly have all the time in the world for time passes by quickly; what seems like a long time will feel like yesterday.Another favorite scene is the reunion with Sarah, at first Eric doesn't reveal himself and we see Sarah is taking about how she feels about her life without both Shelly and Eric. Just as Sarah is about to leave, we see Eric finally show up and both hug. I'll admit that put a tear or two in my eye, as this is something, we all wish would happen for any loved on in our lives lost, but I felt that scene also reflected my feelings on the loss of Brandon. Down to that very final scene which was bittersweet but still to this day still makes me cry as it really felt like I was saying farewell to a best friend.Now this moment I'm going to get real, Brandon Lee he is one of my favorite martial arts stars, he really is one of the ones that inspired me into getting into martial arts and being a martial artist. I carry on doing what I do best and love in life as many more that have and had not seen his movies but all the same his legacy lives on and just like that final line in the crow he will never be forgotten.Rating: 4 stars",The Crow
49,dee.reid,"Dark and depressing, but very good. (10/10)",10,31 October 2002,"""The Crow"", which starred the late Brandon Lee, certainly was one of the best films of 1994.  Brandon Lee, in case you don't know, was the son of martial arts star Bruce Lee, who also died while making his last film.  The story for ""The Crow"" is familiar to countless people.  Lee plays a murdered rock musician who returns from the dead as an invincible ghost of sorts. Guided by a mystical crow, he searches the dark streets looking for the thugs who killed him and his girlfriend.Dark and haunting, ""The Crow"" succeeds, despite its obviously low budget. Director Alex Proyas certainly knows how to direct a film, despite the tragic death of the films star.The camera work in this film is excellent, as is the films story.  The film is also filled with countless symbolisms and many bizarre twists, such as the Crow appearing right before someone is killed (since in the film, it is seen as an omen of certain death) or each of the thugs being killed with the tricks of their trade.Not to be missed.",The Crow
50,FilmCriticLalitRao,American director Alex Proyas' film 'The Crow' continues to enjoy its cult film status.,10,17 December 2015,"'The Crow' was American actor Brandon Lee's last film where has left indelible marks on all scenes in which he has featured. There are numerous reasons which might have compelled director Alex Proyas to choose 'The Crow' as a bird who helps a man avenge senseless killings. One should note that the crow symbolizes the perfect harmony between a bird and a human to wage a war against injustices. A crow is the best spirit animal associated with life's mysteries and magic. Apart from beautifully choreographed action scenes, it has a strong revenge story with ample scope for drama. In one of the major subplots, viewers are able to watch how a neglected child is able to get happiness when her mother realizes the mistakes she made by ignoring her. The cult film status accorded to American director Alex Proyas' film 'The Crow' is justified by all means. In 1994, at the time of its release it was hailed as both box office success as well as many critics' favorite film.It is no wonder that there is hardly any director who has artistic abilities to direct a sensible remake of 'The Crow'.This information should be taken into account to measure the overall success of the film 'The Crow'",The Crow
51,drqshadow-reviews,"Revolutionary for its Time, The Crow Feels Dated and Vain Today",4,11 January 2012,"Like leafing through an old high school journal, this was difficult to get through without cringing at every bad line and self-absorbed thought. I'd recalled the dialog as being fairly pretentious, even through the rosy-red glasses of fond remembrance, but nothing could've prepared me for just how poorly the whole package has aged over the last decade and a half. Try as he might, Brandon Lee never comes close to getting over the hump as a serious dramatic actor, even in a mostly-action setting, and the half-baked revenge formula he plods through does little to challenge convention. Though its unique visual identity is still a strong point and the soundtrack remains gigantic, there's really little else to celebrate about The Crow in a modern setting. For its time this was a fantastic comic book adaptation, but given the strides made in that field over the last ten years it really isn't even a fair fight any more. Let it live on in your memories; modern viewings do nothing but disturb a settling grave.",The Crow
52,Fluke_Skywalker,A Gothic masterpiece,10,14 March 2016,"It's amazing that a film so steeped in 90s zeitgeist also manages to feel timeless. Director Alex Proyas tells the story as a sort of Gothic tone poem, with the music and visuals creating a mood that hangs over you like a weeping sky. Brandon Lee, who was tragically killed during filming, is brilliant in what would've been a star making turn. Shifting easily between rage, compassion and humor, he transcends the typical comic book hero archetype.With its darkly beautiful visuals, pitch perfect soundtrack and excellent score, 'The Crow' remains a unique and genre defying masterpiece.",The Crow
53,jimbo-53-186511,A tragedy within a tragedy; haunting & memorable,8,1 May 2021,"When rocker Eric Draven and his fiancee Shelly Webster are tragically killed by a bunch of thugs; 1 year later Eric returns from the dead and guided by a crow (who acts as his link between the land of the living and the dead realm) Eric sets out to avenge his and his fiancee's deaths by taking each of the culprits out one by one...As a revenge-based film The Crow plays out exactly as any good vengeance based film should; it is short, action-packed and mercifully free of a lot of unnecessary exposition. Director Alex Proyas shows Eric and Shelly's backstory through flashbacks which in lesser hands could come across as cheesy, but in The Crow they do heighten Eric's pain and act as a driver for his revenge. Once Eric is back from the dead the film is fast-paced, exciting and packed with action and incident. There is also a touching moment when Eric saves the mother of a young girl he used to take care of when he was alive which was just one example of the film having some heart to it rather than just being a generic bone-crunching film.I thik what balances The Crow out so well is that not only is it action-packed, intense and fast-paced, but Draven's likeability also makes it a winner - you want him to get his revenge, you want him to help the girl etc. The fact that he isn't just doing it for himself makes it more of an emotional journey and the 2 elements moulded together make this a terrific film.Of course, the tragic real-life on-set death of Brandon Lee will always make The Crow a haunting film and perhaps it's for this reason that the film resonates with me more than some other films within the same genre. However, to me The Crow is still a brilliant film and, at least for me, a fitting legacy to an actor whose life was cut short just as he was on the ascendency.",The Crow
54,yusufpiskin,Eric The Raven,10,29 March 2018,"The question is, would The Crow be the cult movie it is today without Lee's untimely death? Possibly not, although interest in the character was strong enough to generate a dire sequel with Vincent Perez in the title role, as well as a TV series with chop-sockey C-lister Mark Dacascos. What is certain though is that, like River Phoenix and James Dean, Lee entered the grim pantheon of fast-lived good-looking corpses and thus gained a morbid immortality which no doubt adds to his popularity among his adolescent, angsty fan base. It's a popularity significantly reinforced by Lee's eerie musing on mortality during his final screen interview just days before his death. ""Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well,"" he said.. ""It all seems limitless.""",The Crow

56,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Haunting, timeless classic. As good as films get.",10,26 October 2015,"31 Days Of Horror: Day 26Not technically a horror, I know, but Alex Proyas's The Crow is close enough to the mark, and a halloween seasonal film at that, so get off my back. Plus, it's one of the best movies ever made, period. Anyone who knows me well enough is aware that my love for this one veers close to fanaticism. Now the one thing I try not to dwell on when discussing it is the tragic accidental death of young star Brandon Lee on set, a result of a grave props error. Yes it happened, but it's not the distinguishing feature of it and if anything gives the film a haunted, otherworldy, aching vibe. Lee had a star quality that burned bright in his few cinematic outings, and he's a dark prince of fierce revenge and essential 90's grunge here, playing musician Eric Draven. On a hellish, arson plagued night before Halloween in an unnamed urban sinkhole, Draven and his beautiful fiancé Shelley (Sophia Shinas) are heartlessly murdered by a marauding band of street thugs. One year later, a mysterious crow lands on Draven's grave, a harbinger of resurrection. Draven is brought back to life for one purpose: revenge against the men who killed them. For two haunting hours, Lee is a hypnotic angel of death, thrashing his guitar at the heavens atop a cathedral when he's not laying waste to the inner city scum of a city rotting at its core, yet filled with a lived in, gritty Gothic grandeur that's a testament to the set design and cinematography. Lee had a special way with dialogue thats wonderful to hear, a brisk cadence and well spoken sincerity that stands out among the crass inbreds he interacts with for much of the story. Each of the gang members are more self destructive and psychopathic than the last: Skank (Angel David) a mumbling crackhead screw up, knife throwing Tin Tin (Laurence Mason), skeevy rape fanatic Funboy (Michael Massee) and their nasty leader T Bird, played by underrated David Patrick Kelly, who shows uncanny abilities in his final scene of reckoning and realization. Their leader is a terrifying machiavellan overlord named Top Dollar, and runs every crime outlet in town. He's played by my favourite actor, Michael Wincott with a devilish, nihilistic brutality, his trademark velvet over broken glass voice, and a sense of dark, almost Poe-esque mythology. Whether burying his face in a mound of coke, hacking off limbs of disloyal cohorts with his ornate sword collection or giving a hair raising monologue on social anarchy, he's a highlight of the film and a comic book villain for the ages. Along with his kinky sister Myca (Bai Ling, who he also bangs >:), and his suave first lieutenant Grange (Candyman himself, Tony Todd) he launches an all out war against Draven, rallying every lowlife, gutter rat and junkie with a gun to find him. Meanwhile kind hearted police officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is on his case as well, and young Sarah (Rochelle Davis), Eric's friend, misses him and searches the streets for someone to care for her while her deadbeat slutty mother (Anna Thompson) does drugs with Funboy. There's scene stealing work from Jon Polito as deplorably scuzzy pawn shop proprietor Gideon, the black humored comic relief of the movie. There's such an organic, fluid energy to this film, every beat hitting the mark, the editing a precise symphony of image and sound that leaves you wanting more and keeps you coming back. The ethereal score by Graeme Revell is a mothwinged lullaby of mythic proportions accented by fitting work from The Cure, and every performance is exactly and perfectly what it needs to be. Not to mention the production and costume design, setting a mood of brooding tragedy, burning romanticism, dark emotional torment and surreal Gothic characters that should have their own action figure set. There's endlessly quotable lines in the script penned from James O Barr's comic book as well, from offbeat humour, to poignant poetry and all kinds of profane and threatening utterances. It's as near to a perfect film as one can get, and hovers around in my top five of all time. A classic.",The Crow
57,hu675,Excellent Dark Fantasy Thriller.,9,31 July 2005,"Eric Draven (The Late Brandon Lee) and Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) have been murdered in Devil's Night by a vicious gang of murderers (David Patrick Kelly, Angel David, Michael Massee & Laurence Mason).

58,rooprect,This movie will infect your soul,9,23 August 2012,"What can I say. Each day I find myself quoting The Crow at least a dozen times. Usually people just give me strange looks. Sometimes (like when I say, ""I got stabbed! I shot the sonnovabitch! I watched the bullet hole close by itself. And then my business gets blown up real good. Other than that, my day sucked!"") people call security on me.This movie is a one-of-a-kind. It's grunge, it's goth, it's dark, it's funny, it's touching and it's inspiring... even if it merely inspires you to slap mime makeup on your face and walk the streets at night yelling, ""I guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy, huh SKANK?!!""Seriously, as Roger Ebert said, it's an experience. Even though the plot is pretty straightforward (rockstar gets killed & comes back from the grave to seek revenge), it's done in a way that keeps you riveted every minute. The same way ""Peewee's Big Adventure"" is just about a guy looking for his bike, The Crow takes the same approach of using a minimalist plot and coating it in heaps of style, music and surreal visuals. Except The Crow has a few dozen more murders than Peewee.What makes this film a visual feast is the way it stylistically mirrors the comic book that inspired it. Like the comic, it's very monochrome... almost black & white, but with some icy tints to it. It has a very wet look to it, making it seem glossy and muted at the same time. Like another favourite film of mine ""City of Lost Children"", it achieves a certain vivid appearance even though the colour palette is very limited.As far as action flicks go, this is quite a literary extravaganza. Quotes from Poe's ""The Raven"", Milton's ""Paradise Lost"", Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" and who knows what else, lend an air of classiness and antiquity to the film. And of course the movie generates its own memorable quotes. Like ""Greed is for amateurs. Disorder, chaos, anarchy... now that's fun!"" Paired with an entertaining script full of great zingers, the acting is first rate all around. Each & every character, no matter how large or minor, delivers a memorable performance. Of course Brandon Lee is the standout, playing the cold-hearted, vengeful killer but with a gentleness that makes you want to take him home to meet your folks. Conversely, the bad guys are brutal but so comic you can't help but love them.A word about Brandon's death... yes, it's true that he was killed by a malfunctioning prop gun during the apartment scene. But that reel of film was reportedly destroyed by the director. The movie still had several scenes that needed to be filmed, and the director compensated by recycling other scenes with some very interesting effects. For example, when Brandon punches the mirror, it's actually a double punching the mirror with Brandon's ""reflection"" (from another scene) digitally imposed on the glass. Tricks like that are not obvious, and they add a certain otherworldly feel to the movie. It also makes the film feel more fragmented and incomplete (in a good way), leaving more to the imagination. If you're like me and you hate movies that over-explain everything, the minimalistic presentation of The Crow will be right up your alley.Lastly, the music. If you were alive & remotely cool in the 90s you'll love the soundtrack. The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, Violent Femmes, Stone Temple Pilots, Henry Rollins, the list goes on...If you're familiar with the director Alex Proyas, you'll recognize this as possibly his greatest work (alongside ""Dark City"", ""Garage Days"" and some great, surreal music videos like Sting ""All This Time""). The feel of The Crow is also reminiscent of director Frank Miller's work (""The Spirit"", ""Sin City""). And although I haven't seen it, I've heard the Batman film ""Dark Knight"" pays tribute to this film, particularly Heath Ledger's Joker who is hauntingly close to Brandon Lee's character. If you like artsy movies, this fits right in, reminding me of Jean Pierre Jeunet (""City of Lost Children"", ""Delicatessen"") and the darker side of Tim Burton (""Sweeny Todd""). Maybe there's even a bit of ""Blade Runner"" thrown in.If you get a chance, see The Crow on a rainy night with all the lights off. Lose yourself in the mood, the music and the memory of Brandon, the greatest star who never was. Halloween is coming up, so get your favourite Crow costume ready. If you live in a sheltered town like mine, chances are nobody will recognize who you're supposed to be. Although quite a few people think I'm Edward Scissorhands who is also pretty cool, so whatever...",The Crow

It's still a pretty good movie, but far from great. The main problem is that it's theme is serious, but it's funny body. Everything's over-the-too in thus film, homor, action, acting, etc. It's a fun watch, but I believe it would have had been a lot better if it was darker and more serious, like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight or Watchmen.",The Crow

This is unfortunate for star Brandon Lee and would be his final film role as he died making this due to an accident on set. Borrowing a lot from the horror genre, the movie has a dark atmosphere and has a Gothic/industrial music soundtrack in the background. The revenge theme is played out here as Eric Draven (Lee) returns from the dead to send his killers of himself and his girlfriend to hell. The fights are savage and don't come across as too slick or choreographed. The gunplay gives a nod to John Woo with double revolver shootouts. The supporting cast is good, especially Ernie Hudson.

But their deaths was unjust and Draven, with the help of a raven, one who connects the living with the afterlife, Draven returns to claim revenge. And the punishment can only be death.Alone, Draven takes on the entire criminal organization of crime lord Top Dollar, whose gang killed him once. And it is easy, since Draven is already dead and can't be hurt. He is indestructible and invincible. Until Top Dollar figures out that it is the raven that gives Draven his superhuman powers.Not a very entertaining story, since it doesn't get any suspense until the final ten minutes, and barely then either. Draven, with his powers, is simply to powerful. There is no threat to him. What it is is an action packed dark story. The scenery is very dark, it is always raining and the Gothic influence is heavy. Visually it is interesting, but not very good either.Had Draven been vulnerable somehow, this could have been really good. Now, ironically, it is mostly known and interesting since lead actor Brandon Lee died in an accident while filming it. Had the accident never occurred, I believe this movie would have been forgotten long ago.I feel that it is a movie one should have seen. But it wasn't very memorable, unfortunately.4/10",The Crow

Much like his father's tragic ending, he too had a film that was being made when he came to the same conclusion in his life. Much of the public had no clue who Brandon Lee was until he was dead. While the Martial Arts audience knew a lot about him, the typical American movie audience hadn't a clue. The same went for the movie. Not too many people knew what it was about or who the star of the film was. Because of the so called ""mystery"" and ""conspiracy"" behind his death, Brandon Lee's end made The Crow an instant Cult Classic.A story of revenge and timeless love, The Crow is an interesting film with a great supporting casts. Ernie Hudson along with others create well rounded and very dark cast which Brandon Lee does justice as the movie's star.

64,rbverhoef,See it for its visual style and Lee,5,29 February 2004,"'The Crow' has two interesting things. The first is Brandon Lee's final performance, since this is the movie where he was killed in the making. His performance, may be because he was killed, is very interesting. The other reason to see this movie is the visual style. With a great production design and a very fine cinematography you almost have the perfect look for a comic book movie, what 'The Crow' is. The movie is dark, may be a little too dark at times, but knows its main characters and therefore chooses this great look.Still, for me it was not enough to like this movie. There were single scenes I did like but as a whole it wasn't very good. There is no story at all. Brandon Lee is Eric. He is killed and his wife is beaten and raped and dies in the hospital as well. According to the movie a crow takes your soul after you die. When the soul is not able to rest the crow can bring you back to make things right. Eric is brought back and it is time for revenge.It is not that I always want a story. Some movies have almost no story but are great anyway. This is not the kind of movie that can realize that.

Alex Proyas' direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. Despite some brief but poor visual effects, it holds up really well with great production design. The music by Graeme Revell is also great.",The Crow
66,a_chinn,Classic film overshadowed by Lee's Untimely Death,9,29 April 2017,"Terrific film that is often overshadowed by it's notoriety over Brandon Lee's unfortunate death. Based on the cult comic by James O'Barr, this film, adapted by splatterpunk writer David J. Schow, is true to it's source material, but director Alex Proyas, in his feature film debut, unmistakably leave his mark on the film. The story has Lee and his girlfriend are murdered by gang members, but Lee is resurrected as an avenging angel, or crow, who then seeks his revenge upon those who killed him and raped and murdered his girlfriend. Lee gives a strong performance in a part that easily could have been swallowed up under all the make-up, atmosphere, and action. With this as his final film appearance, it's purely speculative, but I really do believe this would have been his breakout film and would have made him a huge star. Besides Lee the film is bolstered by a strong supporting cast that includes Michael Wincott (who was all over the place in the 90s, but seems to have since disappeared), the underused Ernie Hudson, Bai Ling, Anna Thomson, the great David Patrick Kelly, Tony Todd, and Jon Polito. Production designer Alex McDowell also gets big props for his contribution to the film's moody fell, as does cinematographer Dariusz Wolski. Graeme Revell provides a terrific score that I regularly listen to to this day, but I think one of the major heroes of this film is the soundtrack, led off by the title song by The Cure. Back in the day I played this soundtrack endlessness. Some of the tracks, particularly the grunge ones, don't hold up so well (i.e. Stone Temple Pilots or For Love Not Lisa), but others like The Cure, Rage Against The Machine, Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band, and even My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult still hold up. It's a killer soundtrack and is once again on high rotation in my car. The soundtrack alone should earn this film another star. But overall, this is a smart, scrappy, dark fantasy, that does deserve it's cult following.",The Crow
67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Solid, Dark Comic Book Film",7,23 July 2019,"This was a film that I only remember when it came out because of the controversy of its star, Brandon Lee, passing away during the filming. I never actually saw this film until after college and I did enjoy it. I got the chance for my second viewing to be in the theater I'm a member at as part of their Summer of 1994 series. The synopsis is a man brutally murdered comes back to life as an undead avenger of his and his fiancée's murder.We start this film on Devil's Night, which is an event in Detroit the day before Halloween. There are a ton of fires going on around the city, but we focus on an apartment that belongs to Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiancée Shelly (Sofia Shinas). They were supposed to be getting married on the following day, but they were attacked. Eric was thrown from their window, killing him. Shelly was raped and brutally beaten. Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is there and he gets scolded by a detective for messing with his crime scene. On the way to the ambulance, a girl Sarah (Rochelle Davis) asks about the two who were attacked. She is quite close to them.It then shifts a year into the future. We learn through some voice-over narration that the crow takes the souls to the land of the dead. If something really bad happens, it can return it to the body to get vengeance. That's what happens here. Eric wakes up in his grave and returns to his apartment. He is quite upset about what has happened and decides to get his revenge.Those that attacked him are led by T-Bird (David Patrick Kelly). Working with him are Skank (Angel David), Tin Tin (Laurence Mason) and Funboy (Michael Massee). Eric's path starts with Tin Tin. It then leads him to Gideon (Jon Polito) and his pawn shop. When he blows it up, it draws the attention of Albrecht, who starts to look into the old case. On top of that, he also draws the attention of Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), Myca (Bai Ling) and Grange (Tony Todd). Top Dollar is actually T-Bird's boss and doesn't like what happened to Gideon's. He also doesn't like his men being picked off. Myca seems to know the lore about the crow and what is happening here, which means she might know of a way to stop him.Something that I remembered from the first time I saw this film was that it really feels like a comic book movie. That makes sense as it was based off a strip as well as being expanded into much larger form there. I will admit, I give the film a pass for some of its CGI look at the city since it has its roots in comic books.I do like the idea of this story. I know that crows are definitely birds that are associated with the underworld. There is a moment where Eric quotes Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven, which I thought was interesting. I know I've looked up what the difference is, but it is something that is escaping me while writing this. The lore that is used here that the crow can bring the soul back is good. The issue I had though was that I don't like Eric being invincible. This does get resolved late in the film, but I think I would have liked this to be explored earlier on.Since I've brought up how this is a comic book film, I love that they went rated R on this one. It is actually quite violent and I was down with that. The crime that is committed against Eric and Shelly is pretty heinous that the revenge he gets is quite justified. I like that he does mimic the same death with just different items. I almost would have liked to see that a bit more, but it does become problematic with some of the people he goes after.I do have to admit something here though; I do feel that this film has some pacing issues. I think that the film is too long for one thing. There are a quite a few scenes of Eric just brooding about what happened to him. I don't want all of them cut out, but we don't need as many of them as we get. I think that actually really hurt the film for me. I don't expect it to be all action all the time, but there had to be different things to do to break up the action if I'm perfectly honest. I do like how it ends and the stakes being raised for sure though.Something that I didn't have any issues with was the acting. Lee was really good here. He just had a good look about him and he really brought this character to life. I like the charisma that he had for sure. Davis was solid in her performance. She has a difficult role as she needs to act more adult, because her mother is an addict and she really has to take care of herself. I thought that she definitely played that pretty well. It was nice to see Hudson here. I thought he was good. Wincott, Ling, Kelly, Todd and the rest of the criminals I thought were all solid. Shinas has a minor role, but she was quite easy on the eyes. I would say that the rest of the cast did round out the film for what was needed.To move next to the effects of the film, I have to say that they're pretty hit or miss for me. The practical effects, like the blood and the deaths actually were good. I thought they looked pretty real which is all I can ask for. The problem comes from the CGI that is used. There are a few times that the crow was CGI and didn't look good. I can't fault it too much, but it did take me out at times. I won't hold it against the movie the city being CGI, as it has a comic book feel. The only real issue is with the CGI fire. I've said it before, this is actually an issue we still see today. I do think the film was shot well, which is definitely a plus.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack, which I really liked. They did go heavy with the rock music and it fit. Eric was in a rock band before dying and I like that they embodied that. I also think it works because the city is dirty so it helps to establish that gritty feel.Now with that said, this film I did really enjoy the first time I saw it, but I do think after this second viewing my rating is coming down a bit. It does do some good things. First being that it's based off of a comic book, I like that they went with the hard R rating on this. The crime that starts this all is pretty heinous and makes the revenge work better for me. I like the lore that is used here, but I do think that they made Eric a bit too powerful for too long. The pacing of the film did have some issues for me, but I do like how things played out. There is just some filler that could be trimmed. The acting is good across the board, with a pretty solid cast. The practical effects of the film are good, but the CGI really isn't. Soundtrack of the film was also good and definitely helped to build how the film needed to feel. I would say that this film is definitely worth a watch, especially if you are into comic book films. I do have to say that this is above average for me though.",The Crow
68,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A missed anti-hero,9,4 June 2014,"If there's one movie that will be forever known as the late Brandon Lee's best movie, it is this one. Sadly, the son of famous martial arts master Bruce Lee, would too suffer from a fatal injury on set, leading to his untimely death before this cult classic was released. What's completely astonishing though, is how well this movie was put together even after Lee's death. One would almost think that Lee only had died after the filming, but not so. There were several edits, body doubles and even CGI used to make it look like Lee was in whole film throughout. For 1994, that's extremely impressive. But this isn't the only outstanding thing to this comic book movie. There's very little to nit pick about.The story is about Eric Draven, a regular everyday man who witnesses the brutal rape and murder of his wife to-be and is killed off as well. This all happens during Halloween (or Devil's Night as its called) in a crime ridden city where buildings are set ablaze just for fun. A year later, Draven is resurrected by a single crow to take vengeance upon the people who took his and wife's life that same night. In the simplest of terms, it is a revenge story, but the execution is done in such a way that gives depth to each character on screen. Alex Proyas, who begins his directorial debut here, keeps a steady pace as well. Of course, the person who carries majority of the entertainment is Brandon Lee.Brandon Lee as Eric Draven gives a performance that feels natural. His delivery of lines are not over-the-top campy, nor are they boring. His voice allows the character to sound serious or kind whenever it is needed. The costume design is also great looking as well. It matches not only the Gothic tone, but also the whole design as a comic book movie. Attempting to understand Draven's case is Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson). Hudson is one of those actors who most viewers enjoy in whatever film he stars in because of how relaxed he comes across. The main villain behind Devil's Night is called Top Dollar (Michael Wincott) who also gives a performance that is precise with his delivery. He's an anarchist, so all he wants is chaos, thus creating Devil's Night.The violence portrayed here is another strong point. There's no plotting or brooding. All it is, is pure vengeance and no holds bar. It's taking care of business with no thinking which is beneficial to this kind of revenge film. That and the dialog used throughout each scene makes the revenge feel that much more justified. What's surprising, is how it feels like this is the movie that inspired other anti-hero films to do the same kind of theatrics. For example, having an outline symbol lit by flames? The Punisher (2004) and Daredevil (2003) performed those same types of moves during their moments of payback. The Crow (1994) is still the antihero that started it all and should be given respected for that.The special effects have aged rather well too. With most of the background being dark with either black or grey, it's difficult to see what was enhanced by computer and what wasn't. The crows themselves are hard to distinguish between actor and CGI. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is neat with panning shots of the city that'll make the viewer feel like they are the crow in the sky gliding across the landscape. Wolski would later do all the cinematography for all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The editing is also competently done considering it looks like Lee was on set for the whole movie even though he died during filming. The only thing that could've been slightly fixed was the music. Graeme Revell's score does contain a soft reoccurring theme, which focuses that on Draven's humanity and love for his wife with gentle flutes. Revell's music also contains saxophone, which is rare for an action film but it works. It makes it feel like a film noir in some senses. Yet, the score lacks any real action cues, other than tribal drums, which make it feel empty in some cases. Also, it's understood that the movie has a Gothic tone but including metal bands in a few scenes wasn't necessary either. Instead Revell could've included tunes that particularly enhanced them with more power and emotion. Other than that, there really isn't anything to truly be upset about. It's one of those rare, dark comic book adaptations that any comic book reader should watch.Although it was Brandon Lee's last film, it's one of his best. The action is dark, special effects look good and the actors pitch great performances. It's Graeme Revell's score that could use some improvement although it is still a special element to the film.",The Crow

70,Matt_Layden,Tragic And Gothic Film.,8,20 July 2009,"The Crow is a film that I knew I would like before I even watched it. Directed by Alex Proyas, who also directed my favourite sci/fi flick of all time, Dark City, works his Gothic magic here and shows us that not all fantasy/comic book films have to be immature.Whenever I talk to people about The Crow, they either love it (because it's apparently the new emo thing to do, just like Darko) or hate it because it was too dark. Both of these reasons are unfair to an intelligent and well directed film.Although the idea of revenge in films has been done to death numerous times before, The Crow takes a unique approach to the subject. This is mainly due to the main character himself, who is a favourite of mine. Well acted by Brandon Lee, who tragically died on the set of the film. Much like the death of health Ledger, one can only imagine what his career would have been like if he were still alive today.Alex Proyas is someone to look out for in his future projects, his weakest film, I, Robot is still pretty decent. I think he is underrated as is this film. It's a shame that they made so many crappy sequels that the original sometimes gets thrown into that bad mix. I mean come on, Furlong as The Crow? I can't take that seriously. As it is today, this film stands out from those and many other comic book flicks. It's definitely in my top 5 comic book adaptations and in a sense it breaks that genre, well before Dark Knight did. But not many people see that.If you haven't seen this one, pick it up now. It's Gothic atmosphere, great direction and acting will draw you in. The story of love, revenge and redemption is one for the ages.",The Crow
71,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Crow""- A Gothic masterpiece of action, suspense and emotion. One of the defining films of the 90's.",10,15 May 2017,"""People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.""Those are the words that usher us into the world of director Alex Proyas' legendary film ""The Crow,"" based of course on the beloved comic book created by James O'Barr. The film is a defining masterpiece of its decade, and a dark and Gothic portrayal of action, romance and vengeance that thrilled audiences and remains a cult-classic to this very day, more than twenty years later. Though overshadowed by the tragic loss of its star Brandon Lee, whom was accidentally killed in an on-set incident, the fact remains that there's something special here. Something that cannot be stopped by the misfortune of Lee's passing. Something provocative and moving. Something that spoke to audiences when it was released in 1994 and still very much does.The film follows Eric Draven (Lee), a rock-and-roll guitarist who is slain- along with his fiancée Shelly- the night before their wedding in an apparent gang attack. One year later, he is brought back to life through the power of a crow- who are said to carry the souls of the dead into the afterlife. Now granted an array of supernatural (and superhuman) abilities that render him seemingly immortal, Eric stalks the night on a mission of revenge against those who destroyed his life. He receives help from Sarah (Rochelle Davis), a young girl who had befriended Shelly before her death and kind-hearted cop Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) in his hunt for retribution. What Eric doesn't realize, however, is just how far into the dark and criminal underworld he'll have to go, nor will he be able to predict the severity and intricacy of his search...I think a great deal of the magic of ""The Crow"" lies in the fact that while not particularly original and reliant on plenty of cliché and convention, it fundamentally excels at everything it sets out to do with a level of style and competence that is far beyond the standard Hollywood film. We've seen this story and these ideas before. But not told in quite this same way. The film isn't content with just giving us a standard visual palette... instead it crafts a complex and Gothic atmosphere that's striking and visually engaging, and combines different filmmaking techniques to create a world all its own. The characters aren't just archetypes... they're fully fleshed out and even the more minor of characters are given a great deal of establishment and development. The film doesn't just follow the standard path... but rather it gives us a stirring narrative where stakes are constantly raised and because of the supernatural elements at play, we can never guess what's going to come next. The original comic came from a very unique place, and it's clear that the cast and crew of the film are going above and beyond to craft a masterpiece.To build upon this, the performances are a phenomena and lend much to the story. Lee is a revelation, and injects not only plenty of pathos and agony into the role of Draven... but also a large amount of hope and joy. Conflicted though he may be, he's still willing to do the right thing by other people and to help them even in his war of violence and vengeance. Hudson and Davis round out our protagonists in nuanced and sensitive roles that very much compliment Draven's struggles and help to inject some heart into the narrative so that it never feels bogged down by the rampant darkness of the story. And our villains- including David Patrick Kelly, Tony Todd, Bai Ling and the extremely underrated Michael Wincott are all deliciously evil, yet still feel somewhat grounded and ""real."" It's a great rogues gallery for Draven to face off against with some top- notch performers behind them.And finally, the film is a complete powerhouse of visual storytelling. As mentioned above, director Alex Proyas seemingly builds and entire new world with the help of writers David J. Schow and John Shirley, in addition to his inspiration from James O'Barr's original comic. The colors are cold and stark. The designs sharp and vast. And the contrast in color and darkness is simply outstanding. Proyas takes inspiration from many sources and his slick, flowing camera-work perfectly compliments the twisted Gothic world that is crafted. He knows how to showcase both his actors and his sets for maximum emotional impact, and the film is never anything less than completely absorbing and wondrous to behold.""The Crow"" is by far and quite easily one of the defining films of the 1990's. With an impact still being felt to this day, definitive demonstrations of themes and visual nuances, stunning performances and a memorable message, it's no wonder why the film has maintained such a strong and dedicated following. And though its effects and ideals might feel somewhat antiquated or even dated by films that have gone on to successfully improve on the techniques used and defined here, you simply cannot downplay how big an impact its had on popular culture. It's a stunning work of art through-and- through and easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",The Crow
72,mjw2305,Brandon Lee - A Great loss to the Movie world,8,29 December 2006,"The Crow sadly turned out to be Brandon Lee's swan song, but if a movie was ever befitting such an honour, this was undoubtedly it.Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) was a rock star who was brutally murdered along with his girlfriend on devil's night. One year later he is granted superhuman strength and vision so he can seek vengeance on those responsible.This terrifically dark and Gothic style fantasy is truly compelling and charged with emotion. The action is used sparingly to great effect creating some fantastic scenes that are both visually impressive and brilliantly entertaining. The story, the direction and the performance from Brandon Lee are all excellent.The Crow is a great movie 8/10 R.I.P Brandon, you're fans miss you",The Crow
73,Howlin Wolf,A Boy and his Bird...,8,2 September 2007,"Aside from the impeccably created landscape that the events of the movie take place in; ""The Crow"" works for two reasons: The villains of the piece are completely despicable, so we root for their comeuppance to be justifiably served, and also the avenger in this case is played by Brandon Lee. This perfect casting of both 'good' and 'evil' is crucial to the film's success. You could see that Brandon was such a genuine and emotionally honest performer, even though he was still just a fledgling in career terms by 1993. It helps that the lines are so clearly drawn, because we can then take total pleasure from the artfully constructed, gloomy setting.All of the main cast do well, but there is an especially wicked delight to be drawn from Michael Wincott's portrayal. On the evidence of this he deserves a much higher profile, because he's utterly magnetic at every point within the movie. All good confrontations need a memorable hero and villain - we get both here. So allow the darkness to envelop you, don't even think about entertaining any of the amateurish sequels, and let Alex Proyas and Co. take you on a gut-wrenching journey of dogged retribution.",The Crow
74,Xstal,Mime from Hell...,6,19 September 2020,"Future flavours and concentrates abound for epic movies that would appear a decade or more later in various superhero franchise and still do. It's also riven by Noirish elements of some years precedent and consumes a significant measure of Goth/Punk music culture and stylisation e.g. The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie Sue, X-Ray Specs and Gene Loves Jezebel, none of which would have looked out of place on set. Shows its age a bit now but the themes are perpetual.",The Crow
75,bobsgrock,Follow the black bird.,9,4 August 2011,"Eighteen years after the terribly unfortunate death of future star Brandon Lee and it still cannot be accepted any easier. Seventeen years after the release of The Crow and it remains the dark, stylish comic adaptation it was celebrated as. This film holds up remarkably well, the computer effects adding rather than subtracting from the story, which is by itself more than rich enough to carry the film. Here we have one of the most common and potentially powerful story lines in the movies: a dead soul returns to Earth (usually one year later) to exact revenge on those who put him here in the first place. However, thanks to the powerful storytelling of James O'Barr and director Alex Proyas fantastic direction, the film focuses not simply on the acts of revenge themselves but also on the protagonist's relationships with the people around him. Most effective of all is the memory element in which the resurrected Eric Draven must recall various timeless moments spent with his slain fiancée and the young girl they cared for. Here is where the film gets the bulk of its emotional material, which makes the acts of revenge at once both violent and satisfying.So much has been written about Lee's performance and the cutting short of his promising career. This is all true but to focus on this film, he creates a sympathetic, driven individual who must sacrifice his own desires to complete this mission he is sent back for. The supernatural element is effective without being too ridiculous, the set design is one of the best ever created and the acting carries the heavy scenes all the way, paving the way for a startling and satisfying conclusion. The themes may be familiar, but the style and substance with which it is presented on screen is unsurpassed. Watching this film, one cannot help but feel that heavy tone of elegiac sadness which hangs over the entire production. Of course it is because of Lee but also because of the story itself. When tragedy strikes, the best the living can do for the dead is love them. This is as emotionally powerful and moving as films get.",The Crow
76,fmarkland32,Watching you like a hawk...,8,1 August 2006,"Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven a rock star who was killed on the night before his wedding along with his girlfriend Shelly(Sofia Shinas) however a year later Draven rises from the dead and looks to avenge himself and his girlfriend's death. David Patrick Kelly, Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson co-star in this dark yet romantic vigilante thriller. I remember reading about how Brandon Lee died on the set of The Crow and all the comparisons to his father and all that jazz, however despite Lee's tragic death, The Crow is easily his best work. (Keep in mind I haven't seen Laser Mission and Legacy Of Rage, although I have ordered Legacy on Amazon) Brandon Lee is an action star who I have always thought of as too much of a nice guy to really get down and dirty to take out the bad guys, this time this usual weakness actually becomes the film's biggest strength. Lee's nice guy approach to the madness that occupies his character works in creating more impact than usual. Also it helps that Lee speaks almost beautiful dialog when dispatching the bad guys. In fact there is one startling scene where Lee doesn't even speak and let's the bad guy figure it all out on his own, to which the bad guy says ""Abashed the devil stood and felt awful goodness is..."" This is a great movie. I can see why so many people like it, it is one of the few revenge movies out there that actually rise above guilty pleasure and provide a show worth seeing over and over again.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very Good)",The Crow
77,jon.h.ochiai,Candle in the wind...,9,22 August 2001,"Alex Proyas's ""The Crow"" was an amazing piece of work. ""The Crow"" is on the surface a brutal and unforgiving tale of vengeance, that somehow transforms itself into a truly touching Gothic romance. And the tragedy of it all is that it was both a milestone performance and the last performance of Brandon Lee. Brandon totally commands the screen. He had true screen presence. Charismatic. Handsome. He was an excellent martial artist, who had the grace of a dancer. Lee gave Eric Draven a soul. You understand his anger and sadness. His relationship in the world of the living with Sarah (Rochelle Davis) is both touching and moving. Through Lee's performance you get that ultimately this path of violence and vengeance is really about his undying love for Shelly (Sofia Shinas). Brandon Lee will forever remain young in the movies. He would have been the next great martial arts superstars... and he would have become a gifted actor. There is sense of loss in this.",The Crow

79,stamper,This is a movie the way I like'em,8,5 August 2000,"The Crow should be, hell is a classic (you can tell by the way it is done, plus they are making tons of sequels etc.) and it rightly so is one. It has got a good and fitting soundtrack, a dark town (very Blade Runner), a determined yet cool' hero, freaked out bad guys (I especially like Michael Wincott, he's made some cool movies, like Alien Resurrection and Metro (OK this wasn't like a Hit, but it was better than Murphy's other sh.t, like Nutty Professor 1 + 2, Doctor Dolittle and so on)). Plus the film has got a lot of emotion (greatly brought forward by the music of Graeme Revell as well), mysticism, a few jokes and good characters. That along with the good story, the good direction plus the good cast makes this really worth a look. I only wonder what is up with that editing, was the movie edited cause it was too violent or was it just badly edited (101 Minutes was printed on the package, but the ending credits started after 90 minutes (I guess they included Brandon Lee's last interview in the running time) . Well when I'm stepping on bad things here I might just as well mention the other thing. This film was not as exciting and I wasn't on the edge of my seat, hey but no film is perfect (that's why my highest vote is a 9 out of 10).
The thing I liked most about this movie was Brandon Lee (a pity he had to leave this world so early). He played a freaked and psychotic hero really good and cool. Plus he played the guitar pretty good and walked around as what most people though was supposed to be some kind of a clown. To me it was more like a dark, rock and gothic avenger, why, cause I'd like it that way. I think people who dress up like that and walk around have got balls plus they are original and I like them for that. That's also why I like Eric Draven as the Avenger. OK it looks cool too and I probably wouldn't have liked it if it would have been, like Clint Eastwoood, but what the hell.

81,cchase,A Classic Genre Role For An Immortal Hero...,8,5 December 2008,"We'll probably never know what would've happened to the first movie in THE CROW series, if Brandon Lee were still walking around today. Unfortunately, it will forever be stained with the reputation as the film that ultimately led to his death, and because of that fact, even today it carries with it an aura of mystery and a powerful attraction for the morbidly curious. It's worth noting that it's also one helluva good-looking, well-paced Gothic drama.The graphic novel by James O'Barr, upon which THE CROW is based, was less the product of a dark and disturbed mind than the result of O'Barr metaphorically cutting himself wide open and just splattering his guts all over the pages. As a way of dealing with the shocking and untimely death of his fiancée, (yes, that really DID happen), this pitch-black drama is the result.Set in a bleakly nihilistic future, it's the story of struggling rock musician and artist Eric Draven, (Lee), and his girlfriend Shelley (Sofia Shinas), who become the latest victims of a brutal crime wave instigated by crazed kingpin Top Dollar (Michael Wincott). By the power of supernatural events and sheer force of will, Draven comes back from the dead and literally rips his way through the crime lord's minions to get to him. Of course, not a lot of this attracts the attention of local law enforcement, save the man who is probably the last good cop left in the world, let alone the entire city, Sergeant Albrecht (Ernie Hudson.) Witnessing all the carnage is a young girl named Sarah (Rochelle Davis) the narrator of the story, who together with Albrecht are basically the only friends the undead vigilante has. Directed by DARK CITY'S Alex Proyas from a pretty faithful screenplay by horror author David J. Schow and John Shirley, THE CROW was one of the innovative Gothic dramas based on graphic novels, that successfully paved the way for so many of the others that have come out since (FROM HELL, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, V FOR VENDETTA, etc.) All of them have their merit, but none have quite the oppressive feel for gloom and doom that THE CROW has. Much of this quality is due to the outstanding job on production design by Alex McDowell and the cinematography of Dariusz Wolski, whose pictures painted so evocatively with textures and shadows recall the best work of the late, great Conrad Hall.But great movies don't get that way based strictly on the technical aspects, and I do believe that if he had lived, Brandon Lee's rage-and-angst-filled performance as the anguished (and unendingly angry) Draven would've finally gotten him the notice, respect and the kind of work that he craved so much while building the foundation for his career. And because he steps up so intensely with his work, it makes the rest of the cast raise their game as well. Genre favorites abound here, from GHOSTBUSTER'S Hudson and Wincott, to DREAMSCAPE'S David Patrick Kelly and longtime vet and perennial heavy Jon Polito. Also helping it's classic cult status is a killer soundtrack that has to be one of the best ""alterna-goth"" collections in genre history (a close tie with RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE LOST BOYS.) This was the time when I either ""discovered"" or re-discovered bands such as The Cure (""Burn""), Machines of Loving Grace (""Golgotha Tenement Blues""), NIN/Trent Reznor (""Dead Souls"") and Stone Temple Pilots (""Big Empty"").Also cementing its eternally creepy cachet is the fact that it was one of the first movies ever to use ""digital technology"" to manipulate the image of an actor unavailable to ""finish"" his role, (the film was completed after Brandon's death.) Only the sharpest of eyes might be able to figure out where the real Brandon's performance ends and the ""digital stand-in's"" begins, but then again, why bother? This is his legacy, and even if it weren't, the movie deserves better than merely that kind of scrutiny.This is just one more classic that demands to become a permanent part of your library.",The Crow
82,Maziun,Beware the revenge of The Crow,8,8 November 2013,"""The Crow"" is adapted from James O'Barr's 1989 graphic novel. It's not the first movie made by Alex Proyas (his debut was an obscure arty post-holocaust film ""Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds"" from 1989) , but it's the one movie that made him famous and promised a great things in the future from Proyas . Along with ""The Dark city"" it's still his best movie , despite it's been almost 20 years since it's premiere. At it's heart it's a simple revenge movie told with lot of mood . It has soul and it's one of best comic book movies.Alex Proyas is a former music video director and it shows here . The movie resembles an rock video . There is a lot of rock songs in the background , the main hero is an ex-rockstar , the whole movie feels like a energetic video clip. ""The Crow"" is a dark movie with black and white easily dominating the screen. It's not a black and white movie , yet other colors are lifeless , well fitting with the overall mood of the movie. ""The Crow"" easily draws you in it's world , into this unnamed city and it's residents. The Gothic architecture reminds of Tim Burton's ""Batman"". The grotesque parody of clown makeup on Brandon Lee's face feels strangely familiar to Heath Ledger's joker in ""The Dark knight"". There are more similarities between two actors – both movies are great , they both died in suspicious circumstances at the peek of their careers , both actors and movies gained a massive cult following.Brandon Lee gives a good performance . It's not as amazing as Ledger's and definitely not an Oscar material , yet it is obviously his best performance and proof that he had potential to become a real legend. The movie is dedicated to Brandon and Eliza. Eliza Hutton is a fiancée of Brandon . They were to have been married less than two weeks after the film wrapped. It's obvious that ""The Crow"" attracted attention in the media because of Brandon Lee's tragic death . The story about a youth brutally killed in his prime so ironically reflected events in real life. Keith David gives a good support as the experienced cop and friend of Eric. The action set-pieces are immensely exciting . Instead of typical summer blockbuster one – liners we have lines like : ""Mother is the name of God on every child's lips,"" ""Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were trivial. Believe me, nothing is ever trivial."" Quite poetic.My advice – don't listen to all those rumors about Brandon's death or his father's , Bruce Lee death too . Just enjoy this movie . A well crafted arty entertainment. Watch this and don't waste your time on the lame sequels. I give it 8/10.",The Crow

85,rebeljenn,"a good film, not for the birds",6,8 November 2005,"'The Crow' was one of the popular movies during my years growing up. In that time, Metallica was popular, and there were a lot of goths. This film really appealed to them because it had the whole goth, dark style, the sadness/bittersweet love, and the music appreciated so much by that audience. This film succeeded very well in capturing the hearts of the young goth in the late 1980s and early 1990s.This film would probably be best enjoyed by those who grew up with it, because I think it has so much more meaning beyond its story and visuals. Done well, this film has a little bit of everything and there isn't any reason why someone watching it today for the first time would not enjoy it.",The Crow
86,Ben_Cheshire,The Myth of The Crow,7,12 February 2004,"The Crow opens with a voiceover reading this myth: ""People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it, and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back, to put the wrong things right.""The Crow is mythmaking at its best. Eric Draven (Lee) is brought back from the dead to avenge the rape and murder of his wife and his own murder. While filming the scene where his character is shot dead at the beginning of The Crow, in order to return to life as an immortal Jesus figure, the cap from the blank hit him and lodged in his spine, and Brandon Lee died. The way Lee's death on set at that particular moment fit into the myth of the movie is just as much to do with the cult status of this picture, as its fantastic gothic landscape, exciting story, gorgeous score and irresistable central figure.Brandon Lee, being interviewed about The Crow, was asked about death and his character in the film. He said this:""Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. And yet everything happens only a certain number of times. And a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood. An afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it. Perhaps four or five times or more. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.""He died not long after. This was his last interview.",The Crow
87,DarthVoorhees,Worthy outing by Proyas,8,24 September 2007,Is the Crow a great film? No but Proyas' masterful directing makes it a much better one. The Crow is your standard vigilante revenge flick with some odd improvements to make it different. The story isn't original you can catch glimpses of other things in there. However I do have to recommend The Crow.The Late Brandon Lee makes his exit on a high note. The movie is all too ironic for him because his tragic death matches that of his characters all most on the dot. Lee creates an interesting character. I suspect that had he lived he could have been more than just your action star.Proyas deserves all the credit in the world. He is the driving force behind this movie. He gives a Gothic feel and the visuals and camera work are absolutely gorgeous. Tim Burton get's praised for doing half of what Proyas does. He is our greatest dark film maker.,The Crow
88,PersianPlaya408,One of the best films ever,10,21 August 2006,"Proyas's dark film about a brutally murdered man who comes back from the dead to punish those who hurt him and his fiancé'e. The book which is adapted from a comic is written well and directed very well by Proyas. I liked Brandon Lee a lot in the lead here, shame what happened to him. This Gothic suspenseful flick is done very well, great cinematography from Dariusz Woltski and i loved the songs used, great soundtrack. Michael Wincott is a great villain, and i thought the rest of the cast was decent as well. This early film from Proyas makes me anxious to check out I, Robot. This was an amazing film-- IMDb rating: 7.4, my rating: 10/10",The Crow
89,cardsrock,Through the crow's eyes,8,29 July 2019,"The tragic death of Brandon Lee looms large over this film, however, it only immortalizes his performance in this fascinating film. The style and production design are incredibly unique and help give The Crow a distinctive feel. It does hit some familiar revenge story beats, though the story has enough dramatic heft to overpower them. The Crow is a touching, stylish take on the classic revenge story.",The Crow
90,garethcrook,Real love is forever...,8,15 January 2020,"Teenage me loved this film. I mean adored it. Partly for the aesthetic and a lot for its soundtrack. The soundtrack still stands up, it's the perfect slice of 90s fused industrial goth rock. NIN, The Cure, Mary Chain and the still fantastically named My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, it was rarely out of my tape deck. Much was made of the loss of star Brandon Lee during filming, an accident with a gun sadly taking him at only 28. This really played into its instant cult appeal and of course only fuelled the dark tone of the film. This film isn't depressing though, it's hopeful, celebratory and smothered in revenge. It's pretty simple. Good guy comes back from the dead on Devils Night, a year after his death, to avenge his and the life of his fiancé. Systematically working his way through a gang of druggy occult loving criminals, all whilst coming to terms with his new found post-mortality, through flashbacks so stylised they instantly date it like a pop video. Lee is the epitome of the screen hero and style icon, donning the iconic make up and leather within the opening quarter hour. I'll be honest, the plot is basic, ridiculously predicable and obviously far-fetched. That's not really the point though, this is comic book fantasy territory (based on original work), each revenge scene set on a different page, tied together loosely in world in perpetual darkness, where it ""Can't rain all the time"", but seemingly does. It's over the top, packed with humour, playful and totally stands up. Yes it's of it's time, but it plays to that strength, classic good and evil. Even down to the casting, Lee is every bit the poster boy, head gangster Micheal Wincott is the very opposite, so much so I've always had a vivid distaste of him, something about his face I really dislike, he might be a nice bloke off screen but I find him revolting. Granted there may be some of my teenage goth tendencies influencing me here, but I still love this and I'm glad I took the time to revisit it, after all ""Real love is forever"". Right, where's my black lipstick and eyeliner?",The Crow
91,thekingsdom,Second Time Around: Meh,5,12 October 2020,"I watched this on VHS when it first came out when I was 23. I loved it. But now at 49, it's just pants. It's very badly acted, it has cheap sets and it's just not very good. Bottom line in 2020: 5/10",The Crow
92,Darth_Osmosis,A Gothic comic book masterpiece.,10,16 April 2012,"The crow, is a tale of loss and retribution, love and sadness, but not without hope or it's fair share of (dark and sarcastic)humor! The main character portrayed brilliantly by Brandon Lee, is sympathetic, poetic and sometimes even philosophical, which doesn't in any way stop him from being also a total badass. The atmosphere and setting are amazing. The film manages to create a desolate urban environment, where it seems to constantly rain, and be a perpetual night. We get sweeping and awe inspiring looks of the city rooftops, and of it's dark crime infested alleyways. The supporting cast also does a wonderful job of creating despicable villains who yet doing horrible deeds manage to be entertaining and never dull, and also some innocent characters who show that not all is lost and there is hope still. Dialogue fitting the rest of the movie is never altogether happy, manages to be impressing as well. It will leave you with many memorable lines that you remember long after seeing the movie. When there are quotes of John Milton and Edgar Allan Poe, but it's the original lines that stand out the most it should say something! The action scenes are top notch, can be a bit graphic if you don't like violence, but as with the dialogue, there are many scenes that are iconic and memorable. All of it is stylized, but strays never too far from realism. Soundtrack manages to fill the movie mainly with 90's metal and grunge, which is to say with music that feels as natural in this movie as birds singing in Bambi. I am not gonna talk about the story itself, cause I want everybody to see this film. It's a milestone and a blueprint of how dark fantasy should be handled! 10/10 cause I can't think of anything that I didn't like or felt it could have been improved on in this movie.",The Crow
93,chrisbrown6453,What a finely directed film.,8,15 May 2002,"As everyone already knows, actor Brandon Lee, son of Bruce, was accidentally killed during the filming of The Crow. His character in the film, Eric Draven, makes a spectacular return from the dead, making the coincidence all the more eerie. Lee actually died when hit with live ammunition during the filming of a shoot-out, but the living-dead Draven is magically healed each time a bad guy blasts him. Sticks and stones won't break his bones, and bullets will never harm him. Evidently, a double has been used to fill in the scenes that remained to be filmed at the time of the accident, but the movie is so shadowy and Lee's features so obscured by makeup that it is hard to tell what was done after the star's demise. Some computer trickery was also employed. The comic strip-inspired, action-packed adventure is quite something to see. The Crow is an art decorator/production designer's dream and should have been an Oscar contender. The MTVish direction is of the cut-and-run variety, but that is understandable when you read Alex Proyas's credits. He has directed commercials for Nike, Swatch, Nissan and Kleenex. The story is really secondary to the showy style. Draven and his girlfriend are murdered by thugs who invade their inner-city apartment. On a dark and stormy night that follows, Eric steps out of his grave and goes for revenge. Wearing black lip gloss, straggly curls and white pancake makeup, Lee looks a bit like a mime moonlighting as Michael Jackson. Accompanied by a big crow, the vengeful Eric sets about ridding his neighborhood of the resident lowlife. The dark and disturbing urban fantasy about a boy and his bird turns out to be more Death Wish than Edward Scrissorhands.",The Crow
94,hellholehorror,Gothic masterpiece,10,22 September 2021,"It looks a little dated. Some of the visual effects are really poor! But it looks gritty which isn't the best look for impressiveness. It is the only style that this movie could have had and so it looks amazing. It is good to see no computer generated effects. The sound has a subtle mix that can be very active when required. I liked the sound design in general a lot except that the dialogue was a little too quiet (not badly prioritised but overall too quiet). This is a true gothic masterpiece. The story is amazing, the concept is unbelievable, the acting is spot-on and the gothic atmosphere is the star of this classic movie. There is such a tragic story behind the film with is mimicked in the brooding moody and tragic story on-screen. A rare classic movie with a beautiful gothic noir style.",The Crow
95,DavidSim240183,"A dark, textured tale of vengeance",10,16 May 2007,"The Crow will always be forever remembered for the notoriety surrounding it concerning Brandon Lee's on-set death. Such a tragedy, for if he had lived, he undoubtedly would have gone on to even greater things. Because he was more than just a fine martial artist (inherited from Bruce), he had true talent as an actor too. Nevertheless, Lee's death added an additional layer of symbolism to what was an already excellent undead revenge tale. It elevates it to classic status.Although in some ways The Crow has a fairly standard revenge plot, its added considerable depth and intelligence, not only because the subject matter becomes intertwined with Lee's real life circumstances, but also because of a rich and accessible screenplay by David J Schow and John Shirley, and the excellent kinetic direction by Alex Proyas.Alex Proyas originated as an MTV director. Usually whenever I see directors branch out into feature films whose background consists of music videos I get apprehensive. About 80% of them turn out films that are all style and no substance to speak of. Joel Schumacher is a particularly guilty offender.Proyas is that rare exception where he can create an atmosphere that becomes substance. He first demonstrated this ability with The Crow, and then outdid himself with his next venture, the quite extraordinary Dark City. One of the most intelligent science-fiction films ever made.The opening shots of The Crow highlight a devastated city. The night before Halloween. Or Devil's Night as its called here. A city in flames. On this unholy night, Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiancée Shelly are both killed by a ruthless gang of street hoods on the evening before their wedding day.Even at this early stage, we know anything can and will happen. In contrast to the violence on display, a child's voice narrates. A child called Sarah (Rochelle Davis' first and only film). She tells the haunting story of how a crow can bring the dead back to Earth to conclude unfinished business.And that's what happens to Eric. The following year, Eric claws his way out of his grave. Reborn. As an avenger of the night. Ready to take revenge on those who robbed him of his life. With the crow as his guide.The Crow is one of the greatest revenge tales ever made. Second only to Sin City, an equally brilliant comic book to film adaptation. Proyas gets right into the heart of it with barnstorming regard. And delivers on every level. From the very second Eric rediscovers himself as The Crow, its just the launching pad for a dizzying, exhilarating adventure.Brandon Lee was perfectly cast. Even when he's buried under striking makeup, he embodies the role so completely that he becomes the living personification of an avenging angel. Something I haven't seen since Tim Burton's Batman.His rich, baritone voice helps no end. And Proyas does everything he can to ensure that Lee cuts a striking, intimidating figure. Some of the camera shots gloriously highlight Lee's frame against a backdrop of breathtaking sunsets and ominous city streets. When he swoops through the air and makes his presence felt, he feels like a comic book character made flesh. One that's stepped right off the printed page. Into our world.The Crow is very exciting. And the whole tone of the film is as thrilling as its possible to get from this type of story. The action scenes are handled with almost operatic reverence. And its a testament to Lee's abilities as an actor that he's not swallowed up by the gritty, neo-noir world Proyas has surrounded him with.But The Crow is not always about the next kinetically driven action scene. Some moments are more thoughtful. And allows us to plumb the psychological depths of Lee's character. His scenes with Sarah are both haunting and poignant. She was Eric's friend in life. And remains his friend in death. Davis made an astonishing debut. Almost as astonishing as Lee's. Such an assured and commanding performance from someone so young. What a shame she never had the film career she so richly deserved. Again, like Lee.And Lee's scenes with Ernie Hudson are rewarding too. He plays a police sergeant who slowly sympathises with The Crow, and eventually helps him to bring down the gang. Schow and Shirley craft some exquisite dialogue from these two characters, and its all delivered perfectly too:""Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were trivial. Nothing is trivial.""The grand finale is worthy of epic status. A final battle between the living and the dead. All helped with Proyas' atmospheric direction, and Graeme Revell's chilling, resonant musical score. The finishing touch to a superb, modern classic.As tragic as Lee's death was, it granted The Crow a unique place in history, and afforded it an immortality. This is one film that shall never be forgotten.",The Crow
96,domino1003,Brandon Lee's Swan Song,9,25 January 2006,"""The Crow"" will always be remembered not for its story of revenge from beyond the grave, but the tragic death of Brandon Lee, who was shot by a faulty gun prop (And giving conspiracy fans reason to believe that Brandon and his legendary father Bruce Lee were cursed). It's too bad, because this is an exceptional movie.Lee plays Eric Draven, a musician who is murdered on Devil's Night. His fiancée is raped and beaten before she dies in the hospital. It seems that his fiancée was trying to stop the violence in her neighborhood created by Top Dollar (Michael Wincott)and his gang. However, just because you're dead doesn't mean things are settled. A year later, Eric climbs out of his grave, seeking revenge on the guys that put him and his fiancée six feet under. All of this has to do with the myth of the crow, which carries the link between the land of the living and the dead.Eric has an advantage over the guys that he is about to kill: Nothing can kill him and nothing can harm him (When he gets shot, the bullet-holes close right up, as if they never happened). With the help of Sgt. Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), Eric goes to work.Things don't turn out completely cut and dry, especially when Top Dollar and his half-sister Myca (Bai Ling)cause a few roadblocks on the road to vengeance.Alex Proyas (Who would later direct ""Dark City"" and ""I, Robot"") created a film that is kinetic and energetic (With a soundtrack of songs from Nine Inch Nails and Stone Temple Pilots among others). A film that is fast paced, yet emotional at the same time. A fitting tribute to Lee, whose performance will be remembered for a long time.",The Crow
97,AvidClimber,The Crow — Revenge from beyond the grave on a human level and emotional,9,11 February 2013,"The Crow is by now a cult movie. Although it's getting a bit old for some of its special effects, it's still excellent.The soundtrack, especially the music, is exceptional. It's edgy, dark, and the emotions it stirs get you in the guts. It's a mirror image of the story. The revenge theme, certainly isn't new, not even one from beyond the grave, but the angle chosen here, is quite different. It's touching.You get a great mix of action, emotional drama, ghostly romance, and human relations, often dark and twisted, other times simple or basic. The sets are very dark and strongly Gothic. The acting is not perfect, but still strong and just.There are a few mistakes, not big, but at times noticeable, like some bad sound pickups. However, they seem to make the film into some sort of archaic rendition, which really works to its advantage.I recommend it if you don't mind its age.",The Crow

The acting from everyone was great, Brandon Lee's role as The Crow was fantastic he really did a great performance since he showed the characters rage and sorrow for what happened. The plot sees a young couple murdered by a gang on a night called Devil's Night, one year later and a Crow flies down by the grave of Eric Draven who was murdered by them, he rises from his grave and follows the Crow to his old apartment where he then remembers what happened and soon puts on the make up, dresses in a black outfit and goes out to kill the people who murdered him and his girlfriend, a girl named Sarah who was friends with Eric and his girlfriend and a cop that was at the crime scene soon discover that it is Eric and soon he meets up with both of them, the gang soon come up with a plan to stop Eric since if the Crow is killed then Eric will lose his power and they can kill him but Eric will stop at nothing to kill them.

99,lagudafuad,The best of the them all,8,27 December 2012,"The Crow has reached an iconic high in the movie realm, mostly because it was the last movie that Brandon Lee stared him, as he Brandon died on set during the production of the film; his death was due to a gunshot. The gun was supposed to be loaded with blanks, but one life ammunition bullet was lodged in the gun that was then loaded with blanks. His death on set made the movie gross more than the producers could ever imagine and turned this movie to a cult classic.The movie is an adaptation of a comic book series of the same name, that was created by James O'Barr and it tells the tale of the life of Eric (Brandon Lee). Eric and his fiancée were attacked at their home, Eric got shot and he was paralyzed, and could only watch as Shelly his fiancée is savagely beaten and raped. The attackers finally kill Eric.But a year later Eric is resurrected by a crow, now he hunts the men that killed him and his fiancée, Eric is now an undead, unable to be killed or hurt (as long as he stays on course, which is revenge on those who killed him and his fiancée).The movie boasts of fast paced action, the movie adaption of the comic is seen by many to be near accurate. The movie's cinematography is engaging as we mostly are moving around with Eric in the night, the camera angles or light feed never make you wish that there were gotten from another shot or you needing more light. Then there is the score, the dark rocky score that brings you into the melancholy mood of Eric as you watch, the movie doesn't at any time take you to a high of good things happening then brings you back to the main dark theme Alex Proyas (the director, and also director of Dark City (1998) and I, Robot) made sure that from the get go of this movie you are introduced to a sad theme, a sad scene, a sad story and it the movie keeps to that till the end.The Crow goes places other hero movies don't want to go, no breather just darkness.The movies special effects were most rewarding and the story is very engaging a fit none of the other sequels after it has been able to accomplish, as more sequels were being released the worse the ratings they were getting, making this movie stand out the more.A remake of this said ""untouchable classic"" is being done, the argument is will this remake be as good as the original or is it just going to follow the way all the other sequels went. My take on this is, Hollywood filmmakers are now at the end of their rope, going back to remake movies or dragging them into trilogies just to make more money, the remake falls into this suit if you ask me (suit of not having an idea of what movie to do), because such movies like this should never be remade. That said, I will be watching the remake with high hopes, reason being times have changed, 1994 and now that is more than 18 years, enough technological advancement that could not be employed in 1994 will be used in this remake, I just hope it won't suck.www.lagsreviews.com",The Crow

I did the same thing with the Usual uspects and that turned out to be one of the best films I have seen. The Crow was dark, atmospheric and stylish. It was a real comic to film classic and perhaps dare I say it the best. Brandon Lee was outstanding in this, his presence on screen was amazing. I had only previously seen him in Showdown in little tokyo and Rapid fire and while he could obviously fight and do much of his stunt work, I was not overly impressed with his acting. In the Crow he gives his last and best perfromance in his best film and its a shame his blossoming career was tragically cut short I feel he could be one of the main action stars out here today. I liked the Crow immensly, I admitadly didn't think I would but this, like the Terminator is a true classic B-Movie which has become a cult classic and spawned inferior sequals and a sub-standard TV series that wasted the talents of Mark Dacascos.

101,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,28 February 2005,"Pulp Fiction? Forrest Gump? Nah, this is what should have won the Best Film Oscar in 94. The best comic book film ever made, surpassing even Batman and Superman, The Crow is one film that will remain eternal, and never age over the years. Its story may be simple, but it is executed with such style and heart that it will never become unfashionable, and although the sequels have so far been poor, this is unmissable. Action, humour, love, and a visual flare that only Burton can match, The Crow, as Brandon Lee's last film has a massive cult following and was hailed by many critics.Eric Draven, a rock musician and his girlfriend Shelley are brutally killed on Halloween by the members of a local gang. The case is never solved, but cop Albrecht stayed with Shelley in the hospital for the many hours before she died. He has gone on with his job in the stinking city, occasionally meeting with Sarah, a young girl who was friends with Eric and Shelley, whose mother is a waster and addict. One year later, Draven returns from the grave, terrified and tortured until he remembers what has happened. A Crow seems to look after him and he is invincible. He soon sets out for revenge, picking off the gang members one by one, on his way to Top Dollar, the leader. Although he tries to hide, he eventually shows himself to Sarah and Albrecht, and they work together. Soon Draven and Top Dollar square off, but The Crow has been injured, and Draven's power has gone.Never before has such a beautiful film been made. Only Scissorhands can equal this, but even it has a different style. The sweeping views of the city, a terrible place to be, are stunning, with camera angles the Matrix would emulate. The soundtrack adds immensely, both the rock songs, and the instrumental tracks, making the film all the more powerful. The acting is all immense, though understated and quiet for the most part. Lee gives his best performance and it is a remarkable one, going through the emotions of the character, as well as doing the stunts. Of course, this would cost him his life, tragically echoing the story. In fact, the story seems to have been cursed from the start, with creator O'Barr basing the story and character on the real events of his life-his girlfriend being killed and the emotions he went through. Davis as Sarah gives a strong performance too, and could have had the world at her feet, but vowed never to return to the set and has not acted since Lee's death. Hudson gives a career best, and Wincott gives his usual snarling effort, here it is superb and has not been bettered. All the other cast members are great too, the gang members each well drawn and acted to perfection.The story is told with such skill that you can't help to feel such sympathy for the characters, and Sarah's monologues are very emphatic. Draven is a strong character, getting a second chance to do things right, and saying that yes- scumbags who kill do deserve to die also. These bad guys have no redeeming qualities, and their deaths are satisfying. The script is also awesome, and their are many one-liners, and these are not stupid either, but have meaning. If their were only a handful of films from this decade which survived a war, or which could be used to show humanity, this would be one of them. Easily one of the best movies of the decade which should continue to be seen by all.10 out of 10",The Crow
102,thomasjay-2201,"Brutal, gothic masterpiece",10,2 September 2019,"The crow has its slot in pop culture history for many a reason and is known by all in passing at least. Released at a time in the early onslaught of comic book films it arguably slightly suffers from the fact that it's fairly similar, visually at least to others such as the batman films released at the same time, however, it's more bold and brave with what it chooses to show, Lee delivers an exceptional performance and the slow, methodical pursuit his character, Eric ensues upon to avenge himself and his wife is enthralling to watch and feels pressured with the compressed time limit of one night ensuring a thrill ride of high octane action. Genuinely a fantastic film that should be more appreciated for its quality opposed to solely on set affairs its one in half I finally managed to see",The Crow

104,jayjaycee,Believe in Angels,10,2 November 2019,"""The Crow"" is a 1994 comic book drama directed by Alex Proyas starring Brandon Lee and Ernie Hudson. This is honestly one of those few movies that personally mean so much to me. Over the years, I've always been rewatching it every Devil's Night - it became sort of a tradition to honour this absolute masterpiece. It's the movie where the lines between fiction and reality overlap in such a devastating way. To this day, the people talk about the tragic incident that cost uprising actor Brandon Lee his life. You can literally feel the pain of this loss in the whole production. It's dark, depressing and devastating throughout, not only by the heartbreaking premise, also by what happened on set. Some characters and dialogue might be a little cheesy compared to modern standards, but that's what gives this movie it's weird charme. It assembles a pretty decent cast and they're all delivering great performances. The atmosphere is packing from start to finish and perfectly captured by the phenomenal cinematography. The third act especially gets me every time, it's just beautifully tragic and gives me goosebumps, because it's so heartbreaking. All in all, this film is an outstanding comic book adaption, both stylish and original, creating a tragic drama that will haunt you for a long time, by both it's dark and depressing themes and real life tragedy aspect. As always, rest in peace, Brandon Lee. You're gone too soon.",The Crow
105,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Stylish And Haunting Comic Book Adaptation And A Classic With A Brilliant,Unforgettable Final Performance From Brandon Lee(RIP).",10,8 December 2013,"The Crow is an excellent,stylish and haunting classic and one of the greatest Comic Book films ever made that's filled amazing direction,a brilliant,unforgettable final performance from Brandon Lee,a great cast,thrilling Action,beautiful photography,a terrific score and Rock soundtrack. All of those elements make The Crow a Cult Classic and a powerful movie experience.Based on James O'Barr Comic Book Series and Comic Strip and set in Detroit,Michigan,The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven(Brandon Lee),a rock musician who along with his fiancée Shelly(Sofia Shinas)were assaulted and murdered by a group of thugs on Devil's Night,the night before Halloween. A year later after the murder,Eric is brought back from the grave to get revenge on the killers who murdered him and his fiancée and wants vengeance at all costs.Released in 1994,The Crow is brilliant and powerful film that came out a year after the tragic death of Brandon Lee(the son of the late,great legendary Martial Arts/Kung-Fu Icon Bruce Lee)who died on the set after an unfortunate accident while making the film. Although Brandon Lee's death loomed over the movie,The Crow became a critical and box office success and also became a Cult Film thanks to Brandon Lee's final performance and is seen as one of the best Comic Book films ever made. The Crow is an amazing film that right from the beginning pulls into a dark,Gothic nightmare that is grim and gloomy and looks like a Graphic novel coming to life with beauty and ugliness but is also a movie that is Action-packed and visually stunning and when you see The Crow the first time it will blow your mind. The Crow is a film that deals with themes such as tragedy,death,revenge and love which gives the movie a sadness that surrounds the film's atmosphere as well as the characters which gives The Crow depth and substance. Another thing I love about The Crow is the style and look of the movie thanks to the beautiful camera work and lighting by Dariusz Wolski. Wolski's photography and lighting gives The Crow a great and unique look that is in the style of Film Noir and Dystopian with rainy streets and buildings that are in the dark with the movie almost giving the film a timeless quality that combines the look of Tim Burton's Batman and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner because with The Crow you as a viewer don't know if it's the past,present or future. The Crow is also in the style of Film Noir with the characters attitudes which are cynical and bleak with no happy ending satisfaction. The main character Eric Draven is one of the best characters in a comic book film because even though Draven is back from the dead and looking for revenge he has depth and sympathy while having good(Draven's time with Shelly)and bad memories(him and Shelly's murder)which gives Draven and the film great power because what The Crow tells viewers even when you're dead a person still has a memory. Eric Draven is a character who represents the dark and gloomy tone and when he is off the screen you can feel Draven's presence because he represents violence,death and darkness. Eric Draven is a incredible character that you will never forget and is a character that will forever be a Cult icon and a classic anti hero that is timeless and for the ages. The Action scenes in The Crow are fantastic and done with a great pace and style which is fierce and at times brutal but if you are an Action movie lover the Action will have you foaming at the mouth and will keep glued to the screen with Action scenes of intensity,great excitement and explosive thrills. The ending of The Crow is amazing, beautiful and bittersweet because with the ending you will feel happy and sad for Eric Draven. A great conclusion.The whole cast is terrific. Brandon Lee is excellent and unforgettable as Eric Draven,with Lee bringing depth,sadness and charisma to the performance. R.I.P Brandon Lee,you and your acting talent were gone too soon. Rochelle Davis is wonderful as Sarah,Eric's friend. Ernie Hudsen is terrific as Sergeant Albrecht,a cop that helps Eric. Michael Wincott is amazing as Top Dollar,a local crime boss. Anna Thomson is fantastic as Darla,Sarah's drug addicted Mother. David Patrick Kelly(T-Bird),Angel David(Skank),Laurence Mason(Tin Tin)and Michael Masse(Funboy)do great jobs as Top Dollar's henchmen. Jon Polito is outstanding and funny as Gideon,a pawn shop owner. Sofia Shinas is beautiful and memorable as Shelly,Eric's fiancé. Tony Todd(Grange),Bai Ling(Myca) and Marco Rodriguez(Torres)give good performances as well. The direction by Alex Ployas is brilliant and stylish,with Ployas always moving the camera giving the film a dark and grim visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Ployas.The score by Graeme Revell is terrific,haunting and unforgettable and adds to the tone of the film. Great score,Revell. There is also an amazing soundtrack with songs by Nine Inch Nails(Dead Souls),Stone Temple Pilots(Big Empty),The Cure(Burn),Pantera(The Badge),Rage Against The Machine(Darkness),Rollins Band(Ghostrider),Medicine(Time Baby III)and more. Fantastic soundtrack.In final word,if you love Action Films or Comic Book Movies,I highly suggest you see The Crow,an excellent,stylish Comic adaptation and classic that you can watch again and again and belongs in every movie lover's collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Crow
106,flicklover,One of the best comic book films ever!!!,9,5 April 2020,"Even though I liked comic books when I was younger I wouldn't say I was deeply a fan. I was into the more popular, mainstream comics. I had never heard of The Crow comic when the film was released. Of course there was some controversy regarding the untimely death of the film's star Brandon Lee in an on set accident with a gun. I went into the film not expecting much. I was blown away by what I saw!!! To this day I believe it is one of the best films of it's kind ever.The story is basically a revenge story. A young guy named Eric Draven and his fiance are murdered by some thugs in their own apartment. Eric is brought back from the dead by a crow to avenge what was done to him and his fiance. It is a very basic revenge plot. He comes back fro. The dead and adopts the persona of the crow. The scene where he paints his face and dresses as the character is really great. The look of the film is up until that time the best representation of a comic on screen IMO. The look of the film is very dark and gothic. It fits the comic book vision perfectly. The soundtrack that is dominated by alternative rock is great. I bought the soundtrack and still listen to this day. Brandon Led is great as Eric. The performance is very sad and full of rage. Obviously, the fact that he died in the making of the film his performance has more weight. I think he would have had a really good career. The director was a veteran music video director and it shows. He blends the music and the rapid fire editing is done very well though the film is not confusing. The main villain is Top Dollar played by Michael Wincott in a very good but somewhat funny performance. Ernie Hudson plays a cop that had gone to the hospital to see Eric's fiance before she died and he befriends Eric. Understanding that he us out for revenge. There is also a girl named Sara that was very close to both Eric and his fiance that figures out that he is back. All of the action is very well done, the film is very fast paced but never tiresome. This mix of action and melancholy makes The Crow a great comic book film that has grown its reputation since it came out in 1994.Grade: A-",The Crow
107,Darkest_Rose,Dreaming The Crow-Black Dream...,6,5 May 2003,"After Eric Draven(Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend Shelly(Sofia Shinas) are brutally attacked and murdered, Eric comes back from the dead a year later along with a black crow to seek revenge on those who have destroyed his love. This movie wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Sure, it was very dark and gothic just the way that I like it but I think there was a lack of character development. We never really find out what the secret is behind each character and why exactly they do the things they do and also the story was fairly predictable. And there also was too much action and fighting which isn't really my style. However, it had a few beautiful moments and lines that made me like and appreciate the movie for what it is.""Buildings Burn and People Die But Real Love Is Forever"".

108,jonathanruano,The Crow,7,19 October 2012,"In ""The Crow,"" Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) comes back from the dead as a Marilyn Manson-wannabe and exacts a brutal revenge against several criminals for killing him and his girlfriend. The plot is as simple as that, but the movie plays well because Brandon Lee's portrayal of Draven as a man consumed with insanity and rage is highly original. The movie works best with those scenes where Brandon Lee is just talking to the criminals before beating them to a pulp or killing them in highly gratuitous ways that impress even the head villain. Yet this film is also less entertaining when the movie shifts away from Lee's intense lines of dialogue to the card board villains (which are as two dimensional as any of the villains in the Karate kid movies or most of the Steven Seagal films), the cops that play the role of incompetent spectators (much like they did in the first Die Hard film), and the action sequences which for the most part come straight off the assembly line of most Hollywood action pictures. ""The Crow"" is not a bad film, but it comes across only as a competently made picture that depends almost entirely on Brandon Lee's bravura performance.",The Crow
109,Jerique,Happy Halloween!,9,17 January 2009,"Brandon Lee's epic performance is left behind in this legendary movie in which he will forever be remembered as the very first ""Crow."" Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) are killed just before they are set to be married. A year later, while visiting their graves, Sarah (Rochelle Davis) notices a crow atop of Eric's gravestone (""who are you, the night watchman?""). When Sarah leaves, the crow somehow resurrects Eric back to life. When he revisits his old place, he find himself to be invincible and paints himself. He goes on a mission to get revenge on the people who stole his life away.The plot of the movie is inspiring even though it's about revenge and murder. It makes a new hero, who is immortal, unless his crow is killed or damaged. The villains are played well and the characters are easy to hate, but you love to hate them. There is cool visual effects and memorable quotes that you'll probably be quoting for dozens of years after viewing the film.The cinematography is dark and with the constant rain you really get a feel of how the characters feel. The heroes Eric and Sarah are developed well and the friendship between Eric and Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) is wonderful due to the good chemistry. The only shame of this film is the real life death of Brandon Lee which caused him to be replaced in the sequel by a different actor and character.It's been 14 years since the movie was released, but I still love it like it was released yesterday.

That is of course, if you like the idea of a man shooting criminals for being involved with murdering and raping his girlfriend. I'm not going to write a very lengthy review, but I'm just going to say this.. this movie's exciting.At first, it may seem that this movie just features a man smiling killing people and laughing every time he gets a wound and it heals, but this movie packs in a lot of humor, action, gore, and more. It doesn't feature any plot twists. In fact, the whole movie is about the man taking his revenge on others, but that's alright with me.Overall, I recommend you to buy this movie. No, not rent.

112,mistoppi,Enchanting and brutal,10,4 April 2017,"I've watched a lot of movies that are about revenge, and most of them are just action movies that don't really capture the darkness of revenge and the human soul in those kind of movies. The Crow is one of the very few revenge themed movies that is as dark as needed, and it doesn't exactly make revenge seem more glorious than it is. The Crow is brutal and violent, but there are also some really beautiful, comforting parts, which make the film stand out from the typical films of the genre.The cinematography is amazing, it's like a beautiful comic book. There's a lot of contrast, loads of black, but still surprisingly much colour. The palette is breathtaking. The cinematography is gruesomely beautiful, considering what they show and what they don't show, and how it's shown.The soundtrack is great, but a bit surprising here and there. Then again, of course such a goth classic would use The Cure in the soundtrack.The Crow is an enchanting, beautiful yet brutal movie, and it's definitely worth watching. Even if you don't care about the genre or a story, what happened to Brandon Lee should be enough to pique your interest.",The Crow
113,rparham,"An overrated ""classic""",6,5 April 2012,"When first released in 1994, The Crow came with a lot of baggage attached. Star Brandon Lee, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee, had died during the production of the film due to a mishap with a prop firearm. The producers and director Alex Proyas, who had largely finished the film, elected to reshoot a small amount and utilize emerging digital technology to composite Brandon Lee into a select number of scenes as well as using a body double in some cases. When it hit screens in May, critical reception was largely warm. From then until now, I have stood as one of the seemingly small cadre of individuals who found The Crow, Brandon Lee's tragic passing notwithstanding, to be considerably overrated, full of style, but largely hollow at the core.For the most part, The Crow is a revenge film dressed up with mystical elements. One year after Eric Draven (Lee) and fiancé Shelly (Sofia Shinas) were killed in a violent home invasion, Draven is resurrected from his grave by the presence of a crow, which has seemingly returned his soul to him to avenge his and Shelly's murder. Draven runs into former friends along the way, including largely ignored young girl Sarah (Rochelle Davis) and police officer Albrecht (Ernie Hudson), whom he occasionally ponders life and death with. Draven's targets are a small group of criminals, led by T-Bird (David Patrick Kelley), who works for Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), the crime boss of Detroit. Draven begins working through T-Bird's crew to reach Top Dollar, but Dollar's girlfriend, Myca (Bai Ling), realizes the source of Draven's power is the crow, and Top Dollar plots to take Draven down.The Crow's key weakness is the shallowness of the characters. While it is hard to know whether some aspects of the film were affected by Lee's death and subsequent re-editing, but both Eric and Shelly are largely ciphers, revealed to us only via very limited flashbacks, but not given much depth or development. We are supposed to feel for them because the screenplay requires it, not because of any genuine interest in them. Without this identification with the victims, it is almost impossible to be involved in the film on a visceral level. There are moments when their plight is moving, but those are few and far between. The rest of the time, The Crow is not really anything special. Draven, seeking retribution for his death and loss, mows down each one of T-Bird's henchmen, using their particular vices or skills to make for stylish deaths (One is impaled on a half-dozen knives, another overdosed on a plethora of hypodermic needles filled with drugs). Some of the action sequences are well staged, but rarely are they exciting or involving.The film's villains are also a bit underwhelming. Wincott, as Top Dollar, has a terrific raspy voice that gives Top Dollar a degree of menace, but still comes up wanting as a memorable screen heavy. T-Bird and his co-horts are barely on screen enough to register, and since they are largely drug addicts, some of them flail about wildly and are almost caricatures, not characters. The film does provide some interesting moments as Eric reconnects with friends from a prior life, but those are just glimpses of a film that is more interested in sweeping camera shots and violent death scenes.The Crow is also not exactly an upbeat film. It was based on a comic series by author James O'Barr who tragically lost his family, and The Crow was an attempt by him to provide some catharsis to those events. The Crow mediates on life and death at times, but the oppressiveness of the narrative occasionally threatens to swallow it. I am hardly one to shy away from films with downbeat material, to be sure, but without the character foundation to provide support, the darkness of The Crow sometimes seems a bit much.Many gave Brandon Lee positive notices for his last performance in this film, and he is fairly accomplished in the role. While he isn't given a lot to work with, what moments of pathos The Crow offers are in many cases due to Lee's work. It was a shame and tragedy that he died so young, on the cusp of attaining stardom. The Crow was also the film that brought director Alex Proyas to the attention of American audiences, lensing the film in largely dark and dank environments, crafting an decaying urban environment that fits the narrative. Not many years after Batman, The Crow certainly appears to offer some degree of homage to the design of Tim Burton's breakthrough success. The Crow is a very stylish affair, but good looks without a strong narrative are nothing but pretty pictures.The Crow is not a meritless film, and some moments work, but for the most part it smacks of a film that attracted a great deal of attention due to the controversy surrounding it than for its substance. The Crow would go on to be followed by one theatrical sequel, The Crow: City of Angels, which would prove abysmal, and then two other, direct to video sequels that few people probably realize ever existed. The original film is the crown jewel in that franchise, but the praise is misplaced from my point of view, affection for a film that didn't really deserve it, while its lead actor actually did. The Crow is an unfortunate end to a career, and life, cut far too short.",The Crow
114,AwesomeWolf,Excellent,10,29 November 2004,"'The Crow' - the final movie of Brandon Lee and his finest hour, and one of the best movies ever. Brandon starred as Eric Draven, a musician living with his fiancée, Shelley. Life for them was perfect, but on Devil's Night, everything changed. Eric was murdered, but Shelley was beaten and raped, and the last thirty hours of her life were filled with nothing but pain. Exactly one year later, Eric is brought back to seek out and gain his revenge on those responsible.The story is great, despite simplicity. The atmosphere is very dark and sad, yet also hopeful, bringing a message of eternal love. Brandon finally got to showcase his skill as an actor, as well as a martial artist, and he was brilliant as both. Despite numerous one-liners, the violent tone, and some great action scenes, Brandon was able to prove he was also a great actor.I could talk at length about how great this movie, and how much I enjoy it, but I won't. I will just re-iterate that it is an excellent movie, and urge you to see it. 'The Crow' definitely deserves a 10/10. Be warned, it is obviously not for everyone - it is the kind of movie that would scare children, and get disapproving comments from others unable to stomach the violence and drug use.",The Crow

Brandon Lee was brilliant in the part of Eric Draven, the rock musician who was brutally murdered by thugs and brought back from the grave to avenge the rape and murder of his fiancee, Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas.)
The Crow was also the last movie that Brandon Lee would make as he died during the filming through a tragic mishap with a gun. In fact, the movie was almost not completed. Alex Proyas did manage to bring James O'Barr's graphic novel to the screen.
The film has an almost fairy tale feel to it even though it's described as a superhero movie. Brandon Lee is at times ethereal, then terrifying as he takes revenge one by one on the men who murdered him and his beloved fiancee. The gravelly voiced Michael Wincott as Top Dollar, the head honcho was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. The music was beautiful and the visuals were stunning.

I suppose it became a cult classic immediately with the tragic death of Brandon Lee. You can tell Brandon was committed to the role and gave it his all, leaving a lasting legacy to 'The Crow' similar to Heath Ledger and the 'Joker'. Though to be fair, the acting when comparing those two roles is not even close.The story itself is just as tragic, as it is surrounded with loss and grief. A fairly run of the mill revenge story that involves picking off those responsible one by one. The action is decent enough. It's dark throughout and has that intense goth feel. Film noir of comic book heroes one could say.The overall film is slightly dated and could be due for a reboot in the coming years, but of course this would be of no disrespect to Brandon Lee's legacy.

118,lagriff05,The best B movie ever made.,10,18 April 2008,"There are movies you watch for their deep, spiritual messages, and there are movies you watch for the sheer, unholy, Christ-crushing badassery they contain. If you were to guess that this movie is of the latter persuasion, you'd be correct, and what a glorious, wonderful sight this was to behold.The Crow is the B movie to end all B movies. Let's not kid ourselves; that is what it is, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's an old school, Halloweenish (the holiday, not the John Carpenter film) revenge flick with broad, straightforward, gleefully Satanic undertones and imagery - pentagrams, black coats, fire, the whole deal. It's not even exceptionally dark, either; these themes are all carried out with an exuberant sort of merriment, as if the film thrives on the dark itself. And I don't know about you, but I love stuff like this, so revisiting The Crow was a huge treat for me. The imagery I mentioned before is not really Satanic, being a mere stereotype and cliché, but it's fun, the film equivalent of running around outside on Halloween night with masks and fake weapons and the whole deal. It's a childlike fascination, and combined with the succinct, tightly woven little storyline, The Crow becomes much greater in the eyes of many like myself. There isn't anything too deep here, but there doesn't need to be. The acting is pretty subpar overall, although nobody can deny Brandon Lee's status as a Certified Badass. The whole thing has that 90s sort of grainy, underground feel to it, quality-wise, and it fits the storyline to a tee.If you only like polished Hollywood films or the ""classics"" of the olden days, then you won't understand my reverence for this film at all, for it isn't something everyone will agree with or even ""get."" This is just a damned cool movie, and all of its overblown cheese does nothing but lift it up to higher levels. This isn't a subtle or deep movie; it lays out everything right in front of you with gruesome, dark images and total sincerity, much better than the forced crap we get nowadays. The Crow is an honest, sincere little film, and I respect it for that.I don't hate anything about this movie at all, and I would say it is the best B movie ever, however bold that statement may be. The Crow is a huge, metallic spiked behemoth of a film, and it will roll over your ass like an angry battle tank. Superlative.",The Crow

120,mgruebel,Greek Tragedy,8,30 July 2015,"Revenge is sweet, especially if you have already been dead for a year. Alex Proyas has made some amazing dark films, and The Crow is no exception. The eponymous bird acts like the narrator in Greek tragedy, guiding the un-dead main character face to face with those who brutally murdered him and his wife in a dark and forlorn city full of Gothic churches, dark streets, car-swallowing rivers...The film is hyper-violent, and so it is not for everyone. Even more disconcerting is the fact that Brandon Lee (son of Bruce Lee, famous for martial arts) was accidentally shot to death during his protagonist's death scene. A mix up with an uncharged bullet getting stuck and a live blank without a bullet being fired subsequently cost him his life, with the .44 Magnum seen in the film. I was in Wilmington NC a couple of years ago, and learned that the scene was filmed there. It sent a shiver down my spine, although Wilmington is a nice little town.The Crow is a tragedy in the Greek sense for many of its themes: the love for your soul mate, the inevitable justice of revenge, the drama of the high falling. I was wavering between a 7 and 8, but in the end, the vision of this film rises to the quality of one of a film that defines or re-defines its genre.",The Crow

It is tragic about Brandon Lee. He will be missed.The Crow is a great movie. We start in a truly dark and decadent city on Devil's night, the night before Halloween. The city is filled with crime and run by a powerful syndicate lead by Top Dollar. Four members of the syndicate have a night on the town and murder two innocent people. However, the death was so tragic that a crow brings back one of the victims in Eric Draven to get vengeance for him and his fiancé. Anyone who gets in his way will certainly regret it.This movie works in many ways. One is the scene when Eric comes back from the dead. This scene was so very well done. He rises and opens the casket and then has trouble with his balance and is trembling, scared, and confused. Brandon Lee is great as Eric Draven. He has the look and charisma. For what it's worth, he seemed to enjoy this role.More goods is the acting on just anyone here. The one that steals the show is Micheal Wincott in a memorable and awesome role as Top Dollar. The Directing from Alex Proyas is great too. Ernie Hudson despite being type-cast as a cop is here and plays the role nicely.

It is a perfect example of how emotion and character development can overcome all other things that may be lacking in a film. I feel the acting is perfect. Anyone who doesn't feel for Erik(and yes, Brandon's presence, fortunately or unfortunately makes that feeling for us moviegoers stronger) must have a heart made of lead.   WHAT I LOVE MOST OF ALL ABOUT THE CROW (besides Brandon Lee) is the fact that people can't judge what this movie is by its ""cover"". Who would've thought from watching the previews and hearing the plot, that this movie will make you fall in love with the concept of ""love"" and ""soulmates"" and the phrase ""buildings may burn, people die, but real love is forever.""
   This film was strong enough to create a whole underground neo-goth scene. I remember because I was 13, and no way did those black nail polish-wearing, black-haired, teardrop-tattooed, leather-pants-wearing guys come around until after that movie. At least in the Sates. I can swear by that statement.
   Those reading this have probably either not seen the film or have not seen it in a long time. To either scenario I'd like to say that you need to watch this film again. Hell, *I* need to watch it again. It will restore your faith in love. Seeing beautiful Shelly and Erik together, adorable, you'll want that soulmate of your own.Good luck and take care.

125,renaldo and clara,an old comment,10,13 December 2002,"I found this in my old stuff; a review from 5 years ago for this movie...though I already commented on The Crow; I feel this may be the most honest review for it:Once upon a time-not so long ago- Halloween was something more magical. Up until the early 90's kids were happy to be frightened because it was about being alive and honest, without the fear that evil truly did reign the Earth. It was optimism and how it related to human darkness.  Moreover it was about how ""Goth"" had come back in style, the education in literary background that came with it. There was a lot of culture behind black attire and make-up of this time- whether it was referenced to writers, music, religion, or just pure romantic love.That's where this film comes in. Its theme-""love conquers all""- is not about romance-but about true LOVE. This film is all about staying true to the essence of its theme. If you're talking about ""love"" during this time(1992-4), you're not talking about any ""areas"" around it- like romance, lover's quarrel, jealousy, self-doubt. It's not about enhancing the faces of your film's attractive leads; Brandon Lee's face is mostly covered in make-up and similarly Sofia Shinas is barely shown, but when she finally is it is only her face-she is more like an angel than an attractive woman. Point being that everything needed to make an action/horror film was there. But it's like the director wanted to show how he deliberately ignored these aspects and remained loyal to his theme.Sarah and Officer Albrecht are plot thickeners and serve to give the film a modern perspective, so they are shown as realistically as possible. But all the ""bad""-guys are purposely unrealistic, they are shown as symbols for you to HATE-out of pure emotion. You don't want them in the slammer, you want their evil out of this world.This film is like a landmark in a temporary (American-I can't speak for other countries) pop culture between 1992&4. Kurt Cobain's suicide, Real World London, Live, Pearl Jam's zenith of pop influence, Nine Inch Nails, STP...this is the era when some young kids today (and older folks who passed by this era) complain we took ourselves too seriously. It was right before grunge supposedly""died"" and before humour and obsolete issues came back into rap and rock; before new-wave ""punk"". Financial gain/monetary value was shunned during this short-lived culture, because it didn't have to do with human emotion. Incidentally the ""bad guys"" of this film aren't out for money, just for the glory of madness, anarchy, and hate.There is a line in The Crow where Eric tells Albrecht, upon fond reflection:""Little things used to mean so much to Shelly. I used to think they were kind of trivial. Believe me-nothing's trivial.""
There was a little gap in pop culture history, reminding us how important love and classic literature was, and how youthful optimism and love could be combined with negative attitudes(like anger,sadness, and vengeance) to create a character everyone could identify with. This is the time when ""nothing was trivial""-the ""important"" stuff mattered, a feeling to which music of the time consequently made a huge impact. Nothing was done without thought, so words could make you fall in love or cry.If there ever was a film that could reflect this confusing and beautiful revival of the Romantic Period, The Crow is the movie. It will take you back. This is the only film that I wish could've lasted longer.",The Crow

As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it.

I think a lot of the silly IMDb hero-worship (you see written below) over this film was due to the fact that Brandon Lee died during the making of it, and that all the kiddies from all around the world wanted to emulate the Goth look with a little dose of Marilyn Manson on the side. Besides, I hate silly music videos and the angst metal crap on this thing, blew green snot.... In other words, it sucked... Still, some of the visual CGI cityscapes looked cool for it's time and the storyline didn't insult my intelligence any, so I'll be kind and give it an average rating.5 out of 10",The Crow

I am not saying that this was Brandon Lee's best performance because it was his last. If that were the case,I wouldn't be reviewing this film.""The Crow"" deals with the supernatural and gives us a supernatural hero we can go for.What I liked about the film, is the fact that Eric doesn't want to be a hero.He is cursed and to remove that curse he must avenge himself and his girlfriend.The film is also about damnation which I consider really dark.After seeing ""The Crow"",I realized that on March 31,1993 we lost a really great actor.""The Crow"" is one hell of a film.",The Crow

Both of these films share a lot in common. In the end, they showed fans that Hollywood could get a comic book right.....every now and then.Though drastically different from its source graphic novel in tone and story, the film manages to hold on to the ""love is forever"" theme of the O'Barr graphic novel.All the cast turn in great performances in spades. All the right elements clicked together from a great script written by David Schow and John Shirley, direction from Proyas, and musical direction by Graeme Revell and Jeff Most.It would be hard to mention this film without making a nod to the doomed lead actor, Brandon Lee. The film stands as a fitting tribute to where he was headed as an actor. He was not there yet by no means, but I think this film really set him apart from his famous father's shadow. As is, the film still plays well today. It was purposely not set in either a future or past world. It represents right now, no matter what year it plays. That is a mark of a very good film.",The Crow

The supporting cast was OK but they were not the focus point. This is one of those classic stories of hero seeking revenge. The Gothic setting for this is like Outlaw Josey Wales meets New York City at night.Like all real ""Guy movies"" they must meet 3 or criteria: 1. Action worth re-watching (fighting, shooting or blowing up) 2. A Hero you like (Strong silent like Eastwood, Badass like Bruce/Brandon Lee, or Tough Everyday guy like Bruce Willis) and a Villain you HATE 3.

136,moviemattb,Brandon Lee is The Crow,10,29 April 2014,"""The Crow"" is absolutely one of the best comic book movies ever made. This is before we have other great comic book movies such as ""Sin City,"" ""The Avengers,"" or ""The Dark Knight"" Trilogy. ""The Crow"" is very much a revenge story of a man who lost the love of his life and now takes on a gang of thugs for all the things that took from him. Brandon Lee is the Crow and it is sad that he died during the making of this movie, and it would've been interesting to hear his thoughts on the movie if he was still alive today. He has given an amazing performance and this is the movie that he shall always be remembered. Ernie Hudson and the rest of the other cast did great for their performance. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is beautifully shot for its style of a comic book movie. Same goes to the production design of this movie, which it does look like a cross mixture between Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" I do enjoy Graeme Revell's score and the songs that were selected for the movie. Alex Proyas does a fantastic job for directing this movie as well as his other movie ""Dark City."" There is not a whole lot more to say except that ""The Crow"" is dark, edgy, and entertaining. I give this movie a 10 out of 10!",The Crow
137,talllwoood13,a little crap in a big toilet,2,18 October 2021,"Well time to poo on another movie that deserves it, so time to take your rose tinted glasses off from someone who finally saw this movie almost 30 years after it's been made. Time flies. I think anything over a 3 star is insulting, yes the movie has a really dark atmosphere and it was unique back then as all there was at the time really was this and the Batman movies Tim Burton did. However on todays standards which let's face it most of it is just remakes and making women take over mens roles or make different ethnicities play roles because Hollywood is so brilliant and far from lazy this.This hands down has to be one of the most over rated films ever made that people talk about. I'm tempted to watch Citizen Kane and Casablanca how awful this was just to see what many consider the ""Greatest"" movies are.The story was about as deep as an adult movie, the director did an awful job, they just wanted to piece this together what they could and hit that hour and thirty minute mark because of course Brandon getting killed. This film shouldn't have came out in the state it's in. The production story for this movie is far more interesting than this movie. All the drugs and hurricane to name a few things it's amazing this even came out.Other than the cop who helps Eric and Keith David no one can really act in this movie. The worst is the little girl she's just as stiff as Shelly's corpse is in this movie. The scene where Eric screams as he comes out of his grave I laughed my head off. The little girl Sarah just murmurs through her lines like Summer Smith in Rick And Morty voiced by Spencer Grammar. It is on par with. Taissa Farmiga when she was in the first few seasons of American Horror Story as the girl who falls in love with Tate the Kurt Cobain looking kid in season 1. None of them can act their way out of wet paper bags.The only parts to the score I really liked were the more experimental stuff. The use of the tsiranapogh (duduk) was surprisingly fitting. It makes me want to listen to Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath record he did with Ian Gillian of Deep Purple the project was called ""Who Cares"". More thought went into that band name than the dialogue of this movie.How is that fluffy white cat still alive. Better yet how is it so white. I guess there is lots of rats to eat in that decrepit cityThe movie struggles to have a story, the script should have been worked on longer. I kind of wish they gave the crow a better outfit as it comes off as mish mashed together like when Tommy Wiseau did that scene on the rooftop where he had cargo pants, a muscle shirt and what looked like a blazer shouting I DID NOT HIT HER I DID NOT.. OH HI MARK. I kind of wish they were into bondage or something for something with more leather and spikes that looked more super hero than some poor kid who wants to go trick or treating because mommy is too drunk to bring him and his friends. This is coming from someone who despises all the over saturation of marvel and dc atrocities these days too. I don't get it why the girlfriend would want a white wedding dress, I mean aren't they ""goth"". I mean the woman is too pretty and skinny to be goth, doesn't look like she has drug or mental problems but to me anyways why would these two bother with tradition or so. Do they exchange gifts from hot topic on Halloween?The fights are poorly choreographed and or editedthe alternative rock in this movie is terrible as well. I bet you could find a better sound track in a dollar store.Why did Keith David sign up to be in this? Thankfully he still has a career which I don't think anyone else in this movie can say the same.Why is the engagement ring in some slimy pawn shop ran by a real life Carl Brutananadilewskii (Aqua Teen Hunger Force).The movie struggles to have meaningful dialogue between the characters, how is child service not called on Sarah too. What is she 12? She goes around on a long board in this dangerous city. Was that one of the buildings that burnt or blew up in what I imagine is Detroit. Any more fire and it might as well be Fallujah or. Kabul.What I hate about Eric is he's too confident to the point it's nauseating. He thinks everyone knows who he is as if he was the only one to get murdered in that slimy city. He comes off like some trashy social media influencer. Woah you don't know Chad he has like 10,000 followers on this site. You should totally give him the presidential suite of your 7 star hotel for free. He is so lame, so unlikable. I liked Brandon more in Showdown In Little Tokyo but this is just awful. I've said it in other reviews as I have a thing for watching so bad they are good movies but if Brandon's dad wasn't who he was there is no way he would have been cast for even a laundry detergent ad.The bad guy in this movie sucks, i can't take him seriously. He doesn't do enough to really be a bad guy and what happens to him is just lazy.Did I mention Eric sucks at guitar. I'd want to smash that guitar too or throw him out a 6 story building if I had him as a neighbor. Whatever the heck that noodling he played at first was made most 13 year olds in guitar center or other popular guitar shops look like guitar gods. They edited most of it out thankfully. I'd say he can't play guitar to save his life but it's a bit too late.This movie desperately needed a better director. The ONLY reason this movie is a classic is either Brandon's death which is why this movie is extremely over rated or possibly the dark atmosphere. Sort of like no one cared about Heath Ledger until he passed away after filming the Dark Knight if memory serves me right. If this movie came out and Brandon was still alive milking his fathers fame this would be in the same bargain bin as I Come In Peace (Dark Angel) with Dolph Lundgren.The final shootout and fight were just lazy, there are some faint bits of good cinematography but this movie is just awful. The only redeeming thing about this is the ending. But the damage is already done.This movie is horribly paced. There are parts you'll get bored.The special effects and the look of the movie and i feel if Brandon didn't wear all that clown makeup no one would remember this movie.Go ahead my mid life crisis friends and say this is unhelpful. This movie was borderline unwatchable. But at least the production team had fun partying and doing drugs the entire time.",The Crow
138,tiskec,F'ing Loved This Movie!,8,27 October 2016,"**THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN A LOT OF SPOILERS. IF THE READER DOESN'T WANT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MOVIE BEING SPOILED FOR THEM, THEN I RECOMMEND WATCHING THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU.**I down right loved this movie. It's just a shame that Brandon Lee had actually been shot while filming. Such a tragedy. This movie's story-line was deep. It had a Gothic-love type feel to it. Very awesome. The whole movie just gave me a deep feel of how important the people that you care about actually are in your life. When Eric's (Brandon Lee) love of his life is brutally raped and thrown out of a high story window, he is forced to watch. Then, they slowly kill him. It was on a criminal holiday known as Devil's Night. This little girl both Eric and his love (Shelly) were really close to, Sara, is now on her own to live on the street with a liquid morphine junkie of a mom.Later in the Movie Eric's soul is awakened, and carried, by a crow. He had unfinished business. The love he possessed was actually real. So the crow brought him back to get even for the torture of all three of them, that that group of people had done. He starts killing them off one-by-one; killing all who were responsible for the death of his lost love. I will not tell you any more of this movie, except that the fact that it is epic. The story-line was epic, the script was epic, the dialog was good, the actors did an excellent job of allowing viewers to connect to them, and the Gothic environment of the film. I gave this movie an ""8"". The only thing I thought they could've improved on was the ending. Otherwise it would've bee close to a ""10"".

140,Derek237,A young girl's fantasy?,9,1 November 2005,"Film is an art form, and it's open to interpretation. An interpretation of The Crow that occurred to me after watching it the other night was that maybe the whole film was Sarah (the girl in the film)'s fantasy. It always struck me as kind of shallow to just look at this as a revenge film. Because, what makes Eric and Shelley such important victims? Are there no other good people in the entire city? The clear answer to that is that what makes them the most important is their connection to Sarah. They looked after her and were her friends while her mother was off doing drugs all the time. Then on ""Devil's Night,"" they are brutally, unjustly, and senselessly murdered by some truly evil people. Sarah runs into a cop who does his best to comfort her. The world is an awful place.Then we get the title card indicating a year had passed. This is when I think the fantasy begins. Sarah continues to live in this city, and she has now befriended the cop she met a year earlier. A crow brings Eric back to life with divine powers, and guides him along a journey to bring justice to the world by killing his and Shelley's killers. Through the eyes of a young person this is as just as it gets. But it's more than just revenge. Eric gets Sarah's mom to quit drugs and start to be a mom again. Sarah is also able to say goodbye to Eric, a person who she must have loved a lot. Her fantasy also gives Eric and Shelley a chance to say goodbye to each other, to embrace one last time, bringing some closure to such unjust, terrible circumstances. The fantasy even hints that maybe the evil in the world will stop since the top villain of the city is taken down.This is just one interpretation, of course, and there's many ways to look at the movie, but I like to look at it this way. It makes it a bit more sad; a bit more beautiful, and also gives it a deeper meaning. If you listen to the final words of the movie, it does make sense. It's taken her a year, but Sarah did end up finding a way to cope with the deaths of her loved ones, and the evil in the world around her.As far as things like its visual style and acting goes, this is brilliant. I love its dark atmosphere. This is really the epitome of the early 90's. The generation X gloom, the grunge, the dark, the angst, etc. The late Brandon Lee gives a credible performance here, hitting mostly the right notes. And the great Michael Wincott adds to the enjoyment of this movie with his performance as the villain, Top Dollar. This is one movie that really is a must-see.My rating: 9/10",The Crow

What if you weren't given the choice and, instead, were left with the more grisly task of balancing the scales? Would you take it?It's Mischief Night, or Devil's Night as it's referred to in this film, in Detroit and the night before musician Eric Draven (played by Brandon Lee) and Shelley Webster (played by Sofia Shinas) are to be married. Then, thanks to their efforts to fight eviction for themselves and their fellow tenants, their home is broken into. The invaders toss Draven (Lee) through a window and send him plummeting to the ground three stories below and savage his bride-to-be. The first officer on the scene is Sgt. Albrecht (played by Ernie Hudson) and when Shelley asks about her fiancée, he spares her the truth and tells her he's fine. Then, when the latchkey kid that Eric and Shelley have taken under their wing stumbles upon the scene, Albrecht relays the lie once again. The child, Sarah (played by Rochelle Davis who also acts as the film's narrator), sees through the sergeant's reassuring fiction and departs soon after. Flash-forward one year, Sarah is visiting the graveyard where Shelly and Eric have been laid to rest and encounters a crow. After she'd left, the crow begins tapping on Eric's headstone with his beak. Then, that night, Eric emerges from his grave, shaking and traumatized. He returns to the apartment that he and Shelley once shared and finds that it is a ruin of the home he knew. While there, he begins experiencing flashbacks of the night one year before when he lost everything. Seeing the men responsible, who call themselves T-Bird (played by David Patrick Kelly), Tin-Tin (played by Laurence Mason), Funboy (played by Michael Massee), and Skank (played by Angel David). Still reeling from those memories, Eric grabs onto the frame that once held the apartment's only window and swings out and back in. He notices that he's cut himself on remnants on the window but, to his surprise, he heals almost immediately. With this new gift, he dons all black clothes, decorates his face in the style of a harlequin mask that was on the floor of his home, and sets out to seek revenge with the crow as his guide.I cannot adequately express how much I love this movie. The tone, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the antagonists. Everything about this movie is top-drawer. Fans of the graphic novel of the same name that inspired the film say that the master criminal in the film, known as Top Dollar in the novel and not actually given a name in the film, was far more ordinary than the evil genius Michael Wincott portrayed. Other critics say that the death of Brandon Lee gave this film a legacy it didn't earn, much the same way that critics claim Heath Ledger's death before the release of The Dark Knight added anticipation it wouldn't have gotten otherwise. As I was only ten when the film was first released, I was not aware of the film itself or Lee's death until much later. What I will say is that I cannot watch this film enough. Even so, if you haven't seen The Crow, shame on you.",The Crow
144,DoctorSkyTower,GREAT MOVIE,9,17 August 1999,"WARNING SPOILERS??? I HOPE NOT!!!This is a KEWL movie. Much better than the sequel, with its haunting storyline and dark and dingy backgrounds. Brandon Lee played the lead character exceptionally well (he was killed in the making of this flick)Despite the graphic violence, drug-taking, vicious killers and rapists, the story is still great. It basically revolves around a young dude who is murdered by a bunch of pyscho maniacs. His bride-to-be is beaten violently to death. He is reincarnated to avenge both their deaths by killing the monsters responsible. The crow that follows him around is his third eye and the source of his 'immortal' powers.This is definitely not a movie for the faint of heart. We see the bad guys gettin their just desserts in the most violent ways imaginable, they are hunted down like animals and killed according to what tortures they inflicted upon our hero's bride before she died her slow and painful death. Of course, they deserve to die like animals, except our hero wouldn't even kill an animal like that!!However, despite the gratuitous violence and colourful uses of the 'F' word, there are still tender tear-jerker moments and a few humourous moments too.I recommend this flick to anybody who loves action flicks.",The Crow
145,Phil_H,No Jones Transfer?...,6,19 November 2001,"(The summary above only makes sense to true Crow fans...)Brandon Lee was remarkable in this. My only complaint is that he died. This was his film, through and through. He worked to bring it to existence, he labored to finish it, and in the end he paid the ultimate price for his art. He will be missed.This movie is a testament to how love breaches the gap of death. It is a love story, regardless of content. Many of the sequences of the comic are not present, for valid reasons, but I kind of wish they were...perhaps the ""Jones Transfer"" segment I mentioned would have been good for a commercial (or two.) Who can say?..I saw this movie immediately upon release and was pleased to see it. It is a fine example of a unique spin on an old idea. More moviemakers should take the cue from O'Barr, et. al., and climb out on a limb once and a while -- and make something different. Something that might not be great, but is far the more genuine for it.",The Crow
146,HanShotFirstGR,"Epic, beautiful and stylish!",9,14 May 2021,"Plot:A man brutally murdered comes back to life as an undead avenger of his and his fiancée's murder.Analysis:Before emo and goth style becomes mainstream, The Crow took a huge risk to choose this in mid-90s. It certainly has an influence from grunge style, almost like a Nirvana music video but it takes it a step further by doing something new, and inspiring many films that were released even two decades after this one.The movie is an adaptation of a very famous comic book series. Despite being some pretty good material, the story was changed almost completely by maintaining a certain core from the original, but also changing a huge part of it to make it more cinematic. After all, who would wanna see a very overpowered guy who doesn't sweat at all? No one. The Crow in this movie is in pain, physical and spiritual, he is not a random psychopath, his goal is revenge, justice that wasn't done back then when he and his fiancée were brutally murdered. David J. Schow and John Shirley managed to successfully complete the impossible task of humanizing the character and they made him almost relatable as the very tragic figure who's emotional and a human after all that was given a chance to fix the wrong that had been done to him and his beloved one. It's hard to say what I love the most about this movie, from the wonderful character to great poetic quotes and amazing interractions everything about this movie is top-level moviemaking and the screenplay is still over twenty years later one of the simplest and most awesome ones I've ever seen in a comic book movie. You don't need a very complicated story to produce something worth-watching, you just need to be passionate about what you're doing. Exceptionally paced, well-written, very intetesting and quite stylish, The Crow is everything you ever wanted.Alex Proyas has done some very good (Dark City) and some very bad (Gods of Egypt) projects over the years but he never did anything simillar to this one, probably because this is close to perfection. Amazing dark tone, fantastic camera work and unique style, things that made this movie even more memorable, incredible original scenes, well-executed ideas and a satisfying result that it was certain that it would become a cult classic. With every re-watch I really try to find things I don't like in his direction but I just can't, I really wish we could see more movies like this one, gothic, dark and awesome.Sadly, this whole project was marked by the sudden on-set death of Brandon Lee who portrayed the main character Eric Draven. Lee was fataly injured by a poor designed proped that costed him his life and made this film ever more sad and dark. Eric was a man that was given a second chance to fix the injustice that was done to him, too bad that Brandon can't have the same treatment from the universe. But despite his death, he managed to show what a wonderful actor he was and what a huge star he would be, by creating a memorable and unique character that inspired a lot of people and creators like Cristopher Nolan and Heath Ledger who crafted the final form of Joker in the movie The Dark Knight clearly influenced by Lee's Eric Draven. His performance was amazing and he will be missed.Conclusion:Everytime I watch this movie I get goosebumps by the quality and fun of this project. It's not just great everytime I think of it, it's also extremely entertaining every single time. It's not among the best movies every made but it's one of the greatest experiences you can have as it will be tons of fun and inspiring. Give this film a chance and you will be rewarded on every level. R. I. P. Brandon LeeRating: 9.5/10.",The Crow
147,SPaS,Aaahh!,10,24 February 2003,"I like impossible equations that work. Hear me out - how about... a serious, dark movie about a guy coming back to take revenge from the dead. Eh... A rock'n'roll-dude, even, whose SOUL is carried on earth by a CROW, which acts as his companion throughout the movie. Yea, right... Well, you don't hear any ""yea, rights"" when this flick plays. See, THIS is what happens, when the director knows his sh*t, and you invest on the atmosphere - who says photography and lightning are trivial in an action flick? The result is just like the comic-book: almost looks like it (almost black & white), dark, and full of energy; looks like ""a beautiful nightmare"". And kicks ass!",The Crow
148,LilyDaleLady,Very stylish Graphic novel adaptation,8,1 May 2006,"I never saw this originally in '94 because I dismissed it as A. a martial arts film (and I hate those) and B. adapted from a comic (and I just can't get into those) and C. aimed at a teen/ goth/punk audience (and I am way too old for that). What a mistake! Finally a decade on, a friend heard me say how much I liked Alex Proyas' DARK CITY -- a neat sci fi film with a very different story but the same kind of dark fantasy look -- and couldn't believe I had never seen THE CROW and made me watch it.I have to say that I really think this is a very fine, well made movie and none of my preconceptions were remotely correct. The art direction is brilliant, with a wonderful and creepy Gothic fantasy look, almost but not quite black-and-white, set in a mysteriously surreal ""Detroit"" that is in some kind of alternate universe from the real Motown. Brandon Lee is really charismatic and haunting in the role of Eric Draven, and not merely because of the tragic incident surrounding the film. He was real star material and just totally inhabits this part.After seeing the film, I did read the O'Barr comic, which is very sincere and heartfelt, but I think the filmmakers -- in what is a pretty rare event -- IMPROVED the plot and characters while keeping all of the angst and atmosphere. They totally honored the character of Eric and the basic idea of the avenger, the memories of his beautiful girlfriend, and sense of overwhelming grief that inhabits the graphic novel. Where they improved the storyline in cinematic terms is in the treatment of the minor characters and villains. They really fleshed them out, and it enriches the movie and balances the storyline well.Bookending the film with quotes from Sarah (Rochelle Davis), the little girl who narrates and observes much of the story is an example of a good idea that doesn't really exist in the comic, where the little girl is called Sherri and only appears briefly. Even more so is the expansion of the character of Top Dollar, who again is a minor episode in the comic and more of a grubby hell's angel/drug dealer -- in the film he has been transformed into a complex and compelling crime-lord. Michael Wincott is simply amazing in this part, playing Top Dollar as a kind of depraved, satanic, renaissance prince, and clearly having a great deal of fun with this role, especially some wonderful and very clever dialog. The very, very sick (but quite sincere) love story between Top Dollar and his psychic half-sister is the reversed-mirror image of the pure and innocent love of Eric and his fiancé...a very clever idea.Wonderful music, great visuals, terrific acting...""The Crow"" should NOT be missed.NOTE: I bought the ""Collector's DVD"". Don't bother. There is NOTHING worth looking at on the second DVD, some production sketches and posters, nothing special. The director's commentary (on the first disk) is interesting to listen to ONCE, but you can get that on the single disk DVD. There is a smattering of extra footage, but nothing you will miss. Save some bucks and just get the one disk wide screen version.",The Crow
149,gothicgoblin1334,"A beautiful, marvellous and poetic adaption of the comic with the same skills",10,4 January 2007,"Brandon Lee, a triumph of an actor, earned his stardom from his film...and his life. I recently bought this film, knowing it appealed to many Gothic cultures and thought of this as something I may enjoy-and it was worth every penny. I enjoy perhaps every moment of this film, and it remains one of my favourites. The symbolic scene of The Crow's arrival from the grave shall remain in my head for years to come. How could I explain this film? How could I project such a legendary plot, I'll never know. The only thing I can honestly say is to see this film. Watch it just more than once and have it stay in your mind forever. Goth bless James 'O Barr for bringing us in the first place a story like this-an expanded poem in the format of a film. A horror-like film with Goth potential, anyone can enjoy ''The Crow''.",The Crow
150,Deckard-16,Death Wish in goth drag thats surprisingly soars.,10,21 August 1999,"This is a real surprise. It's a very dark revenge fantasy that flies on imagination and a terrific performance by Brandon Lee. Director Alex Proyas's stunning feature debut is a stylistic masterpiece based on James O'Barr's best-selling graphic novel. Although it can be dismissed as Death Wish dressed up for the kids it can't be easily forgotten. I keep going back to this movie because Lee is genuinely sweet and tragic as a hero returned from the dead to exact revenge on a gang of speed metal villians. He makes you root for him. His work here totally wins you over (which makes his actual death all the more painful for people who love movies). And the villians are among the most colorful and evil ever assembled on the big screen. Michael Wincott and David Patrick Kelly lead this band of bad guys. Each set piece that leads Eric Draven/The Crow getting revenge up the bad guy ladder is sharp and adrenalized. Proyas's camera work and cutting are truly something to behold. Ernie Hudson's is memorable as a disbelieving cop who befriends Draven. For all of the stylistic guts this movie has (it looks very dark as well) it would not have won me over so much if it weren't for Lee's poignant work which is something very unexpected in such a dark and violent fantasy. Like such films as The Terminator and The Road Warrior, The Crow rises far above its B-movie trappings into a modern mythology of sorts.",The Crow
151,brent_or,An Outstandingly Rich Film,9,28 May 2014,"I finally watched The Crow, and even though I was aware of its reputation going in, I was still deeply impressed by what a rich, well-crafted and darkly beautiful film it is. Violent and tragic, but also poetic and passionate. Certainly worthy of high esteem.Like many of the best films, The Crow draws energy from a very simple, powerful theme, but does not rely on just one character. Brandon Lee is fantastic in the title role, but I was surprised to discover a terrific group of supporting players, from the police to the villains. And the same goes for the story--there are small details written into this film that add extra dimensions. That's one of the marks of a well-written film--not just coasting on a gimmick, but telling a story that is clearly part of a greater world. The Crow has this quality in spades.The one other thing that I have to mention is that, while in many ways this film shares an aesthetic with Tim Burton's Batman films, i.e. darkly Gothic set pieces and so forth, it is impossible to look at Brandon Lee and not see how clearly his character design here influenced the Heath Ledger Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. It's uncanny. Beyond that, one can look at The Crow and see its fingerprints all over many other subsequent films. Very influential, this, and no doubt one of the best films of its type that I have ever seen.",The Crow
152,rowanmaillot,One of the greatest comic book movies ever put on the big screen!,10,20 June 2020,"This might be a very controversial thing to say, but I think that The Crow is one of the best films of 1994, it's after Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption. One of the most tragic things about The Crow is that actor Brandon Lee died on set, he got shot in a scene that Michael Massee wanted to add in to make the story even the darker. Except the gun was not a prop, it had real bullets in there and Lee ended up getting shot. R.I.PSaying that, Brandon Lee's iconic performance as The Crow/Eric Draven will live on for eternity. First of all, this film is very nostalgic for me because I remember sneaking it into my mum's DVD player on the side of her laptop when I was around 5 and I remember watching 25 minutes of it and already being pretty scared. Some scenes had to be done without Brandon Lee because he had famously died on set, so they cleverly used light and shadow and/or special effects to cover up the fact that it's not Brandon Lee.The script is fantastic, the iconic images from it are also pretty creepy. It's one of those films like The Dark Knight or Inception that lived up to my expectations and exceeded them. Literally everything about this movie has a Gothic atmosphere, the set design is beautiful, go check it out if you haven't, it's one of my all time favourites.",The Crow
153,newblu,Peep This Reviews,8,9 July 2017,"One of the absolute best comic book movies ever and this was before there were seemingly dozens of them being made every year. Brandon Lee gives such an intense and emotional performance that is made even more chilling considering that he died while it was filming. A dark super hero film that will probably be re-booted at some point but it's got very big shoes to fill. Plus there's no topping this soundtrack filled with lots of ear- candy songs that you'll want to enjoy after the film is over. But avoid all the sequels, unless you're a die hard fan of the series.",The Crow
154,MovieKing-4,The best movie of all time,10,12 April 1999,"""Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well and yet everything happens only a certain number of times, how many times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being you cannot even conceive of your life without it.Perhaps four or five times more?.Perhaps not even that.How many times will you watch the full moon rise, perhaps twenty, and yet it all seems limitless""Thanks to Brandon Lee I can remember this passage word for word,every time i watch The Crow i can`t help thinking what Brandon Lee was thinking when he was actually shot, i can picture how it happened.It is so very touching.The film in general is Top class, Brandon Lee plays the murdered revenge-on his-mind Eric Draven,and he portrays him well, it was a good touch that he was a Martial arts expert. I like the scenes where it freezes on pictures of Brandon.He made everyones life better (in the film) and he reunited a druggie mother with her rebellious daughter. The story of a rock star and his fiancee who are murdered on Halloween Eve, they were  sort of surrogate parents to Sarah the rebellious teenager.It was an all time greatest film and should be in the top 10 films of all time, it was once again like many others ruined by totally crap sequels, and now a second sequel is out i feel like puking.Brandon lee was killed during this movie and they should at least pay respect to him by leaving The Crow as an original, no sequels or anything.Because of Brandon Lee`s brilliant acting along with almost every other part of the film I give this first class film a 9 and a half out of 10. it would have got a 10 if Brandon Lee could have seen how much of a hit this film was.",The Crow
155,McFrogg,As of someone gently crapping...,3,1 May 2017,"The Crow is based on James O'Barr's independent comic book by the same name. Both the comic book and the movie are dark stories of revenge. The movie takes some liberties with the material, but is mostly faithful. The comic book has some beautiful illustrations, and the movie looks and sounds good (the music by Graeme Revell)...unfortunately, the story is crap.It's just a supernatural rock version of Death Wish. A man gets wronged by evil scumbags and kills almost everyone. The only difference is that while Kersey from Death Wish takes the law into his own hands, Draven is sent back against his will, to enact some kind of weird, divine retribution. And Draven doesn't even have a mustache...It's no surprise then that the movie is very violent (but mild compared to the comic book). It is a story about revenge, after all. People are stabbed, burned, slashed, thrown out of windows, impaled etc. One of the villains cuts out women's eyes. The same villain gets her own eyes pecked out by a crow. The assault on Draven and his wife is disturbing. There's some nudity in it. And the main villain is sleeping with his sister for some reason. Probably to show how evil and twisted he is. None of it made the movie any better. You could remove the nudity and creepy sex stuff, and tone down the violence a lot and still have a dark and gritty story. Just watch Nolan's Batman trilogy.The ""land of the dead"" must be a confusing place. Sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring souls back to put the wrong things right...but what happens to the people who are murdered by Eric Draven, where do they go? And what about Draven's wife? Where is she? Probably in the land of the dead. But, if she's in the land of the dead, why does Draven return? She shows up again at the end, and like Princess Peach from Super Mario, she's Draven's reward for murdering a lot of evil goombas.Maybe that's the idea? The land of the dead is the ""first level"" of the afterlife, and some lucky souls are sent back for a chance to reach the next level, where their beautiful wives wait for them. They just have to prove their worth by slaughtering King Koopa. But, what would happen to Eric Draven if he died in the church? Would the crow take him back to the land of the dead? What if T-Bird, Skank etc. Were there too? Awkward!Maybe I'm over-analyzing it? Anyway, it's not a very good movie, but then again, the comic book isn't very good either. It's a pointless story. Just some guy slaughtering a lot of evil people. There's no real message here...wouldn't it be more interesting if Draven came back and found out that some of the killers regretted their evil deeds? We have seen the ""they killed his wife, poisoned his goldfish and made annoying slurping sounds last time they drank a soda at McDonald's...now, he's back"" stuff before. It rarely ends with anything other than blood and death. I would love to see a story like this that ends with mercy and forgiveness.There are some good parts in the movie, like the scenes with Draven and the girl, and the last scene where Draven is reunited with his wife. It's just sad that those beautiful scenes are wasted on a crappy movie like this. It's also very sad that Brandon Lee died during the making of The Crow...rest in peace.Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish The Crow could bring me my time and money back.",The Crow

No questions asked about why he comes back just straight to the point no boring points in between.The crow delivers something else that other action does not maybe because it's so much more darker and is a revenge story or a Gothic black fairy tale.And don't get me wrong you don't have to be a goth to like this.

164,Zoopansick,Nothing new here,5,14 December 2003,"Despite comments that proclaim this movie really deep and memorable the performance by the ""late great Brandon Lee (as if he was a great actor or even as good as his dad)"" this movie left a lot to be desired as far as I'm concerned. Now let me say right off, if you are a fan of the comic book (or other popular Gothic literature) you probably will like the movie or at least find it more interesting then I did. But I am reviewing this movie from the perspective of an action fan / experienced movie watcher and therefore I have no particular bias towards the genre.Anyway the plot is pretty standard. Guy is wronged by criminals who kill him and his wife and he comes back a year later to seek revenge. I guess this is slightly different cause usually the bad guys only ""think"" they kill the guy, but this time they managed to finish him off and he comes back to life (sorta). Still it's your standard revenge/action movie plot with little suspense actually cause he is invincible so there is no chance he will get hurt. So he kills abunch of guys and the action is so so. The biggest gunfight is pretty lame actually, the bad guys just keep shooting at him and the bullets have no effect...but they never learn and keep shooting, silly criminals. It has a predictable ending and there isn't very much mystery.The movie also has managed to pack a ton of clichés that any action fan can spot. The angry police chief, the helpful police officer who comes to the Crows aid at the end (only after being suspended, cause as we all know the cop can never get anything done while actually on the force), the girl who is gonna kidnapped by the bad guys at the end, the fight on the roof (sometimes on another perilous location, but rooftop is standard), the bad guy falling off and getting impaled, the climactic fight in the rain, pretty lame chase scenes (2), vigilante hero, rainy dark city (someone said think Blade Runner, I wouldn't give it that much credit, I would say think Split Second with Rutger Hauer), flashbacks to the original crime. There are probably a few more but those are just the ones off the top of my head.Anyway the movie is not nearly as original as some of it's fans make it sound. The characters are really 2-dimensional. It's kind of funny to hear people say that the movie is deep. It's really simple, the guy is killed he comes back to avenge his girl friends death and kill the bad guys. There are some attempts to have the Crow represent a Christ like figure (palms healing, touching the crack-whore and the drugs come out of her body and she turns a new leaf in life, the whole resurrection aspect (i guess)). Still that is only a few brief scenes, and besides when you really think of it, Jesus came back to life so that he could ascend to heaven, the Crow came back so he could kill the guys who murdered his girlfriend and ruined his budding rock career (btw his guitar solo on top of the building was really moving).So in conclusion you could do better. Darkman is essentially the same movie but is more entertaining and certainly has a more interesting directing style. The action here is pretty mediocre and the results are predictable (though I admit pretty much 100% of action movies are predictable). To fans of the comic I would recommend it (I guess, though I have never read the comic so I don't know how faithful a representation this is).One more thing. I love how he (and now on this site) people quote Edgar Allen Poe (who is much more worthy of your time then this movie)and give the quote ""Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping...at my chamber door"". I guess for the makers of the movie they thought, ""Crow, raven who will notice that it isn't the same bird? It sounds cool so let's just put it in there."" Apparently not the fans of this movie.Zoopansick",The Crow

No movie is perfect, all have flaws but this is as close as you can come to my idea of perfection. It is the perfect balance of haunting drama and violent revenge with a gothic atmosphere unlike any other movie of its kind. Years ahead of what most of us now think of as comic book movies this one got it right on the first try (perhaps never again but honorable mention to Dacascos for playing Draven honorably on the tv show) and Lee didn't just transition from martial arts movie star to something more he catapulted into a broader genre with a haunting performance which I have always though Ledger might have drawn some inspiration from years later. I'm a huge fan of comics and the movie adaptations but this one and Logan deserve a special place in the ranks as both managed to maintain a tragic sadness throughout while still being great action movies. The Crow of course gets extra points for having done it all in 1994! A must see for fans of drama, action, gothic movies or really just fans of cinema in general!!!

LET ME SAY WHY,10,20 November 2004,"I like to think that when it comes to films i know a thing or two, i have around 300 dvds and follow and collect on a few of them, I saw The Crow in 1994, i saw it 12 times on the big screen...yes 12, why 12? well i found many things about this film to bring me back time after time, the first few times it was the action and the way it way shot that brought me back but soon i looked deeper into the story and its background, it struck on points about life and how we treat it, there are interviews with the late great Brandon Lee in which he covers this point in detail but the just been that we only have so long here and we should not take it and people for granted. The Crow was made with little money and some say this was the cause or part cause for Mr Lees death as the set should of had more people working on the checking of guns used in the film and the safety of the crew, others would go into the curse of the Lees or strange plots to do away with him, but the truth will out although i feel they have it now, just a pure accident, the low cost of this film hardly ever shows through, its shot with flair and hits all the right notes when it comes to the music which helps drive the film, the rock soundtrack by many great bands and one of the best scores by Greame Revell which has been sampled by other films. The Crow is a film that you must see, nothing can be found to fault it and its easy to see that all who worked on this film gave it there all, make what you will of those that followed but this is timeless.

172,Tyler_R_Weston,"A Wicked Tale of Vengeance, Power, Blood, and a Crow",8,9 December 2004,"The Crow is one of the best hero movies I have seen. I don't really know if the Crow is actually a super hero, but he plays a great one. This is one of the darkest movies I had ever seen. It has a dark sense of humor and plenty of knife-stabbing, gun-firing action. This a creepy tale of vengeance over a dead fiancée. A highly recommended film, however the subjects in this movie may be hazardous to the unstable. I gave this movie an 8. Perhaps a thrilling classic in film history. While there will be many seuqels to come, the original Crow will always be the best one. If you have any agreements or comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.",The Crow
173,toonyjakes,"""Everything is trivial""",10,29 July 2018,"The Crow is a cult classic for several reason I think, but it is not made for everyone. Do I think it is a flawless movie? No. But in that sense, along with everything else to like about it, I think it's awesome as a whole.Plot- It's about a musician being resurrected by a crow, which then obligates him to avenge the murder of his girlfriend. If you're a majorly picky person when it comes to realism, just note, this is a fantasy movie as much as an action crime thriller. The story is told straight forwardly, with interjections of flashbacks and about one montage, with the main driving force being revenge. There are pretty funny moments, some twisted, and it all takes place within two days (I'm pretty positive) Has a good ending scene that will stick in your mind.Writing- I love it. I know there are rare moments, mainly with the little kid, where it's a fine line between cliché writing and bad acting. But there are definitely some good quotes to walk away with, a lot of natural conversation that isn't useless in terms of the plot. Always nice to have that.Acting/Characters- Brandon Lee is stellar in this role. It's a cool thing to see, for it appears he wasn't in many popular films that would allow him to actually act. In this film, he is full of life within his emotions, which makes every scene so good to me. The supporting cast is great too, minus the little girl. The bad guys are infamously stuck in my head after seeing them shout ""FIRE IT UP! FIRE IT UP!"" like animals. The main villain is very good too, unpredictable, and played very well.Quality- The production design is killer, absolutely original and cool. It looks like the darkest, most off kilter part of New York or New Jersey. The cinematography is sick, I'll never forget the scene where he finally finds his strength and runs across the rooftops in the night. The filming, the scenery, and the original soundtrack is so great in this movie- so original, and that's why I think it is considered a cult classic.Overall, if you don't like movies that have anything unbelievable in it, don't watch this. If you can simply embrace a movie for the good qualities, understanding it's fiction, this movie is super cool. It's so sad to see somebody absolutely knock out a performance (referring to Lee) and pass away on set. Anyways, this is one of my favorite movies, easily top 10, simply because of the genuine scenes and the unparalleled style. Try to find a movie like this before it's time, you most likely won't. I recommend it highly.",The Crow
174,Khwaj,A Contemporary Classic in every way!,10,24 February 2002,"When I first heard of Brandon lee's death back in '93 I didn't become so shocked until I took a glimpse of the film when it got released in th UK in 1994.It's extermely tragic not to mention speechless to lose someone who's career coincidently started to shine through. Only recently I watched ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee story"" and I started to shed tears wishing both father and son were still alive. Lets face it Brandon Lee's performance might've not been the best, but hey at least he would've done better than the likes of Keanu Reeves. I even considered Brandon Lee for future roles in films that would've elevated him in even further than his father. Even looks that could rival some of today's leading actors' (Johnny Depp, Ben Affleck etc).The film's demonstration of Lee's performance was equivelent to a like a starter cuisine. Although sad to lose such striking actor who had very little time to blossom, we can only imagine what roles would best suit him (Cyclops: X-Men, Johnny Cage: Mortal kombat, even a perfect cast for films like Lord of The Rings. I know that might sound a few and far between, but it's matter of personal opinion).Long live Brandon Lee (The body rests, but the spirit lives on)",The Crow
175,Jakethemuss,"Dark, Gothic and oh so good",9,26 June 2007,"If one word could describe this film it would be dark. Dark is the absence of light, and throughout much of this film..light is hard to see.It begins with the tragedy that shapes the film; a rock musician named Eric Draven and his fiancé have just been brutally murdered by thugs. One year on, and Eric Draven's soul is having trouble resting, so a crow brings him back to the real world to put the wrong things right...queue one of the best films ever made.The cityscape plays a major part in setting the scene for this Gothic film. Tall looming brick buildings line desolate, garbage strewn, rainswept streets, a pitch black soulless sky hangs overhead, gunshots and screams can be heard echoing through the night. This is one town you DON'T want to be. Then we meet the locals; drug addicts, hookers killers, freaks, thieves, pyromaniacs and thats just the nicer ones.Eric Dravens transition from frightened, newly awoken victim to face painted, high flying avenger is both energetic and powerful. The film definitely gets better and better as Eric does his stuff and cleans up the streets. The film is violent as you'd expect, but also touching in some bits, such as when Eric speaks with the cop who was as the scene when he and his girlfriend were murdered. Also when Eric appears to a lonely young girl who he used to help take care of.Brilliant heavy metal soundtrack, cool action scenes, grizzly characters, far out camera work and unique execution methods make this film one that will stay in your mind. I've seen it many times since first seeing it 10 years ago, and it doesn't loose its power.I only wish people would recognise it for what it is, instead of giving it a cult status because it was the film where Bruce Lee's son was killed by a firearm accident.",The Crow

177,Peter Elefant,Brilliance.,9,29 April 2001,"""The Crow"" tells the classic tale, of a man having revenge on the wrong-doers of his life. There are a few twists though. For one the man is killed in the beginning of the film, hence having to come back from the dead, helped by a crow. Now we have a classic tale, with a touch of urban legend.This guy is completely twisted in mind and soul, as he mourns for his true love, that died with him. That's a dash of romance right there. Naturally there's villian. This villian is also a bit on the edgy side of the human psyche. With remarks as ""My father once told me that childhood is over the day you know you're gonna die"", he's not the guy you want crashing in at your birthday-party. Although intelligent and wise, you get the feeling that him dying, wouldn't be all that bad, for the world as we know it. Madness and philosophy is added. Then there's the whole enviorment, that Mr. Proyas can create. It IS amazing. The dark world, that makes the urban streets feel unsafe, and yet interesting. Reminds me of Blade Runner, but that might just be the rain.Time to sum up, people: We have our classic tale of revenge, tweaked with urban legend, the right enviorment, romance, madness and philosophy. That's kinda shakespeare, hence the 9, I'm giving this masterpiece.",The Crow
178,Cube_TX,Classic Romance Film,8,3 September 2002,"Contrary to how it is categorized in most stores, this is a romance movie -- albeit a dark and disturbing one.  The entire purpose of Eric Draven's resurrection is to avenge his and his fiancee's deaths.  I've never seen a movie with such emotion and classic one-liners.Most people compliment Brandon Lee's performance, and rightfully so, but many overlook great performances by Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson.  Both of them are good as supporting characters.  Wincott delivers almost as many classic lines as Lee.  Hudson is the perfect choice for the police officer -- showing his versatility (who would have thought Winston Zeedmore from Ghostbusters would be the one of the four to go on to a dramatic career?).Tragic in that it was Brandon Lee's last movie, and that he died while filming it.  This adds to the surreal atmosphere of the film, especially since its protagonist has been resurrected from the dead.  I first saw this film with an old girlfriend and disliked it because she MADE me watch it, but I saw it again 8 years later and realized what I'd missed.  Great film overall.",The Crow
179,im_veritas_photo,Among the Worst That Hollywood Has to Offer!,1,3 January 2008,"I wish there were a zero rating on IMDb. The movie industry ought to have a ""Toxic Waste"" rating, the kind that damages our society with absolutely no chance of cleanup. Yes, I believe that The Crow is the Love Canal of movies...I can't believe this motion picture was directed by the same person who directed ""Dark City."" If I had seen The Crow (an earlier film) first, I would never have viewed Dark City, and that would have been a shame. The two don't belong on the same planet... They truly don't reside in the same universe. The only thing I can figure: The Crow came out of Hollywood, while Dark City came out of Australia.Regardless of what Roger Ebert says about The Crow (he called it ""good"" ?), to me it is the worst piece of ultra-violent dreck I have ever seen, even including ""Narc,"" the only other film I've rated a ""1"" here. Both richly deserve a complete zero. I detect a pattern here: Both films' stories take place in Detroit. Moral: Never watch any film whose setting is Detroit! The Crow is genuinely scary to me, but not in the way you might imagine. I think the horribly ultra-violent spirit of the film, completely unrelieved throughout (no matter the insipid, unbelievably saccharine ""good guys win"" ? ending) contributed directly to Brandon Lee's death. How else can you explain something as bizarre as a ""blank"" movie-prop round killing someone during the filming of a motion picture? It is obvious to me that so many (way-over-the-top many) ""blank"" shots had to be fired at the (so-called) ""hero"" that this must have contributed to Lee's death. Someone said this film is a fitting memorial to Lee. Indeed. No further comment required.Even the music during the ending credits: ""It Can't Rain All the Time,"" or whatever it's called, is nausea-producing garbage. The singer is horribly flat (pitch, that is). Just listen to it, if you dare; it is totally forgettable trash. Thank heavens it has been forgotten! I made the mistake of starting to play the comment track by the Producer and Screenwriter. I do wish English grammar allowed me to de-capitalize their titles. I think they are quite demented, totally out of touch with reality... I believe their warped view of the world has caused them to descend into the depths of self-aggrandizing insanity.People: Do not view The Crow, ever. Unless you like flirting with brain-damaging toxic waste. If you let any teenager view this film, it should be considered that you should be jailed for launching sociopathic violence on the rest of us.Thank Goodness I watched The Crow only once. I am hoping that Time Will Heal All Wounds.",The Crow

181,shariqq,"A ""dark"" superhero 14 years ago.",6,4 November 2008,"14 years after its original release, and the movie still holds up well! This inspite of watching dozens of movies that have copied or have been inspired in different ways from Alex Proyas's excellent 'dark' superhero movie.Although the movie comes across very simple and straight forward, considering that we have seen all the movies that this pioneered, it still stands on its own for the wonderful portrayal of a back-from-dead vigilante out to avenge the destruction of his life. Brandon Lee, who died in a freak accident while this movie was shot, plays his resurrected character of Draven coming to terms with his new found powers with such fierce glee that it becomes difficult to disassociate the actor from the character. It's not that he is a good actor - it's just the physical grace he brings to his movements that makes the supernatural element of his character's presence more effective. Most of the movie plays out in the night (two nights a year apart from each other), something which Proyas had done in Dark City too before succumbing to the Hollywood machine. If seen these movies when they were released, it would be easy to be excited about the future of this promising director.The movie is a let down though when it comes to the supporting characters and the villain. As much as the Crow goes about executing his oppressors over one night, there is no sense of threat to him as he finishes them off with relative ease - although in spectacular fashion.For fans of cinema, the movie adds a lot to enjoy. It starts with a homage to Blade Runner. And references to The Crow are equally easy to find in later movies, especially in The Matrix. Or when relating Heath Ledger's Joker to Brandon Lee's Crow in a few key scenes. What a tragic coincidence that both actors died before their milestone performances were released.My rating --> 3 of 5",The Crow
182,sjwest,A true gothic classic.,7,13 January 2001,"There are very few films that have combined the necessary elements of filmmaking as well as this offering.The elements I feel that are essential to create a movie that may achieve cult status and be respected by audiences and artists alike are a strong emsemble cast,direction, cinematography and a soundtrack that complements the theme.As for being a showpiece for goth,all elements are here-a man oppressed who after a tragedy rises against his oppressors and takes revenge in a dark and brutal manner using the forces used against him on his enemies.Pain is now his weapon.The cast is superb and everyone contributes by rendering fine performances.Brandon Lee is well suited to the main role and this time not only because of his martial arts skills.He has a strong on screen presence and although not being the most gifted actor,he is able to evoke the strong emotions of a man hell bent on revenge for the death of his fiancee.No other actor has been capable of creating believability for James O'Barrs character as is evident in the sequels.That is no sympathy call-just an objective observation.Micheal Wincott has a penchant for playing dark characters and it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing this role.The rest play well as dregs and are not too camp.The cast obviously could not do it alone and Alex Proyas mustered his team well to create arguably his best movie.I agree with other IMDB users that the sequels would have been more than mediocre with his influence.Cinematography is largely unheralded but it's role here in creating unforgettable images should not go unnoticed.The visions of a dark city were riveting and images from the crow's POV are easily remembered.Of great influence to O'Barr was music and the soundtrack is of world class.Every track has it's place in this movie.Moods are manipulated by each track and Eric's rage and deep set sadness is accentuated by the relevant track.The soundtrack CD is a definite must for all fans of the movie or of alternative music.It is easy to say that Brandon's death helped this movie achieve cult status.While this was an obvious influence especially considering the theme of the screenplay,I believe that cult status would have been achieved regardless owing to the elements discussed above.I believe that this was going to be the picture that would have launched Brandon to being a big Hollywood player.At least he had the chance to make a film like this.",The Crow

He only did this once to one baddie in a burning car.Doesn't go through to detail of him questioning why this happen and how much hate or why nobody has done any justice.

186,HawkHerald,An atypical revenge thriller,8,31 December 2013,"So this is a strange looking but still beautifully made film about a rock star, Eric Draven (Brandon Lee), who's murdered and his fiancé, Shelly Webster, who was beaten, raped and later dies in an intensive care unit. The two are killed on Devil's Night, October 30, the night before their wedding by T-Bird and his gang on orders from Detroit drug lord Top Dollar (Michael Wincott). Devil's Night in Detroit, according to this movie is a night of crime and rampant acts of arson committed by gangs like T-Bird's who use arson as a way of destroying evidence and intimidating people. A year after he is killed, Eric returns from the grave to seek vengeance for his and Shelley's murders. Dressed in dark ragged clothing and Hellequin make-up, as The Crow, Eric seems to be impervious to gunshots and have near superhuman strength. He's guided by a crow, a supernatural symbol of death and perhaps salvation or transcendence, that allows him to track the movements of his enemies. Eric's death and undead mission of vengeance intersect with the lives Sergeant Albrecht and Sarah. Sgt. Albrecht was a first responding police officer who stayed with Shelley while she was in intensive care until she died. Sarah was a skater girl who's neglectful junkie mother caused her to spend much of her time with Eric and Shelley when she wasn't skateboarding. Both of them were directly affected by Eric and Shelley's deaths, and later help Eric's quest for revenge. Eric's makeup and dress were influenced by English goth rock as seen in Crow creator James O'Barr's source comic material, in particular Bauhaus lead singer Peter Murphy. James O'Barr's own loss of his fiancé to a drunk driver and love of goth rock inspired the story. Alex Proyas, a director who came to movies from a short film and music video background, does an excellent job of making Detroit look like a smoky empty industrial wasteland (which it sadly is) that was also strangely beautiful and appealing. Great entertaining film for action film who want some substance to their viewing or even Bruce Lee connoisseurs who want to see the kind of superstar potential Brandon Lee possessed.",The Crow

I saw an Episode of ""The Crow: Stairway to Heaven"", but it uses the Crow as more of a Detective and Ninja than what The Crow is. I hope it gets cancelled really soon. It is too cheap.Well back to the film, I was so sad to see that this man, (Brandon Lee)The son of Martial Arts, was no longer with us. This would've made Brandon a star.

189,WilderMovieReviews,A great film but give the follow ups a miss!,10,19 March 2012,"I followed the making of this film quite closely after the lead star Brandon Lee was tragically killed during the making of the film. It happened when a gun used to fire live rounds was then used to fire blanks during a scene with Brandon Lee. The gun wasn't cleaned and checked correctly and it was discovered that a round that had been previously fired had failed to fire correctly. The bullet lodged in the barrel and remained there until the gun was used with blank rounds. The force of the blank firing was enough to propel the bullet out of the barrel and fatally wounded Brandon Lee. This led to many changes in the use of firearms on set, sadly however these changes were too late and the movie world lost a truly great rising star.The film is ironically about the murder of the character played by Brandon Lee. He then comes back from the grave to avenge his death and the brutal rape and murder of his girlfriend Shelly by a gang.The film is a masterpiece and visually stunning. It is a very dark film and the visuals portray this extremely well. The cast includes Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson & Michael Wincott. The acting is great from most of the cast with very over the top performances by the gang members and a near perfect stand out performance by Brandon Lee. Having only seen him in action martial arts movies prior to this his acting ability really stands out here and shows what potential he had.This is a really good film and knowing the background into the death of the lead actor helps to bring a sense of reality to it. However without the tragic accident this is still a great film. More fantasy than horror it has a great story that really draws you in and doesn't let go until the end.Unfortunately someone decided the film needed some very poor sequels! However a short lived TV series was made using the original characters and it was actually quite good.If you have never seen this please give it a go, it's a great film but give the follow ups a miss!",The Crow

191,golem3,A No Frills Shoot-Em Up Revenge Ride,9,11 September 2005,"The beauty of The Crow is that it's all about revenge without waiting for the afterlife. This movie is unique that it is one of few modern dark films that are shot in a noir-esquire style; like Blade Runner, Underworld, and the Matrix it reflects a bleak and terrible future riddled with crime and infamy. Brandon Lee (the son of legendary Kung Fu master Bruce Lee) plays the human behind a terrible tragedy in which he comes alive again with the help of the myth of the Crow. The film is a no-frills shoot up the bad guys without any significant martial arts (although Brandon was trained like his father  both Lees died tragically) As with many films today, this film dabbles with the mysteries of the supernatural, where both the evil and good have some control over mysterious powers that they seem to just attain without any background. Of course, there is a host of other side characters that add to Mr. Lee's need to pursue his main goal. ""You're all gonna die anyway!"" RATING: 9.5/10 SPECIAL NOTE: A terrible tragedy, Brandon Lee was accidentally killed during the filming of The Crow, due to a blank shell entering his chest.

On a scale of 1 to 10 this movie is a 1. If this movie were a dish at a Mexican restaurant it would be an ASS-TACO. Goth movies are always bad because the material is very childish and silly. The acting is like an after school special and the writing... well it looks like it was written by Goths.

195,RebelXStar,"Believe me, nothing is trivial",7,19 October 2015,"A stylish revenge fantasy film inspired by the graphic novel by James O' Barr, which in turn, was inspired by the real-life murder of his girlfriend by a drunk driver.The title refers to the crow that brings the main character, Eric Draven back to life after a year to avenge his and fiancée, Shelly Webster's murder at the hands of the city's most notorious gang members. And is, of course, the final film of the man who plays him, Brandon Lee, who was fatally injured on set by a stunt that went awry.I admit to not being familiar with Lee's previous work as it mostly consists of martial arts movies, which don't really interest me, but in regards to his performance as Eric, he was putting his heart and soul into the role and it shows.He displays all the key emotions you'd expect to see in a man who has already lost everything dear to him and has nothing else left to lose, perfectly. He plays Eric with vulnerability, sadness, rage, a thirst for vengeance and just the right amount of child-like mischievousness of someone who knows he can can basically do whatever he wants with no consequences. I couldn't do a review of The Crow without mentioning Ernie Hudson, who plays my favourite character, Police Officer Albrecht who aids Eric on his quest for vengeance. He provides the 'every man' perspective and occasional comic relief.In any other genre, having one-dimensional villains can really weaken a film but as this is a revenge fantasy it isn't necessary to know how the villains came to be or what they do when they're not being scumbags. The main villain, mob boss Top Dollar, alludes to having tragedy in his past but ultimately falls into the category of ""man who just wants to watch the world burn"" (to quote another movie featuring a man with a painted face who also died in tragic circumstances).The story of Eric and Shelly's relationship is told through the use of flashbacks and it's a pity we don't get to see more of them together on screen.

Atmosphere, visualization etc.,etc., I can't say enough!! This is one of those movie's that almost made me cry (the best any movie can do) which to me, despite Lee's death, is an achievement, believe me, I saw it quite a few times and my reaction is the same (I must be a freak!!) Anyhow, I forgot how I was going to pick everything apart on this movie, so I'll leave this alone... a 10!",The Crow
198,TriNitroToluene,Explosive movie,10,17 January 2001,"This Gothic action movie based upon the comic book by James O'Bar turned out to be a surprising success, not just in my eyes but in many people's. This was within the top 5 best movies I've ever seen.  Rarely does an action movie have such a powerful effect upon your emotions.  The acting was done well by each and every actor in the cast.  The atmosphere is very constant throughout the movie, and it just grabs you from the beginning scene and holds you until the very end.  You will never forget this movie once you see it.  There are many memorable lines in the script and I guarantee it will stick to you.  I'm sure Brandon Lee would have been proud to see the project completed.",The Crow
199,dangermous,wow,10,31 January 2010,"I saw this 3 times at the cinema and seen it so many times since on DVD. I have never got bored watching it again.a dark brooding movie set in a dark world which all martial arts, action and Gothic movie fans will love.The film is full of edgy characters that pull off an amazing performance. Brandon lee is the crow! The crow is without a doubt better than anything he has done before.so many characters and such a powerful story, this movie will keep you gripped. I'm not going to go into the plot just whole heartedly recommend this film to everyone.I will say all the sequels and TV shows that followed are really bad in comparison. If you've seen any of them don't be put off. this is the only version worth watching",The Crow
200,Andrew_Wiper,"Fun, dark, emotional.",10,7 October 2019,"A fantastic performance from Brandon Lee that still holds up to this day. You could just tell he loved every minute of playing this character and it majorly sucks he had to die the way he did. The Crow, directed by Alex Proyas is a dark, vibrant movie. It is violent yes, but it has a lot of heart and emotion too. Made even more so by the fact of Brandon's untimely passing. It's a moody and fun action flick and all the actors who play the bad guys nail their parts in it. Made in 1993, the film was released in 1994. It has that feel of something out of the 90's, a grunginess to it.. and the soundtrack and score perfectly fit into this. Mortal Kombat is the best video game to movie adaptation in my opinion, and this very well may be the greatest comic book to movie adaption. There's no denying that. All in all, this is a darkly fun, grungy, gothic comic book film. A terrific performance from Brandon Lee. Watch it if you haven't seen it. There is a cool book written about it by Bridget Biass. It's titled The Crow: The Story Behind The Film. Filled with tons of information about the making of the movie, the before and after process, all the people involved and there's lots of stuff to read about Brandon too. This movie deserves its cult status and is worth watching every devil's night if you ask me.",The Crow
201,atanas_n1-1,this movie is my absolute favorite of all times,10,18 September 2009,"it has exactly the right mood, fatalistic feeling, darkness, mystery, love, hate and poesy. it also managed to hit me at the right time in the right mood for sure a movie about revenge, justice and love beyond the grave, it manages to keep you under pressure all the time, even with the main character seemingly indestructible at the beginning. the characters are great and unique, featuring what i find some of the most interesting and funny bad guys. the lines they trade and the acting delivered by the actors is beautiful too, and still feels fresh after all the times i watched it.the soundtrack even manages to improve the already well created mood, with bands like the cure, machines of loving grace and stone temple pilots - in fact i first discovered the soundtrack and loved it :) the movie manages to inspire me each time i watch it, and there surely have been 20-30 times already. i've never watched anything like it, not in terms of mood, story or mystery, but the action is beautiful too, as is every shot in it ...yeah, i know - i'm better when ranting about one i didn't like ... this is why i waited so long before writing something about this one ... still doesn't seem right, but i will improve it with the time Eric Draven: ""Victims - aren't we all...""",The Crow
202,johncusacksback,Mostly entertaining,6,4 July 2003,"**1/2 out of ****Starts off strong, but then just drags on and too often resorts to excessive violence. Brandon Lee gives a good performance and is very likeable in the title role. Ernie Hudson is also good as a former detective who has been demoted and now walks the beat of the crime infested inner city. It doesn't help that as the movie goes on, the bad guys become more cliched and far too wise as to what exactly is happening. None the less, it's still an entertaining movie.",The Crow
203,c_hookham,gothic masterpiece?,10,13 June 2003,revenge is probably my favourite film themes and the crow is a great example of a revenge film that is also very touching. The theme of true love even in death is brilliantly portrayed by Brandon Lee and there are some stunning visuals. Part action part gloomy gothic horror romance. 9/10,The Crow
204,jordansteel,"A fine effort, but nothing exceptional",4,27 September 2018,"Good atmosphere, unique concept. The concept will (obviously) lead to only one end. A superhero, bound to squash the villain's. 
Have added a few turns here and there and given him his weaknesses for his enemies to stand a chance so we get to see a full match. 
May appeal to certain audiences, those looking for something light, who are interested in the genre, fans of the star, i fell a significant part of the fans are the sympathizers. 
But lets face it. This is nowhere among the best films made. My sympathies go out to Lee as well and the movie was fine. But not among the best made, wont figure in the top 30%. A one time watch for a different concept.",The Crow
205,jjo999,Dark but touching movie,10,1 January 2005,"Although this movie does not appear to be all that interesting from the cover, the storyline is awesome and completely well-done. The action appears realistic and the drama is sufficient enough to bring tears to the eyes. I definitely encourage anyone to watch this movie and formulate their own opinion of it. It's beautiful (in a dark way), but that doesn't have to be a bad thing all the time. The only thing I keep wondering is why the crow always put himself in danger's way. If he was Eric's strength, he should have kept himself in hiding until he really needed to come out. Many action movies tend to lack in the aspect of drama, but this movie had the right balance of action and drama to keep my interest the whole way through. My best friend, Kristine (sexy4u) showed me this movie, and I loved it so much that it will become a part of my growing movie selection shortly.",The Crow

207,afdiazr,A fantastic tale of love and revenge that will never die,10,20 January 2005,"This movie holds a lot of feelings for me. It was a movie that I shared with a person I loved so much back in the 90s. It's a movie that moved me beyond words. Yeah, you can say it lacks a story, but it delivers on a powerful set of sensations derived mainly from love and despair. I remember going to the movies with my mom and brother (the first time I saw it), and even my mom loved it for it's strength. Then my ex-girlfriend and I turned into our very own movie. We accepted Eric, Sarah and Shelley into our lives, and they became a part of our relationship. This movie speaks so much to you when you're deeply in love, because you feel Eric's loss. Brandon did a great job on this, so did Proyas and everyone involved. There hasn't been another comic book movie like this one, only Spider-man 2. The rest are just action flicks with great sequences.",The Crow
208,Mr. Superbad,A great action film.,8,10 October 1999,"It has great atmosphere and incredible action sequences. However the actor's are somewhat hammy, (especially in the flashbacks). Overall it's a great action flick with supernatural overtones, but the acting brings it down a notch.The original graphic novel is a work of art, the film just doesn't live up to it.A minor problem I had with it is that there was no original Joy Division song in the movie. A band who's songs were deeply influential to the original story. Instead we get a b********** NIN version to sell the soundtrack. Lame.",The Crow

Yeah, so what? Plots suck. It's what happens that's important(You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?). Anyways, you all know what happens. Dead rock singer comes back to avenge the death of him and his wife. It's very simple. And when it's all that simple and is so darn good, why do you need a plot? It really sucks that Brandon Lee died on the set, this movie really brought out his extraordinary acting talent, that he must have inherited from his father, Bruce.

I was sort of sickened that they would even attempt to finish this movie without him.So I didn't jump the gun and see this movie in the theatres until very late. To my surprise it was a great movie that had an excellent cast, and an excellent soundtrack. Brandon Lee's scenes are moving, perhaps more so when in the back of your mind you know this was his last film. After seeing the finished product I feel it was well done in good taste.",The Crow

In the scene where Eric is under the policeman's gun, the cop is distracted by the sight of people looting the ruins of the burning pawnshop.

212,Oorag,Intoxicatingly good,10,24 January 2000,"I was hesitant to watch this movie because a guy I knew in school was infatuated with this movie, and I didn't want to feel gothy for watching it. After i succumbed, I was infatuated as well. It stopped at dressing like the Crow, but I still dug the movie.This movie is one of the few ever made that has everything going for it: tragedy with genuine emotion, incredible style, breath-taking images, hip dialogue, and truly kick-ass action. This is not only one of the very best action movies I've ever seen, it's also a cracking good story.
Every character has personality and style, and the bad guys, while brutal, still manage to be human. One doesn't loose sight of the grittiness of the story. The Crow isn't just taking out the trash, he's risen from the dead to exterminate four human beings. It's not pretty. Not only that, but the Crow has the pleasure of show-casing one of my favorite unknown actors: Michael Wincott, as Top Dollar. No one plays a human reptile as well as Wincott. That slithery, gravely voice sends chills down your spine, I'm upset he didn't get more recognition for this movie.
I also have to hand it to the director, if you read the script for this movie you see the director made some really good choices in filtering a lot of promising but convoluted ideas into a whip-cord of a movie.",The Crow

217,knows_film,don't watch this expecting a snuff film (they cut the scene),5,3 July 2011,For a long time I have known of the tragedy that surrounded this film. An actor being killed on set for giving a wooden performance. Harsh but not necessarily unjustified. Films cost millions of dollars and poor acting can completely ruin the finished product. People have been killed for a lot less is all I'm saying. Don't expect to see the famous scene its not in the film and or special features. Disappointing!Now to the film. I found it quite entertaining in parts. Brandon Lee's character was quite a dark hero. The film was quite dark. Not to mention violent. I enjoyed the violence.An interesting observation I had was in the similarities between Brandon Lee's Crow character and Heath Ledger's Joker character. Not just in make up but in performance. I have to wonder whether or not Heath Ledger modeled his Joker on Lee's Crow. One might go as far as saying Ledger modeled everything on Lee. Right down to promoting the film by dying during the production of it. No doubt both films received extra attention due to the star dying before it hit the cinemas.,The Crow

It is better than the Batman movies(Jack Nicholson notwithstanding), a bit better than Blade, and about as good as the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. Hollywood lost a probable superactor(Brandon's father Bruce preferred the term superactor to superstar) when Brandon was accidently killed. The darkness and incredible set designs, special effects, and characters make this a cinematic classic. All this on a budget of $6 million. Skip the sequel.",The Crow

Excellent metal/alternative soundtrack as well.",The Crow
220,Andrew-162,Perfect Halloween Movie.,8,15 September 1999,"For the horror-movie weakling, this is as dark and gloomy as it gets. Is this a bad thing? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! This movie is fantastic. The photography is incredible, the set design is as fitting as humanly possible, and Brandon Lee makes a surprisingly good undead. Here's the plot line. Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his girlfriend/fiancee, Shelley (Sophia Shinas) are the ideal couple with a romance that conquers all-including death. However, the local crime gang interrupts that on halloween (eve or night, I can't remember) and rapes his fiancee. When Eric comes in in the middle of this, he tries to stop them. This gets him thrown out the window and his girlfriend killed. Young, tough, and street-wise Sarah (Rochelle Davis) always looked up to Eric and Shelley, and always imagined them as the caring parents she never had. She can see right through local cop Albrecht (Ernie Hudson) when he says they're going to be OK.However, 1 year later on Halloween  (eve or night) the darkest city I've ever seen in a movie and the local crime gang are in for a surprise. For, Eric Draven, surprise surprise, is back from the grave. Led by a mysterious crow (who the audience can obviously tell holds Eric's soul), Eric finds clothes and makeup to disguise his true identity. He then goes to find revenge on those who took the 2 most precious things to him-his wife and his life. He kills them one by one, now invincible because he is already dead.Each time he leaves some kind of mark in the shape of a crow (A blood painting, and a trail of lit gasoline, etc.) Albrecht vaguely remembers Eric from last Halloween (Eve or night) and meets Eric after his 2nd murder. He and Eric have the hilarious confrontation: ""You move and you're dead!!!"" ""And I say I'm dead...and I move"". Whenever anyone meets Eric, he mysteriously dissapears, until Sarah recognizes him from a quote of his and confronts him. After he kills the men he thinks are responsible for last Halloween (eve or night), he meets the real man behind the plan--Top Dollar (Michael Wilcott), who is the leader of the crime gang. Then things start to get interesting. I won't give away the ending. Brandon Lee puts on a great performance, and sadly, his last, as irony entered the situation and when he was supposed to be shot with a blank he was actually shot for real. This is probably the darkest movie I've ever seen that still managed to be a romance. A Must-see (4½ out of 5, 1/2 point off for a little predictability).",The Crow

And it's not just that it has a Gothic setting that makes it so intriguing.  The acting is superb.  Every actor and actress in this film put their best effort in the making of this movie.Caution: might be spoilers ahead'The Crow' is a simple story about a guy who comes back from the dead to avenge the death of his fiancee.  He searches the city for the men responsible for her death and as long as the crow that guides him throughout the city remains unharmed, he is invincible.  The key performances are Brandon Lee as Eric Draven and Michael Wincott as Top Dollar.  David Patrick Kelly, Rochelle Davies, Bai Ling, and the men who play Tin Tin, Skank, Funboy, the cop, and the pawnshop owner are also riveting.  Every kill Eric Draven makes is creative, and just about every line that comes out of Top Dollar's mouth makes you laugh.  The songs are great.  The only part about it I didn't get (I think they explained this but I didn't catch it) was the part about Bai Ling's character being Top Dollar's sister.  Anyway, the reason why I think this is the best material to come out of cinema is because this is a simple plot twisted into a haunting, action-packed tale that will end with you feeling happy about renting it and very sad that Brandon Lee died during the filming.",The Crow

I recommend this great thriller. **** out of ****",The Crow
226,Killer_Romance2,Good Guys do wear Black,10,29 October 2004,"I watched this movie in my video collection. For starters, Brandon Lee was about 29 years old when he died on the set, so young and influential like his Father Bruce Lee who is arguably the first Action Hero, because no doubt in my mind if Brandon lived on, he not only would have been the most talented, successful Actor taking over Johnny Depp, but he would be the most independent Actor in his own rite. Plus, I cannot believe this movie is not older than it is!! Made in 1994 and it still looks great, absolutely Timeless, if it was released in the box office beyond the threshold of the year 2K , the sales would hit the roof, and here is why: The music score is brilliantly composed by Graeme Revell, who also done Child's Play 2 and Bride of Chucky, and the electric Guitar sound during the fighting scenes sores up your adrenal glands and gets them pumping.The Style of the comic strip super hero is a Mosher; the twisted Gothic look that now inspires trends due to the like of Marilyn Manson, and most black metal bands that are appealing at this particular time even as I speak! That is why I am accounting that this movie is beyond it's time.Set on Devil's Night 30 October, Hangman's Noose front man musician, Eric Draven suitably played by Brandon Lee, and beautiful fiancée Shelley Webster were ready for their big day on Hallowe'en Night, but tragedy came when Shelley was Raped and beaten by vicious and invective Gang members by the names of Tin Tin, Skank, T-bird etc. Eric walks in unexpectedly and was beaten, shot and thrown from the window as he plummets a 100 feet below to his death. A cool-headed cop wonderfully played by Ernie Hudson of Hand that rocks the Cradle, and Ghostbusters fame is in charge of the case, breaks the news to 12 year old lonely Sarah who narrates the story in the Movie.Exactly one year later, with a help of a Crow, Eric Draven rose from his grave and become the psychopathic avenger, but he puts his insanity into good use to stalk the Gang one-by-one, turns Tin Tin into a ""Voodoo doll"", T-bird into a moving flame grilled Whopper burger, and the crack head one that ""feels like a worm on a big fvcking hook"" known as Skank gets a plunge from the Window and ritualistically leaves an outlined symbol of a Crow at the scene. The head leader of the Gang is Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), his half-Sister who have more than a consanguineous relationship (yep! you guessed it!) along with his comrade Tony Todd (Candyman) as they ploy and find out that a welcomed guest who has come back from the dead to greet them, has a weakness to be human by killing the Crow that guides him and to destroy Eric to allure him by kidnapping Sarah. It is up to Eric to go against all odds to save the captive Sarah and finally rest in peace.I enjoyed Superhero movies like Batman, Spiderman 1 and 2, but they lacked the witty, dark humor that realistically reflects the heart of the chaotic society where scruples don't apply, and the dialogue resembles Quentin Tarantino Style that is compared to DUSK TIL DAWN, and it is a clever movie about a deceased Victim that becomes a deadly vigilante with a scary presence in an anti-hero sense that irritates the law, unlike a geek that gets bitten by a spider, or an embodiment of a poor little orphan dressed as a bat.Better than Batman and Spidey, You are damn right!",The Crow
227,sr-shah,"Not dead, just too embarrassed to go out in public again",3,30 April 2012,"While watching this I decided that Brandon Lee's death must be a hoax. He isn't really dead, just too embarrassed to out in public again. This whole movie is just awful. Though, I suppose the two dimensional nature of everything about the film can be traced back to its comic origins, but what's the point of making a live action film if it's going to be thinner than the paper the original story was printed on? I'd like to see a prequel detailing the rise to power of the Hell Night leader despite his position as leader seeming completely arbitrary. I got the feeling that the soundtrack sold the movie. Grunge heads went to see it because their heroes' music was in it and must have loved it because of that. Can't recommend even for a casual view, really. Total waste of time IMO.",The Crow

When most people hear the name Brandon Lee, they think ""The Crow"" after all, it was his last performance in cinematic history. An All time favorite.To those who have seen it often experience the Sadness that was carried with the film, and what is kind of ironic about this movie dealing with life and death is the fact that Brandon Lee was killed during this movie.I consider this movie to be an independent film, yet it still hit theaters and was rewarded as a beautiful masterpiece. The crow is not a movie to see for entertainment (though it is HIGHLY entertaining and is also considered a classic), this is a movie to experience.Reading what many others have said about The Crow, it has touched them in so many ways, as well as myself.I advise everyone to go see this movie who hasn't.",The Crow

It's all the more tragic that he died during filming as the man certainly had some talent which might have been able to grow more. Watching him in The Crow brings conflicting emotions to the surface; you sympathize with his violent death and vengeful existence, yet he is absolutely ruthless and sadistic in exacting punishment on his executioners.The depressed look of the city where it is constantly raining can be slightly overbearing at times, but still does an admirable job of conveying the melancholy of the environment. The supporting cast does a fine job also, even the child actor avoids being irritating.Overall, definitely one of the better comic book adaptions of the 1990s.",The Crow

The dark nature of the film and its hero might not appeal to everyone, but for me it was right on the money. I find the movie fascinating and moving every time I view it. Yes, I said ""moving"" because I can feel the hero's pain and torment. Hey, how would you feel after coming back from the dead to avenge the murder of your one true love?

232,Walter_Skinner,A personal favorite of mine.,8,7 August 2011,I don't actually watch many movies more then once but The Crow is actually one of the few movies I've seen more than once. I genuinely like the movie for several reasons. I find this to be one of the best revenge tales I've ever seen. Unlike almost all other revenge flicks I've seen this one works because the characters are likable. The theme of the movie is actually tied into the unfortunate death of Brandon Lee. It also manages to capture the atmosphere of the Grunge craze that happened in the 90s. The best part about it though is that the movie manages to pull all of this off and still not seem dated. Even though I only saw this movie twice it felt better watching it the second time around rather then the first. I also like the movie more then the Comic even though the comic is solid as well.,The Crow
233,maple_leafs_kickass,Perfect,10,14 May 2006,"This movie is a gorgeous cinematic masterpiece that everyone should view. Though dark and Gothic this movie resembles such terrific and strong emotion and is centered around a romantic theme as Brandon Lee exacts revenge against the ruthless band of criminals who murdered him and his fiancée after being revived from a hypnotic crow. I Can't believe that Brandon Lee died while filming this movie, I was really looking foreword to see him shine in the future. Some argue that Brandon Lee's death sold this movie but I don't buy that. If you've watched this movie it hits you, it hits you hard and grabs you in with it and you'll want to keep watching till Brandon brings down the last criminal. I can't believe what a performance Brandon Lee gave he was terrific and gripping portraying a character that everybody can relate to. Alex Proyas did a terrific job of making the movie really bleak and dark just like the comic book. A beautiful comic book brought to life I was amazed blown away and breathless by the time it had come to conclusion.Rest in Peace Brandon you have made your mark 10/10",The Crow

235,adamzad,The comments saying it's a good adaptation...,4,24 June 2004,"of the comic must have been written by people who haven't read the comic.*Possible* spoilers...When the producers adapted the comic to the movie, they left behind the core of the character. The major characteristic that made The Crow who he was. To describe the revenant of Eric Draven requires only one word: laconic. He was an avenging angel who said very little, and that was a big part of what made him so terrifying to his victims. He appears and they recognize him. He doesn't say much. He doesn't really seem angry. He just, calmly, proceeds to extract the full measure of justice they deserve. Nothing they do can stop him. This is the definition of a revenant. Someone who has died so wrongly that their spirit remains in the earthly plane with a single driving purpose (in this case, vengeance). Nothing diverts the revenant from that purpose and it's damn near impossible to stop it from accomplishing said purpose.Making all those long-winded speeches is, simply, something that a revenant would not do. There is no need and it distracts from the purpose.So. Go back and read the comic, it's better than the movie (which, with 2 exceptions, is always the case). It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't do justice to the source.4 of 10.",The Crow
236,muchneededescape,One of the deepest movies of all time.,10,14 August 2004,"This movie is my favorite film of all time. One factor of this film that made it so awesome had to be the casting. The acting is just superb. Brandon Lee did an excellent job of playing Eric Draven, one of the most complicated comic book characters ever. I don't think there's any actor out there that could've mastered this role like Brandon Lee did. Michael Wincott fit Top Dollar's personality so well. He can be so evil at times. The soundtrack and the score were masterpieces in themselves. All the bands chosen to appear ( ex. Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails)on the soundtrack had a certain mood to their music that fit the movie's aura. As for the score, Graeme Revell put together perhaps one of the best scores of the 1990's. With his combination of modern musical instruments and foreign instruments and his tasteful and original use of synthesizers, he will always be one of the most talented composers. The plot of this film is so universal. it can be used on so many other levels or in so many other stories. Being brought back from the dead not to avenge yourself, but to avenge the death of your loved one. Some may think that it's cliche but this coming from the same people who watch movie like Robo Cop and think that that is good movie-making. ::shudder:: Others believe that the movie became popular for the fact that Brandon Lee passed away during the making of it. I don't think this could be farther from the truth. The movie would be just as popular as it is today even if Brandon Lee had not died during the fabrication of the film. Though the sequels that followed the film fell short of it's greatness, they will never tarnish the importance of The Crow. James O' Barr put together a story of anger, pain, and love and Alex Proyas turned his vision into a masterpiece. This movie changed my life...",The Crow

So Eric and his girlfriend get munder because they your a post to move out of their apartment but they didn't so they got killed so a year later a crow brings Eric back to life so can seek revenge on the people who killed his girlfriend and go after top dollar which is a very underrated villain in my opinion but you should watch this it has great action sequences and amazing soundtrack,The Crow

239,comfortablynumb_1,The Gothic matrix,8,2 August 2005,What a classic! Dark and disturbing but with an undercurrent of hope throughout. Essentially the film is about revenge of a murdered man who isn't ready for death so returns from death in an immortal form. A crow is his link between life and afterlife.The Crow is a cold film but occasionally the young girl brings some warmth to the screen in particular when She becomes friends with a police officer and when her Mother cleans up and starts caring.The villains are pure evil. Of course they all die and there is a happy ending for the girl and her mother. How sweet.8/10 for this which is 2 points more than my Matrix rating. This is due to the Matrix being dehumanized and the Crow shows human emotion and certain characters personify these emotions particularly anger and sorrow. A better soundtrack too.,The Crow

""The Crow"" is a masterpiece. A sad, dark and violent fable of revenge and death bought by a black bird that, sometimes, takes back to life the victims of brutal murderer so they can have they holy revenge. The movie is a little different from the original graphic novel written by James O.Barr. The novel is beautiful and my advice is to read it as soon as you can if you loved the movie. This film also remind the tragic death of Brandon Lee. Brandon was incredible acting as ""the Crow"". The other two movies are simply awful and cannot bring to life the spirit within the original, incredible, novel. This is an angry movie on the side of the victims. Not politically correct, not religious, but simply a movie about revenge, and it's something like a poem about love and death. I loved it. Wonderful.",The Crow

On this dvd there is an interesting interview with the original cartoonist of the Crow. He tells he's proud the director really listened to him to make it as darkish as possible, even bleach out colors to make it this gothic crow world. The soundtrack (The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots), the cast, the director, to the last person just exquisite.PS I only approve to this movie to be THE CROW. The sequels aren't even worth watching. I cannot understand how they could screw up the excellent original. And the tragedy that happened during the making of this movie: Brandon Lee got shot with a real bullet instead of blanks.How could this happen?

Lee gives an excellent performance filled up with emotion, sarcasm, energy which makes all viewers starting believing in angels. It is probably the darkest Gothic film of all time at its best and we don't know how far would Brandon Lee go if he was still alive today. Life has been so unfair for the Lee family, people say that they are cursed. I wonder when will the crow be released in a special edition DVD set. It deserves it. Brandon deserves it. All Gothic and not only fans deserve it. Thank you Brandon and thank you Alex Proyas for this great film. 10 of course. Rest in peace Brandon. Thanx again",The Crow

""i loved it"". from the beginning till the moment Shelly comes to escort him to the afterlife where he can finally rest. the music was rocking. i downloaded a lot of the song and still looking for the last ones.

245,Dark Scribe,Darkly stylish,7,31 December 1999,"The Crow showcased the prodigious talents of Brandon Lee, who with out doubt would have forged his own considerable identity with this film had he not been tragically killed. A very stylish film throughout, this film established the dark brooding style that rocketed The Matrix into international success. Lee is magnificent as the reborn Eric Draven, although a little more martial arts from him would have been appreciated. Michael Wincott also turns in a great performance as the villainous Top Dollar, delivering his lines with gutteral precision and evil. Stylish costumes, lighting and cinematography complement the fantastic action sequences and fine acting perfectly, to create a truly excellent film. 8 out of 10.",The Crow

Yes, his death was tragic, all the more tragic considering the movie and the source material (ironic is a better word.) This is one of the greatest movies of the 1990's, and anyone who claims otherwise is sadly mistaken. As with most decades, it is the smaller cult films that take the cake. Clerks, Pulp fiction, The Matrix (although bigger budget), and the crow are on the list of the ten best movies of the 1990's.

But as the movie went on I realized that Brandon was truly one fine actor who before this one was not given adequate script to work on.This is a kind of movie one should gift another or even keep in his own personal collection. The cinematography was excellent and action was brilliant as did not posses that high flying gravity defying martial arts instead it was more natural.The acting is brilliant, Brandon Lee was simply superb shame that he died during filming this motion picture, I guess god is not fair in certain aspects. Rochelle Davis as a teenager was awesome, pity that she didn't featured in any other movie after this. Ernie Hudson & Michael Wincott were very good in their respectable roles, Bai Ling was perhaps the only one who was wrongly cast.The story is great and the overall package was not only entertaining but also enterprising. I would give it an eight out of ten but simply because of Brendon it gets nine out of ten. Do watch this movie as it will surely deliver to your expectations.",The Crow

251,tommonster3k,Among the great comic book movies.,8,6 April 2004,"Alex Proyas is gifted at crafting fine dark sci-fi cinema.  ""The Crow"" is truly a great movie.  There are a few things that could've been done a little better.  For instance, lots of quick cuts rarely work to do anything but confuse and frustrate.  But as that may be intentional, why nitpick over it?Funny that a guy whose resume consists almost entirely of cheap horror sequels could pen this movie, especially with several scenes of genuine good dialogue.  But Proyas' cinematic style is what makes the film really great. He took a good story and treated it with respect, taking the time to let the character of Eric Draven develop through a succession of alternating loud and violent scenes, and quiet and contemplative scenes.  It's a beautiful balance for such an intriguing character.Brandon Lee's Eric Draven has secured a place in the history of great, memorable cinematic characters, and he will forever be remembered and loved for his role in this film.8/10 stars: an excellent film.",The Crow

How I could feel the misery.Consistent use of color tones is another remarkable thing that I appreciated. It was like looking at a one single beautiful piece of art, rather than trying to grasp what is at stake in each frame of a flow. Nothing was deflected.I'd just wanted the journey last longer so that maybe we could see an in-depth character development through which maybe I could empathize even more with Eric.Also it appears to me that whole entire story can be created to reflect the weirdness of the sibling villains. I'm not sure whether I would want it but sure it can be done as there are too many materials in them.Lastly, It's not a hero movie about a strong guy but a story of a vulnerable guy who tries to go back into light, near to his beloved one. Struggles of him reflected to every ground of the movie and even to the coloring. I feel sad, angry sometimes and slightly happy. Actings do not really have flaws and the movie successfully tells whatever it likes to say implicitly. So you can take whatever you want or you don't, then just enjoy.",The Crow

Taking place on the night before Halloween, Brandon Lee, in his final ironic performance, portrays Eric Draven risen from the grave to obtain revenge and justice against the violent street gang that brutally murdered him and raped his fiancé before they were set to be married. With a look very similar to Tim Burton's Batman and a bit of Blade Runner homages, it is definitely a visual work of art in cinema. This certainly falls into the category of one of those movies that would be very difficult if not impossible to remake. The only minor nitpick I as a viewer have is how Top Dollar kind of steps out of line and cheats against our hero as I like to call it. Luckily, our hero fights back and teaches him a lesson through grief.",The Crow

The film then jumps to a year later.  Brandon Lee's character Eric Draven returns from the dead to avenge his death and to ""put the wrong things right"".  His return is made possible because as legend says a crow takes a person from the land of the living to the land of the dead, but sometimes when a terrible evil has been committed the soul can't rest.  Thus the crow allows Eric to return.The film has really good acting in it, especially Brandon Lee.  It is really sad to watch him knowing that he died while filming the movie.  I think he could have been a really great actor and dominates the film.  Ernie Hudson also does a great job as the good police man who does his best to do the right thing and help people, even though it means he gets in trouble with his boss.Overall this is a great movie.

When I went home and popped in the VCR...it was a great film.The story was great...which was based by the comic by James o'barr.  The plot is Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)is a dead guy who comes back to life to get revenge from the gang that killed he and his girlfriend one year before. Later on he finds out he got these supernatural powers from a crow. I won't get too much on detail but here is what i liked about it. I loved the strong acting and the action sequence in the board room which was cool.

Lee brilliantly becomes Eric Draven, a dead rock singer who is risen from the grave by a Crow exactly one year later to avenge his and his fiancee's murders.  The scenes when he is a complete psycho, who is driven to the limits just blows you away.  When he is deep he is just moving.  Plus here's something for action fans.

But 'The Crow' is, in my opinion, the finest film ever made.  Brandon Lee excels in his final role, echoing his father with an eerie sense of fate. Ernie Hudson is brilliant as ever - hell this man made 'Congo' worth watching so he's bound to make 'The Crow' even better.  Other members of the cast, notably Michael Wincott and Tony Todd also add their acting brilliance, but they could amount to nothing without a great script.The truth is, the script for this film is electrifying.  As I write this, the site's quote of the day is from 'The Crow'.  I'm reminded of great lines like 'Halloween ain't till Manyana' (if that's how ya spell it) and 'Jesus Christ walks into an inn, hands the innkeeper three nails and says - can you put me up for the night' and above all the haunting 'It can't rain all the time'.Everything about this film is superb.

260,danieljfenner,Like a two-hour long music video,7,14 November 2015,"But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The soundtrack to this film had shaped my adolescence even though I hadn't even seen the movie until twenty years later. In fact, most of the fun of watching it was the 90's nostalgia and to see and hear how the music was used in the film. It's almost as if there was a special block of a non-existent MTV show that catered to the goth/industrial set. The film flows like a series of music videos with its building-leaping action, surreal close-ups of the mysterious black-bird, and washed-out, sepia-drenched flashback sequences. While watching it I just remembered ""DAMN, that song by Medicine is so great!"" Too bad they never really took off. Truly, much of the music in this film still holds up even though I have changed drastically as a person when it comes to musical taste. Now. Let's get to the movie.Part of me as a critic really wants to target and surgically strike the painfully elementary dialogue and predictable story line but it would be unfair. To even criticize an adaptation of a comic book would be like sending a food critic to Wendy's. It's pop-culture, and typically when it comes to comics and graphic novels, the target audience is adolescent boys who wish to pass on the James Joyce and Bronte sisters melodrama. In other words, the intention is to be narratively pedestrian and simple while focusing on the tone, atmosphere and artistic prowess. It is fantasy. I'm not going to bring a gun to this knife fight.So what about the visuals and the film itself? It truly is a gorgeous film. Sweeping Hitchockian crane shots, birds eye view shots and blazing action sequences. It gracefully shifts back and forth from a gritty urban action thriller to a highly detailed romance. There is enough substance here to satisfy your inner Batman as well as your Wings of Desire. It is the perfectly appeasing date movie. If I saw it 1994, it would have been cliché. Seeing it now, I'm thinking ""they don't make em like this anymore."" Plus it gave Ernie Hudson a chance to show that he is more than Winston. More than the token tag-along.",The Crow

I remember being very taken by this movie as a young child, and now several years later and find myself still enjoying this film. I can't help but to feel that it lack something though. It had great potential to be extraordinary, and yet somehow it fails to deliver fully out and ends up being just a good movie with a original idea, when it could have been so much better! Its visuals are beautiful in a depressing and sad way, with a surreal and dark feel to it. The acting from Brandon Lee is great as avenger of his wife's murder and Michael Wincott's performance as the main villain is above average, however I feel it's missing something. His character could have been portrayed better by a different actor perhaps. Ernie Hudson gives a solid performance as well as Rochelle Davis as young Sarah. Also nice work from David Patrick Kelly playing his usual role as a psycho. Overall the acting is unfortunately a bit uneven on behalf of the rest of the cast.The pacing of the film is just about right. But as stated before I do feel that some elements are missing in order for this to be a totally mesmerizing experience. I can't really put my finger on it but it lack some depth. The quite original idea that Eric Draven is brought back from beyond the grave by a crow is excellent, and how the crow works as his link to the world and his temporary immortal state. Yet I would have wished for more of a build up, so we can feel his pain and loss. Shelley is seen only in flashbacks for instance. I also feel something else could be added to the plot in order for it to grow and be a really great film.To sum up it's a good film with an original idea and quite good acting, that just simply lack something to be as great as it could have been.

267,RFred666,a beautiful love story,10,21 February 2004,"This film is wonderful to me. I just think it has such a PURE message:- that some things NEVER die, and real LOVE is one of them. Even though this film happens to be pretty violent, I think the violence is 100% necessary. Because to be perfectly honest, if my fiance was brutally raped and murdered, I'd go out and do the same thing as young Eric did!!Also, me being of a gothic nature, made me love the film even more, thanks to the film settings and musical score!!!Brandon Lee gave a beautiful, and strong performance, and it was a tragedy, that his life, ironically, had to end so soon, during the making of this movie. But, despite, I think this made the movie even more powerful, and will go on for hopefully many more years, remaining as it deserves: A CULT CLASSIC.",The Crow
268,de_cafe6914,A Gothic Love Story,10,17 August 2006,"The Crow is a Gothic masterpiece. It is perhaps one of the only action movies to have a lot of heart, and a very uplifting love story and message. There are no other words to describe it other than amazing. It is one of my personal favorites, and I loved every minute of it.Story: The movie is about rock guitarist Eric Draven and his girlfriend Shelly that get murdered the day before their wedding by a group of thugs. One year after his death, Eric is resurrected from the grave, and guided by a mysterious crow. His mission: To avenge the death of himself and his lover. While seeking his vengeance, Eric is plagued by the pain of losing his love, and constantly reminded of what he lost via flashbacks. Sarah, Eric's daughter-like friend, soon learns of Eric's return, and the film deals with her aspect of the situation as well. It sounds like a simple enough mindless action plot, but the movie packs so much emotion and power into it. The movie really exploits the power of love and friendship. Although gritty and violent, it is emotional enough to make even the biggest man teary-eyed.Direction: Alex Proyas(Dark City) filmed a Gothic masterpiece. The directing is very slick and stylish. Proyas was not afraid to make the film have a very dark and bleak look, as to really show how sad Eric is. Rain is a character in this movie, and even the rain is filmed beautifully. Proyas got everything right: Pacing, Color, Mood, and Style. Excellent stuff! Acting: Four actors stood out in my mind in this film. Brandon Lee(Eric Draven) played his part with excellent skill. He knew what he was doing. He nailed every line, and brought a real humanity to the part, which is great. It's important to be able to relate to a character, and care about it. Michael Wincott(Top Dollar) executed the part of the villain with ease. There's a definite evil in the part, as well as humanity, and Wincott knew exactly how to do it. Ernie Hudson(Officer Albrecht) portrayed the city cop quite well. Even though the part was simple enough, Hudson made it very memorable, and brought a lot of meaning to his character. One of the most amazing actors was Rochelle Davis(Sarah) This girl can act! I felt her pain and anger throughout the whole film, and that voice! Man! All the acting in the film was top-notch, but those performances stood out to me.Score: The music was powerful. It draws you in to every scene. Graeme Revell is outstanding as a composer. The music fits the mood for the film.Violence: The film is an action movie, so, there is violence. It is pretty straight forward, and quite gritty. There's plenty of stabbings, brawls, and bloody shootouts.Profanity/Sexual Themes: They are not afraid to drop the f-bomb in the film. Language is throughout, and pretty strong. There is a mild rape scene, as well as some brief female nudity.Substance Abuse: One of the characters is a morphine addict, and some others snort coke. Moderate.Overall: The Crow is an excellent action-thriller that goes into deep and powerful territory. I loved every frame, and every minute of the movie. A must-have. 10/10",The Crow
269,tonyband,The Crow will always understandably be over-shadowed by the tragic death of Brandon Lee,10,1 February 2016,"Brandon plays rock star Eric Draven, who, along with his fiancée is murdered by a gang of thugs who work for the city's evil crime boss (Michael Wincott). One year later, a spiritual crow brings Eric's restless soul back from the dead so he can get revenge on those who killed him and his beloved.A cult classic favorite that from a style point of view that is full of Gothic visuals and brooding melancholy, the bleak gloom is striking, all dark rooms, dirty streets and perpetual rain. The constantly-blaring soundtrack batters you into submission, the rock-Gothic feel is ideal for the underground comic adaptation.The action scenes are well put together and there are good turns from Ernie 'Winston out of Ghostbusters' Hudson as the sympathetic cop and Wincott as the ominous kingpin. As for Lee, while the co-credited choreographer obviously rocks the fight scenes, he brings an appropriately-haunting vibe to every scene he's in, nailing some key lines (like his response to Hudson's ""Don't move...you move, you're dead!"" order: ""I say I'm dead...and I move""). Chilling us further, he eerily mused on mortality in his final interview: ""Because we do not know when we will die we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. It all seems limitless.""

The music, the style, the set design, even the cinematography, are all quintessential 90s. Brandon Lee shows what a star he could have been, crackling with on-screen charisma.

273,Moviefan-Two-Kay-Four,"A Good Film, Born From Great Tragedies...",8,12 March 2018,"The tale of ""The Crow"" begins almost fifty years ago, with the birth of the man who'd later become its creator...self-taught writer and artist James O'Barr.Born in a trailer to an unwed, alcoholic mother, the baby boy wasn't taken to a hospital until almost a week after his birth. James later recalled, ""She was so drunk and out of it, she couldn't remember the exact day I was born."" Told by his mother it was between Christmas and New Year's Day, the local authorities gave him the birthday of January 1st, 1961.Growing up in an orphanage, James wasn't adopted until he was seven years old. He was often ""loaned out"" to various families for the weekend, as was a common practice in those days. Upon his adoption by hard-working blue-collar Southerners, James rapidly became a self-imposed loner, who preferred to spend his free time absorbed in horror films or his burgeoning artwork. But his parents differed, seeing art as the equivalent of playing cards: a hobby, nothing more. James would later say, ""It got so bad that I was forbidden to draw in the house."" Working different jobs at auto-body shops or nursing homes, he stayed within himself, becoming what he would later describe as a ""brooding and sarcastic"" person.However, that began to change when, at age 16, he met a young woman named Bethany. Described by James as a ""bright light"" who ""never said a word against anyone"", their connection was apparently the embodiment of the phrase ""opposites attract"". When James would verbally assault someone, Bethany would point out their good or positive attributes. It was a balanced relationship that James clearly loved and cherished. They were together for three years, and planned to marry after graduation.But then, tragedy struck. While crossing the street one night, Bethany was killed by a drunk driver. James was not present at the time; he was later told by her father. The emotional stability that James had once craved was now gone in his life, and shortly afterward, he enlisted in the Marines, where he hoped the regimented lifestyle overseas would help him vent his anger. Instead, it only made him feel worse. Drawing combat manuals by day, James would immerse himself in nightly barfights, hoping that one of them would end his life as well. Upon his return to the States, James had one intention: to kill the driver who'd taken Bethany from him. But when he discovered the driver had died from natural causes, his anger and rage threatened to destroy him. Desperate for some kind of cathartic release, he channeled his pain and hatred into his artwork as a form of personal therapy. Explaining years later, he said, ""It was a lot cheaper than seeing a therapist or something.""Honing his artistry, James opted against using comic books as his inspiration, citing common illustration methods as ""an exaggeration of an exaggeration...twice removed from life."" Instead, he studied ancient paintings and marble statues of the human form. However, James was uncomfortable sketching scenes of himself, so to better express his inner darkness, he created an avatar named Eric. The role was visually reminiscent of James' enjoyment of hard rock music, with bands like Joy Division, The Cure, and Iggy Pop all serving as cultural models for the character's appearance and mannerisms. In the pages of his ""therapy"", Eric often spoke in lyrical statements and poetic flair. But his temperment was not so subtle: he was a deadly avenger of untold violence, with little compassion to speak of, if any at all.The story which eventually became ""The Crow"" was first put to paper in 1981. However, due to the immense pain and anger James felt, he could only complete so much of it at a time. The book was finally finished in 1989, eight years later. In it, the story is that of Eric and his love, Shelley, who are murdered by ruthless gang members when their car breaks down on a desolate road. Eric is mortally wounded, powerless to intervene as Shelley is raped and killed by the sadistic criminals. But Eric's soul does not rest, and one year later he is resurrected as an immortal being with one agenda: those who destroyed he and Shelley's lives will die. No trials, no appeals, none of what mass society would consider proper justice...only death. James would later intone, ""There is pure anger on each page.""Sadly, the completion of ""The Crow"" didn't really grant James the peace he had hoped for; instead, it made him more angry and depressed, in various ways. But another shift took place when he was working as a T-shirt artist in a comic shop. The owner liked his work very much, and aksed if he had any comics at home. On a whim, James presented ""The Crow"", and the owner asked for permission to publish it under his emerging company, Caliber Comics; James agreed. Within two years, offers were being made from various studios, who were interested in filming the project. But things got progressively worse as the higher-ups of American cinema desperately sought to rework the concept. Having sold the film rights, James had very little say in the matter; at one point, producers even suggested the film as a musical, with Michael Jackson as Eric and Julian Temple directing. It looked as if the film would bear little resemblance (if any) to O'Barr's work...until director Alex Proyas stepped in. Soon, another talent was brought into the mix, who was a self-described fan of the book, and wanted to preserve it as closely as possible. This was actor Brandon Lee, son of famed martial artist Bruce. At Lee's and Proyas' insistence, the film was reined in, and returned to an approach more in line with James' original story. James and Brandon would foster a close friendship over the course of the production...but tragedy would soon strike again.As Proyas' film of ""The Crow"" neared its final days of principal photography, a terrible disaster shook everyone involved. During the filming of a flashback scene to Eric and Shelley's murders, Brandon Lee was to enter the apartment with a bag of groceries. Conatined in the bag was a ""squib"", or a small bag of fake blood rigged with a tiny, remote-controlled explosive. Actor Michael Massee (who played the villain ""Funboy"") was to fire in Brandon's general direction, and the squib would be detonated to simulate Eric being shot. But instead, Lee crumpled to the floor, and when he didn't get up, the crew realized the unthinkable had happened: Brandon had been shot for real. Twelve hours later, he died in the hospital from internal bleeding. Even more painful was the timing of his death: he was set to wed his long-time girlfriend, Eliza Hutton, just two weeks after filming wrapped.Police officials later ruled Brandon's death an accident, explaining that a ""dummy bullet"" (powderless shell casing) had become lodged in the barrel of the gun which Massee had held. When powder was inserted for a close-up scene so the weapon would flash, both ingredients combined in a deadly manner. For everyone involved, Lee's death was heartbreaking beyond words...and of them all, the four who likely took it the hardest were Lee's mother Linda, his sister Shannon, fiancee Eliza Hutton, and James O'Barr. To James, it was like Bethany being killed all over again, and infinitely worse. To add further insult, Miramax Films failed to pay full royalties to O'Barr; what little cash he made from the project, he donated to charity, considering it ""blood money"". Offered the chance to scrap the film if he so chose, director Alex Proyas consulted Linda Lee, who asked it be finished in Brandon's memory. Released in 1994, the movie became a box-office smash, due to both the visceral, emotional story, and the media-fueled notoriety brought about by the death of its star.But for James, he felt worse than ever. After fighting Miramax for the money he was rightfully owed (which still has not been delivered in full), James began making his living as a ""starving artist"", touring the convention circuit, selling custom sketches and small memorabilia based on the book. He later married, and now has two young children. While his character has been reinvented multiple times in sequels and spinoffs, O'Barr has seen none of the rewards (save for a small amount from Miramax, and a minor contract job for the third film's soundtrack). Today, he says, ""I'm actually happier than I've been since I was 16 years old"", in reference to his wife and family. At nearly 50 years of age, he continues to make the rounds at conventions, now residing near Granbury, Texas.",The Crow
274,terminator690,Awesome!!!!! Watch this Movie!,10,28 December 2004,"This movie is mega sweet. It is excellent. And, in some ways, legendary. This movie had a perfect story, perfect cast, perfect script and a great twist.Brandon Lee (1965- 1993) was perfect for this role and played the part sweetly. This review may be short, for it is hard to describe in words just how good this movie is, also, this is my first review for IMDb.com and I am a little nervous.Anyways, I just wanted to tell anyone who gets a chance at reading this review: THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!I would also just like to say that I am deeply sad for what happened to Brandon Lee on the set, for who knows, if he had lived he might have become a movie superstar, so I am going to close my first review by saying that Brandon Lee will always be remembered.",The Crow
275,Sean68,the best Gothic comic book movie ever made,10,4 February 2005,"This movie is fantastic. plain and simple. Brandon Lee delivers his lines to the point they were instantly memorable after seeing the film only once. The casting of both Michael Wincott and Tony Todd was inspired as these two guys have two of the most instantly recognisable voices in the movie industry. If i could ever be a movie or a lead in a film this would be it. I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief, capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.",The Crow

277,yeaimdaman73,A True Classic,10,5 February 2011,"Usually, a film gets a lot of appraisal if one of the main actors dies. I.E. Dark Knight. I love Dark Knight as well as Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker - But it certainly wouldn't have gotten that much publicity had it not been for his unfortunate early demise.I can almost guarantee - Even though I was too young at the time - When Brandon Lee died for this film, this film had the same deal. Well, if it did, I agree with them. This film is IMO one of the greatest I have ever seen. It truly shows that had Brandon Lee lived, he would've been an all time action star.The story is surrounding Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) along with his fiancé Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) being murdered by a gang of thugs. One year later, Eric is brought back to life by the mystic power of The Crow to avenge the lost of his love and to set things right.In my view, acting is superb on everyone's part. The scenery of a dark corrupted city is fantastic. Action is very bad ass. Progression is great as well. It's not a film that feels like it's going too long, or feels boring at all. It has a nice flow and pace to make everything about it interesting. The story is intriguing from beginning to end, and has very minimal loopholes.Again with acting, it proves that Brandon Lee wasn't just an action star, he was an ACTion star. Meaning he could pull off the character he is suppose to portray very well.If you want a film to enjoy, I definitely recommend it. Great action, directing, acting, story, pace and flow. A true classic in my books.",The Crow

279,solidsnake8706,"simply put, this is amazing",8,14 July 2005,"I haven't commented on IMDb in a long time, but I just saw this and decided I had to. This is really a very impressive film, full of amazing Gothic set pieces and a simple but extremely well told story, full of style and heart, although it also has corny dialog and the simplicity can be troublesome to some people. The story is about a rock guitarist who is murdered along with his fiancé, but who then gets the opportunity to come back to life with the help of a mystical crow to exact revenge on his and his fiancé's killers. The true stand-out of the film is in fact not the storytelling style or even the over the top action sequences, but instead the acting of Brandon Lee in the title role, who as many know tragically died during shooting of the film and was digitally added or had a double for the remainder of his scenes. Knowing that Lee had passed on gave watching this movie a unique experience, as you really started to blend Lee the actor and his character into one person. I don't like that many action movies and I don't like movies with simple plots but this one is an exception. I urge everyone to see this movie and experience both the fun Gothic storyline as well as Brandon Lee's truly spectacular performance. This is a must-see.",The Crow
280,donot_forget-remember_me,Never should have come to big screen. It was better in comics..!!,3,1 April 2009,This is the movie which should have never made. So predictable..! I knew what was going to happen before every other scene. Few times I wished while watching the movie that the killers should have been 1 or 2... Because in that case the movie would be much smaller. It was not at all scary. I don't know who ever said this is the character which gave competition to Batman. I said give me a break..!! Batman revenge was serious enough besides this Crowman guy isn't taking his seriously. Why does he have to laugh and make jokes while killing every murderer? And on top of that I didn't like the acting of lead character as well. Okay finally one of the reason I gave this movie 3 stars because Firstly IMDb doesn't accept less than zero rating. Secondly it has a message which is Don't smoke it will kill you. Or don't watch me it can kill you (whichever you want to take) . Thirdly Rock song in the movie..which made it a little bit bearable. I think it's a silly movie with a simple and predictable storyline,The Crow
281,docchainsaw2000,"""It can't rain all the time.""",10,28 September 2003,"The 1994 film adaption of the popular comic book ""The Crow"" has got to be one of the best comic book adaptions around. And I don't just like it out of sympathy for Brandon Lee, when I first saw this film I did not know that he died on sight, I didn't even really know who he was, I was to young to really know any actor. Mr. Lee will be missed by many, but he left his mark in this film, and all you really need is just one thing for people to remember you by, and this is his. Well, I suppose I should get around to the standard plot synopsis.Eric Draven (Brandon Lee)comes back from the grave to avenge his death, but more importantly the death of his girlfriend. Not your standard 'Mr. nice Guy' kind of heroes, Draven sets out on his quest to avenge his fallen lover, with the help of a young girl, a beat cop, and his fine feathered friend. He shows the mercy that they showed him and his girl: None. Eric Draven has got to be one of the coolest good guys, and Top Dollar has got to be one of the coolest bad guys. And what movie wouldn't be complete without the great ending fight (of course there's a fight, what fun would it be if Top Dollar was an easy-to-defeat type bad guy). Anyhow, I really like this movie a lot, and of course, you don't have to listen to me, but I suggest that you go out and rent it, even if you have already seen it. One of the best.",The Crow
282,81Scorp,Better than what it could have been,8,19 January 2014,"The nineties. Not the best decade for comic book adaptations. Richard Donners Superman did well in the seventies and Tim Burtons Batman got the tone for the Dark Knight right near the end of the eighties. This could have been what made the studios see the potential for big bucks in turning stories of the sequential art into something a little bit more cinematic back then. Not many comic book movies made this era turned out well though. This movie however was an exception. While many other movies made this era only (or mostly) survived by being so bad that they were good, this one respected the story and tone of the work it was based on and met success. Though possibly not only for its quality, something I'll get to later.The story: Rock musician Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancée Shelly Webster (Sofia Shinas) gets attacked and killed by a gang on a dark October night. One year later Eric rises from his grave, now undead and guided by a mysterious crow. He remembers what happened one year ago, on that fateful night, and the faces of his murderers and starts to take his revenge on them one by one until he reaches the top of the lowlifes, their boss, Top Dollar (brilliantly played by Michael Wincott).This was Brandon Lee's last movie. During filming a gun that had not been properly prepared was fired at him and what was intended to be an ordinary, fictional death scene turned out be a quite real one. Still, after a while, the movie was finished with a few rewrites and a few scenes recorded with Brandons face digitally placed on a body double. There has been some changes to the original story from the comic book, but they are small (and in some cases an improvement).The overall tone is kept and the movie respects the material on which it is based. It dares to be dark in a decade where most comic book movies at their darkest were like Batman Forever. It's not just dark ""because it's cool"", but because it fits the story and theme. A darkness that knows the right time to step aside and let some humanity seep in. In retrospect the story is very simple, the bad guys does not seem like more than a bunch of two-dimensional troublemakers who likes to cause mayhem for the sake of mayhem and at it's core it's an ordinary revenge story (with a bit of supernatural thrown in). But it's a little bit more than that. In the hands of someone else it could have been just another revenge-movie and nothing (or not much) more. But thankfully the writers David J Schow and John Shirley, the director Alex Proyas and Brandon Lee gave it that little extra. It's not just about revenge but also about losing and finding one's way and finding glimmers of light in the darkness. Michael Wincott's performance as Top Dollar should not go unmentioned either as it is very memorable. There is a little extra depth to his character with his doubts, thoughts about death and a scene where he monologues about how he, over the years, has lost a little bit of passion for his work. Brandon Lee does a good job at balancing between being consumed by revenge but at the same time trying to hold on to his humanity. A minor complaint about the movie would be that one of the characters at one point becomes a damsel in distress. something typical that we've seen before and something the movie, up to that point, managed to avoid. But like I said, it's a minor complaint and the actress playing her is good.One can not help to wonder if this movie could have been just as successful (or at least have a similar success) without the death of the main star. I like to think that it could. Because there's more to it than what it could have been, had it not been made by someone who knew how to give it that little extra.",The Crow

Even if you see the edited version, it has a darker character.First of all, the main character Eric Draven is much more of the classic knight in shining armor. All that he does, he's doing strictly for his princess. That being said, he couldn't care any less about the city he lived in.And another thing; Bruce's parents died due to desperation., not some sick maniacs who ended up raping the mother. Well, they raped Eric's fiancée Shelley then killed both of them. Now he's back from the grave and he's out for revenge.Not only is the hero darker, but the villains are as well. Out only to benefit themselves, they couldn't care less what carnage they had to do. Hell, they thought that was the fun part.The acting was superb especially for an independent film, and the cinematography done by Dariusz Wolski is on par with A list films.There's not a lot of plot.

287,Daniel Johnson,Hauntingly good.,7,28 November 1999,"Perhaps its just me but The Crow has a real feeling of sentimentality running throughout the film. Maybe its because the subject of the film coupled with the tragic death of Brandon Lee make it feel almost spiritual. This could so easily have degenerated into a by the book revenge thriller, and I suppose in some aspects it is. But the dark imagery and the feeling of loss portrayed by Eric Draven in being separated from his one true love is tragic. The flash back scenes of Eric and his girlfriend instead of being corny, portray his anger and sense of loss very well.The always excellent Michael Wincott makes a great gothic bad guy, and the action scenes although simple do pack a punch. Proyas shows a real visual flair in his direction and the music score by Graeme Revell gives the film a sombre atmosphere. The final scene with Eric and Shelly never fails to pull on the heart strings. Hauntingly good.  7.5/10",The Crow
288,QBlank27,Unique,9,29 October 2003,"Saw this recently, bought the excellent 2 disc special edition dvd. Its a film i remember watching mainly because of a few action set pieces, i flicked through after they finished the first time round...im ashamed of what i did and what ive missed for so long. Its not fantastically made, in terms of script or screenplay ie its no damn Shakespeare (or is it...?) . What it mulls down to is love, Eric Dravens love is so strong he has to come back and avenge the death of his wife to be, his soul simply cant rest. The violence is simply eye candy, the city is absolutely incredible, stylistic yet straight forward, dark yet believable and wonderfully lit on the 2 'devils nights'.Overall a great film from the 90's that truly is a modern day love story, it saddens me that Brandon Lee died making this...but it makes me happy they finished it and that his legacy lives on through it.See this now! 8.5/10!",The Crow

I guess you could call it my favorite movie.The story focuses around Eric Draven, a rock star who was murdered along with his wife-to-be, Shelly, the day before his Halloween wedding. He comes back a year later to seek vengeance on those who put him and his wife through the pain they had to endure. Each of the men who murdered him are slowly stalked by Draven and The Crow that brought him back to life, who is his only link to the realm of the living.Brandon Lee gives an unforgettable performance as Eric Draven. He is convincing in his role, and you really forget that he is just an actor pretending to be this character. It really feels as if Eric Draven is a real person seeking vengeance. Rochelle Davis is another example of bringing a character to life. Her portrayal of Sarah is amazing. She really shows how to make a character come to life. You really can connect with Sarah as she feels alone in the world without Eric and Shelly. This is easily one of my favorite, if not number one on my list of favorite movies. I can recommend this movie to any movie lover without hesitation.",The Crow
290,kerottes,Amazing....,10,16 April 2002,"This movie is one classic that every person in the world should see. Until you've seen this movie you don't know what mood is. The dark and depressing mood of this flick, combined with the cinematography is classical.
Brandon Lee's last performance was better than in say, Rapid Fire, and we remember him now as the man who portrayed Eric Draven the only way he could have been. The crow has yet to bring back an undead such as Brandon Lee's Eric Draven.One of the great things about this movie is that Draven has absolutely NO sympathy for those that killed him and his bride to be. In many movies the hero gets soft at the last minute and hands the villain over to the cops. The Crow shows no sign of weakness instead he systematically erases those who have done him wrong!A big roud of applause for Alex Proyas The Crow and Brandon Lee may he rest in peace...",The Crow
291,tommi462,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,24 April 2002,"I have no words to describe this piece of art. OK I just loved Brandon Lee, and the dark atmosphere. The plot was pretty korny, but still kinda good. Great Movie.I also loved the fighting scenes, although I'm usually not that much into those fighting movies etc.",The Crow
292,Tomici,My all time favorite movie,10,25 December 2008,"I think I watched ""The Crow"" at least 30 times during the last 5 or 6 years. And it's not because I didn't had any other great movies to watch. It's because I never seen movie that has so much emotions,great acting,soundtracks, dialogs's and everything else that is needful to make, I'll dare to say it, a perfect movie. This is not just some usual ""vendetta"" action movie we get a chance to see very often these days. Above all, it's a great love story. And it all began with James O' Barr.I remember when I read James O'Barr's masterpiece ""The Crow"". From the moment I read the first page, the introduction page, I knew I have in my hands something extraordinary. The best way to express my impressions is to use John Bergins words and say that James didn't wrote just another comic book. He wrote a love letter,the most beautiful love letter I have ever read. Alex Proyas and Brandon Lee where the one's who showed their talent and managed to put this story on screen in the best possible way.I've seen a lots of different comic adaptations, but in the most of occasions movies couldn't live up to my expectations. The Crow is definitely not one of them. This is one of those movies that can be made only once (the best proof are other pretty bad sequels), but can be watched over and over again. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.Like the book,the movie shows us what it means to lose someone close to us. Just then we'll know emptiness and what it means to be completely and utterly alone. And nothing can prepare us for that day. Nothing. Brandon Lee gave us an Oscar worthy performance of Eric Draven, a man whom exactly that happened. I read that he did everything he could to make his character look realistic as much possible. And after that terrible shooting accident, it was (at least I think so) impossible to find someone who would be good enough to replace Brandon. But then Proyas and his team showed us how capable they really are and managed to film this movie to the end without making any mistake.So, I don't know how helpful my babbling was to you, but I hope I managed to convince you to watch this movie. The same goes for reading O'Barr's comic book.",The Crow
293,Virginstateofmind,556,10,17 September 2004,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it over 556 times. I own it on VHS, BETA, Laser Disc and DVD. I also have the comics, action figures, the soundtrack and the soundtrack to the Crow Comic book. I have had to buy multiple copies of the VHS and DVD because I used them so much that they stopped working. I have never been able to tell anyone why this is my favorite movie and why I have seen it so many times, except that it strongly appeals to me. The scene in which Eric walks into the church and you can see the rain outside, it just moves me. The face paint, the coat, the overall sense of revenge, but how it is done. I just can't explain it.",The Crow
294,UKBio,A touching elegy for a life cut short,9,6 May 2003,"I was unprepared for this movie when I first saw it in 1994. The film had become more than just a film, but a touching elegy for the gifted Brandon Lee.The producers were put into a bind when during filming, Lee was accidentally killed when a cast member shot at him and the gun malfunctioned sending debris into a major artery of his body. The producers had to quickly decide if the film would be finished at all.I'm glad they finished it because it is a moving piece of work. You can hardly see the seams where body doubles and early versions of CGI were used to fill in the blanks.It is the story of Eric Draven, the rock musician who returns from the grave to avenge the brutal murder of his fiancee, Shelly. It is a stylistic wonder. And Lee shows so much promise in his line delivery and balletic grace. It is dark, and given Lee's demise, it is chilling and ironic.",The Crow
295,eMpTy84,A Spectre on Film,8,8 March 2017,"Eric Draven and his newlywed wife Shelly are brutally murdered in their apartment. Eric was the first to die, being stabbed, shot and thrown out the window. Shelly was repeatedly raped and beaten by the four culprits, later dying in excruciating pain in the hospital. This is not the end of a story, but the beginning. The Crow is one of the rare comic book films made in the early 90s that holds true to the essence of its source material.Based off of the popular comic book series by James O'Barr and directed by Alex Proyas, The Crow merges the Gothic with the mythical in a modern backdrop. Even though the movie is set in Detroit, it is extremely stylized with black stone architecture under never ending rainfall. The city seems like it is warped back to the middle ages, where crime has become the institution, and evil is commonplace. Eric Draven comes back not only as a grim reaper, but to give some small measure of hope to the few good people left. There is a haunting pull of real darkness in this film. This heavy feeling looms because of Brandon Lee's accidental death during filming. There are scenes where body doubles were used to finish shooting, and as the plot progresses to the middle of the film, Draven's face is seen less and less, as if he is more of an apparition than flesh and blood. There is something ominous about seeing shadows and silhouettes in place of a man that already ceased to exist. The Crow is not a horror film, but the menacing acts and the tragic story behind the camera create the atmosphere of one.",The Crow

297,ashleynkateri,"A Haunting, Iconic Movie",8,16 February 2019,"This movie is visually stunning, almost like something out of a dream. Brandon Lee's performance was incredible, I thought he did a fantastic job of bringing Eric Draven to life. Sarah and Albrecht's performances were also really well done and added to how beautifully emotional the story is.
The only place this movie kind of falls down for me is all the villians' performances. They're campy and outrageous, especially Top Dollar who reminded me of the stereotypical villain from old movies who would twirl their mustache and always had a cat in their lap for some reason. It feels hard to believe that people who are that ridiculous can actually manage to run a criminal enterprise.
Overall though, this is beautiful movie and the score perfectly sets the scenes. Brandon Lee's performance was particularly beautiful and I think if he were still alive he would be one of the best actors of his generation.",The Crow
298,Jc-101,Fantastic but cut short,10,10 August 1999,"This is in my top favorite movies for many reasons. It's amazing to see such a great movie in which the violence is so justified. Which is of course what made Brandon Lee take this character. The movie was great but could have been better because a lot of important scenes had to be cut because of the untimely death of Brandon. Still overall the editing was very well done considering the circumstances. I think his death did have a huge effect on this movie and the way you watch it but anyone with a sense if whats important in ANY movie will enjoy this film. Yes there is the action but more than that, there is this feeling that you get when you watch this movie that can't be explained. In other words....I strongly recommend this movie!",The Crow
299,eric-225,Excellent adaptation of the graphic novel,10,4 November 2000,"This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.The way it is adapted from ""comic book"" form is amazing.  The sets, the characters and the story all retain a very graphic feel.  It follows the story fairly closely - at least as closely as most movie adaptation of books - but viewed independently of the ""comic book"" is simply amazing.  The acting is all around perfect for the story and roles, the locations and sets are everything one could hope for, and the story is entertaining and perhaps surprisingly hopeful.",The Crow

Sure people may dig this movie because of its rockin soundtrack.  But truth be told, it would still be a great movie even with out the above listed components.

303,pmcdeee,The best romantic revenge movie ever,9,10 December 2009,"When this movie originally came out, I went to see it because I was a huge Bruce Lee fan and naturally interested in Brandon Lee. I never knew this would be one of my all time favourite movies.This is a dark movie, in fact, until the very end of the movie there is not one scene in daylight. The fact that the full movie is set at night heightens the whole experience greatly. Throughout the movie it never stops raining, which is noted in the dialogue, this only serves to increase the moody atmosphere throughout. The cinematic scenes are amazing, utilising the conditions, surroundings and music to dramatic effect. Some of the scenes are pure visual genius i.e. the battle scene in the gangsters lair with the strobes, guns, combat. The chase scene across the rooftops is great also.The cast couldn't have been more suited, Brandon is believable an obviously delivers on his action scenes. The main villain Michael Wincott's plays a perfect part also, he is rightly typecast in his other films due to his voice and appearance. The gang are great, they are believable scum, this only serves to fuel your thirst for revenge. The Cop and Sarah who are his living link to his past offer a little bit of respite from the revenge rampage. Its a shame that the young actresses who played Sarah appeared to be affected by the death of Brandon and never acted again.The soundtrack and musical score are outstanding. I was in no way into the type of music in the soundtrack before I watched the crow. I was converted through this movie. Burn by the Cure is my personal favourite, I was also introduced me to Nine Inch nails, Stone Temple Pilots, Pantera and more. Again, this soundtrack combined with the dark, violent scenes are perfectly matched at every scene.The whole of the above results in an awesome action, sentimental, dark revenge cult movie. The concept of the movie is great, the unfortunate death of Brandon is this movie morbidly contributes to the overall mystique and attraction to the film. I was genuinely that another talented Lee passed away before their prime.Turn the lights out, sound up and watch this film now.",The Crow
304,isaacj-oconnor,Should've been a trilogy,7,13 March 2015,"I know Brandon Lee died during filming but still it feels like they closed a door.This is a very interesting movie that has really gotten me thinking for the past 12 hours. What would I do if I were Eric and had a short time to come back? Who would I go to? Who would I talk to? Especially with the way that Brandon Lee plays the character, its just as if I have so many new ideas that have come to life. Thats a bad thing at the same time. They opened a door to new ideas, then just stood there and didn't make anything come to life.I really like the plot and the main idea of the movie. All actors played their roles very well and especially Brandon Lee and the young girl. I mean you don't see many pre-teens that know how to act but she did an incredible job; especially considering the rarity of kid actors being of any quality above cheesy. But, like I state in my review title, it feels like this idea can be opened up to so much more and has been cut short. Yes, i know the protagonist passed away during filming and they didn't want to shove another guy in his position, but it feels like there is so much more that not only the film but the main idea. It seems as though they had cut it short.",The Crow
305,suburbanpineapple,A bargain bin popcorn film that your troubled teenage son/daughter will love,1,26 March 2006,"Like Donnie Darko, Johnny Depp and The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Crow has now achieved cult status through its legions of depressed teenager fans. Despite the film's iconic lead Eric Draven now being the patron saint of Goths everywhere, The Crow delivers an adequate slice of revenge action that is brought down just below the bar because of its hideously clichéd principal character. Sporting a skin type black ninja outfit, make up only Kiss would be proud of and Edgar Allen Poe's Raven's wimpier cousin 'The Crow', Draven (Brandon Lee's final performance) deals out painful revenge upon those that murdered him and his girlfriend one year ago. The plot plays out exactly as you would expect for a nineties revenge flik except rather than Harry Tasker kicking ass and taking names we observe Edward Scissorhands on drugs slaughtering all opposition. Its a good laugh if you want a harmless revenge film with little more than the necessary amount of substance than the dry script requires, or you may enjoy it if you are aged between 12-17 and haven't found your niche in life yet. Rest assured teens, The Crow will answer none of your questions but will only fill you with new ones such as: Wouldn't it have been nice if poor Eric Draven had only stayed dead?",The Crow
306,Uther1,"Decent action film, but not much more",7,9 January 2010,"The Crow had been recommended to me by a few friends of mine, so I figured I'd give it a try. I read a few reviews online before watching it and was pretty excited. They said it was a deep movie with a lot to say. After watching it, I have no idea what the hell they were talking about. It was a pretty decent action movie, but the only depth was that revenge is good. In fact, it's so important that you might come back from the dead for revenge. That's not very deep to me. The fact that he was so mad because the love of his life was killed as well doesn't really add depth.But the real problem with this movie is a lack of tension. For the entire time he's eking out his revenge one death at a time, he's invincible. The main character who we're supposed to be worried about can't be hurt. Every fight he gets into is a foregone conclusion. It's a bit satisfying to see him get his revenge, but really, it's not very exciting, even with gratuitously large explosions. They find an excuse for him to become vulnerable at the end, but the final show down with the head bad guy doesn't make any sense plot wise. It seemed very unnecessary, I even found myself asking aloud ""Why is this movie still going?""There isn't much else to say. The atmosphere the movie created was great, but it was just the same way movies have created atmosphere for decades, it was raining all the time. Blade Runner did it and did it better. The city felt despondent, but it didn't feel like that was necessary. The action was fun, but the lack of tension stopped this movie from being great. As it is, it's a decent action flick with an odd sort of ambiance and characters from a subculture. 6/10, watch if it's on TV, but I wouldn't bother searching it out.This was a snippet of my full review, read the full article at docamos.blogspot.com",The Crow
307,gilbertcarlton7,My 2nd favorite movie of all time.,10,23 December 2015,"I watched this movie last night and i can now call it my second favorite movie of all time. It is incredibly good for a multitude of reasons. Brandon Lee is the one and only Crow and was a real life superhero, just like his dad. I will admit i cried during this movie just because of how good it is and especially because of the incredible poetic quotes it contains. Especially the one at the end of the movie, that is connected to the movie and real life. What is incredibly sad about this movie is that during one of the last days of filming Brandon Lee was accidentally shot and killed because of a firearms accident on the set of filming ""The Crow."" This should have never happened and it bothers me that it did. Brandon Lee could have been in all the other movies in the series and he could have been just as popular as Spider Man or Batman. He had a great acting career ahead of him and had just started acting, he died at the age of 28, on March 31st,1993. This movie is action packed and filled with drama, horror, love and poetry. It effected me even more because of the death of amazing actor Brandon Lee on the set of the movie. After his death his fiancée and others decided to finish the movie, and dedicate it to Brandon and his Fiancée, Eliza Hutton. The movie was finished with a stunt double (a friend of Brandon's) and special effects.",The Crow

309,CinemaOddity,A Haunting Final Performance,9,13 April 2017,"Spoiler-free The word ""marvelous"" is best used for a movie like this.The reason this movie is so notorious for it's themes will be addressed last. One of the most striking visual styles is in this movie. It was originally supposed to be black and white. While the idea was scrapped, the movie gives off a monotone feeling of sleep and solitary, the movie is possessed by a look of darkness and gloom.The writing is sharp, funny, yet it makes you think. The violence in the script is handled maturely and with a rock n' roll style. The CGI isn't perfect but it holds up for a movie like this. The one flaw is certain dialogue can be stale, but it doesn't really affect the whole story. Side note: Listen to the Cure's ""Burn"", it is equally haunting and is the official song for the movie And then there is Brandon Lee. His acting makes me feel like he really is dealing with a tortured soul. This movie became infamous following his accidental on-set shooting. The death gave the scenes a melancholy feeling and as if this were made to capture his real life. This film is a tribute and memory of a haunting performance from a genuinely great film 1994 gave us Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, and Leon: The Professional, yet the most overlooked is this Gothic masterpiece",The Crow

311,Bob-406,Over rated American trash,5,2 September 1999,"Parts of this film are visually stunning but it is again an American film that glorifies the use of violence. The theory is simple, if the bad guy has a big gun then the hero gets a bigger one or a super power. The film seems to reflect that dark side of the US psyche that believes that it is descending into a final fight against evil and you should fight with every weapon at your disposal.The violence that is relatively sterile on the comic page, explodes into a completely unacceptable level without any of the humour or irony of so many other violent films. And that is the films downfall.Devoid of any humour or meaning it becomes instantly forgettable other than the fact that the star is Bruce Lee's son, and he died during the filming.",The Crow

I found it sad that Lee died during this film because in my book he was going to be the best action star of the decade.

Brandon Lee was excellent, hearing about his death was one of the worst things I have ever heard (in the movie biz). There are a lot of great things about this movie and for those of you that have seen this I am sure you know. Great story, acting, the dark/ rainy scenery was great, etc... There are so many ""I'll get my revenge"" movies but the way this movie portrayed it was totally original. This movie has good replay value also, I saw it 5 times in the theater when it came out and numerous times since I have had it on DVD. Michael Wincott also did a great job as well as Ernie Hudson. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommended that you do. I'm not going to go all about telling you about it, that is what all the other comments are for.

Simple story spiced up with vivid characters, scenes and retorts, no extra pieces, no stereotypes which look stupid. Everything is just like a perfect melody. There is one way to make a good man be a bad man. There is one wound that hurts the most. There is one law that works in any religion and any universe: everything pays off.

While every sequel and Crow movie since this has destroyed the credibility of this film, it truly is possibly the greatest Gothic superhero movie of all time (with exception to Batman). Some of the scenes in this film are just so well done I still feel shivers when I watch them. For example The scene when Brandon Lee finally comes back to his now abandon apartment and relives his death is one of the most powerful and well edited scenes from 90's films.

One of my favorite films ever. Another one ""the dark knight"" I always say set the gold standard for a comic book movie but in reality this film paved the way for burtons Batman style along with the dark knight trilogy. Watching Brandon Lee (RIP) is almost haunting in some of the scenes. The emotions he portrays just through his voice and expressions makes you feel like he is really Eric draven and these awful things happened to him in reality. I'm open to another crow BUT it can not be the Eric draven story it needs to be something seperate because he will always be the only one. If I have to give a ""negative"" of the film it would be the low budget which does stick out in some areas. This is the reason Brandon lost his life on the set as well the safety oversight and props handling of the weapons were a joke. There are a few scenes that stick out to me that you are able to tell were filmed after his passing (T-birds death as there was no dialogue from Eric) I applaud them for being able to come back to the set, and honor him to finish a film loved by so many",The Crow

Shelly's presumed dead boyfriend, Eric Draven comes back to life as a revenant to take revenge on the four criminal dirtbags who raped and murdered Shelly. Eric Draven rises from the grave to find he is virtually indestructible and deathless and applies harlequin face makeup. A crow-which is also his Achilles-heel accompanies him on his vengeful mission. Sarah, dear friend of both Eric and Shelly, is at once a liability and a weakness for Eric and his agendum. The over-boss Top Dog, in charge of the four rapist-murderers ultimately stands off against Eric Draven.I'd say The Crow might be a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies. The film is predominantly dark, mostly taking place during the night and utilizing light and shadow. So it has a nocturnal ambiance coupled with it's deteriorating urban backdrop.

Each justification is done stylishly and yet so violent that you don't forget them, making a crow sigyl out of their blood as a marking.The script and directing are excellent, making the bad guys so evil and cruel, your glad when they die.  There are action sequences that are spectacular and sly, done in strobelights and heavy metal music.For an extremely well done superhero movie forget Batman, check out The Crow",The Crow
325,multiverse,The best adaptation of a comic to film!,10,27 August 2001,"The only bad thing about this film was the tragic death of Brandon Lee during it's filming.This film stands alone not only for the comic book movie genre but for all movies.The story flows from beginning to end,the acting is flawless from Brandon's portrayal of Eric Draven to Ernie Hudson's portrayal of a semi-lost cop.The supporting cast was outstanding,the consumate bad-guy David Patrick Kelly, who hasn't played that intense a character since The Warriors and the rest of his gang added a believable nastiness to their roles and the movie.This film is not only a must see it is a must own!!!",The Crow
326,artfuldodger9,"Timeless cult classic with Action, Romance and drama",8,28 October 2002,"1993's ""The Crow"" was a film that I remember seeing commercials to and never being fully in-love with it when it came out.  It was dark and it was jumpy and it didn't fully grasp me as well as ""Die Hard"" or other action movies would.  Yes, Brandon Lee died during the shoot of this film but what was the big deal?The ""big deal"" was when I sat down to watch the film.  The gothic setting of a burnt out city (Detroit - it seems) that was the essence of decay.  And yet within the essence of decay was this bright and shining love that was tragically destroyed all in the name of Anarchy.Alex Proyas, the films director, worked a cast of B-movie stars and several low-quality sets and scenes and knitted a visual masterpiece, completing the film in spite having the lead actor killed and not being able to complete his scenes (which is not new in Hollywood, but still a director challenge). Proyas deserves all the kudos in the world for his work on this film.Brandon Lee makes a memorable last-call to cinema as the shadowy, kindred soul of Eric Draven, on a quest to put right the wrongs of his murder. While watching some of his scenes, one has to wonder just where Brandon's career would have taken him after this movie came into public view?This movie is one of the cult classics that will go on for ages.  Though there have been sequels to this, the original film, there will never be anything that comes close to ""The Crow"".",The Crow
327,Matt_Corkhill,FInally watched it,8,5 June 2020,"As a child of the 90s, this movie has always been in my rear view mirror. It was talked about, parodied and the subject of many a Halloween costume - but it always eluded me.Finally, 26 years after it was released, I finally watched it - and I was not disappointed.Based on the comic book series of the same name, the film bursts straight out of the gates and we find main character and rock musician Eric already dead. He has been murdered during a home invasion by sadistic thugs, and his fiancee succumbs to the same fate shortly after.Eric, with the mysterious and spiritual aid of a crow, rises from the dead and methodically goes about exacting revenge on the ones responsible for the cruel slayings.I thought this was a great movie. It was melodramatic, fast-paced and action packed. Not to mention a very punchy dialogue.Every character had its place, and every place had character - a true comic book movie. Of course the film is known for being Brandon Lee's swansong and, although I am no expert on Brandon, what a marvellous performance it was. Not over the top, but perfectly black and white just as the role demanded.The dark and gothic backdrop perfectly sets the scene for the story, and the crow motif gives this revenge movie a marvellously poetic dimension (allusion's are even made Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Raven').Overall - fun, exciting and thoroughly satisfying.",The Crow
328,imdb-513-877358,"Not a brooding, dark Gothic masterpiece. Just bad.",2,11 April 2015,"Yes, I know of its origins in comic book land, but that doesn't mean the characters have to be two-dimensional. Cardboard villains and heroes. Idiotically simple-minded revenge plot. Absolutely no suspense or tension because you know Brandon Lee's character is invincible.The crow-raven conflation is silly (""rapping, rapping at my chamber door"" etc.) Why not make the bird a freaking raven instead of a crow if you want to reference Poe?And the goth-rock setting is equally moronic. (Everyone knows that all Goths are pussies and afraid of any violence other than to themselves.) Brandon Lee putting on his Robert Smith makeup after rising from the dead just made me laugh out loud.I don't understand the reviewers lauding the ""atmospheric"" / ""beautifully shot"" / etc. cinematography. The whole thing looks like a cheesy 90s MTV video.I could go on. This is probably the worst movie I've seen in the last year...or more.",The Crow

330,JLM-7,The Most Romantic Movie Ever!!!,10,16 April 2000,"I know most people watch this movie expecting to see a kick ass action flick....and it doesn't disappoint either, but that's not what makes this movie so great...and it's damn sure not what makes it my all time favorite. First I have to admit a few things...I am a hopeless romantic..and am fascinated with the possibility of life after death...so when the movie came along that tossed those two elements in together and mixed them up I got to say I was completely jazzed to see it. Though I gotta' admit that I was kind of regretting it too because it was a comic book movie. Luckily it wasn't the typical comic book film. This flick is the most romantic movie ever made...it shows us that a love can be so strong and powerful that one will even refuse death to be held in the arms of that loved one again. That someone can be so passionate in their lives that they will forego their eternal peace and face eternal damnation just to get revenge on those that would harm the love of their lives. The Crow could have floundered had it not been for the wonderfully soul-wrenching performance of the late Brandon Lee, he truly makes you feel the passion that his character must have felt. Brandon just seems like someone who would say to hell with death you hurt my fiance.  I really can't seem to heap enough praise on this film so I will quit rambling now and allow you to go see this for yourself and fall in love again.",The Crow

334,frostyde,Classic with stylistic integrity!,7,4 October 2020,"I've always known this is a classic horror movie but I was avoiding watching it because I thought it might be tacky.The crow didn't disappoint. It's stylistic and moral plot is great. The crow becomes a likable and relatable character for every kind honest man who loves a beautiful woman.Although the film is a little cliche at times, this little bit of cliche seems to add to the horror metal kitsch that makes the film a cult classic.This film is a must watch for any cult film or horror film enthusiast! It's good for an easy night in and a good one to watch with your partner. Although spoilers you partner has to have an open mind about what a relationship film can be. Maybe not want to show on the first date.",The Crow

It reminded me of all those mid-eighties comics where suddenly all the superheroes were turning psychotic, like the Punisher or Vigilante or the Dark Knight Returns.  The original Batman tried to be like that, but IMHO failed.  I enjoyed this a lot more, even though it's a smaller movie with a less well-known hero.  Check it out.",The Crow

So I made a point of watching it. Oh dear. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film, I gave it the benefit of the doubt considering it's age and the hype surrounding it but it was dreadful. In my opinion, if Lee hadn't died tragically during the making if this film then it would probably have gone straight to DVD and I wouldn't have just sat through an hour and half of dross.",The Crow

I had to go through quite a few video shops to get my hand on a decent VHS tape but boy oh boy was i blown way with this flick. The dark atmosphere coupled with a banging soundtrack makes it a proper cult classic. Who can forget the scene when Brandon lee is standing at the window looking at the town with The Crow's 'Burn' track in the backdrop. It is one of cinema's most hallucinating scenes yet the movie never got the status it deserved when it got released. With time people will discover this cult classic and rediscover themselves with it. The soundtrack in its own is another classic,filled with big names like The Cure, Nine inch nails,violent femmes, panthera etc, it sure is a soundtrack to blow you away.",The Crow
340,musicasaweapon,The greatest movie of all time.,10,14 August 2004,"This is my absolute, hands-down favorite of all time. Brandon Lee gave a phenomenal performance, portraying the immense pain and anguish of a man who had his true love taken from him and then was murdered.Eric Draven is one of the most emotionally deep characters of all time. He drives through the plot with such power and momentum, never letting the adrenaline slow. If you want to see a true artist performing a true work of art, watch Brandon Lee in The Crow. Any artist can recognize the beauty of Brandon Lee's work here. Just like his father, Brandon Lee has mastered the artless art. It is a tragedy that this was to be his final work.In addition to Brandon Lee's amazing mastery of Eric Draven, Michael Wincott is incredible as Top Dollar, the villainous leader of the gang infamous for beginning the tradition of Devil's Night.The Crow is also full of memorable scenes, and quotes. ""It can't rain all the time."" became a household phrase among my friends and anyone familiar with the scene will know why I adore ""Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children.""",The Crow

Brandon Lee gives the most thrilling final performance of all time before his death on set on March 31, 1993 from a gunshot wound.

343,tjross-1,Sadness is the Main Character,10,14 May 2013,"There is a tacit theme of sadness that is so ubiquitous throughout the entire movie that it should have been billed as the main character. It's raised to the next level when you remember that this was Brandon Lee's breakout movie and he died making it. I never read the comic so I do not know if it was true to it, but I do know that this movie had a tone that I've never felt before. Brandon Lee is simply amazing! The set design, writing, and directing are top notch--they truly transport you to the goth underbelly of a place you don't want to be. It will clearly be too violent and dark for many viewers, but if you can get over it, you will experience a brilliant film. i've seen this movie a few times and it gets better every time I see it.

I can't but just praise every single picture shown and every line spoken in this movie. Maybe the plot is a little stereotype ( a Victim of a brutal murder, returns from the dead to avenge his death an the death of his fiancée), but as a modern fairy tale this movie has an excuse for having a quite well-known story-line.

348,Corven,A real fever dream of a movie,10,8 March 2000,"'The Crow' is neither original nor easy to watch, but persist and you will find it to be one of the best movies around.  Themes of love, death, and revenge feature heavily, and there is a lot of violence, urban decay, and very little sunlight (not good for those of you who find dark movies hard to watch).Every aspect of 'The Crow' oozes quality: Alex Proyas' fantastic directing (a more visually stunning movie you will not find), the stunning performances by the late Brandon Lee and the menacing Michael Wincott, the fabulous sound track, the brilliant scripting ... I could go on forever.The movie does have its faults though.  There are probably not enough flashback scenes of Eric Draven and Shelly Webster in better times, and there are a few inconsistencies in the plot, but these are minor quibbles and do not detract from an otherwise excellent movie.'The Crow' is going to be either one of two things for the first time viewer: an amazing experience, or your worst nightmare.Whether for you it's amazing or a nightmare, 'The Crow' has succeeded in its aim.",The Crow

I sat there, knowing full well that I had school the next morning, and watched the film end to end... To say I was impressed would be an understatement.Since then I have seen the film at least 50 times (i long since stopped counting) and each time I enjoy it.The plot is a basic justice for victims affair based on the graphic novel by James O'barr.I can barely fault this film, the sets, acting (Brandon Lee's finest moment - Rest in Piece Brandon), screen play and directing are virtually flawless.
The soundtrack has some great songs on it and the films score is moving.If you have a couple of hours free watch this film.10 out of 10 for me",The Crow

353,jakobkraft,"Best, Most Resourceful Comic Adaptation",10,10 May 2001,"Of the many reviews here, I found that far too few mention the astounding resourcefulness of director Alex Proyas; yes, Brandon Lee was good (note: Michael Wincott was better), yes there is a gleeful amount of menacing action and, surprisingly, some well-rounded characters and bits of clever dialogue, as opposed to the pun-filled Batman Returns (and should go away again)...but considering the fact that this film cost 6 million dollars to make-the cheapest of the Burton/Schumacher Batman films cost 80 million-and that it maintained a level of frenetic energy to rival, and often succeed, any of the Batman films is a testament to his ability. I agree with most of what was already said here: better than average comic-adaptation with a script that doesn't go out of its way to insult the intelligence of its audience, a tragic, pensive mood prevalent throughout a story that could have easily evolved into a revenge epic ala Chuck Bronson...but the fact it was done for six million dollars is truly staggering-Proyas should have a sizeable bulk of Hollywood eating out of his hand for how well he can stretch a budget. Added note: 'Hannibal' costs 87 million; hopefully this puts Proyas achievement into perspective.",The Crow

One year later, he is ressurected by a crow to seek vengence upon those who caused his death and bring the killers to justice.  The darkness/goth of this film is the key to commiting it to memory.  Who can forget a man strolling the streets of a post-apoclyptic Detroit wearing black and white make-up(NOT FACEPAINT)and a trenchcoat? Not any sane human.  The action in this movie is also fantastic, although scarce, but what this movie lacks in action, it makes up for ten-fold in plot.

Not only Brandon Lee is amazing in what came to be his swan song, but also brings a more than flawless performance that will stay in the minds of cinema-lovers for years to come.I never peeked ""The Crow"" comic book, neither knew who created it. I just saw ""The Crow"" under recommendation of my girlfriend who found it the most beautiful film on earth. The Gothic aesthetics portrayed on screen are extremely accurate and the Montecristo's sense of vengeance make this a ""justified"" Action/Sci-Fi Drama film. Brandon Lee parted ways leaving behind him a movie that has to be claimed whether you're a comic book fan or not, the now remembered phrase: ""Nothing is Trivial"" has almost become a myth. The Visual Effects deployed in it are way too unreal, surreal; to the point of believing yourself in a black, but beautiful, nightmare. The environments, the facial-uplifting, the stunts and explosions seem to come from a 22nd Century motion picture. The Crow has surpassed the many boring blockbusters that have been bombarding us for the past few years.Cerebral, dramatic, fantastic and surreal are the words that can, closely, describe this wonder.

Thanks to that one fantastic--and very underrated--actor, who I still cherish in my personal top ten of screen performers.So, my ten stars are out of sentimental value, but also personal taste--never was a revenge tale so beautifully told, never so uplifting, never... holding so much *hope* in the eventual sunshine--that ""it can't rain all the time.""",The Crow
361,NalleK,What A Masterpiece,10,3 January 2003,"The first time I saw The Crow was around 1996, when I was about 14 years old, had no idea what ""goth"" means and wasn't yet very seriously into metal music. This movie left me trembling, sitting on the couch with my mouth open and tears in my eyes. I couldn't stand up in at least half an hour! It was something totally new for me. No movie had affected me that way before and it took years before anything similar happened.Well, now seven years older and still not into almost anything that can be classified as ""gothic"" (goths do wear some nice clothes though) - and still The Crow has the same effect on me. There are some other movies that affect me very strongly, but The Crow is different - it was the first one. It's no longer the best movie I've seen - the third or fourth best probably - but anyway it was the first, and that's why it may always be 'special' for me. I hope so.The plot of the movie isn't very interesting - actually pretty corny. Apparently it doesn't prevent from making one hell of a movie experience. Alex Proyas did a marvellous job. The movie's got everything. The overall atmosphere of it is just beyond description. The soundtrack is great, too - even though I listen to a bit different kind of music normally.Brandon Lee is superb as Eric Draven, and I love also Rochelle Davis as Sarah. But as usually, Michael Wincott - as Top Dollar - steals the show with one of his best performances ever. For me, Top Dollar is a very significant part of the fascination about this movie. He's not just plain bad - he's got a sense of humour just like mine. Plus there's some kind of deep inexplicable sadness about him, which makes me confused: should I hate him or not? He's the bad guy, so I probably should, but... - And this is just one of the strange feelings this movie awakes in me.What a totally amazing movie.",The Crow

It was well done, except from his father's film Game of Death when the editing to it look like Bruce Lee was still in the film was badly done and shouldn't have went ahead with it's release.

This movie by far is one of the best love stories ever written and it was truly sad to see that Brandon is no longer with us.",The Crow
366,kennythecountrybumpkin,Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.,8,29 December 2005,"Stealing visual style from Blade Runner and The Fugitive, throwing in the then very trendy grunge theme and heaping a (bloody excellent) grunge/goth/industrial soundtrack on top to finish. For my eyes and ears its a very long rock video, with some decent action sequences, and a good indicator of future movies by Proyas. The lad takes a very poor script, makes a marketable object with it, it might be bit light on the intellectual palate,(so what?who says that's automatically a bad thing?). Its still good for my money, certainly worth watching, especially for Michael Wincott's incestuous very very bad guy, he just steals the show for turning up. Damned shame about Brandon Lee, he was starting to move up in the industry and given time, may have eclipsed his old dad.",The Crow

Some people complain that it lacked character development of the part of Eric Draven, the character Brandon Lee portrayed. But in fact if you dive into the movie, you will see that they build his persona well. He has a sort of rage that anybody would if they knew they couldn't be stopped from avenging the death of the most important person in their life. It's a love story in the sickest dimensions, Fantastic. Lee was terrific in his role, as was villain, Michael Wincott as Top Dollar.

Unfortunately, I watched this movie for the first time 10 years after it was released, I can only assume this was a costly mistake, the ruining of a legend for me. By the time it started, I knew I would be disappointed, and I was. To me, this movie was a tragic, god awful mess. Simply too melodramatic, too pseudo-poetic (psuedo as in what they tried to do did not work at all), and much too talky. Too many people explained way too many things that should have been inferred. Too many characters were stereotypes, mainly concepts represented by human bodies, and actors not doing a good job at portraying them. I know this may sound like blasphemy, but Brandon Lee, rest his soul, was not a good actor, at all. Actually quite the opposite. It looked like a terribly written movie with terrible actors, yet a big heart, that's the only good thing I could say about this movie.",The Crow

The effects team did an outstanding job adding the various elements to the film and bring Brandon ""back to life."" When i learned of the tragedy I was devastated. i was even a bit scared that the film would never be released.This film is Brandon Lee's legacy. i am happy to see that it has so many fans and that the film was well received by audiences even after Brandon's shocking death.

370,KarateBoyBiff,Great movie,10,26 January 2005,"In my opinion, The Crow is the greatest movie of all time. Brandon Lee's death had absolutely nothing to do with it, although it was a tragedy. That movie contained everything. Action, suspense, romance, horror, sci fi. It could literally fit into any category (accept for maybe porno). The diverse cast helped a lot showing that any one can be a bad guy. If you look at it, the character of Eric Draven is everybody. He's just your average Joe Shmoe who was scraping to make a living. There wasn't anything special about him until after he died. While Crow movies after this one may have had better special affects, or been less family friendly, there was a magic that these people brought to this movie that will never be recreated. Brandon Lee's death did not sell this movie, a story that everyone could relate to did.",The Crow
371,crow76308,Best movie I've seen in a while.,10,12 May 2007,"You see a crow winging over a scene of urban decay; the majority of the buildings are on fire. A young girl's voice says, ""People once believed that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right."" Welcome to the world of The Crow, one of the most powerful films ever made. The Crow, written by David J. Schow and John Shirley and directed by Alex Proyas. Its story is simple, much like the graphic novel by James O'Barr by the same name: a man and his fiancée are killed, she is raped and tortured, and he comes back as an undead to wreak bloody revenge on the gang that did these horrible things. The execution of the plot sets it apart from similar revenge tales. Everything from the scripting, the casting, the direction, and the acting set this from a simple popcorn movie and into the realm of true art.First, the scripting. There are so many wonderful quotes in this movie that it is impossible to list them all. Each character is given its own unique voice and personality, from the lowly hot-dog vendor to and especially the mysterious and creepy Top Dollar, head of Detroit's underworld of drugs and violence; who has a penchant for saying things like, ""Dad gave me this. Fifth birthday. He said, 'Childhood's over the moment you know you're gonna die,'"" while gazing at a snow-globe containing a miniature cemetery.Of course, brilliant as the script is, none of these characters would have found their unique voice if not for the casting by Billy Hopkins and Susan Smith. Michael Wincott is absolutely the only person to play the Top Dollar envisioned in this film. (In the comics, Top Dollar is just a leader of a small drug ring.) Ernie Hudson was a solid choice for Sgt. Albrecht. Introducing Rochelle Davis as the world weary and cynical at thirteen Sarah was a stroke of genius, and casting Brandon Lee as the title character, Eric Draven, a.k.a. The Crow, was an inspiration.Of course casting is only as good as the actors' performance. In other roles, Lee put in less than stellar performances, but as Draven, Lee created an opus. He takes a role that could easily been played as an emotionless machine and brought depth and humanity to it. In one ad-lib scene between Draven and Albrecht, he speaks lines that sum up the whole movie: ""Little things use to mean so much to Shelley - I thought they were kind of trivial. Believe me, nothing is trivial."" Then, as he starts to leave, Albrecht asks if he is just going to vanish again. Draven replies with a wistful smile, ""I thought I'd just use the front door,"" making people see and feel the aching for normalcy in this character through his inflections and body language. Wincott is at his spooky best, but, surprisingly enough, also brings a dark sensuality to his character. Hudson underplays his role, lending it a certain believable, every-man quality, as him and Sarah are the two most normal and sanest people present in this dystopian view of Detroit. Particularly note worthy is the performance by David Patrick Kelley as T-Bird, the leader of the gang that murdered Eric and his fiancée, Shelly. He became so immersed in his role that he bought a classic first printing of Milton's Paradise Lost, Book IV, costing thousands that he was supposed to read from during the murder scene to use as a prop on the film. Rochelle Davis manages to walk a fine line of fragile, youthful hope, and the expected bitter cynicism that one might find in a thirteen year old whose mother is a drug addled prostitute. She brings pathos to this character without making it syrupy and unpalatable. It is true brilliance when one considers that this is her first role.The director of this film also did a superb job. Proyas brought the best out of his actors, obviously, but special attention should also be given to the rich visual styling of the film. The graphic novel was black and white, an ambiance that Proyas achieves in his film by shooting everything in washed out sepia tones making it feel like a rich and fantastically old picture book, or like the viewer is seeing things under water at dusk. Proyas did the unthinkable in that he worked lovingly on a low-budget action flick and elevated it to art. Of course this film, like any other, has its detractors. Some say that it glorifies violence. Granted. It does glorify violence revenge. That doesn't change the underlying fact that this is a truly beautiful film, and does have another, positive message of not taking one moment for granted with a loved one, since one never knows when that loved one won't be there any more. Some say that it is a simple ""bug-hunt"" film. Once again, this is true. The difference is that most such films are indifferently put together and aimed at the lowest common denominator, while this film strives for and achieves a higher level than that. Finally, some might say that it was ghoulish to release a movie where the star died while filming it. I must say that at first I thought the same thing. I was drug to this movie by a girlfriend, and I entered ready to hate it. Having seen it, and Brandon's other works, I have to say he would have wanted this movie released. It is his masterpiece. I can think of no better swan-song for any actor than the job that Brandon did on this film.",The Crow

The camera shots are beautiful, the scenery dark and Gothic, the dialog unforgettable, the acting phenomenal, great story and imagery. What more could you want?. The best part of it is that you have this indestructible guy that came back from the dead to avenge his death and the death of his fiancé, yet he is still gentle and caring to those that have helped him. I also love the interesting ways he takes out the murderers. Particularly when he killed Tin Tin. There are many great lines from this movie as well, like ""He was already dead.

An A list Soundtrack featuring Stone Temple Pilots, NIN, Pantera (R.I.P. Dimebag), Ministry, and many more. This movie would even be an excellent Broadway play!

From start to end, this film delivers something that you feel deep inside your soul. It's spiritual atmosphere pulls your mind completely into it. The story in itself leaves such an impression on you, you can't recall a better movie seen than this. The music matches the grieving pain and dark nature of this film perfectly. The score is by far the best I've ever heard. Return To The Grave and On Hollowed Ground is what caught my mind more than the others.Alex Proyas really has a view of everything and he deserves an Oscar for his work. Brandon Lee's performance deserves 10 Oscars but sadly he wouldn't be there to receive it. It's his death that may have attracted media attention but it's his performance that brings Eric Draven to life. His legacy lives on in the hearts of Crowfans forever.The supporting cast try their best and really give a great performance.The sets have a dark and goth feel to it, just as the movie is.You can watch it 200 times but still can't get enough of it.

377,telekon-3,The Mother Of All Goth Movies!,8,22 November 2005,"Having read the original comic book series in which this The Crow was based, one can see how a direct film translation would have been difficult to accomplish. Unfortunately several movie clichés have been added: A police man butting heads with his superior, a kidnapped girl, a grand finale on top of a cathedral (ala Batman, Metropolis), a buddy cop to the rescue, a villain that is killed by a hero who throws him off a very high place and onto a large pointy object. What THE CROW lacks in story is made up for with beautiful direction by Alex Proyas, stunning goth-noir cinematography, and a memorable theme by Graham Revell. This is more than your average comic book movie (do not expect a SPIDERMAN, BATMAN, or X-MEN). Here, our ""hero""'s actions come from what he alone feels: pain, loss, anger, isolation, despair. His primary goal is not to bring justice to this world, his main goal is to kill those who have murdered him and his fiancé and to return to the grave where he can be reunited with her. Brandon Lee really is good in the lead roll, his presence can be felt throughout the film, including scenes filmed after his death. Had he lived he would have made an excellent action hero. Perhaps the MATRIX trilogy would have been better starring a real martial artist and a proved dramatic actor such as Brandon Lee.THE CROW has a real soul and inner life that is rare for action movies.",The Crow

I've watched it repeatedly so often that now it is a black and white film with a little red, red! The lines are beautiful, the characters well portrayed...I also like The Crow: City of Angels though the ending was a bit... eccentric, and The Crow: Salvation didn't much live up to my standards. The Crow: Wicked Prayer would have been better if Furlong wasn't trying so hard to deliver his lines like Brandon Lee in the first film.

From the first time I saw this film, I was touched deeply by the story. The love between two people is so strong that a Crow can bring one man back to avenge their gruesome, murderous deaths.The story in itself is magical. The comics that it was based on were kept true in the film, due to the devotion shown by Brandon Lee and other cast and crew members. Such a story stays in your mind and influences your thoughts forever, it's a movie that I cannot ignore.The acting was superb. The honesty, acting ability, and the fact that Brandon Lee was an almost unrecognised star made the perfect combination, Lee fitted the role perfectly. For this reason, I believe that it really IS Brandon's film. Other roles, particularly that of Albrecht, were also played with nothing less than perfection.The follow ups to The Crow, however, are simply disgusting. To say the least, they are truly an insult to the work of everyone involved with The Crow. A study of the crew lists shows that many crew members on the original movie were not even consulted in the following attempts. I find the newer attempts are simply greedy money-making ideas, with no attention paid to the simple beauty of The Crow as a complete story in itself.Stop the sequels.

The comics flashback were in watercolor. The comic book was a very dark and gritty comic that couldn't have been a movie if there wasn't an 'R' rating but there were a few choice things the movie chose to omit that were in the comic book.

I feel so strongly about this movie because, since I know that Brandon Lee died, I feel that the story is real or something.  Even with the errors in editing, I still give this movie a 10/10.  It has an explosive cast and unique storyline.  It seems that today, you can't say that about too many movies.  I think that this is a modern classic.  Many movies today seem to start off good, with a good cast or a twisted plot line, but in the end, they seem to spoil it by trying too hard.  But this movie is what it is.  Brandon Lee deserves much more recognition for this role than he got.  He had such a presence on screen. Other things about this movie that I liked are that there is drama, suspense, action, it's gothic, and yet it is still a love story.  And not to mention some really great lines!

The fact that ""The Crow"" comic was written to help the passing of the writers wife, she was killed by a drunk driver, and Brandon Lee was killed in the making of this movie. The story it's self is about death and murder. A flock of crows are called a murder. E.A. Poe's poem is about death as well. Maybe there's something behind all of this, or maybe not. It's all in the eye of the beholder.",The Crow
405,JessKat,"In my opinion, the best film ever",10,4 August 2002,"The Crow has got to be my favorite film ever. It has everything: intense plot, fascinating characters, dark atmosphere, fabulous soundtrack (both the songs and score, which I highly recommend) and great quotes.I love every character in the movie, even the gang members stand out individually in some way and don't come off as ""just bad guys"" as in the horrid sequel. Eric is a great character, somewhat crazy, tortured and sympathetic. Top Dollar makes a fantastic nemesis, he's an interesting character and has lots of great lines.Despite the dark atmosphere, the message is beautiful: true love an conquer even death. This film is definitely worth watching....over and over again.",The Crow

407,gODGRINDER,13 Years Later.....,10,30 December 2007,"....this movie still gets to me.I remember seeing this movie in the theater at the tender age of 15. I never cry at movies, but the first (and only) time I ever did was at the end of this movie. For years, this movie haunted me; it permeated nearly every aspect of my existence. My bedroom walls were covered with posters from the film, I saved up the money to hunt down and purchase all of the comic books, and grew my hair long for the sole purpose of going out for Halloween as Eric Draven my senior year in high school. I wrote countless papers for various classes during my undergraduate study related to the film. Sometimes I feel like I know this movie better than the people who made it.It's funny how the things that are going on your life shape the way you experience the movies and music of your past. When life is good, it's easy to be over-analytical, to be hyper-critical, maybe even poke fun. I've been in this stage, watching this film and having almost no reaction to it whatsoever. However, there are times when life feels so dark and overwhelming and suddenly I'm that emotionally-vulnerable, confused 15-year-old kid again, carrying around the haunting images and music of the film in my head and trying to sort out the feelings evoked by it.And that's the beauty of this film. From the intensely angry expressions on Eric's face as he metes out his brand of justice to the tender moment he shares with Shelley before returning to the grave, this film encapsulates so many emotions; fear, rage, sadness, loneliness, hope, love, and redemption. The viewer can't help but have a bittersweet, visceral reaction to the film as we weep alongside Eric and revel in his revenge at the same time. An action-packed thriller it is, but this film really serves to remind us of how precious this life is; that every little moment we can share with those we love is to be treasured and cherished. And that when we love, we must love as long and as much as we can. Because, as Lee points out in his comments on the DVD extras, this ""seemingly inexhaustible"" well of life really is quite shallow, for we never really know when our time will come. This is the tragedy of both the film and of Brandon Lee's pointless death, but it can ultimately instill a sense of hope and purpose in those who heed the message.",The Crow
408,Dark_Romancer,True Love Is Forever,10,5 August 2002,"This film is often classified as a horror movie, or an action movie.  But that's not what it's about.  The main theme of this movie is love, and how ""when two people are meant to be together, nothing can keep them apart"". Although violent, dark, and gritty, this film captures the strength of the love Eric and Shelly shared.  Eric is the anti-hero, played brilliantly by the late Brandon Lee.  His mission is simple--revenge.  But along the way, love gets involved, the love for Shelly, and for his friend Sarah.  This is a really excellent movie, with a strong theme.  The violence puts off some people, but I think if you give the movie a chance and see how the violence is justified, you'll be glad you saw it.",The Crow
409,s-oosterveld,"On the surface an ordinary action movie, however...",8,14 December 2002,"A veil of darkness surrounds this movie. Not only because of the movie itself, but also due to the death of Brandon during the making. This gives the film an extra darkness and mystery around it.The story is about Eric Draven's search as an avenger to find justice for the brutal murder on him and his wife. He has been granted a dark and mysterious power of the crow and with this he seeks justice to them who were responsible for all of the pain and sadness.The film is a pretty straightforward action movie, yet it has a certain originality and quality. The dialogue thus the script is partly the reason, as well as the original comic.Micheal Wincott (Along came a Spider) and David Patrick Kelly (Twin Peaks) were among the cast, and Ernie Hudson (Oz) playing the sidekick as Cop Albrecht.One way or another, this movie was Brandon's big breakthrough and like his father he will be remembered for many generations to come.8/10",The Crow

411,the_indie_music_man,Great movie with a great soundtrack and storyline (WARNING- Very Mild Spoilers),10,8 February 2003,"There were a three things that atracted me to this movie and they were.1) The whole theme of the dead coming back to life intrests me and I am always keen to see a different take on the theme.2) The soundtrack: It contains mostly Gothic/Indie music, but the whole theme of the movie seems to be based around loosely around a post-Grunge america.3) The audience it attracts: The Crow is seen as a gothic film and is seen to have been made for goths. I am semi-gothic and am always interested to see films of this nature.With all those things in mind, the movie seemed irresistable and after i've seen it, it would now be in my top 10 movies of all time.The film is often violent, but somehow seems to keep a romantic and erotic feel to it, because after all, the whole movie is based on Eric's love for Shelly. It is also filled with minor jokes, which I found amusing.The only complaint I have about this movie is it didn't seem to have enough in it.I will look foward to seeing the sequel very much, and I recomend this film to anyone!",The Crow

Seeing as how The Crow has a 7.5 I thought I would watch it. Little did I come to find that this movie wouldn't even get a 1/10 on my scale.What a horrible film. The acting was horrible and the story line was just bad. Brandon Lee was not a good actor and the supporting cast was extremely bad as well. The flow of the movie was awful as well leaving you hanging more than once.Maybe I'm being to hard on this film because it was made in 1993 and most movies back then were filmed the same way, but I literally fast forwarded to the end of the movie because I couldn't take it any longer.If they were to remake this film today, I believe it could be much better, but for the one I saw, it sucked!",The Crow

Brandon Lee is the best! It is a tragedy that he was taken from us so early in his life. I watch this movie every year at least for Halloween my favorite holiday. The other The Crow movies don't even compare to this one and it is sad that they tried to sequel perfection. Its like trying to make a sequel to Casablanca.

420,elemari-365-648550,I'm not sure why this movie is rated so high,4,18 January 2013,"Simply put, this movie is very mediocre.The storyline is weak. A rock star and his fiancé are murdered on Halloween night by a gang of thugs. The rock star then returns from the dead to seek revenge on the murder and rape of his fiancé. Honestly, this plot screams cliché. The whole rock star idea is extremely cheesy and just reminds me of the rock band KISS and their dreadful costumes.The acting is decent. I feel that Brandon Lee gives off too much of a ""good guy"" vibe for his role. Despite being dressed up as a menacing, undead badass seeking revenge, he somehow still gives off the impression that he's a nice guy. The gang thugs seem a bit like they're trying too hard. They seem to act how they think thugs would act instead of acting like thugs. I just didn't buy it.The highlight of this film is the special effects, which were well done for 1994. Even so, they fail to outshine a cheesy plot and mediocre acting.Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't all bad, but it just wasn't good. The Crow lies out there in the vast gray area of mediocre action films.",The Crow

None of the other ""Crow"" movies are as good or even compare to the first. One thing that amazes me about this movie is Brandon Lee actually died in the process of making it and they continued production. I never would have guessed that they could do that and it still turn out to be an amazing movie. My favorite line in the movie "" Buildings burn, People die, but real love is forever.""

(but i wont say if he is or not) i know there are a lot of movies out there can make you cry and laugh, but this one is the only one that blends a full range of emotions and balances it out with well timed scenes and perfectly placed lines. it is too good to analyse, but i'll say this; some eccentric camera angles, quirky lighting and film noir-esquire shots make this as unusual as it is practically revolutionary. there's even the essential cheesy line in there somewhere :)",The Crow

I really wanted to see and like that movie but honestly speaking while watching the movie i dozed off a few times. Apart from the atmosphere, set design and photography everything is so dull and boring. Acting, screenplay, direction and every other thing about the movie are so poor and mediocre I cant help but to dislike the movie.

425,drs2,Ahead of its time,10,2 July 2005,"As we sit in movie theaters today endlessly assaulted by comic adaptations many have overlooked or never seen The Crow, which is arguably the best film in the entire genre. Sure the effects are dated but the story and acting in this beautifully dark picture are leaps and bounds ahead of comic book movies today. As I just mentioned the style of this movie fits just perfectly with the characters and with the killer soundtrack that accompanies it. Some people say that this movie is overrated because of the death of Brandon Lee during shooting but honestly I first saw this movie years ago and I, first of all didn't know who Brandon Lee was or that he had died tragically due to an on the set accident. Brandon Lee in this picture simply put gives the performance of a lifetime it is just so powerful and emotional that you sometimes forget that it's a movie. It's simply not the kind of acting that is usually reserved for a comic book movie but more dramatic films instead. That is not to say the film lacks action, which there is plenty of but it's more than just that. The story is also very compelling because it poses the question to the whole audience of what they would do if they were allowed to come back, what would you do how would you view the world and all its changes since your departure and how would all your loved ones have moved forward without you? It makes you think about your own mortality because none of us know how much time we have left and we sometimes take for granted certain things because they seem small or trivial but as Eric discovers in the movie ""nothing is trivial"" and that's true. Under appreciated masterpiece",The Crow
426,Videogamer49107,My favorite movie,10,25 July 2005,"The Crow is my favorite movie. It's a mixed bag of emotions and it just takes you on one helluva' trip.

There are many differences between the graphic novel and the movie, but the main story and most of the characters stay the same. The greatest thing about the similarities is that they're both written by James O' Barr. This movie is very sad, it's very violent.

I also would like to recognize the religious similarities. Eric is Christ and he must take up the biblical quote ""Vengence is Mine"" and sacrifice himself to save all he loves.

429,alongano,comic book movie fun,8,4 January 2007,"Some how this movie works more than it should. Your standard revenge action comic book movie is much more with the great work (sad story) of Lee (what a good action star he would have made!), the villain (Wincott- the voice pipes on that guy!) , and the director / writer. You have touches of comedy that are a nice alt. to the regular dark tale one usually gets in these films. Check out Lee's little wave as he sends one bad guy off to his death in his car, or his quick little step/dance as he shot at by the cops, and even the one liners are not that bad :). The overall film is darkly shot- some say too dark- but I would disagree it allows the directly to use the low budget he had to greater effect and sets a timeless sorrow to this world the characters are in. The action scenes are over the top, esp one where Lee's Crow character takes on around 20 of the bad guys during a ""bad guy summit"" = the director hits it out of the park with the editing, music, and using Lee's physical ability to make this a stand out action piece.

430,rob_chezmoyd,No film in a million years will ever top this! A Landmark In Cinematic History,10,15 March 2005,"This film is absolutely phenomenal. Better than The Godfather, better than The Matrix and better than Die Hard! The Crow is one of the best films ever made. It is just like any other rubbish basic storyline. Man and his fiancée get killed. Man gets resurrected a year later and kills the people who murder him. But Proyas's sharp and exquisite directing and Brandon Lee's sensational role as Eric Draven (The Crow) has turned this film into one of the best films of all time! And its not just Lee who puts in a stunning performance. Michael Wincott - in my opinion a superb but underrated actor - turns in a superb role as the sadistic and menacing master criminal Top Dollar.Despite all of the violence and gore, it doesn't lead us away from the fact that this story is about true love lasting forever. Usually in films like this, they just mention the death of a loved one a couple of times and then it's forgotten and it gets boring. But in this film, Shelley (Lee's fiancée in the film) is mentioned a lot by Eric and a series of flashbacks - including the scene where she is beaten and raped by the villains in the movie, Tin Tin, T-Bird, Funboy and Skank - makes us realise just how much love they had for each other and we feel satisfied when Eric picks off each of the villains in an assortment of gruesome ways.The dark sets and characters all add to the gritty, Gothic atmosphere that just made me admire this film even more. It is also one of the only films i have seen where the cast has been chosen to perfection. If Lee was still alive today, I have no doubt that he would be one of the best actors around.

Whether its the scene where he embeds a crow-like design in Tin-Tin's chest, or leaves behind a fiery calling card after sending T-bird to his death, Brandon Lee left his mark. I was also impressed with the film's cinematography. With black being the picture's dominant color, I felt it was a perfect fit with it's storyline.

Other then that it just looked like any other B-movie shown on TV on a Tuesday night, some hero killing typical 100% evil bad guys, random cop with a moustache, random kid, all played by actors you normally see in different TV series.

Viewers be forewarned: it isn't, not by a long-shot.What it is: a comic-genre film - and like most film versions of dark comics, it is enslaved to rain and shadows, candlelight and eyeliner aesthetics, pseudo-intellectualism and faux-poetic moments. It suffers greatly from an unbelievable premise (murderous super bad guys run wild in the streets, doing their will) and mind-numbingly dense dialog. I watched this movie just recently for the first time - and had to check all the background material on it because I just couldn't believe it was actually shot in the nineties - it is an eighties movie in every way shape and form, hearkening back to the days of the early Cure, Bauhaus, Souxsie and the Banshees, etc.The acting is flat all around (Brandon Lee spends the entire movie with his chin on his chest, glaring menacingly from underneath his furrowed brow) and what little there is of character is two-dimensional - a comic book view of the world, juvenile and meaningless, trying desperately to be ""deep"".If Brandon Lee hadn't died during production, this film would be regarded as nothing more than an amusing goth fantasy - and not the goth cult classic it seems to have become. I guess I understand some people's emotional attachment to it, but back when I was being goth and under the influence of nihilist aesthetics, my friends and I read Baudelaire, Sartre and Dostoevsky.

To start, the bad guys in this movie are absolutely terrible. T-Bird reminds me more of a high school teacher than a criminal. All Funboy does is sleep around. Skank is just a raving fool along for the ride. When i think about it, Tin-Tin was the only dangerous person in that group (because of the knives). Top Dollar, a criminal whose name makes no sense, is a weird dude who, what, wiggles around a sword? calls an Asian woman with huge lips his sister? kills women he sleeps with and takes out their eyes to do..what, exactly? Nothing about him either made sense or was in the least bit intimidating.The main character, Eric Draven, is (or was) a rock star with a pretty fiancée, Shelly. whenever he remembers past experiences with Shelly, he goes back to this sappy world of before when nothing could possibly go wrong and everything was set to candlelight. When he comes back from the dead, he, like other superheroes, inexplicably breaks into some makeup and paints himself to be weird. Whenever he says something, it's usually a quote of some book, and the effect is totally not there (e.g. his quote from Poe's ""the Raven"" in the pawn shop, or when he says ""Mother is the word for God on the lips of children"" to Darla - lame). And the SUBTLE interjections of humor could not possibly have occurred at more inappropriate times: when he dares funboy to shoot his hand, then laughs when it heals, it seems like he's showing off this ability that is only given to him for a single, serious purpose; and in the cathedral when he is shot, he stumbles a bit and drops an f-bomb (so badly done!)The smashing of the guitar on the rooftop was a little cheesy for my taste as well.",The Crow

The crow starts with the brutal murder of two lovers eric draven and shelly webster the day before their wedding (halloween). legend has it that when you die a crow carries your soul to the land of the dead. but in some cases the crow can bring that soul back to make the wrongs right. a year after they were killed eric is risen by the crow from the dead to avenge shelly. The acting is amazing and the film is legendary. its a great performance on all terms. you get sucked into james o'barr's world and watch as he tells his tale of love surviving everything... even death.,The Crow

440,woody-23,An excellent movie,10,12 August 1998,"The Crow is an excellent movie, I didnt find one sequence or part boring or dull.  It's ashame Brandon Lee died because I think this movie would have rocketed him to stardom. The Crow is dark and gloomy and violent everything that makes a good fantasy movie good.  All of the acting was good and I like the way the camera sometimes switches to the crows view and the cinematography is great. The music is loud and depressing and MTV-ish most of the time. Go see it and watch a visual masterpiece. Rated R for:Graphic, bloody violence,rape,profanity * * * *(out of  4 stars)",The Crow
441,Hoser Eh,This movie is the greatest action movie ever made,10,8 November 1998,"Fast paced, great action, perfect soundtrack for the film, excellent acting, toss in a bit of artsy spectacle, great movie all around. Makes you suspend disbelief, and there's not one scene that is lacking. If you've seen the sequel, please don't judge this movie before seeing it, this is so far superior it's incredible.",The Crow
442,Nostrada-2,Top Marks,10,2 September 1999,"An excellent film.  The only shame in it being that Brandon Lee died for his art.  The film is dark and somewhat gothic, with some real poetic justice. A must-see.  Surely, one of the best movies of all time (and with a beyond-excellent orchestral score).",The Crow

If you die without seeing this movie, make sure you come back to see it.",The Crow
445,ursinus,A twist for the film noir genre.,9,15 December 1999,"The Crow is a fantasy tale, plain and simple.  You don't see many dark fantasies however.  As the movie tag line says, 'Believe in Angels', and after viewing this movie, you will.  The dark, twisted, violent, and sometimes funny film takes the classic film noir sense to new levels.  The whole combination of lighting, or lack there off, the music, and the acting of Brandon Lee give this movie the added punch.  The use of flashbacks fill in the gaps in the story, so people will not be asking too many questions. Overall, the movie makes the viewer cheer for Eric Draven and scream for the demise of the criminals.  A perfect fit for anyone wanting fantasy, romance, and/or violence.",The Crow
446,S-Zonig,A masterpiece concerning the usage of violence in a movie,10,16 January 2000,"A movie taking place mostly at night is exceptional. Even more exceptional is how the movie manages to mix a very simple, yet excellent background story with the display of furious violence, without becoming ridiculous. The good thing about this movie is that the plot is dominant over the action scenes right until the end unlike in many other films (where the plot is a mere excuse for showing as much action scenes as possible). It's the first movie glorifying violence that I thoroughly enjoyed watching.",The Crow
447,marc.de.s,A most excellent movie...,10,18 January 2000,"This film is, in my opinion, the greatest film of all time.  Stunning performances all round (especially Brandon Lee, and the ever watchable Michael Wincott), amazing direction, these thrown together with a beautiful soundtrack (rivaled only by 'Romeo & Juliet'), and you have this near perfect film.If you haven't watched it yet, go to the video shop NOW and rent it immediately!",The Crow
448,Abdiel42,Poetic and breathtaking,10,20 October 2000,"Some of the most intense cinematography and poetic irony ever.  As everyone knows, Lee died during the filming, and the irony of his character returning to avenge his own death should not be lost on the viewer.It is true that the plot of the movie is not on par with ""American Beauty"" or ""The Godfather"" but Proyas' directing and Wolski's cinematography are incredible.  The cast all deliver good performances with Lee's probably being the weakest, but still quite acceptable.  He had trouble displaying mixed emotions, but most of his scenes were very believable in part because of directing, in part cinematography.The action scenes range from beautiful and poetic, to intense and powerful, to bloody and fast-paced.  The only thing that could have made them even the slightest bit better would have been some consultation by John Woo.The character development is quite well done, although I wish we had more about Albrecht.  Sarah and Darla are developed well, Eric and his love of Shelly, and even Top Dollar is shown with emotion.  O'Barr's writing of the characters is very well done.I need to take a moment to comment on the score.  Graeme Revell made the most incredible musical score to ever accompany an action movie.  The passion and drama in the percussive action tracks and the aching strings in the introspective periods serve as wonderful punctuation to a great statement of filmmaking.Finally, the worst part about the Crow.  The sequel.  Do not even waste your time.  The only good part of the second movie is the recitation of the English dictation rhyme about counting crows.  ""One for sorrow, two for joy,"" etc.Overall, because of a _tiny_ bit of acting and plot, I'm going to knock a half point off.  My score:  9.5/10  (Round up to 10/10)",The Crow
449,smileitdontgetbetterthanthis,totally breathtaking,10,15 December 2000,"well, i only saw this film recently and i was totally blown away by it. the story-about a man (Brandon lee) coming back from the dead to avenge him and his fiancees murder was good, and brandon lee was fantastic in his role as Eric Draven. its a real tragedy that he died so young and so full of promise. the freaky thing is that Brandon Lee had to be 'literally brought back from the dead' in computerised sequences to finish the movie. he was accidentally killed in one of the 'flash back ' scenes by a gun shot by the actor playing 'fun boy'. getting back to the film, i dont believe in praising an actor simply because their dead, but it does give a certain eerie sadness to the role.the loctaion, music and supporting acting was great and i definately reccomend it. its sad, funny, stylish and action packed. it really gives us alot to think about after weve seen it, if your into that, but even not, i havent met anyone whose disliked it (yet!)if you can go see it i totally recommend it. one of the best films ive seen in a long while.",The Crow

In that moment I didn't know that this night would be very special.This was the first movie which made me cry. And I've always been wondering how people can cry, while they are watching a movie. Now I know, how.I loved this Gothic style, which made ""The Crow"" very emotional and painful. I can remember, that someone called this a "" dark fairy-tale for adults"". And I agree with him.If I didn't know that this movie is actually 12 years old, I would say that it's kinda new. I can only imagine, how people acted when this movie was first shown in cinemas.Acting was brilliant, every character was so realistic. Seems that everyone perfectly knows what they're supposed to do. Expectually villains and Eric.One of my favorite scenes are when Sarah is looking for Eric in his old flat, and she screams in anger and frustration, that he doesn't care about her. But then, when she's already leaving, Eric suddenly appears and says : "" Sarah, I do care."" Strange, how three small words can contain such a big amount of emotions.And now I'm always remembering one of the most beautiful quotes : "" If the people we love are stolen from us, the way to have them live on is to never stop loving them. Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever."" It's very sad, that this was Brandon Lee's last movie, because he really had a talent. His acting is stunning and definitely not shallow.This movie really deserves more than 7.4. 10/10",The Crow
454,theblix,"Buildings burn, people die, but real love is forever.",9,22 March 2001,"In the spring of 1994 I watched in amazement at my glowing television to see the news that ""The Crow"" - the film which claimed the life of young Brandon Lee - was to be released in May.  The Crow is a visual masterpiece in which we learn that: even in times of great brutality and sorrow, love can conquer all things and survive beyond the grave.  This film is one of the best adaptations of a comic book to film, some other notables being Superman and Batman.  But never have the others been so raw in there presentation to the audience or as poetic.  This is the story of a rock musician (Eric Draven) and his fiance (Shelley Webster) who are to be married on Halloween but with one knock at the door their lives are shattered.  The Crow is the image of a soul brought back to avenge the murder of a loved one, a murder so violent that it haunts that soul even in death.  This film is truly not for everyone, it is violent and boasts that it is ""Darker than the Bat"" in reference to Batman.  The film will leave you with a feeling of closure and completion, that the actions of the evil of the world do not go unpunished.I recommend The Crow to everyone and for those who like the film I also recommend reading the graphic novel by James O'Barr.  This film will make you cheer and make you angry, and in that respect it accomplishes what many thers have failed in doing and that is enthral the viewer into the world that is created by the actors and the directors of the film.  Just before the credits role there is a brief note from Linda Lee Cadwell (Brandon Lee's mother) and Edward R. Pressman (the films Producer) it says ""To Brandon and Eliza"" for those that understand, this will be the image that will impact you the most.  Happy viewing.

It also help's that Brandon Lee plays the lead character. God Rest His Soal. Oh and I agree that The Crow 2 and 3 sucked, big time. They have to be the 2 cheesiest movies out there. If you have ever seen The Crow then there is no way you could be a fan of #2 and 3. I don't understand why this thing is making me write 10 lines.

456,lucanobrimaz,Most overrated cult film in cinema's history.,4,13 March 2021,"While the film is rich in style and the visual effects are certainly good for its time, a very special mention to the miniatures work and the set pieces is due being fair. It is the screenwriting that falls awfully short to support an otherwise well put together film.The Crow is the perfect example of style over substance and while some films may get away with it because even if they're plot-thin, at least they manage to make sense. The Crow, dearly lacks it; sense that is.The amazingly presented neo-noir streets deserved better worldbuilding, we deserved more backstory to such a visually pleasing dark-fantasy. And sadly, said dark fantasy didn't manage to support a thin script to provide more visual storytelling. It is pretty to look at, but it really doesn't tell us anything extra, unlike similar films like The Matrix, or Blade Runner that added to simple, yet robust stories, have the aid of pretty kick-ass visual storytelling in numerous details that removed from said films, would have left us with yet another awesome looking film, but nothing else to support them.The film is often looked at through the lens of heavy nostalgia rain (pun intended). Plus the obvious awe and mysticism behind Brandon Lee's demise while filming it. Giving it an instant ""cult classic"" status, similar to The Dark Knight's because of Heath Ledger's death. However TDK's status is at least well deserved due to the film achieving something The Crow couldn't ultimately, rising above and becoming something more than the sum of its individual parts.4/10. Mostly because of its amazing visual achievements for its time and also because it has one of the best soundtrack albums to ever be put together for a feature film.",The Crow

Brandon Lee does an amazing job and deserves credit beyond words for this film. He captures the character in a great way and has really great on set chemistry with all of the other actors. I love the way that the flashbacks are shown, in exaggerated bright colors. Probably my favorite thing about this movie is the way is it shown. Everything is dark and i think that that really gives you a stronger feeling about the movie. Overall, i really love watching this movie. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and you don't get bored of it because you discover different things about it every time. I highly recommend this movie.",The Crow

There were even scenes where he appeared when Eric Draven was resurrected, and he was holding the crow on his hand and the crow flew off and to Eric. Why did they omit this character? I am glad that they did, because he seemed ridiculous, and would have made the story unbelievable. I do not see the purpose of having him anyway. The storyline for the movie is WAY better than the comic, James O'barr doesn't know what he is talking about when he commented that in his version of the crow states that Eric Knew exactly what to do and who to go for, whereas in the movie we learn with Eric. the only thing I like better in the comic is the appearance of the crow's character.",The Crow

Sadly, this movie did not age well. It is plagued with cringe-inducing one-liners, questionable plot lines and every angsty fantasy that lived inside the heads of black-eyeliner-wearing disgruntled teenagers. After the first 10 minutes of the film, you can accurately predict everything.I can see how this movie is a ""cult-film"".

Great hero, great villain, great graphics, (for the time and money spent) and yes even a great soundtrack! Not many movies can say that, I also feel very strongly that this was Brandon Lee's breakout film. It's a shame that the work that he did in this movie not only turned out to be his best work, but also his last.

It mixes anger, passion, love, insanity, everything you can think of, very well. It's a perfectly balanced movie and they show every side of Eric Draven perfectly.

Possibly what I'm missing is, never having read the comic book, I don't realize that its supposed to have an overdone but two dimensional feel.

With Such phenomenal acting by the late Brandon Lee makes this movie great, but the action pact movie with, at its time, good visual effects makes this movie powerful in more ways than one.

474,dannylmores,The themes of loneliness and loss expressed with creative artistry,10,5 November 2007,"I've heard a lot about The Crow, as well as the tragic story of Brandon Lee's death. But I never saw this movie until last week.What touched me immediately was the commitment of the actors to their character's emotions, particularly by Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson (the police sergeant), and Rochelle Davis (little girl Sarah). I could feel the loneliness and pain of each of these three characters. These emotions are presented powerfully when superimposed against the fantasy storyline, and that is the art of this movie. We rarely see authentic and poignant emotion like this in real life. But I think anyone who has ever experienced loss and loneliness can relate to it.There are many moments in the movie when each of these three characters are abandoned, and then one of the other three appears unexpectedly to provide comfort. They stay long enough only to provide reassurance or hope, and then they disappear. So it looks like these fallen angels are, themselves, angels to save each other.How often in real life does such an angel appear at a moment of despair? In the movie, it happens, and it happens unexpectedly, and that is when any viewer who has felt despair in their own life can feel the joy when this happens, and the sadness that it does not happen in our own real lives. This technique plays loss and hope against each other. I'll admit I cried. This movie was created by deeply felt artists.I looked up the biography of James O'Barr, the creator of The Crow. Along with Brandon Lee's death, there is indeed tragedy sweeping across the real lives behind this movie. Coincidence or not, the creators of this movie have tapped into those tragic threads of life that are so rarely touched by other movies.",The Crow

One year later he is brought back from the dead by the crow to seek revenge on the people who raped and murdered his girlfriend.This is a very powerful movie with dark, almost gothic scenery. It is very bleak and depressing. The music is very moving with tracks varying from the Cure to Nine Inch Nails.This is one of those movies that must be seen even if you are not a fan of the action genre. It is a very moving film and the use of symbolizm is very good.I highly reccomend",The Crow
480,quixotiz-601-220928,Unique,9,6 December 2009,"The Crow. An example of the a comic book which has been made into Art. Conversely, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings is an example of Art being made into a comic book.I haven't watched this one for well over 10 years. I was first struck by the resemblance to Blade Runner in the opening scene - sweeping over a dark, dismal cityscape with flames billowing from buildings. The constant rain, the trash bestrewn streets and gutters, the decaying buildings, the denizens....you can see the influence of Ridley Scott's early masterpiece here. But The Crow is no mere imitation of a work that is itself unique and insurpassable. The Crow seems more to me like a sister film, a film with similarities of visual style to Blade Runner, but a film with a spirit of its own.Brandon Lee somehow imparts an energy and a passion and a belief to the role of Eric Draven that comes across as true. On this basis it is easy to enter this world, it is easy enough to believe that this man has indeed come back from death, not as a ghost, but as flesh and blood, to exact bloody retribution on those who cruelly cut short the life of the woman he loved. For it is not so much his own death that consumes him. It is clear enough that the rage which drives him is the dark side of the bright fire of love that burned within him, while living, for his beloved.His performance gives the film its power. And while the characters are most certainly symbols, they are real too, they are flesh and blood and personalities. The film enfleshes these passions of the soul - love, rage, hatred - hatred of darkness and hatred of light.Although the setting, the city is nameless, we do not need a name and do not even wish for one. Somehow, the police procedural aspect, the typical foot-slogging, persistent and good-hearted beat cop, typically harangued and periodically bawled out by his arrogant, suit-wearing superior nicely grounds the film in a reality with which we are very familiar, if only from countless television shows of the ilk. It works well, and not for a second did I think I was looking at card-board cut-outs of people.This is a great film. It belongs, with a small minority of other films, in the realm of Art. It belongs in the pantheon, along with The Odyssey, with the Lord of the Rings (book), with Handel's Messiah, with the statue of David, with the Sistine chapel......and so on. By no means is it without its flaws, its faults. Among them, I would NOT include the straightforward plot. How many films with twisted, convoluted plots do you watch over and over and over once the mystery is untangled? On the other hand, I ask you, fans of The Crow, how many times have you watched this? It has raw power. You may know exactly what's going to happen, but you're hanging on by your fingernails to the last frame.It's beautiful.",The Crow
481,Amy888,Could i love this movie more?,10,3 July 2003,"Just before we start i have gotta say this is my favourite movie of all time. It might not be technically the best, but its my favourite.I think the whole concept of "" The Crow "" is completly romantic. The notion that somebody could love you so much that they would return from the dead to avenge your death is the type of love every woman dreams of. I know when your watching the film that romance probably isnt the first thing you think of, but for me, that basic idea left a lasting impression on me. That and the excellent production, the amazing Brandon Lee, and the superb darkly meloncholic soundtrack.",The Crow
482,missdancinshorty,Great Movie!,10,31 August 2003,This film is awesome. My dad used to watch it alot when  was 5 and I saw parts of it because I would always fall asleep on the couch. But recently back in may I watched it the whole way through and loved it. At this time I didnt know Brandon Lee was killed so I went onlineto find out what other recent movies brandon did and I found out he was killed on the set of the crow. That made me so sad. I love this movie everyone should see it once in their life!,The Crow
483,jade_6981,Excellent movie (despite some haters!!),10,4 March 2005,"first off to the ""haters"", Just because you think that the movie is all hyped up and that its a bunch of wannabe Goths, listen here, I saw this movie when I was 13 and let me tell you that I can still watch it over and over again and notice something that I had not noticed when I first saw the film. I love it.The concept was a release for James o'Barr when his fiancée was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 18. For James to deal with his anger and pain he thought of what if someone came back from the dead to exact revenge for the loss of a loved one, what would they do? well thats how Eric and Shelly's story was born.I don't care what the haters say about this movie. It will always be a cult classic to me and millions of other fans of both the original graphic novel and movie!",The Crow
484,OneCrow,There is only one Crow....,10,24 December 2003,"If people base their overall opinion on The Crow based on either of its' sequels, they will miss how good The Crow starring Brandon Lee is. City of Angels was a shameful attempt by some writers and producers to capitalize on the original and the stigma attached to the film created through Brandon Lee's tragic on-set death.The Crow should have been Lee's 'breakout' film. His role as Eric Draven should have stood out for the effort Lee put into that, rather than the tragic circumstances inexorably tied to it.The Crow has some endearing qualities, and leaves some lasting impressions and images firmly implanted in memory. From the intentionally dark and dreary settings of Detroit to the soundtrack, The Crow stands on its' own as a truly great - and greatly under-appreciated - film. The story distinguishes itself in such a way, that even some unoriginality is forgiven. What I mean by that is, the revenge theme in movies was nothing new or unique. Avenging a loved one has been done several times and in several different ways. Sometimes this mechanic works, sometimes it doesn't. In The Crow, it works. In other words; some elements in the movie, though unoriginal, are still conveyed in original and intriguing ways.The Crow is original and inspired work. That's the bottomline.Brandon's role wasn't necessarily 'Oscar-worthy'..But, it was believable and presented with emotion and authority. He commanded that role, and the scenes he was in(which is most of them). He was (and is) Eric Draven. One can only guess where this role would have taken Brandon Lee had he lived. My guess is to bigger and better things...come to think of it, maybe that's where he ended up? Depending on what you believe...
If you haven't seen this movie, I'd recommend at least renting it. I own the Collectors' Series DVD, and it is permanently part of my collection.Last note: Really a crying shame City of Angels was ever made, and especially given the fact it involves some of the same people from the original. They seem to thoroughly undo every bit of good they did with The Crow. Please, do yourself a favor; pass the sequels by. There is only one The Crow.",The Crow
485,rupert_davison,My favorite movie of all time,10,28 February 2004,"What can i say? Simply that it is one of of those rare films that appeals to goths, grungers and those who into the alternative and the occult. The late Brandon Lee plays a murdered rocker who comes back from the dead with the help of a crow to inflict revenge on those who killed him his fiance a year ago. After applying black and white face-paint and a black costume he begins his killing spree. The fact that Brandon died during the making of a film increase the dark, surreal atmosphere that remains throughout, and the excellent storyline and special effects make this a brilliant film. Why it got a measly 7/10 I don't know, but i highly suggest you see it",The Crow

487,Angels9thFantasy,This is one of the best movies of its kind,10,18 April 2004,"This is a great movie and not just for goths. I mean I am not a goth and really like this movie. It has more than violence and drugs. Its got a heart and soul to it. But you see several people are to how do you say HARD HEADED to get past its certain look. It is, as I will admit dark and some people just can't seem to get past that. I will state that if you don't like dark films this is so not your thing. My only problem is people who put this movie down because they think it has no purpose. Those people just wont admit they don't understand it. This movie is like the perfect love story. It has action and dynamics. It is about revrenge for the person you love, and I mean if you were rapped and murdered, wouldn't you want some one to do that for you? I no its not right but still you can't say that isn't true love right there. Here is my opinion if you need a movie for a female and a male here it is. Just if you can't understand dark movies or violence take that last part back.* My evaluation 8 1/2 out of 10 (I Refuse to give a number over 9)",The Crow
488,iluvhermione,What a great film!,9,25 April 2004,"OK first of all, I would like to say The Crow is one of my favourite films of all time. My first reason for liking it is because it's a great idea for a film and my other reason is because it's not just a one type genre. What I mean is, The Crow isn't a Horror Movie, It's an action, thriller, dramatic, dark, funny and a sort of Horror Movie. I always watch this movie, so if your board one night and want something to watch and there's nothing good on TV then buy/rent this film. I gave this film a 9/10 rating, and I'm always right. I also heard that the sequels to this film are pretty good, I haven't seen them yet but either way, see this film.",The Crow
489,blackcrowangel,Favorite Movie of All Time,10,26 May 2004,"Who ever said that this movie was dull an empty didn't have more than two brain cells to watch it with. I am hardly a cult member nor am I a goth. Brandon Lee was one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion, next to Cuba Gooding Jr. and Edward Norton. This movie is a romance-action flick depicting the lengths true love will go to justify wrongs. This man comes back from the dead to avenge his fiancé's death and his own. Now what woman wouldn't love that. The knife fights gun fights and martial arts demonstrations make up the perfect mix for an action flick as well, a big plus for the guys! A really excellent film for those with out kids, it's got a little nudity and a lot of gunfire. I've seen this movie more than a hundred times easily and every time I notice something new, so if you like love stories women, and guys if you like action and suspense...See ""THE CROW""",The Crow

I'm glad that there was a t.v. program to follow. I just wish it could have lasted longer than it did. Is there a chance for a revival of the series????? That would be superb! This movie was one of the top highlights of the nineties for me, the music and the pit so well done, just like in the city that became my home, New York. In Transylvania, where I was born, stories like this are told to children, and they grow up fierce, and just, and brave; and the girls dream of a lover of the Crow's caliber!!!.... Every time I go home, I look to the roof tops and, in my heart's eye I see this love story played over and over!!!! Such sweet sorrow!!! Such satisfaction!!!! Sweet revenge!!!!

491,Fatboy4life,the mystery of what if Brandon Lee would have lived to make more films?,10,19 November 2004,"The Crow is one of my favorite movies as it is one of the greatest movies translated from a comic book ever made. Brandon Lee makes the role as Eric Draven as he reserects to payback the people that murdered him and his fiancé a year earlier. As he calls upon the power of the crow to assist him throughout his quest to get the leader, Top Dollar. Which led the murder on Halloween the year before. It just makes you wonder what would have happened if Brandon Lee would have lived to make more movies? I also like in the movie the way that the film is shot with the dark colors showing the true emotion of the film. It is just a superb film and I definitely recommend it for anyone who has not yet seen this cinematic masterpiece.",The Crow
492,FroggyFan16,Amazing,10,20 August 2004,"This movie is a superior breed of brilliance! I was taken by the dark imagery against the bright spark of vengeance. A dark love tale of epic portions. Eric Draven is honestly one of the most interesting and marvelous fictional characters ever created. His comedic timing is perfect and flawless. My friends and I quote this movie all the time. There is not one bad thing about this movie. If you have not seen this movie then I suggest . . . no,I take that back. I DEMAND that you see it! This is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time. Brandon Lee was just spectacular! This is an instant classic and a must-have for every movie collection.",The Crow
493,btukey,This is the best movie ever!,10,28 September 2004,"Basically this movie is about at as bad-ass as it gets. Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a young rock guitarist who is beaten and killed the night before his wedding, along with his fiancé. The next year he comes back and gets even with the guys that killed him. This movie is dark, in a way that it feels real. Instead of letting the love surpass the anger of the overall movie Lee keeps it going. Not only that, but he choreographed every fight scene, and let's be honest, the son of Bruce Lee would not steer us wrong! I would also like to point out that the cinematography is very unique too. The film makers obviously stayed away from ""happy"" colors. They primarily focus on black and blood red. This just adds to the the strength of the movie. The message of the movie is one that can be appreciated. While Lee's character is killing the ""bad guys"", he himself is not romanticized as a good guy. He is still killing, and the film makers did not try to make him look like the every day hero. Like I said, this movie is just to bad-ass for words!!!",The Crow
494,cory_is_the_greatest,Great,10,7 November 2004,The Crow which is directed by Alex Proyas is a very good movie about this man Eric Draven (LEE) who comes back on Devils night and wreaks havoc on the people that killed him and his girlfriend. This movie ultimately caused the death of the star Brandon Lee the son of martial arts superstar Bruce Lee but was it murder or accidental i am still trying to work it out but Alex Proyas won't talk about it he should get it out in the open it might resolve it all this movie is worth seeing though **********/10. This movie will be a movie that will still be around in another 10 years and one that you can watch as soon as your old enough. a classic movie that will never let down on the action a must see,The Crow
495,afi_battousai,Gives the watcher the chance to use imagination.,10,8 November 2004,"in the past, the crow has been given some scrutinizing reviews. and while the movie is not perfect, seeing as none ever are, the total look and feel of the movie give the watcher such a sense of what is happening to Draven. It is obvious that very little is known about the happenings on that fateful night or about eric and his future wife, but this allows the watcher room to imagine and take from his/her heart things that make it what it is. I for one took memories from my life and from past experience and imagined them much stringer in Eric Draven. This gives Eric the character that he was 'lacking' in the film. We all know that what happened was awful, there is no doubt about that. So why should we use up another hour of film explaining something we already know?All in all, The Crow is a very moving film and is full of action for those not looking for a moving experience or the poetic style of the film. I recommend it to anyone who wants to think more about the evil in todays world, grin at the almost constant yet tactful irony, and applaud as Eric wreaks havok on the evil ones.",The Crow
496,chris-last,wicked but in a very good way,10,12 November 2004,"It's a fantastic film, it does a good vs evil with an evil good person better than I have ever seen before or since and I consider it as close to a romantic epic as I can bear although it is actually nothing of the sort. Justice and particularly revenge, the real theme of the film, is a dish best served cold and it's hard to get much colder than the dead.The atmospheric soundtrack stood out as so excellent that I noticed it in the background even though the film was completely absorbing and it complemented the film perfectly.The Gothic look and feel of the whole film was superbly integrated with an alternative present day setting and every character was brought to such vivid life as to be loved or hated with passion.",The Crow
497,deveraux009-650-383191,Great Film,10,30 June 2013,"The film portrays a young rock guitarist who comes back from the dead to avenge the murders of himself and his fiancée. Even as a kid I always enjoyed watching it, as I found Lee's Crow to be easily watchable and I couldn't help but sympathize with the character, thanks to Lee's performance. He truly shined as the character, and captured what James O' Barr worked hard to create in his graphic novels. The atmosphere of the film was damn perfect, and even though some of the dialogue was a bit hit-and-miss(Mainly Rochelle Davis as Sarah), the cast worked and went great together. Michael Wincott as 'Top Dollar' was easily one of the best villains interpreted on-screen, and had some of the best dialogue and scenes besides Lee. To touch up a bit about Brandon Lee as The Crow, the way Lee portrayed the title character was what made the film so great, with his powerful yet gentle charismatic presence, he made one of the best superheroes to ever hit the screen. The action in the film was alright, but without the film's good performances, it might not have carried as well. The direction of the film was practically flawless, and everything clicked just fine. Alex Proyas as director of the film was a fine choice.",The Crow

Get a dark room a group of friends maybe even a bowl of pop corn and enjoy. It is brilliantly done. The storyline is interesting from beginning to end. It truly makes you think about a lot of things. The acting is amazing. It's do bad that Brendon Lee died because he is amazing. The effects and action are brilliant without being overdone.The combat is so realistic. The soundtrack is a work of art. It perfectly captures the mood of each scene. The scene were lee ""suits up"" in his ruined apartment is arguable the best moment in cinema. The visual style of the entire film just perfectly fits. Its dark and bleek and exciting. This is one that no one can afford not to see.",The Crow
499,sproule008,This is my favourite movie,10,21 September 2006,"This movie is a classic! Brandon Lee was amazing, thats all there is too it. He played the verge between pure madness with sorrow brilliantly. If you haven't see this move go out and get it. Seriously there is no bad acting in it. You feel Lee's pain and you you feel his anger. No one could have played Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee. The scene in the pawn shop was taken straight out of the comic book almost word for word. David Patrick Kelly is an amazing actor and he plays a good villain, as for Michael Wincott I feel he is under-rated and proves it in this film. Ernie hudson (from Ghostbusters fame) gave a spectacular performance and continues to give great performances. As for the untimely death of Brandon Lee, it was a terrible loss, but this movie has allowed his memory to live on in the hearts and minds of generations to come. This movie will be appreciated for a long time and may prove to be one of the most successful cult movies ever. The sequels i admit can't live up to the original but are worth a look and the TV series is a pleasant surprise and is one of my favourite shows. This film pulled of a knife catch perfectly and no other film i have seen has ever done that without some glitch. If you play it in slow motion you still wont find a fault. Overall this is an amazing movie that will appeal to fans of horror, action and romantic movie it even has some comedy, so check it out and enjoy.",The Crow

After watching this film i just felt i wanted to learn more about the film and the circumstances which surrounded the filming it. I obtained the ""Making of the Crow"" book and read it from cover to cover that to captivated me and it is well worth a read for all those that enjoyed the film.We may never no the true circumstances in which Brandon was killed but i do know that he was aa special actor with an emotion and a passion for what he did you could tell that from the emotional portrayal of love and loss in the crow.",The Crow
503,rachellenicole93,The Crow,8,27 September 2013,"The Crows RevengeThis movie begins on a dark night in Detroit. The Crow , Shelly Webster (Sofia Shenas) and Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) are engaged to be married the next day on Devils Night, Halloween, the night of fires, vandalism, and crime. Unfortunately that day never came for them. Shelly was raped and murdered for trying to get a petition to help rid the neighborhood of people that weren't contributing to society and that were making it worse. Eric was also killed. One year after their deaths, Eric came back to life as the crow to seek revenge for Shelly's death. The crow makes Eric somewhat invincible to getting hurt or killed while getting the justice that is deserved. The theme of this film seems to be revenge and justice. I feel the directors of this film, Daniel J. Schow and Alex Proyas, are trying to show that even in the darkest of times and bleakness of the night justice can prevail. One must fight to make it happen though. Although Draven was turned into the crow, he still had limitations to his invincibility. The crow followed Eric around the city and was there at the times that Tin-Tin, Fun Boy and T-Bird were brought to their final doom. If the crow was hurt Eric was inevitably hurt also. Justice doesn't always come easy and it's something we have to be willing to fight for. I'm personally attracted to this film for several reasons. One being the way justice is served, another being the love between Shelly and Eric. Eric loved her so much that he was willing to die for her and bring her death to justice; their love as to die for. This film also has a certain attraction to it because it is somewhat of a thriller. It keeps us on edge and captivated. The darkness and costumes bring a certain mysterious quality to it also. Brandon Lee's skills as an actor also bring an attraction to the film.",The Crow
504,toboe4,Very awesome!,10,28 February 2005,"I really love the late Brandon Lee in this movie and I find it very tragic that he was unable to continue his career. I really loved 'The Crow' because of its kind of unclear vision of good and evil. On one hand, Eric Draven is the good avenger getting justice on the druggies/gangsters, but then on the other hand, the way he does it has a slight insanity to it and he NEVER hands them over to the police. He kills them. So, the line between good & evil is there, but a bit less recognizable. For those who have read the graphic novel of 'The Crow,' (which I had the pleasure of reading) it is true to the book in most ways, and the changes that WERE made were minimal. For example, the comic showed that Eric and Shelly were killed on the side of the road after they had some car trouble, whereas in the movie, they were murdered in their apartment. That didn't really bother me at all, and even if you are a strictly by-the-book person, I think it should still be okay. I recommend this movie to anyone who can tolerate excessive cursing. ;)",The Crow

The music, the setting are all awesome. The cast is incredible and the fact that this movie is not one of the 250 greatest films as voted is a real downer. In my eyes this movie is one of the greatest movies of our generation. Brandon Lee is incredible in this movie. The only cheesy part of this movie is when Eric Draven gets his memories back in the cop's apartment and shakes and falls to the ground. I believe that was just a tad overdone. Now the award for best scene is when Eric kills T-Bird and then throws the lighter on the ground igniting a fire that makes a picture of a crow. That is simply beautiful.",The Crow
507,CrowFan,A moving piece of cinematic excellence,10,30 April 2006,"The Crow is my all time favourite movie. Just last night I watched it for about the fifth time this week and every time I watch the film I learn something new about it and I can understand it better each and every time. The movie is excellent, the special effects at the start are a little below par, but this in no way affects my view on the rest of the movie.I was shocked to hear about the death of Brandon Lee when he was filming a flashback scene in the loft where his girlfriend (soon to be wife Shelley in the film) and himself were murdered callously by 4 evil men under the orders of Top Dollar. I was saddened that he had died so early on in his career, because this film paved the way for an excellent future career. It was very coincidentally that he played the part of someone that was to be killed, then he had been accidentally killed by a faulty prop gun.There were two main scenes in the movie that really moved me. The one where he comes out of the grave screaming because he has realised what has happened to him and the other being where he enters the loft where he and his girlfriend were killed only to be reminded of what had happened to him with the aid of moving flashbacks. No other movie has ever done this to me before and a great deal of empathy is needed for Eric and Shelley (the two victims). And as Brandon once started in his final interview no compassion is needed toward the culprits and how they finally meet their demise.The cast is excellent and without a doubt no other person for each role would be suitable other than what was set. The cast was chosen to perfection. The screenplay and how the background sound is often heard at very certain parts of the film is also brilliant. It is a film that I am proud to have in my collection and I am sure that you would love the film if you are into a love story.Alex Proyas (the director of the film) is notorious for the darkness in his films and in this it doesn't go a miss. But things soon brighten up and happiness is restored when Brandon gains revenge for their deaths. There is also a small amount of dark comedy in the film coming both from Eric (when he returns from the dead) and from the culprits which Inflict badly upon Eric.The flashback scenes are especially moving, when you see what life was like for both Eric and Shelley together before they were taken away so suddenly. Life was perfect, and they were about to be married but one thing that we learn from this movie amongst other things as that the majority of us think of life everyday as being trivial. The film also is focused on a girl (Sarah) a friend of Shelley and Eric whose mum is friendly with one of the culprits of Eric and his girlfriends demise. Eric soon sets the mother on the right path and the screen brightens up when we see this happening.Overall the movie is excellent 10/10 overall. The cast overall 10/10 and my recommendation for this film if you haven't yet watched: 10/10.",The Crow
508,ElphabaTheWickedWitch,An absolutely beautiful film that everyone should see at least once.,10,3 July 2005,"This film is so amazing, I can't remember how many times I've seen it. You don't have to be interested in a particular genre of film to watch it, because there is something for everyone in this film. Romance, action, gory bits, humour, drama- you name it, The Crow has it. The tragic circumstances surrounding this film and Brandon Lee also add to it's allure.Basically, it's about a rock star named Eric Draven, his fiancée Shelley Webster and the little girl they take care of, Sarah. When a ruthless gang of thugs viciously murder both Eric and Shelley on the night before their wedding, Eric comes back from the grave to avenge his fiancée's death by going after each member of the gang that killed her, and to say a final goodbye to Sarah.An extremely moving film that I would recommend to anyone who has a heart.",The Crow

510,farrokhbulsara63,......wow,10,21 May 2005,"i just watched the movie today, and i already want to go out and buy the movie. i heard of the movie, and thought it was only something Gothic people watched, but everyone should watch this movie. i thought his love for her was just amazing, that even when he died, he came back to avenge her death, probably more than his own. the scenery was just amazing, and the ways he killed people was awesome. everything was just awesome.i recommend this movie for those interested in a great Gothic style love story. if brandon lee was still alive, he would have given johnny depp a run for his money.",The Crow
511,dravencage,My thoughts,10,10 June 2005,"I have watched this film many, many times and it always captivates me....with it's story of love and loss, revenge and betrayal......the idea that love can conquer all, even death is a strong one, and in this movie it is handled with great gravitas.Alex Proyas (as he also showed with Dark City) has a visual knack for creating a dark world, and the world of the Crow is Detroit, but it could be anywhere.......The villains are never too OTT and the poignant moments between Sarah and Eric are handled well.The real stand out for me though, is Brandon Lee's performance, and it still fills me with sadness to know, that his breakout role, was his last.RIP Brandon...The Crow is a fitting epitaph for you.DC",The Crow
512,yusandra79,The only thing...,10,21 June 2005,"The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it's dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre's in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: ""Can't rain all the time"" By the way the soundtrack's are awesome, The Cure's best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..",The Crow
513,2548ir,One of the best,9,13 January 2018,I wish Brandon Lee were still alive to play in more gold movies like this.,The Crow
514,greeneyed_blackpanther,bloody awesome,10,3 July 2005,"I really love the good guy versus the bad guy movies and this would have to be the best one. Even though i was only 4 when it was made it is still one of my favorite movies and has been for 3 years. the script was excellent and i always quote lines from the movie. out of all the crow movies i have seen this one is the only one which can stick with the story and never leave you bored. i love how all the crow movies are always shot at night time and everything is dark, it adds real character to the movie and all its aspects. even though its really sad that Brandon lee dies while making the movie i am pretty sure he would of been proud of it because i don't know anyone else who could of played his character any better and when i hear someone say something about the crow i can always see Brandon face in my mind.",The Crow
515,bigredmachine63,A Great Movie,9,18 March 2007,"Vigilante movies have been around for God knows how long. The idea of vengeance against those that do us wrong is a driving force in cinema. But most of the time we get a horribly predictable movie that follows a set formula. And then there is The Crow. In its own, stylized way, The Crow puts to rest all those other vigilante movies, and creates a new form, one that leaves the viewer pleased, and never disappoints.Since the first time I saw this movie, which was about the time The Crow: City of Angels was released into the theaters, I was fascinated by the look of this ""Gothic tale of unrequited love and the scorn of a soul burdened by the torment of great loss."" I had only seen the movie once, on HBO, but fell in love with the story. I never really got around to renting it, but if I saw it on the program schedule, I would set time aside to watch it.Now that I am older, and I own the first three (The Crow, The Crow: City of Angels, The Crow: Salvation) I have been able to view it and truly grasp the masterpiece in its entire form. From the soundtrack, to the pop culture references, and even the references in pop culture. It shows the true greatness of comics that become great movies (Sin City and Hellboy being two others.) The story and the acting are terrific and the all out vengeful nature of Eric Dravin is what captures my attention the most.Let's not forget the plethora of colorful characters with the ""jolly pirate nicknames."" From Tin-Tin to T-Bird, Skank to Funboy, and (my personal favorite) Top Dollar. The charismatic villains and the even more charismatic hero (anti-hero to be exact) truly shine in this masterpiece.However, this movie is also very tragic. It would be the last movie Brandon Lee would ever make. He was killed in an accident while filming. Like his character, he was to be wed to his fiancé in just three weeks after filming was to be wrapped up. He follows the mysterious death of his father, the martial arts legend Bruce Lee.All tragedies aside, one of the greatest movies ever made. Followed by an ""all right"" sequel and then two more, ""less than mediocre"" sequels after that, the original stands true. The best ""Crow"" movie out there. The original, the best, The Crow.",The Crow
516,darkangelghoul,A crow resurrects a dead rock star and leads him to the killers who murder him and his fiancé,10,12 July 2005,"Right after it was over I could not believe but that was the greatest movie I ever seen! Brandon Lee's final movie was truly and huge hit, and his acting really touched my heart (corny, but true). The story is particularly for teen Goths--as a favorite I say, so for people who don't like strong violence I suggest to keep away cause this movie is pretty scary, although I found it very dramatic. There really are some sad scenes that really put the viewer away from the killing-action, and I have to say the soundtrack is super, I had to buy it for myself, songs like from the Cure and Nine Inch Nails. But as i said a little earlier, I would recommend this movie to viewers who just want o see a good movie, loves Gothic and horror-action type films(like let's say Batman), then this movie is for you. But whoever, the movie really let me down a bit at the end, and just to say this was Brandon Lee's final movie. Rest in peace but check it out first.",The Crow

Actually not even worth to comment. For kids that want to get even, and ""grown ups"" that never did. Grow up for gods sake!",The Crow
518,smokeymicpotsbestfriend,Great Movie,10,30 October 2005,"I highly recommend this movie, it is my all time favorite movie, it is too bad that Brendan Lee did die making this movie from an accidental backfire from his gun, but it was surely his best movie. It contains drama, action and emotion and it is great. After Brenden Lee and his girlfriend are murdered, a crow resurrects him and he is lurking for revenge from devils night, Halloween. As Brendan goes from person to person who all assisted the murder of him and his girlfriend, he grows the need for blood and revenge bigger and bigger by each kill. It has come to a point where Brenden has lost his invulnerability and he can now feel pain. As he takes out the group in the church with little remorse and nothing holing him back, there is one more person, and now he has to save a child as well (no names, don't want to spoil to much, I highly recommend a viewing of this film). As he saves the child and kills his nemesis, he meets up with his former girlfriend while returning back to the graveyard and it is really a sad ending. BUT THIS IS ENOUGH, GO OUT THERE AND SEE THE MOVIE.",The Crow
519,chrisbentley-1,"My Son, Draven",10,5 September 2005,"Not only did I love the movie, I recited quotes from it for years, I also named my son Draven Eric Bentley (Eric is actually my and my father's middle name and would have been my son's regardless of the first name) who was born Feb 5, 2005. 11 years after ""The Crow"". I hope to have a Eric Draven, Crow figurine for my son to keep for a long time. Because of the violence, drugs, and allusions to sex, it will be a long time before Draven Eric Bentley actually gets to see the movie. The plot and idea of the storyline itself is the best part of ""The Crow"", Brandon Lee's acting and portrayal of the dark protagonist is by far the second best part of this movie. I definitely give ""The Crow"" a 10/10. A must see.",The Crow
520,punkersmileysayz,Was great then and still is now...,10,5 September 2019,"This movie captivated me both as a youngster and now as an adult, and its a timeless (albeit cult) flick. It's got everything; a little fantasy, some action, romance in the form of vengeance, and the necessary good guys vs bad guys needed in any good story. The special effects are still decent after so many years, the acting is spot on for what each character needed, and the cinematic quality for me captures a nostalgic look at the 90's goth/rock culture. I'd also argue that this movie is what sparked the ""Hot Topic"" fashion fads that were seen throughout the late 90's and early 2000's. Clearly people identified and/or loved this movie.",The Crow
521,pinkcat94,Could have been great,5,13 November 2005,"The Crow had all the makings a of a brilliant, unforgettable movie: A great lead actor, a great concept, and a brilliant soundtrack, but somewhere along the way, it went horribly wrong.The original concept for the film (a victim rising from the grave to wreak hideous revenge on those who wronged him), had it been stuck to, would have given this movie the potential to be unforgettable. If they had stuck to it, and not heavily dragged out the storyline, I would have found the film far more captivating. It was also tainted by the hideous genre of 90's Action Films, which somehow infected the story, embellishing what could have been a good ending, with explosions and cheap stunts.Had this been made in a different time, or had a different script/story writer it could have been brilliant. Its still a great movie though, and because I so desperately want to love it, I can ignore the slander that has infected the amazing storyline! All in all...five out of ten",The Crow
522,Captain_CRAZY,An incredible gem of a movie!,10,4 January 2016,"Sometimes a movie comes along that is just perfect. To me this is one of those movies. It has a good story, great characters portrayed by excellent actors and most importantly; heart and soul in bucket loads. Do not shy away thinking it is just another cult film because of the tragic circumstances of Brandon Lee's death during filming. One overlooked tragedy is the aftermath for the young actress Rochelle Davis who portrayed Sarah. Devastated by her friends death she left the movie business and what could have been a great career. I usually cannot stand child actors but she does an amazing job in this movie. As does all the other actors. Michael Wincott and David Patrick Kelly have their best villain roles in this film. Great visual effects, almost no cgi. They do not make them like this anymore.I love this movie.",The Crow
523,jamesy_wamesy,awesome,10,9 December 2005,"this film is truly amazing.it blows my mind and i think anyone is crazy to pull this film down.brandon's performance was spectacular.i have the 2disc DVD set and the comments he made just before his death were i feel so true and honest and i believe he did put his soul into the making of this film.although it is fiction i think we can all take a lesson from this film as it makes you appreciate life on a different level. would recommend anyone to see this piece of genius production and to me it is so much more than that, as I'm sure many will agree.this film truly has opened my eyes.its the kind of film that makes you want to be part of and that is what is so magical about it.i have now watched this film over a hundred times and every time is like the first to me.",The Crow
524,mcph727,Good for a Last Picture from Brandon Lee,7,7 January 2006,"I see that the movie shows a release in 1994, but I saw the ""The Crow"" in New Jersey (USA) the summer of 1993. Where and when did ""The Crow"" come out if it was originally released (by the official IMDb date) in 1994? Why would it sit on the shelf for almost a year?It has become a cult-classic but still has not only dark humor but an estrange ending. The love story was powerful along with his friendship with the homeless little girl. I recommend it to others that want to see Brandon Lee in the movies as one of his best.""The Crow"" sequels sucked very much. Again Hollywood trying to capitalize on a good original screwing up those that follow.",The Crow
525,armands_briedis,A dark gem,10,27 April 2018,"I think one my favourite movies of all time will always be The Crow. I was 10 the first time I saw it and I still watch it sometimes. It's one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen and they pulled it off more than 20 years ago without all the CGI technology we have today. It's a work of art in every frame. Story wise it's full of pain and loss, and the movie captures it so well that it always puzzles me how they could make such a dark and depressing story so beautiful and exciting at the same time. And then there's Brandon Lee - the actor of the main character who got accidentally killed on the set by a malfunctioning firearm. This fact alone makes the movie even more interesting as the movie itself questions the nature of death. This movie influenced me in such a way that I started to appreciate the beauty of all dark and scary things we experience. Most people usually look away when experiencing something negative, but I am always driven to understand it and appreciate it if nothing can be done about it. It's very interesting how art can change our personalities and the things we like. The Crow is the suppressed rage of poets and artists everywhere burning their oppressors on a dark wind-swept night and it's one of those movies that got many people interested in the goth culture and elevated it into a whole new level of popularity. At its heart it is a simple revenge movie; a soul drawn back to a corrupt living world to punish those that killed him and his fiance, but the way it's portrayed sets it apart from similar movies. It's a dark journey in a post-industrial hell-scape in search of those who wronged him. If you're looking for something dark and beautiful, this is it.",The Crow
526,info-72859,Cult Classic will forever mark an epic moment in film..,10,4 November 2020,"This film's dark love story of revenge takes you on a self exploration deep into the realm where grief meets rage.

527,daisieismorbid,The best movie!,10,9 February 2006,"I truly enjoyed this movie! Although the main character died in real life, this movie was well written and well thought out.The idea of someone you loved dying in such a violent way then you returning from the dead to avenge that wrong is wonderful.The power of love can do many things. Love that is true will live forever. Through life and on into death. Eric shows his love so openly that it almost makes you feel the pain of loss.The acting was well done and proves that even a ""dark comic"" can be made into a really great film. A truly wonderful movie!",The Crow
528,tomwolf25,My View Of The Crow,9,22 March 2006,"I have seen this movie many times and still I can not get enough of it. Yes, this shows the darker side to life, but the message is clear. DON'T MESS WITH LOVE! I wish Brandon Lee hadn't died and he was able to make more (yes, I have see the sequel but it is not the same without Brandon Lee). To say that this movie is bad is saying nothing is right within the world. Life and Love will always be connected no matter what anyone tries to do. Sarah was also a very good character to add, and I liked how no matter what was done, their was always a decent officer of the law. I liked the way each victim was taken care of based on their life. Also, by The Crow letting Darla live, he showed that he really was not a bad guy, just someone out for revenge to those that almost destroyed and them alone.",The Crow
529,gothicsurfer,The Crow,10,27 March 2006,"The Crow is a very dark romantic film, the character of Eric Draven is very demanding and yet Brandon Lee manages to play with a believable passion. The film is a must see for anyone esp if you a fan of underworld and the matrix. After watching this you can see why thousands of teenagers paint their faces white and call themselves Eric!!!Its about a beautiful couple - Eric and Shelley who get murdered. Eric Draven comes back from the dead to avenge their deaths and the only way he can do this is by a series of flash backs that haunt him. With the help form a young girl who he and Sheeley were friends with and a police man who looked after the case first time around.",The Crow
