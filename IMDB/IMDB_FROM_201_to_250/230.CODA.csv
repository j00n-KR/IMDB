0,ferguson-6,dream a little dream,8,11 August 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.Emilia Jones (HIGH-RISE, 2015) stars as Ruby, and we first see her slinging fish on the boat with her father Frank (Troy Kutsor) and brother Leo (newcomer Daniel Durant). Ruby belts out songs while the two men handle their duties, unaware of the lovely melodies filling the air. At home, the dinner table conversation is handled through ASL (American Sign Language) with mom/wife Jackie (Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, 1986) leading the way.At school, Ruby is an outcast due to her clothes, the lingering aroma of fish, and her ""weird"" family. With a silent crush on Miles (Ferdio Walsh-Peelo from the excellent SING STREET, 2016), Ruby signs up for choir, but freezes during the audition. The choir director, Bernardo (roll the r's) Villalobos, is played energetically and colorfully by Eugenio Derbez (OVERBOARD, 2018), and he offers encouragement to Ruby - mostly because she has a beautiful singing voice. Bernardo explains how her singing voice offers a path to college, something she's never before considered due to family responsibilities.There is a lot going on in this film from writer-director Sian Heder (TALLULAH, 2016). It's obviously adapted from the 2014 French film LA FAMILLE BELIER, and plays as a mainstream crowd-pleaser, when it just as easily could have been a deep cut indie film. Ms. Heder's approach means a larger viewing audience, though there are elements we wish had been further explored. The teen romance never really clicks, and there are hints that Bernardo's story holds more levels than we get. However, the Rossi family dynamics are quite something to behold. Father Frank wears his emotions on his sleeve. Sometimes those emotions are angry and bitter, while other times quite comical or even horny (for his wife). Brother Leo wants desperately to lead the family business towards prosperity. He has ideas for growth, but is frustrated being dependent on Ruby as a conduit to the community.Mother Jackie and Ruby have a typical mother-teenage daughter relationship. The mother wants status quo where the daughter remains an integral part of the family, while the daughter wants her mom to acknowledge the dreams for a different life - one that capitalizes on her talents. When Jackie questions her daughter on her singing, she does so in the most hurtful way possible (brilliant writing). And yet, when mom recounts Ruby's birth, the love is as clear as the disconnect ... and likely to draw a tear or two. Filmmaker Hader serves up numerous strong scenes, but two really stood out for this viewer. First, when Ruby is singing on stage, we ""hear"" what the parents hear, and their pride is obvious. The second occurs when dad asks Ruby to sing for him as they are perched on the backend of the car. It's phenomenal acting by Kutsor, and further clarifies a lifelong father-daughter bond ... and the first time he fully comprehends her talent. All four leads give strong performances, and it's a star-making performance from Ms. Jones (think a young Saoirse Ronan).Apple paid a record-breaking $25 million for the film's rights at Sundance, and the mainstream appeal of this family drama sprinkled with comedy and life messages is indisputable. So while my preference would have been more focus on the 'outsider' aspect of the Rossi family in the community, it's easy to see why this choice was made. It's an entertaining film that will likely land on many year-end ""Best"" lists. Maybe even mine.Streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13, 2021.",CODA
1,deloudelouvain,Ifyou liked La Famille Bélier you will like this one as well.,7,31 October 2021,"The story of Coda is a bit cliché. Just by reading the ingredients you can already see where this movie is going. So no real surprises in Coda, you will exactly know the outcome way long before the ending. That said it's still an enjoyable movie to watch. A little bit emotional sometimes, which is almost normal as you feel compassion for the deaf people and certainly for the daughter that has a lot on her plate. Maybe a bit too much singing in my opinion but that's just because I'm not a big fan of singing in movies unless it's the music that I like but that's not likely to happen given my taste of music. Coda is predictable but it doesn't really matter as the acting is really good and that from the whole cast. Certainly worth a watch.",CODA

3,Thanos_Alfie,Beautiful...,8,25 October 2021,"""CODA"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a young woman living and helping her deaf family. She wants to study music in the university but she also wants to continue helping their family's fishing business. She is between these two ways and she has only one choice to make.Many people compare this movie with ""La famille Bélier"" of 2014 but there are some difference between them and they are not the same. I found ""CODA"" (CODA means Child Of Deaf Adults) beautiful and I enjoyed it very much because it had a nice, interesting plot addressing many important and unsolved subjects that society has to deal with as soon as possible. The direction which was made by Sian Heder presented very well these subjects in a very clever way combinig comedy with drama, and also made them understood very clear from the audience. The interpretation of Emilia Jones who played as Ruby Rossi was simply outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Troy Kotsur's who played as Frank Rossi, Daniel Durant's who played as Leo Rossi and Amy Forsyth's who played as Gertie. Finally, I have to say that ""CODA"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because you will enjoy it but you will learn something from it, too.",CODA

6,paul-allaer,"Delightful US remake of the French film ""La Famille Belier""",8,31 August 2021,"As ""CODA"" (2012 release; 111 min.) opens, we are introduced to Ruby, a CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), as she is working with her dad and her brother on a fisher's boat just outside of Gloucester, MA. Ruby is a HS senior and on a whim, she decides to sign up for the choir class simply because she loves singing. At the very first choir orientation session, the choir master asks everyone in the class to come forward and sing ""Happy Birthday To You"" so that he can classify the voice (alt/soprano, etc.) When it's Ruby's turn, she panics and runs out of the class room... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film,. But to tell you more of the plot should spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the US remake of a 2014 film from France called ""La Famille Belier"", which was a hit both critically and at the box office. I've not seen it, and so I judge ""CODA"" as a standalone. Strictly going by what I saw on the movie screen, I have nothing but great things to say about it. ""CODA"" is directed by Sian Heder, best known for having written seasons 1-3 of ""Orange Is the New Black"". Here she brings some sharp observations on what it's like being deaf in today's world, and obviously it ain't easy. The film also explores the economic struggles for a community like Gloucester, and in particular its (mostly mom-and-pop) fishing industry. Last but not least the film smartly balances on the one hand the strong family ties in the Rossi family, and on the other hand Ruby's desire to branch out into the world. Of course none of this would matter if the acting lacks, but instead the acting is tops, period. Marlee Latin and 2 other deaf actors play Ruby's parents and brother. And then there is the role of Rubi, played by up-and-coming British actress Emilia Jones. She is nothing short of brilliant, and surely we haven't seen the last of her, on the contrary.""CODA"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate acclaim, and Apple+ immediately snapped it up for a Sundance record #25 million. The movie was released on Apple+ and also in select theaters a few weeks ago, and I finally had a chance to see it at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday early evening where I saw this at was not attended well (exactly 5 people, including myself). Regardless, if you are in the mood for a wonderful and moving family comedy-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",CODA
7,JoBloTheMovieCritic,CODA,6,15 August 2021,"6/10 - while I often find myself enjoying movies that are able to highlight communities that do not often get their fair share of time in the spotlight (in this case, children of deaf adults and the deaf community as a whole), but this story failed to grip me the way it seems to have other viewers.",CODA

12,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Best film I have seen this summer! (2021),10,14 August 2021,"This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters.

An emotional powerhouse.",CODA
15,AhmedSpielberg99,Charming and sincere!,8,20 August 2021,"Ever since premiering at Sundance film festival to rave reviews, I've been looking forward to CODA but have always kept my expectations in check. CODA is a coming-of-age story sees Ruby (played by Emilia Jones in one of the best performances this year), a girl with a penchant for singing, grappling with chasing her dreams while helping her deaf family which she happens to be the only hearing member in. The story is nothing special, and the film itself is anything but groundbreaking. Rather, it's one that thrives off of its simplicity from which it yields enriching subtlety.For starters, the family dynamic is priceless. Whether they're squabbling or having a laugh, their interactions with each other are like quickfire repartees that have you transfixed while at play, and are sunk in as soon as they end. The humour in this movie originally generates either from how crude and blunt Ruby's family is (more on that later) or from the complexity of non-verbal communication. Yet, the movie never looks down at deaf people or even regards them patronizingly, and each time we spend some moments with the family makes this more and more evident. Does the same go for the family itself and each member of it? And are they perfectly imperfect as they seem? Not really.As the family has its own identity, each character has its own individual personality and unique mannerisms, too. And it's here where we get to see through the cracks in each one of them. Ruby is the one who communicates with them and the sign-language interpreter and mediator between them and the townspeople. Ironically, none of her family members is able to properly communicate their feelings to Ruby herself, the thing that made her dilemma more and more perplexing and befuddling.Ruby's brother, Leo (Daniel Durant), grows tired of people regarding him and his parents as 'disabled'. He feels that he's seen as helpless and ""freak"" - as one once called him before getting into a bar brawl. That feeling is further amplified when he realises how much they rely on his sister to be their connection to the outside world. As a consequence, he puts the blame on Ruby because he feels that he lives under her sister's shadow, let alone she's his younger sibling. In his heart, however, he loves his sister dearly. And after knowing of her talent, he becomes worried her potential might go to waste as a result of staying with them forever instead of pursuing her passion.As for the mother, Jackie (Marlee Matlin), things are much more complicated. She bans Ruby from listening to music while they're at the table because that's 'rude' since it's not something ""(they) all can do together,"" and she's frustrated at learning she joined the school choir. Later on, she's desperate to do anything to stop her from heading off to the music school because that way they'd lose their only 'interpreter' they can't afford to keep their fishing business afloat. Thus, her actions and intentions seem to be solely based on the family's business' interests with a total disregard to Ruby's. She comes across as exploitative, and also as someone who clearly sees deafness as a deficiency that the whole family must suffer from. That said, it's revealed that all that has something to do with her past, which I'm not going to spoil but it shows how much Jackie's actually concerned about her relationship with her daughter.However, it's not only about her family, as Ruby herself has her own internal conflict and restrictions that she's built for herself - unwillingly, of course. On the face of it, she's ashamed of her family because of how shamelessly frank they are, especially her father (Troy Kotsur), who legitimately got Ruby in some awkwardly embarrassing situations. On closer inspection, though, we see she's learned to adopt a new persona at school over the years because 'sounding like a deaf person' made her classmates make fun of her. Unfortunately, she learned to be normal by being different, only to become diffident. The whole thing about her inspiring, eccentric music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) telling her that her problem is that she's ""holding her voice,"" as though she's suppressing it, is a metaphor for her true self and identity she's been nearly stripped of unconsciously, whether because she's confined to her familial obligation or to avoid feelings of inadequacy and mortification.""The stars here, they don't look as good as they do on the water.""
The second half of CODA is undeniably the weakest. As I mentioned earlier, the story itself is pretty formulaic, with its ups and downs, romantic storyline that slipped into cliché territory before even we're halfway through, and 'too-good-to-be-true' moments by the end. Nevertheless, CODA overflows with emotional beats that are bound to melt even the stony hearts, which the second half, in particular, is replete with. I mean, I almost teared up in three scenes! If that doesn't eclipse its shortcomings I don't know what does. It's not a film about hearing or deafness per se, but rather about the expression of inner feelings suppressed by circumstances, and by doing so it sets itself apart from your conventional inspirational films about finding your voice and following your dreams, despite conforming to their exact same formula. Sweet, tender and earnest, CODA is a crowd-pleaser and one of the biggest surprises of the year.",CODA
16,Movi3DO,Sweet and beautiful,9,14 August 2021,"Oh yeah being deaf doesn't mean that you can't be horny.An Apple+ Original about a high school student who was the only hearing person in her family.I already love the movie when it started out. There were many funny and clever jokes mostly from the main character's deaf parents that showed the tight relationship in the family. I was consistently entertained with what our main character had to go through because she was the only hearing person in her family.This led to the main conflict for our main character. The struggle between family responsibilities and one's hope and dream was a familiar theme that is explored many times before. However, the story created a new and unique situation that had me sympathized with not our main character, but also her family members. The family dynamics worked so well that the situation even more conflicting.Still, the movie had many sweet moments. The audition scene near the end was beautiful and got me emotional there. Also, Emilia Jones, who played the main girl Ruby, had a beautiful voice, and I loved every scene where she sang.As for problems, the progression was definitely a bit formulaic, but it didn't bother me much at all.Overall, a sweet, beautiful, and unique slice of life/coming of age story. 9/10.",CODA
17,tm-sheehan,A Small film that hits all the right notes,9,15 August 2021,"My Review - CODA
My Rating 9/10
The movie title CODA is an acronym for Child Of Deaf Adults which is the premise for this wonderful ""Indie film ""Independent films are produced by smaller production companies. They do not follow the same formula. As studio films.Instead, they vary in style and genre and usually have a production budget which is a fraction of the studio films in my opinion they often have more to say than many big budget Studio movies .Just imagine living in a family of four and being the only member of that family that can hear. Even in the most loving and supportive family like the Rossi family in ""CODA "" imagine the challenges faced as the daughter who can hear having to put your life aspirations and dreams on hold to take on the role of interpreter for your Mother, Father and Brother because they have no hearing at all.When the family's fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her fear of abandoning her parents.The movie is beautifully set in the seaside locations of Gloucester, Rockport and Boston in Massachusetts
CODA, premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2021, winning more awards than any film in Sundance history. It captivated audiences and prompted a bidding war between Netflix, Amazon, Searchlight and Apple which concluded in Apple paying a record breaking $25 million for world wide rights to the movie.CODA, written and directed by Sian Heder, is an English-language remake of the French-language film La Famille Bélier, which was released in 2014 and was successful at the French box office.Philippe Rousselet was one of the original film's producers, and he had the rights to do a remake. He and producer Patrick Wachsberger approached Sian Heder to direct a remake for a United States audience. Sian Heder said, ""They were interested in adapting the film, but they wanted someone to make it unique and take the premise from the original and, also, reinvent it.""
Well I haven't seen the La Famille Bélier yet but Sian Heder (take note Academy) has more than succeeded. Sian is another brilliant female Writer, Producer, Director who previous to CODA wrote and produced a critically acclaimed short film in 2006 ""Mother"" and help write and produce 20 episodes of the hit series ""Orange is the New Black.""
There have been 2 brilliant movies this year concerning the life experiences of characters who are profoundly hearing impaired or totally deaf .One was the superb film ""Sound of Metal"" about a heavy-metal drummer's life that is thrown into freefall when he begins to lose his hearing.CODA is a very different story I gave ""Sound of Metal"" and CODA both a 9/10 Rating because both films have characters that are real, vulnerable and totally convincing . Their life experiences interested me and opened up a world of complex difficulties that I can only imagine because I can hear and take it for granted so authentic movies about people with a disability like deafness or blindness I find fascinating and educational.Both Directors of these films use a clever and dramatic technique for a few minutes that allows the movie audience to do just that.In ""Sound of Metal"" when the drummer Rubin Stone is walking a street for the first time with his Cochlear implants we hear what he hears just distorted loud sounds that are more disturbing than no sound at all.In CODA when Ruby's family attend their daughter Ruby's Concert in which she is performing a duet they can only watch the reactions of the audience to something they cant experience themselves .The soundtrack is silent in part of the song to show their reactions to the movie its one of the many moving scenes in this film . Another for me was when Ruby's Dad Frank asks her to sing for him only and gently touches his daughters threat to feel the vibrations of her beautiful voice.Emilia Jones the talented 19 year old daughter of famous Welsh singer Aled Jones does have a beautiful voice and it's a joy to hear her version of the Joni Mitchell classic song "" Both Sides Now ""
Emilia Jones impressed me greatly in her role as Ruby Rossi when she filmed CODA she was only 17 or 18 years old .I predict she will become a major Cinema Star in the future she has already been nominated for a BAFTA British Academy Award for her role in the series ""Locke & Key."" which was filmed for Netflix after CODA it also looks very impressive .For her role in CODA, Emilia had to spend nine months learning American Sign Language, have singing lessons and learn how to operate a professional fishing trawler.All the characters in this movie interested me 1987 Oscar Winner Marlee Matlin is perfect as Jackie Rossi the strong willed but loving matriarch of the family .Marlee Matlin was born deaf as was Troy Kotsur who plays Ruby's craggy weather beaten seafaring but very sensitive and loving Father Frank Rossi.Daniel Durant cast as Ruby's brother was born to deaf parents and went to the Minnesota State Academy for the Deaf in Faribault, Minnesota, where he got involved with theater. He's great as the eldest son who feels he's living in the shadow of his talented sister because of his family's dependence on her hearing.Another delightful performance from John Fiore as Tony Salgado the High School music teacher who sees great promise in Ruby and encourages her to think of a life outside her family .There are so many highlights in CODA it's an uplifting film as one reviewer noted ""CODA"" is a small movie that hits all the right notes it's a beautiful film.",CODA

19,msbreviews,Sundance 2021: CODA might very well end up as my favorite film of the festival and one of the best movies of the year!,9,30 January 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I know Sundance is one of those festivals that carry dozens of impressive, impactful films from writer-directors that really throw themselves into the art of filmmaking and storytelling. I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn't recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I'd save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival.CODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Siân Heder, and after this session, I can't wait to see what she did so far and what she's going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today's society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap.As the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of ""limitation"" doesn't automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don't love each other as much or more than the so-called ""normal"" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film's central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline.In fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I'm delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn't just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult.However, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can't remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason.A final praise to Paula Huidobro's visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie's subtle yet efficient score and who I'm guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job.CODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021's edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it's available worldwide. Siân Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.Rating: A",CODA
20,jp_91,A lovely masterpiece!,10,26 September 2021,"""CODA"" is an endearing and moving story about the reality of deaf parents and their hearing children, told from the perspective of the teenage daughter.

22,Alexander_Blanchett,Delightful coming of age story,8,14 August 2021,"Touching coming of age story told out of an unusual perspective.The film perfectly describes the inner feelings of a girl who wants to follow her on dream and thus struggles to leave behind her family responsibilities.Its a heartwarming but also has many funny moments that play out at the right time and right tone which makes it very natural.You can blame it for being a bit cliched at times but life is often full of cliches and its the magic to play around with it and I think in this way the film by Sian Heder successes.Another reason why this is as beloved as it is, is the wonderfully picked cast. Its so far the best ensemble performance I have seen this year.It started with Emilia Jones who is in a career defining performance. She is just wonderful and so natural. Its not an easy role. Finding the right tone around the character and in addition with some physical challenges really makes it a treasure of a performance. The supporting cast is not lesser good. The most outstanding role, and hopefully he will be the Paul Raci of next Oscar season, is Troy Kotsur who does magic with the role of the father. Such a well balanced and beautiful performance. Such a great character, and not only on paper. He adds so much to it. Marlee Matlin is also good in the role of the mother and its always beautiful to see her on screen.

23,cliftonofun,Formulaic (and still fantastic),7,29 August 2021,"We have all watched those movies that just follow the formula and paint by numbers. That is this movie. The high school dramas and family dynamics and unrealistic teachers combine for the perfect crescendo of emotion. And it works anyway.

24,trinaboice,You're definitely going to cry,9,1 August 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
As a CODA (child of deaf adults), Ruby is the only hearing person in her home. When she discovers a passion for singing, Ruby must choose between family fishing business obligations and her dreams to pursue music. After the film won the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award winner at the Sundance Film Festival, Apple bought the distribution rights to it for $25 million, the largest sum at the time.CODA stands for ""Child of Deaf Adults"". The film is written and directed by Sian Heder. It has nothing to do with the 2020 movie also called Coda. This is an English-language remake of the 2014 French-language film called The Belier Family / La Famille Bélier - English Subtitles. It was filmed in Gloucester, Massachusetts.THINGS I LIKED:
Emilia Jones is a revelation. She acts, signs, and sings beautifully.Eugenio Derbez plays the passionate choir director. He's hilarious in everything he does, but he also shows a dramatic flair in his role since the film is more serious than a true comedy.I remember when Marlee Matlin first took Hollywood by storm when she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Children of a Lesser God, the only deaf actress to win the award. She has been deaf since she was a little girl.Actors Troy Kotsur and Daniel Durant are both deaf in real life.It's really powerful when you can't hear any sound and you get to experience what it might be like to be deaf. One of my nieces married a deaf man. Many members of my extended family, including myself, have been trying to learn sign language.There are some truly touching moments that made my eyes fill with tears several times. Very sweet.I like the title because it instantly intrigues you and you want to know what it's all about.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The story is sweet and touching and yet there is a lot of crude content that makes it inappropriate for family viewing, which is such a shame because there are some really great messages in the movie.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity - both spoken verbally and in sign language
Teenage girls talk about hooking up with guys.Adults talk about jock itch
You see a married couple doing it in bed (with clothes on)
The dad smokes marijuana.Men drink alcohol in a bar and get in a brawl.An underage teenager works as a bartender and explains that she can because none of the men there know how to count to 21.A lot of crude conversations and gestures.There's a lot of sign language spoken, obviously, so you have to read a lot of subtitles.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",CODA
25,latinfineart,A gorgeous film with great power,9,23 September 2021,"This is a really wonderful film about a fairly deep subject. I've always found sign language to be beautiful and poetic and fascinating, and this movie really does a good job of exploring the culture, the limitations, the bonds and what it's like to be in that world.It's a great story, very very well-written, beautifully acted, with pitch perfect direction, excellent cinematography a great score. And some beautiful voices.I really loved this film.",CODA
26,sweidman-28016,A Delightful Movie For All,8,29 January 2021,"As the opening for Sundance, CODA gave us a delightful story of a hearing child in a deaf family. She finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her family's reliance on her to be their connection to the outside world. I would like to say how much of a crowd pleaser this is. All of the reviews have come back positive saying this is the best opener since Whiplash. The performances are good all around. What got to me most is the family dynamic. It's something really heart-warming to watch that put a smile on my face the whole time. The comedy landed well throughout. The same goes for the drama. Sian Heder is a good director and we see the heart put into the movie. The story is where some of my issues came from. It follows a typical storyline that we've seen before in movies geared toward teens. It became predictable along the way and some of the scenes felt too good to be true. But I understand this isn't meant to be something to breakdown and analyze. All in all, this is meant to make us feel good and that's exactly what it did. I look forward to rewatching this again in the future.",CODA
27,Dragonborn64,A Typical Heart string Puller,7,14 August 2021,A very enjoyable movie though not the earth shattererer I've been reading about. The lead actress gives a very good performance but the trials and tribulations are tried and true stuff. I liked it very much but there's nothing new here.,CODA
28,ofumalow,Same old song,5,16 August 2021,"I can see why many people like this a lot, as it's a well-crafted ""crowdpleaser"" on a subject that hasn't been dealt with a lot outside documentaries. But despite wanting to like it, I almost immediately found it disappointingly formulaic and pandering, too much like an ""After School Special"" in simplistic narrative conflicts and solutions. Why is the deaf family so socially isolated when they've lived in this town their entire lives (and even generations before that)? Why is the over-the-top music teacher played like some ""flaming"" gay stereotype, but then there are murky suggestions that he's got a (never-seen) child and wife? Why does the choir sing vanilla versions of 1960s soul hits rather than what those kids would actually be performing (or listening to)? These all felt like cute contrivances that didn't bear any scrutiny. I'll admit I generally don't like the kind of singing showcased here that is (as the teacher says at one point, in a line the filmmakers presumably didn't mean to be broadly applicable) of a ""Watched too many episodes of 'Glee'"" type, all imitative, facile showiness. But the film as a whole just felt inorganic, with the cultural differences, economic problems, and other major themes handled without any nuance, in either broad comedy or blunt melodrama. I don't mind sentimentality, but this movie was too artificial in overly familiar ways to move me. (I wonder if the original French film was less on-the-nose.) Watching it was a little like reading a book you've been told is a Pulitzer frontrunner, only to quickly determine that it's more like a well-intentioned, professionally executed but stock YA novel, complete with a Prince Charming and all sorts of little life lessons learned on cue.",CODA
29,daisukereds,"""Move me like the Tide""",8,29 August 2021,"There's little else to say when a movie simply nails the sentimental feelings that wants to transmit to its audience.It's a very local movie with few locations, but that feeling of being ""cramped"" ties in wonderfully with the theme of a family that has grown to depend on a member. Emilia Jones was given a role in which she exceled as the lead, making the movie so much better for it. She wants to sing, while also thinking about the sacrifice she would make for the people she loves by not leaving them. But that sentiment goes both ways, and ""freeing a bird from it's cage"" is also love. It's a family drama with excellent song choices as well as execution and presentation.And I may be used to seeing the silly side of Eugenio Derbez, but as a supporting pillar of a student that wants to just sing, he does an excellent job! The rest of the Cast also does a great job. All the interactions are excellent! And the story may be simple, straightforward and predictable like most movies like these often are.. It's the message and the way that it is said that differentiates them from the rest.It is definitely worth watching if you like to choke up a bit, and would recommend it any time.",CODA

director: Sian Heder
starring: Emilia Jones, Marlee Matlin, Troy Kutser, Daniel Durant, Amy Forsyth, Ferdia Walsh Peelo, Eugenio Derbez.As a CODA (child of deaf adults) Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the only hearing person in her deaf family. When the families fishing business is threatened, Ruby finds herself torn between pursuing her love for music and her fear of abandoning her parents. Wow what a truly moving and incredible film, I have so many amazing things to talk about here.My first few positives would be the amazing cinematography. The charming tone and humour. Excellent chemistry and performances from the cast. As well as the deep themes and excellent representation. This film was visually amazing. Not for its creative shots but for its beautiful simplicity, with long shots really highlighting the beautiful set locations of the film. The film had such a charming tone as well especially with its humour. None of it felt forced and it came across authentically, the family's interactions were so heartfelt and charming, and the awkward situations with Ruby's parents and Ruby and her brother offered a lot of great comedic moments. The whole family had such fantastic chemistry with each other, and it made the film seem so genuine and much more fun to watch. The whole cast also delivered excellent performances here. Everyone executed passionate, charismatic, and powerful performances showing a lot of versatility, specifically with Emilia Jones who was insanely impressive here. The themes that this film touched upon was also very moving. It tackled anxiety, fear of abandonment, responsibility, and the difficulties of having a disability so well and in so much depth it was amazing to watch. It was written so well and was often really moving to see. The representation for the deaf community this film gave was also amazing. It truly was done in a genuine and authentic way, highlighting the struggles the deaf community face, but also highlighting how they adapt and can live a normal life.My next few positives would be the soundtrack and music elements, the great character conflict and depth. As well as balance to the conflict. As well as the likeable main character and strong supporting cast with unique storytelling. The film did a really good job with its music elements. The Soundtrack was fun and Ruby or shall I say Emilia Jones had a beautiful voice and it was amazing to see her grow in confidence with her voice as the film developed. Ruby as a character was also just extremely likeable. I really connected to her character with her anxiety and social awkwardness, she got so used to people making fun of her due to her family it really knocked back her confidence. But as the film developed her confidence grew and so did my love for her character. She helped her family so much and sacrificed a lot for them. The character depth was some of the best I have seen. Each character had their own journey or things to grow on throughout the film. The son felt left out of the family and was finding his path into being accepted as a man. And the mother and father really grew in terms of their openness to see their daughter happy. Ruby as a character had a tremendous amount of depth, which is linked to the conflict. Her family have always been so reliant on her to interpret what other people say or to help with the business, in the process stopping Ruby from achieving her goals in life, and this film showed a great balance to both sides of the conflict and all the characters really grew from this conflict in terms of understanding each other. I also thought the supporting cast was very strong. Ferdia Peelo and Eugenio Derbez in particular. Eugenio Derbez delivered a charismatic performance; his character was so likeable. Despite a perhaps slightly harsh way of teaching occasionally he genuinely cares about his students and his chemistry with Ruby was a fantastic element to the film. Ferdia Peelo was also fantastic. The romance wasn't a big part of the film which I loved as it didn't need to be the main focus. But he delivered a charming performance and his romantic chemistry with Emilia was great to see. Finally, I loved the unique storytelling. This film really incorporated sign language into how the story was told which I loved. Often due to being with a deaf family Ruby expressed her emotions through sign even though she could speak, due to her confidence issues she found this the best way to communicate. It was such a clever and interesting way to incorporate sign language that felt fresh and unique to the film.My final few positives would be the uplifting moments, emotional weight and moving ending. This film was so uplifting and offered such a hopeful message about living with a disability and showing that you can learn and adapt to live a normal life. This film had so much emotional weight and really got to me. It was just heart-breaking to see the families struggles, they couldn't enjoy Ruby's singing because they couldn't hear it and the personal scenes between Ruby and her parents really touched me. This movie handled its deep themes and really showed what it's like to be deaf, and it has really stuck with me. The ending was so moving, the family were such a strong unit by the end, fully supporting Ruby. And Ruby getting accepted into music school was so powerfully done, with her audition being sung and done in sign language at the same time. It was truly moving cinema.Overall, CODA is my favourite film of the year and completely deserved its win at Sundance. In a powerful, moving, and uplifting story. That was incredibly written. Filled with incredible performances and it really moved me emotionally. Offering so many beautiful messages about love, acceptance, and family. Giving important representation to the deaf community showing that with hard work, determination, and cooperation with the people around you, people with disabilities are just as capable at living a normal life.Overall rating 100/100.",CODA

34,arabnikita,Your feel good movie of the summer!,9,21 August 2021,"CODA (2021)Child of Deaf Adults. When I read this title, I thought I would be watching a sad movie similar to Sound of Metal; instead, it turned out to be a feel good film closer to Little Miss Sunshine. On the surface, it might seem like CODA is a coming of age story with the tropes that many of us have seen before. What makes it different though, is the entire deaf aspect and the nuanced way in which the narrative is crafted around it while offering opportunity for both sadness and good natured laughter. Yes laughter! The first half of the film is pure comedy and you wont believe how funny it is unless you see it.CODA is about a young girl Ruby and her deaf family. Being the only hearing person, she has spent her entire life as an interpreter for her mother, father and brother who make their livelihood through fishing. One day, Ruby signs up for choir and her teacher notices that she is highly talented and might have an opportunity to go to a prestigious college. It might seem like good news but in reality, they make Ruby feel torn between chasing a dream and fulfilling the immense responsibility for her family who rely on her for every little thing.If you are someone who is familiar with putting family first, you will find this story even more enjoyable. I did notice occasional cliches but I wasn't bothered by them because of how humane and pleasant the entire experience felt. Emilia Jones manages to brilliantly portray Ruby's struggle who can't imagine existing without her family and yet, can't stop dreaming of bigger things. There are plenty of moments to bring a smile to your face and quite a few that might bring a tear to your eye. I feel this touching story is perfect to watch on a summer day and I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed it.P. S.

And her thing turns out to be singing, which the rest, of course, cannot hear! If this film doesn't have any parts in it that move you, check your freaking pulse!

With enough charm the movie also sells out elements that flow in such a way that you instantly get connected with it. Director and screenplay writer Sian Heder has done a wonderful and sweet job with the presentation. The film itself is quite predictable at many points and the pattern of story feels like it has many predecessors but in the end nothing matters cause the presentation makes up for everything. Every single actor in the movie has given everything that they could to their performance and thanks to that, we can connect to every aspect of the story and that makes it feels relatable.

'CODA' manages to realize the entire story with an immense authenticity, dramaturgy and kindness.The movie consistently relies on sign language again and again and leaves the viewer alone with it. It is fascinating what effect facial expressions and gestures alone can have. Through sign language, you don't understand what exactly is being discussed, but you do understand in which direction a dialogue is developing, which feelings are being triggered and what the context is.The frame story is basically run-of-the-mill, but that's not the point here. It's more about the interpersonal relationships and the tensions within the family. In addition, it is impressively shown what it means to be deaf and with what difficulties one is confronted.The acting performance of Emilia Jones also deserves special mention. She was really good and I found it impressive how authentic her use of sign language was. I totally bought her role.It's really refreshing that there are movies like 'CODA'.

The script weaves their stories together in such a way that each person's perspective is equally understood and valued.I felt so much as I experienced this story. The deaf family members really add layers of conflict and barriers to the characters understanding each other, and the potential is capitalised on very effectively.Not every plot point is used as effectively as it could have been; some are dropped entirely and their consequences never explored.

54,jamuckley,I loved CODA! Funny and Inspirational film about what it's like to be a Child of Deaf Parents,10,12 August 2021,"""CODA,"" a new film coming to theaters and streaming on AppleTV+ on August 13 was a delightful and inspirational movie about what it is like to be a CODA, Child of Deaf Adults.Ruby Rossi is just a normal teenage girl who loves to sing, and her family is anything but normal. As the youngest child of deaf adults, Ruby takes on many roles that many other children don't need to worry about. Her father and older brother are fishermen in Gloucester, Massachusetts. She joins them every morning before the sun rises and before school starts out on the water as a deck hand, and the only one who can listen for distress calls from the Coast Guard or warnings from the National Weather Service. When they bring in the catch, she helps negotiate a price for the fish they catch, making sure they aren't getting ripped off compared to other fishermen.From the docks she goes to school with other kids who don't know what it's like being the daughter of deaf parents. She lives in a world that she feels she doesn't belong, but in her senior year, Ruby decides to do something for herself for once. She auditions for the high school choir.Besides bringing awareness of what it might be like for deaf people around us, the film explores the interesting dynamics between the world of hearers and the deaf community. The film also delves into how the deaf parents might feel if a child wanted to do something that they couldn't enjoy or appreciate due to their deafness.The film is as much about pursuing a dream and gaining independence, as it is about inter-dependence in a family and supporting one another. There are so many powerful moments throughout the film as Ruby explores what it means to be independent as well as what it means to be a CODA. It is a human story about connection and love and being there for one another no matter what. It is also a story about letting go and releasing someone you love to live life to the fullest.I really loved this film and the story that it told. I feel like I gained new empathy and understanding for deaf people in my community. The film is funny and sweet, but also inspirational.""CODA"" was written and directed by Siân Heder.

During the movie she needs to decide if she will go to the school in Boston called Berkley or if she will stay fishing with her family in her hometown.This movie cannot be described as anything other than a fantastic romantic drama movie which is in some situations funny, emotional and it arouses emotions in you too. Actors who have learned sign language were amazing and it looks like they have experience with that. Actors were wisely chosen and the roles were written for them. If I pass a few scenes where I think could have been better camera placement I think that the director of photography Paula Huidobro did as alway a very good job. I'm surprised that this movie does not have a romance genre because the romantic part was made very well. Even if you think that the movie is predictable, it pleasantly misleads you. The music is so perfect that I think better music for this movie could not be.This movie was very remarkable and unique in its style as well as the story. Conclusively I recommend this movie and I think that we will not see such a very good musical, romance and drama movie in one for a long time.8/10 stars

60,thespira,Good remake for once,8,24 August 2021,I loved La famille Bélier so I was a bit worried when I saw there has been a remake of the movie. It's the Russian roulette with remake and they are usually terrible. But very good surprise there. I missed Marlee Matlin who I discovered long ago in the Children of a Lesser God. I was happy to see her again in a comedy like that. Representation is important and this kind of movie is a good way to do it. Kudos to Emilia Jones who learn the ASL to do this movie (same as the French actors who had to learn as well as they were not deaf).The transfert from farmers to fisherman was really good as it shows the additional struggles of the family. All in all a success I'd say.,CODA
61,vedvaghela,Coda offers a new perspective and shines in it,9,13 August 2021,"Coda is definitely one of those films that you want to keep coming back to. Its heartwarming, hilarious and wholesome. It has a small cast that absolutely smash it, especially the three actors that are deaf.Coda innovates. It's a different coming-of-age story, one that offers a fresh perspective. Coda means ""Child of Deaf Adult"". Ruby is a member of a deaf family, in which only she is not deaf. She loves to sing but her family can't here her. And challenges rise from there.One of the best things about Coda is that it never stops giving, every moment in the film is delivered perfectly. The emotions hit you in the right spot, the drama is intense and the comedy sticks the landing. Like the clever use of sign language to converse with someone who is not learned in ASL but gets what that person is trying to convey given the circumstances. Or showing the shortcomings of being deaf while simultaneously not making them seem less able than others. It perfectly shows you what it feels like to be a deaf person.It is perfectly easy to understand sign language via subtitles but the way those actors deliver those signs makes it even more emotional than normal speaking lines.Emilia Jones plays a fantastic role as Ruby. Ruby's story, although unique, is very relatable. I like how the film doesn't over-focus on school stuff and teen romance like some other films. This gave time for and space for Emilia to show her great talents as an actress.Overall, Coda is definitely one of the best films of 2021 and I 100% recommend watching this.",CODA
62,eevaivilo,Do yourself a favor and go see CODA as soon as you can,9,11 August 2021,"I'm not one that gets emotional during movies very often, but this film had even me shedding a few tears.First and foremost, on a general note, it's been incredible to see the amount of accurate and respectful deaf representation in cinema recently. From this, Sound of Metal, and the Quiet Place franchise (and hell, even the use of ASL in Godzilla v. Kong), actual deaf actors and the deaf community are getting the representation in cinema they deserve.Further, the predominantly deaf audience I had the privilege of seeing this film with was elated to find that captions would be provided ON SCREEN, and not with captiview equipment. Hopefully, this film helps usher this accessibility in as a standard, and not an exception.Now, focusing on CODA specifically, it's a brilliantly written and acted story was clearly a labor of love for all involved. You can tell how much the director cared about doing the story justice and accurately capturing the struggles and hardships the deaf community face, as well as the community and love they all share.During this film, you really feel as though you are a part of this family, and their struggles become your struggles. This movie had me laughing, crying, and smiling the whole way through. It's a movie literally anyone can enjoy.This movie really struck a chord with me, and it probably will for you too. So do yourself a favor and see it when it's out. It deserves your support.",CODA
63,SleepingMorpheus,Endearing and Delightful,9,14 August 2021,"This movie on the surface looks like any other coming of age movie about a girl from a troubled family. But I assure you, its anything but that. CODA follows Ruby as the only hearing person in the deaf family with a beautiful singing voice. We follow along as she struggles with the decision to stay and help her poor family's business or follow her singing dreams.In hindsight, this movie gets away with many sugary sweet cliches that makes you puke. And that's what makes it stand out. A very touching story impressively crafted. It's direction, performances and story are all high class. Truly magnificent storytelling.",CODA

72,BoomerFan,A World Apart,9,4 September 2021,"I've known a lot of CODA's. They almost all have stories of having to be the ears and voice for their Deaf parents at a far too young age. Knowing that culture, the story itself is obvious and relatively predictable. The conflict between obligation and independence is a theme for many young CODA's whose Deaf families are dependent on their children's ability to negotiate hearing society. Thanks to the quality of the acting, the actors sell it - especially Emilia Jones as Ruby and Troy Kotsur as her father. There are some particularly strong and sweet moments between Ruby and Marlee Matlin as her mother.A mid-80s TV movie, Love Is Never Silent, covered some of these same themes in a more melodramatic matter. CODA is much better.",CODA
73,akellashashank,"Sweet, heartwarming and charmingly delightful flick.",8,13 August 2021,"One hour into the movie, I felt this is fine and not going in the direction I expected but exactly from 1HR 17minutes, it changed its course and went bonkers with roller-coaster of emotions till the end by giving beautiful , heart tugging scenes one after other and even made my eyes moist. Doesn't mean that first hour is bad, it is quite good and held well by the leads through their outstanding performances , just that it is not on par with the third act. Kudos to Sian Heder , she handled the subject with élan and brought the best emotions from the real deaf guys , hats off.Emilia Jones as Ruby is brilliant, beautiful and incredible throughout. She carried the movie and of course, got amazing support from reel family who did an outstanding job in elevating the movie with their sign act. You eventually become a part of their family, such is the atmosphere and vibe they give through their performances. All the three actors in the movie are real deaf persons and trust me, they make you feel their struggle, plight , emotions just with the signs BRAVO.Troy Kotsur as Ruby's dad is natural and phenomenal. There is one scene in the third act, where he asks his daughter to sing for him and place his hand on her neck to feel it is one of the finest and strikingly beautiful scenes ever. Same goes with the scene where Ruby asks her mother "" did you ever wish I was born deaf ? "" and the following scene with sign language and no background music made me feel something which is unexplainable. I give credit to actors for making me go through this, love you guys.Had it carried the same third act feel in the first hour, overall rating would have been higher. Yet, it deserves 8 for the actors especially real deaf persons act and for Sian's heartwarming stroke. Couple of issues but forgivable , as it managed to overcome in the final showdown. Do yourself a favor and watch it!!",CODA
74,nielssloos-17186,Such a good watch!,8,25 August 2021,"Ruby is the only person in her family who is not deaf and therefore has the responsibility to take care of her family as they fully rely on her. But when she finds out she has a passion for singing, she needs to make a difficult decision.I have heard some good things about this movie already, but I didn't feel like watching it as it seems like not wholly original (besides the deaf family). But I have to take that judgement back, because this is such a great movie for a few reasons.First, the comedy is quiet different from the usual comedy / dramas. They make harsh jokes, they will be in really awkward situations at times and the comedic moments might not work for everyone, but they did for me.Second, where many movies try to become over dramatic because of subject matter, CODA maintains a level of realism by not going too far.Third, the music scenes are great. The practice sessions are enjoyable, and later on, when they have to perform, you immerse yourself completely in the situation.As for flaws, the ending is a bit drawn out with several alternative endings they could make. As for the script, there are a few times that they use too much talk to explain what the family is feeling while we as audience already can feel it without needing the context explained.Overall, a great much where everyone can find something to love even if you think it is not for you, go and give it a try, you won't regret it.",CODA

All of the actors were great. Especially, Troy Kotsur. He is a master! He deserves an Oscar, in my opinion. The movie was written and directed by Sian Heder. She is pretty good! I really enjoyed this movie but this movie should have been released in 1970s-1990s instead of today. This movie didn't show the use of technology that we use along with American Sign Language, (ASL). Technology such as Video Relay Services, and a Video Phone. The device was in the movie but they didn't use it, because they preferred to use their daughter to interpret instead. My dad and aunt did this during the 1970s-1990s, because at that time, there were no devices such as Video Phones for Deaf people to use. Technology was not yet developed then. Today it is better. So, when I watched this movie and I felt like the movie had the same old theme. The theme is consistent in depicting the old adage; ""poor Deaf people can't do anything for themselves, because they can't hear and they need to depend on their CODA children to interpret and do everything for them"". CODA means Child of Deaf Adults. Did we, the Deaf Community ALL like this movie? No. It's very different today. I use a Video Phone, I use the technology available to me today. I can request an ASL interpreter for my doctor's appointment by myself, along with communicating with my employer, and communicating with other hearing folks through current technology/interpreting services. I don't need to use my dad to interpret, or my sister. This movie didn't show that because like I said this move shows an old theme, and this movie should have been released 20-30 years ago. I don't understand why they made this movie, until I learned that this movie is based on the original film, ""La Famille Belier."" They decided to make the movie, ""CODA"", as ""La Famille Belier"" is a foreign, (French) film, and they wanted to do a reinvention/remake of this film. I haven't seen the original film yet, but the issue here is the story/plot is old and out of date. While I enjoyed the movie, I would give it an 8 out of 10. I truly hope that this is the last movie that depicts Deaf folks in a negative and pitiful light, and that we can move on from this and develop/produce movies that depict Deaf people equal to hearing folks.",CODA
83,Waiyan-1999,Small movie but Big with details and feels.,9,14 August 2021,"Let me just start by saying that Apple did dirty to this movie by simply burying it without giving even minimal promotion or marketing because CODA is amazing. Easily one of this year best and deserved to be seen by more people. The story of CODA is simple yet it is rich in emotions, it will tug at your heartstrings and stir up your feelings. It gives much needed representation to under-represented deaf community/families and shines light on and gives us view into some of their problems we will never know about like being alienated from the outside world. This in other hand could fall into the victim of being overly-sentimental and unnecessarily dramatic but Sian Heder carefully directed this movie and it shows. Every moment of the movie is simply magical, heart-warming and furthermore, the performances from the whole cast is deeply moving (particular from the father. The scene where he tried to feel his daughter sings got me in tears) and only adds authenticity into the air. Not to mention it's beautiful photography too.

Unpretentious, deeply inspiring, it's mostly about love - the sacrifices and the warm-hearted way it leads us all to be a little better.Fantastic performances by all involved, on a story that never sees a dull moment. It's got a slice of everything - comedy, drama, and defying your own beliefs. Above all, it gives us all an insight of two distinct realities - those that are hearing impaired and those that aren't, but relate close to the first.It had been a while since a movie got a tear to my eye, but this one surely made the trick for all the right reasons.",CODA

121,mitcharrow,Heartfelt,8,2 September 2021,"Sublime in so many ways, rarely has there been a story so genuine, so lovingly crafted, so expertly depicted. The Rossi family may be fictional, but couldn't be more real - a complex, lovingly dysfunctional, emotionally taxing quartet, seemingly mired in an inner-world missing one important sense - the ability to hear - except for the hearing daughter, Ruby - torn between her own yearnings and a lifelong sense of duty - to remain their bridge to a world of sound. It is exceedingly rare for a performance to master so many disparate nuances as that which Emilia Jones has accomplished. You will believe every fiber of her story...the signing, the singing - and likely not so silently cheer for her (and her family) to achieve a happily-ever-after outcome!",CODA

Some moves you watch you might know the story or have a good idea how the plot is going to play out. It doesn't make a difference.

It's beautifully cast with great performances and tugs the heart strings like the original.The lead, Emilia Jones is wonderful and has a stunning voice. No wonder with her father Aled Jones.There are many scenes which have effectively been copied from the original but some aspects have been changed.I went along for the emotional ride in the end and loved it as much as the original. It's exactly what a film should be. You grow to love and care about the characters. It's so nice to see a film like this being made amongst all the Superhero franchise movies.

132,serendrewpity,I'm giving it a standing ovation right NOW!,10,29 August 2021,"I don't cry!! I don't cry!! I don't cry!! ... I cried. (...and laughed)Listen, I'm not some touchy, feely, sensitive guy. I like my Sci-Fi, Horror and Action movies. I especially do not like subtitles. Still, I felt drawn to this story when reading its description. Its fresh. Different.It didn't disappoint! Right from the start, Ruby's (Emilia) soulful voice grabs you and doesn't let you leave the room for a popcorn run. To think she took singing lessons (in addition to the sign-language and fishing lessons), and was able to perform like that made me believe that... maybe I could sing if I took lessons? Nahh... they probably don't have supernatural abilities.There was a scene with Ruby and her brother Leo (Daniel Durant) that I thought was amazing. The emotion. The pain, frustration and ... conflict of loving the person who is the antagonist to your position in the family was palpable. Well done Daniel!I am familiar with some of Marlee Matlin's (the Mom) work. Not much but I know she's done well with her career, but I didn't like her character in this film. They do some work to try to endear her character to the audience but it wasn't enough for me. At one point her character tried to convey a sense of the empty nester parent that I felt came across as self-centered and uncaring. I just couldn't with her after that. Maybe that's what they were going for.Troy (the Dad) was great also and offered up a welcome comedic relief and not in the form of some one-line chucklers but actually roared laugh that I am sure my neighbors heard.They could have developed the love interest a bit more. It felt thrown in at the last minute. I understand the movie was about the family and the dynamic of being a CODA. But then what value did the romance with Miles add to it. It felt like one of those unwritten rules where every movie has to end with the boy getting the girl (in this case vice versa).Still, this was all around a great movie!! The best I've seen in a long time. I'd pay to see this twice in a theater!!",CODA

It felt so raw and real. I was a little emotional.Although the script is predictable, it is still well written and conveys the intended message. It's a very positivist film... Perhaps if the problems these families face had been deepened, as well as the consequences that follow, I would have felt a better approach. But I still recommend it to all families.",CODA

Some may say Ruby is selfish and doesn't love her family when she first decided to leave, but totally wrong.

Her singing is simply flawless. Marlee Matlin as her mother was exceptional as always. The father played by Troy Kotsur was brilliant. Even the music teacher was perfectly cast.

I watched in Japanese dub & English dub.CODA is such a great story that i have many thoughts after watching. Ruby, the 17 yrs little girl was actually not confident with her voice don't believe she can sing, being born in the deaf family. When the little girl was lack of confident on her accent, it's the Latin Spanish accent singing techer Mr. V helped her on her self-confidence. It's not in the story but i could imagine from the line, the techer had a tough life and that was similar with what Ruby has gone throught.It's not a genios girl AGT kind of heart moving emotion, it's towards a little non confident YOU find your little confidence that you believe in yourself that you want to move on, in a little desperated world and push back from your surrounding.Although i know nothing about the deaf community, the little girl challenge is just a mirror of many of our day to day challenge.If you watched the movie, the highlight is at 1h26m. That open you eyes to the other side of the story. And i fully understand why i felt awkward few minutes earlier. And that also drove me to tear towards end of the movie.This movie is a good entertainment, encouraging story, a little touching and eyes opening. I now can look at lifes from both side now.",CODA

Director did not see a problem here.A final note: As with any music school The Berklee College of Music auditions measure talent and knowledge of classical music.

This movie was a return to older movies where the emphasis was on acting excellence, getting the audience to live and feel the story, and injected a bit of humor and sarcasm to make the interactions between the family members feel even more real. Consequently the movie didn't require millions of dollars in special effects to make it a hit. Super job by the actors, the director and production crew. Looking forward to seeing more movies like this one.",CODA
189,tdierig,Very nice ... but just a copy of The Beliers family,7,20 August 2021,"Really nice, but the original didn't need a US-remake and the french girl has the better voice.Besides that: The original story has less length and loopholes.",CODA

195,deep_purple1,Definitely worth watching,8,18 August 2021,"I liked the story a lot and even though it might have been a little predictable, it still is one of the best feel-good movies I've seen in a while. There isn't really a belly of the beast scene where it feels like all is lost for a moment but that's okay. What's strange about the movie is that part of it feels very professional and part of it feels very amateurish. There were some decisions made in the shooting and in the editing that I've seen only in the festival films of less experienced filmmakers and never in the films of the Hollywood greats.",CODA
196,Hawk-49,One of the Best Movies in Years,10,15 August 2021,"I will start up front by saying that I am hard of hearing - have worn hearing aids all my life - so this movie was guaranteed to hold a special place in my heart. That being said, after all I read about it, I was pretty worried it would not live up to the hype. However, I must say that this movie hits all the right boxes - it had humor, it had heart, it had wonderful, well-drawn out characters who were flawed but redeemable, and it presented real-life dilemmas that I think could be true of any family, not just families with deaf or hard-of-hearing people with in it. I truly connected with the depiction of life viewed through the eyes of the deaf family members, and my mother (who is hearing) truly connected to the experience of having a family member who is DHH as well as just being a mom who is trying to figure out what is best for her kid, no matter what. The acting was superb, the writing was crisp and clean, the sound mixing was awesome, and honestly ... this is what movies should be. All heart, all human. Very powerful, very well done.",CODA

198,Islamyassin-13,This is what we call a beautiful movie,8,10 September 2021,"Coda gives us a touchy story with solid dramatic lines besides hilarious comedy at some times .It introduces us a girl whose life so attached to her deaf family and how she confused between her family needs and her dreams .The relationship between her and every member of her family which includes her father, mother and a brother is various which gives the movie a credit .The most favourite part of the movie for me when she finds her passion then it disagrees with her family life such a different reaction from each one of her family fits with every character was shown in the movie.Actors were very convincing especially the father who was played by "" Troy kotsur "" who gives us a very solid dramatic scenes and a fresh comedy style .The only problem I felt in the movie is that I knew what is going to happen especially the second half and I think you will too .",CODA

201,espaninan,A remake in Sundance and,7,23 August 2021,"Apart from being a remake - which should automatically be a no no for the festivals- it's a pretty cliche story line. Does anyone remember Billy Elliot? Or any other movie in which the child doesn't want to fulfill the traditional expectations and chase his/her dream? It was a predictable movie but still - this is important- nice to watch and I enjoyed it. Music was good, singing was good, acting was good. Something to watch on a Sunday night to go back to work on Monday morning with little more hope in humanity before you check your social media.is that a bad thing? No. Is that good enough to win Jury Special Prize I am not sure. However we should have these movies. Formulaic plots can be useful to put a light on some parts of the society that doesn't have it as easy as the rest of us.",CODA

225,ferraromr,Nice but formula driven,9,15 August 2021,"No surprises in this movie. Formula is driven by check box we have seen in Fame, Glee and countless other coming of age stories.

Making the Coast Guard the bad guys is a low blow.",CODA

If this doesn't win awards, they're admitting they're rigged",10,7 November 2021,"Simply put, if CODA does not win multiple Academy Awards, they are admitting they're rigged. No. I am not kidding.I will say SPOILER ALERT here just in that while this does have a coming of age vibe to it, this is far from your typical coming of age storyline. You don't just follow the life of the main character but you get to FEEL what they're going through. And yes......I'm saying they because while you get emotionally invested in one character, you are also connected with others but in a different sense.The teen girl lead can choose between her family or her dream. Literally her family's ability to support themselves, keep a roof over their heads and food on their table. This is a crushing weight to be on the shoulders of a teenager that is different than the rest of her family.You will need to read subtitles or know ASL to watch this movie but it is 1,000% worth every word. You will want to grab the girl and hold her tight to tell her it will be ok at times and other times you will laugh your ass off.",CODA

It's funny, heartfelt and poignant and certainly better than most movies thrown into streaming services these days. I did wonder about how modern this was in light of technology so perhaps it would have been a bit stronger if this had been set back in a time where technology didn't offer more choices and didn't portray deaf people as so dependent on others who can hear. I know there's an element of resistance in the family to cost etc. But I just wonder about that fact.

Would be awesome to see Troy Katsur get some recognition come awards season as well. The movie is full of heart, made me laugh and made me cry. There were some really beautiful scenes in here and some surprisingly funny ones. The only thing that holds it back is the predictability that comes with abiding by coming of age genre conventions. The pacing also drags a little bit in the middle of the movie. However, the family dynamic here just completely elevates it above normal coming of age fare.",CODA
