0,TheLittleSongbird,"No terror, fear or thrills to this curse",3,16 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' is a prime example of this, a film with very little to recommend and just very poorly done in many areas. Starting with the very few good things, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance, in his last film before his death from heart failure not long after (although his screen time is far too short and was clearly severely truncated), come off in a good way in the acting department. The exploding head death is a pretty fun one and the setting is eerie. As far as praises go, that is it. 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was directed by someone who had an apparent dislike for Pleasance, the main reason for his limited screen time most likely, and had no interest in directing the film or the 'Halloween' series in general, and it shows loud and clear on screen. Even the direction in 'Season of the Witch' and 'Halloween 5' wasn't this indifferent or inept.Sadly the effectiveness of the setting, which actually is eerie, is hindered by the filming and editing being pretty amateurish, the photography often is far too dark and drab and the editing makes bacon-slicer-like editing seem coherent in comparison. The music, like the previous film, is here a drawback when it was one of the better elements of the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and would have sounded out of date even in the 80s most likely.Everything looks, sounds and feels like it was made in a rush and with absolutely no heart, accounting for the constant sense of incompleteness. There is nothing scary or suspenseful, it's unintentionally campy, uncomfortably strange and by the numbers with a convoluted story that makes no sense whatsoever, an abrupt ending, dull pacing and the man in black/cult plot that is just bizarre and just muddles everything. Michael Myers is just not creepy enough and looks goofy.Very like the previous sequel, there is nothing interesting or endearing about the characters (though none are quite as annoying as Tina in 'Halloween 5'). The script especially sounds incomplete and the acting, apart from Rudd and Pleasance (whose screen time, as said, is far too short), is subpar to put it lightly. J.C. Brandy is a pretty poor replacement for Danielle Harris.Overall, don't expect any terror, scares, fear or thrills here, you'll be disappointed. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
1,Leofwine_draca,Tired showing in a past-it franchise,4,10 November 2011,"The HALLOWEEN series really stalled with the fifth entry, which I consider the worst of the bunch. It's a film entirely devoid of imagination, wit, originality and scares, content to rehash old scenes over and again. HALLOWEEN 6 is marginally better because it seeks to introduce a new element to the plot, involving a sinister religious cult that somehow controls Michael Myers. The film ends up as a failure, but it earns points for at least making the effort.The problem with the cult plot is that it doesn't have anything to do with the bread and butter of the series, which is the stalk 'n' slash sequences. The cult scenes could have been excised and the film wouldn't be any different, which goes to show how extraneous they are. There are plenty of stalking sequences in this movie, but none of them are particularly engaging and most of them feel tired. When the Carpenter theme tune is still the best thing in the movie, you know it isn't up to much. There are some mega cheesy gore effects to be endured/enjoyed depending on your partiality, but otherwise this is knifing-by-numbers.Of the cast, Donald Pleasence is the only recurring actor and it's pretty sad to see him in his final days, tottering and weak and with his voice long gone. Needless to say, he still gives the best performance, with the rest of the cast muddled with related characters and TV-level acting. It's not an entirely bad film, because the pacing is strong and the attempt was made to take things in a different direction, but the thing that really spoils it is the direction: Joe Chappelle apparently found Pleasence boring and removed most of his scenes, and in favour of what? More slasher sequel mediocrity.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
2,SnoopyStyle,last survivor Donald Pleasence,3,16 April 2016,"Jamie Lloyd gives birth in a cult. Michael Myers is coming after her and the baby leaving a trail of bodies. She manages to call a radio station and broadcast out a warning. Retired Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is visited by Dr. Terence Wynn (Mitch Ryan) from the first film when they hear the warning. Loomis returns to Haddonfield, Illinois. In Haddonfield, Halloween has been banned for years. Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), whom Laurie Strode babysat in the first film, is obsessed with Michael Myers. Michael kills Jamie Lloyd and Tommy finds her baby. Back in the original Myers home, Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan) has returned home with her son Danny. Her father John is abusive with her mother and brother suffering. Tommy, Kara, and Danny are on the run with Jamie Lloyd's baby.The first problem is that Danielle Harris doesn't return for Jamie Lloyd. It's hard to understand that it's Jamie Lloyd without her. Donald Pleasence does return for a few scenes in his last outing for the franchise. It's really too bad that the movie isn't better. None of it scary. The jump scares don't work. Maybe the other versions work better and is scarier. To some extend, it's because I don't care about these characters. Other than Pleasence, these characters have connections with the franchise but are played by newcomers. It's a bit of a history test to remember where all of these characters fit. It is interesting to see Paul Rudd when this came out around the time of Clueless. This episode tries to continue the franchise but the only connective tissue is Pleasence and he isn't in it enough to hold this movie together.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
3,nogodnomasters,It's his game,5,24 March 2020,"For those who like conspiracy theories and cults, this one ties the series pack to pagan Celtic ritual killing at Halloween. Michael Myers is now less of a psycho, but an instrument of a clan. Tommy is all grown up and it was a kick to see a young Paul Rudd (Ant Man) in the film. A lot the same stuff. The basement scene was my favorite. I thought the crowd screamed a bit early with the dead guy in the tree scene.Guide: sex and nudity (Mariah O'Brien)",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Not as bad as people make out.,6,31 October 2018,"By this stage the franchise had really gotten tired, the previous few had been very poor, almost an insult to the fabulous original.Of the first six films I would place this third overall, after one and two. It doesn't deserve its reputation as a bad film, because it isn't bad, nor is it great.On the plus side, it has some scary moments, Michael's character is well used. The acting in general is rather good, it's quite slick, in a nineties way. On the debit side, the story is a little far fetched, and I didn't particularly like the cult element, it's like they tried to rewrite the show's past. It's a bit silly I guess, but....At least it has Paul Rudd and the wonderful Donald Pleasance.Not that bad. 6/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
5,gavin6942,And the Series Crashes and Burns...,5,9 November 2010,"I'm not even going to dignify this film with a proper review, at least not right now. This is where everything right and good in the world of Halloween took a deuce on my chest.Mike Mayo calls the film ""putrid"", ""repugnant"", ""virtually plot less"" and ""predictable"". That's all fair. It also fails to star Danielle Harris (allegedly due to a mere $5000 dispute) and introduces a cult aspect that never really makes complete sense. Paul Rudd's character is silly, though I'm glad they brought back old characters...The biggest problem at all is the fact the producer's cut is so drastically different from any other known version. I don't think anyone knew going into this film what they wanted, and it's clear that when they finished nobody knew what to do with what they had.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
6,lee_eisenberg,Too bad that Donald Pleasance had to end like this.,4,26 August 2006,"I know that at the end of his life, Donald Pleasance was pretty much only known for the ""Halloween"" movies, but did he really need to get involved in ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" for his final movie role? This entry in the series didn't add anything. It's just more of Michael going around butchering people. The reason that the next entry was so neat was because they brought back Jamie Lee Curtis. So skip this one; entries 1, 2 and 7 are the only ones that you need to see to get the feeling for the series.And Mr. Pleasance, wherever you are, we'll always remember you, if only as Sam Loomis.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
7,jboothmillard,Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers,1,5 November 2010,"I knew about this sequel in the franchise for one very good reason, it was the final film to have the great actor Donald Pleasence, who sadly died not long after filming, and that was one of the main reasons to watch. Basically it has been six years since both psycho killer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) and his niece, daughter of the supposedly dead Laurie Strode, Jamie were seen in the town of Haddonfield, but they are very much alive. Now teenage Jamie Lloyd Carruthers (J.C. Brandy) was raped by a cult and gives birth to her baby boy on Halloween Eve, she manages to hide the baby, and alerts Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence), but suffers Michael pushing her into a corn thresher. Back in Haddonfield, Halloween is apparently banned ever since the horrible incidents involving Myers, but some people are still getting the pumpkins and costumes out, and the Myers house has a new family living in it. They are the Strode family, the ones who adopted Laurie, mother Kara (Marianne Hagan) with her teenage brother Tim (Keith Bogart), her son Danny (Devin Gardner), and her parents, doting mother Debra (Kim Darby) and abusive father John (Bradford English). The baby is eventually found by Tommy Doyle (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Paul Rudd), the little boy Laurie babysat for in the first film, now grown up, and he gets the help of the seemingly retired Loomis to help look after it. Tommy believes that he has an explanation for why Michael is killing people, specifically on Halloween and from his own family bloodline, apparently he is cursed by what is called the Thorn (which he has the symbol of scarred on him), with voices telling him to kill. Soon enough Michael is back in Haddonfield on Halloween to kill the Strodes and anyone else who gets in his way, and Dr. Terence Wynn (Liar Liar's Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan) reveals himself as the man who wants to almost help him in his quest, he's the guy that was in black from the previous film. In the end, after a few chases and deaths, Michael is eventually stopped (for a while) with tranquilisers of corrosive chemicals and a lead pipe beating to the head, and Loomis is the final (overheard) victim from the still living killer. Also starring Mariah O'Brien as Beth. It is such a shame that Pleasence's time on screen is so short (the director removed some stuff claiming he was boring!), and of course his being in a rubbish film is tragic. Michael Myers may have a better mask and still be creepy, I may have jumped once, and enjoyed the death with a guy's head exploding, but we don't want explanation in a stupid storyline, it is just predictable and silly, like most of the sequels before it, a terrible horror. Poor!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
8,Woodyanders,The curse of poor sequels,3,10 April 2013,"Michael Myers (hulking George Wilbur) returns once more to Haddonfield, Illinois to resume his killing spree. It's up to troubled Tommy Doyle (well played by Paul Rudd) and Dr. Loomis (a game, but wasted Donald Pleasence, who's given precious little screen time) to stop Myers. Director Joe Chappelle not only crucially fails to develop any suspense or spooky atmosphere, but also goes way overboard with loads of ugly violence and cheap jump-out-at-you fake scares. Worse yet, the wrongheaded script by Daniel Farrands makes a grievous blunder by providing some kind of ridiculous Druid cult back story for Myers, thus completely undermining Myers' status as the embodiment of pure evil as established in the previous films in the series. Moreover, this picture further suffers from a foul mean-spirited tone that hangs heavy over everything like a putrid fog; placing a newborn baby in considerable jeopardy rates as an especially gross and offensive error on the part of the filmmakers. The plodding pace, clumsy use of flash cutting, and a blaring guitar riff during the murders don't help matters any. Ditto the brutal killing of the Jamie Lloyd character and Loomis' lame send-off. On the plus side, Marianne Hagan contributes an appealing turn as the sympathetic Kara Strode, Mitchell Ryan makes for a nice villain as the sinister Dr. Terence Wynn, and the fetching Mariah O'Brien as the brash Beth bares her sweet perky breasts prior to meeting a harsh untimely end. A real disappointment.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
9,BA_Harrison,It was the rune wot made me do it.,3,11 September 2014,"Remember that tattoo briefly glimpsed on Michael Myer's wrist in Halloween 5? Well, in Part 6, we learn its significance, and it's a real stinker of an explanation, one that takes the story in such a dreadful direction that it will have fans of John Carpenter's classic cringing with embarrassment and/or frothing with rage.The symbol, as it transpires, is a rune, put there by members of a pagan cult who have been controlling Michael for their own nefarious needs ever since he was a child. This unnecessary update to the Michael Myer's mythos robs the character of his mystery and ultimately exonerates him of any blame, turning him from the embodiment of pure evil into a figure almost worthy of our compassion. Way to spoil the entire series!Rather unsurprisingly, Part 6 in the series is utter trash, the script getting more and more preposterous as the plot develops, with the whole evil druid sect storyline making not a lick of sense and the only decent moment in the entire film being a pretty cool exploding head effect (an unofficial unrated version of the film apparently shows a touch more gore throughout but I doubt it would improve the film much).The whole stupid occult angle was wisely ignored for subsequent movies, the series' makers desperately trying to appease fans by bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode for Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection (they needn't have bothered—both films are only marginally better than this garbage).",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
10,paul_haakonsen,Nothing out of the ordinary...,5,22 December 2015,"I never really gotten as much into the Michael Myers hype, as I always found him and the movies inferior to Jason Voorhees (""Friday the 13th"") and Freddy Krueger (""Nightmare on Elm Street""). So I only gotten around to watch the ""Halloween"" movies if they were on TV or if I found them at the local secondhand DVD store. As such, I only got around to seeing this 1995 movie twenty years after it was released.First of all, I was quite surprised to see Paul Rudd in a slasher movie. But it was still a treat to see him in such a movie, because he is a good actor.The story does seem familiar to every other previous ""Halloween"" movie that I have seen; Michael Myers is returning to his childhood home in Haddonfield just in time for Halloween. And in his wake a trail of blood and corpses follow.I was even laughing hard like never before from a slasher movie. And what had me laughing was the scene where a man's head exploded from being electrocuted.The acting was good throughout the movie, and there were some nice enough talents on the cast list.As a gorehound and avid horror fan I watch such movies for the shocks, scares, and of course for the kills. There are absolutely no shocks or scares to be found throughout the course of ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"". There is, though, a fair amount of slayings which makes it sort of worthwhile to sit through this otherwise mediocre slasher movie.But when it comes to it then ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" isn't particularly outstanding for a slasher movie. But I am sure that those who swear to Myers and the ""Halloween"" franchise will find some more enjoyment in it than I did.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
11,Quinoa1984,Dumb horror film is chronology at it's worst,3,5 December 2000,"(Possible spoilers)I remember first seeing this on cable and trying to figure it out (from after seeing parts 4 and 5).  So, Laurie Strode's daughter (as we learned was abandoned in part 4) grew up at the age of maybe 15 and (as the film opens) has a child.  No explanation as to this, but at least the whole film doesn't go on about Mike Myers (and no not SNL Myers) killing the daughter and the child, if you catch my drift.  But that's just the set up.  And the whole film follows Myers new mission: to kill his great nephew!In maybe a couple of spots scary, but overall, a dissapointemnt that makes part III classic and redefines the un-needed horror film in more ways than one.  Biggest embarrasement- Donald Pleasance (of all the Halloween and THX 1138 fame) had his last film with this.  Sad.  D",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
12,Coventry,They'll never get rid of ol' Mickey!!,5,16 March 2006,"In case anyone's still bothering to count: here we have the SIXTH episode in the wacky adventures of mass murderer Michael Myers and the good people of Haddonfield; Illinois apparently STILL don't realize that the white-masked dude can't possibly be killed. The biggest trump of this mid-90's installment, however, is that ""Halloween"" goes occult! Nearly twenty years and four long feature films (""Season of the Witch"" not included) later, this new script suddenly suggests that Myer's nature of pure evil might have been inflicted onto him and that there even exist cults that worship his persona. How about that? I wonder if John Carpenter had any thoughts in that direction when he initially thought up the simple premise of a maniac butchering babysitters! Guess not Anyway, this weirdo cult offers Michael to kill his last niece alive as well as her newborn baby so that his direct bloodline is finished off completely. The girl escapes and the baby ends up in home sweet home Haddonfield where many people will meet their deaths again. Maybe I just was in an extraordinary good mood when I saw this film, but I really didn't think it was that bad. It even qualifies as the series' second best entry, as the atmosphere is quite sinister and the murder-sequences are delightfully gory & sadistic. Unlike part five, which was a really awful film, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" isn't overly talkative or irritatingly dull and Joe Chapelle's directing is surprisingly solid. Even Carpenter's legendary music received a techno update and  believe it or not  it actually works stimulating. The acting performances are more than adequate with Paul Rudd as the adult version of Tommy; the boy Jamie Lee Curtis was babysitting in the original. Donald Pleasance's share in the script has been reduced to a supportive role, but maybe it's better like that, since the poor man looks very fatigue and ill. Pleasance passed away before the film ever hit the theaters and therefore it's dedicated to his memory. An admirable effort.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
13,poolandrews,Rubbishy sixth installment of a very tired franchise that was never that good to begin with.,4,17 March 2006,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers starts as mass murderer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) last remaining blood relative Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy) gives birth in the candle lit basement belonging to a group of dubious character's who worship Michael because he is some sort of druid incarnation of evil & these turkeys protect him & perform all sorts of dodgy rituals & you just know this film is going to be crap from this opening sequence. Anyway, a kind hearted druid nurse (Lee Ju Chew) gives Jamie her baby back & lets them escape but the main man himself Michael Myers is in hot pursuit, I have no idea where he came from or how he knew what was going on but hey I guess the screenwriters thought we wouldn't care (they were right). Michael ends up killing Jamie but discovering that she hid her baby somewhere en-route, since all Michael wants to do is kill all his relatives (don't laugh I feel like this all the time!) for various preposterous reasons he is determined to head back to Haddonfield to kill the folks in his old house including a cousin of Laurie Strode, Kara (Marianne Hagan) & hunt down Jamie's baby even though he couldn't have a clue where it is, as luck would have it Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) the guy across the street, who also has a tenuous link to the original as he was a babysitter or something, found Jamie's baby & has taken it back home where Michael is lurking not far away across the street...Directed by Joe Chappelle I thought Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was a boring & confusing entry in the Halloween franchise that currently numbers 9 & should have stopped at Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) which at least tried to be different & original. The script by Daniel Farrands is an absolute mess & when you consider the various production problems that took place it's no surprise, for instance the script apparently went through 11 drafts (& they still ended up with this?!), Donald Pleasence died before the film was released & many of his scene were edited out, the usual 'creative differences' between director, producer & studio & really bad test screenings prompted re-shoots & heavy re-editing. The whole sorry situation has mess written all over it, the stupid ideas about druid cults, star constellation's, Michaels origins & lots of unnecessary nonsense that I suppose was included to try & stretch the flimsy series out even more although ironically the next film in the series Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) totally ignored Holloween: The Curse of Michael Myers & it's absurd ideas. The film moves along at a fair pace, there are a few decent scenes when taken individually but as a whole the film really is a mess & it looks like it was pieced together using outtakes. Oh & since when do Hospitals leave machetes lying around?Director Chappelle has a nice style going on here, cool neon blues as lightening flash, some good angles & camera moves means that it's a fine looking film. Unfortunately this means that the film looks very staged, one of the reasons why the original Halloween (1978) was effective was because of it's simplicity. There isn't much gore, someone is impaled on some farm machinery, an exploding head, a slit throat & a few spurts of blood. Most of the character's feel very secondary & things are never rounded off with any satisfaction.With a budget of about $5,000,000 it has that Hollywood polish & it looks good throughout. The acting isn't up to much but at least there are no rap 'stars' in it, Pleasence looks really old & disinterested (much like the audience by the time this thing finishes).Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is not for me, maybe there are people out there who love it & that's fine but for me it's a definite miss. Not particularly recommended & for die-hard Halloween fans only. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia Section' many of the cast & crew were angry at all the changes, problems & re-shoots with them vowing never to make another Halloween film again (you know what I'm going to say), well we all have to be grateful for small mercies I suppose!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
14,utgard14,Better Than 5 But That's Not Saying Much,4,4 November 2013,"Disjointed sequel that attempts to add some layers to the franchise's mythology. A lot of crap about druids and curses but ultimately it's still just a movie about a guy who kills people and can't seem to be killed himself. It's marginally better than part 5, with at attempt at creating some atmosphere here and there.The series continues its trend of having completely unlikeable new characters, presumably because the producers (and some fans) viewed Michael as the protagonist in some warped way. Paul Rudd makes his film debut and I'm surprised he ever worked again. The kill scenes are especially terrible and not very creative. An early death scene involves a woman being impaled on a spike in a wall. Why there is a spike in the middle of an otherwise ordinary wall is beyond me. Another gem is that Michael graffiti-tags his Celtic gang sign in this one. Brilliant.There were a lot of behind-the-scenes problems with this movie apparently and it shows. Some say the ""producer's cut"" that can be found online is better. But from what I've read it sounds like garbage as well. Avoid this mess.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

And, there was a story. It wasn't just slash, slash, slash.

16,Boba_Fett1138,Welcome to the horrible ' 90's Michael Myers!,3,26 September 2009,"Man, the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies. The movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking.This 6th entry into the long running Halloween-series is certainly a bad one. You just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build-up movie.It's simply a poorly done film, that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. It's a real shame that this had to be Donald Pleasence last film-role. It's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an Halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one.There is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers just never comes across as threatening or scary. Perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie, from pretty early on already. He does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. Also the attempts to uncover Myer's past don't really work out, for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well. It's obvious that the script went through various re-writes before- and also very possibly during filming. Several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing. The movie more often looks and feels like a made for TV one. This is also due to the lack of some real good gore. As an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch.So far the worst out of the series!3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"I'd be cursing too, if they kept crapping out sub-par sequels that I starred in",5,3 February 2010,"I'll start with saying that I have not watched the Work Print(which I understand is at least somewhat better), only the Theatrical Version. At the very beginning, I thought this showed real promise. The narration wasn't bad; when you can make the silliness that is the overall story-line up to this point sound decent, you've got skill. Then it dawned on me; this tries way too hard, it is over-stylized, and it uses flash cuts as if the editor just realized how to do them. Several sequences are chopped awkwardly together, apparently on account of last-minute changes. The music(apart from the original theme) goes all out in its attempts to hype up what's happening on-screen, and it winds up feeling phony(and it doesn't exactly help with the atmosphere). There is genuine creepiness in this, and the mask is great, but many things hold this back. Nearly everyone plays Captain Exposition, most of the characters are obnoxious(giving us few to care about, enough to hope they survive), and the credibility and consistency are lacking. Is that radio dude supposed to be a ""shock jock"" or not? Why didn't he ""play along"" with the phone call early on? Or how about that ridiculous teen who is somehow turning the Halloween celebration into a objection against authority? Naming two of them for the people responsible for the excellent first film makes it all the more awful that they are so irritating. This is overly confusing, and the plot is simply put a mess. Loomis is yelling yet again(for how little he is in this; Chappelle... Pleasence ""boring""? Seriously, he is the one thing that made II, 4 and 5 anything less than completely intolerable; also, he can act, and it comes in handy to have at least one person who knows how to do that, when making a movie), and what happened to his burnt face? Maybe it heals, in the crazy world this takes place in, where things don't have to connect to one another in any sensible manner, and where newborns have plenty of hair right out of the womb. There is plenty of brutal, bloody, gory violence, brief gratuitous nudity, and a tiny bit of strong(as well as occasional moderate) language in this. I recommend this to fans of slashers who don't consider the actual quality(this does deliver, if you don't look deeper at it). 5/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
18,view_and_review,Grasping at Straws,3,3 September 2020,"By now the ""Halloween"" franchise is just running on fumes. It hit its zenith at part 2, did a complete nosedive in part 3, a slight recovery in part 4, then back on the slide in part 5, and a further digression in this episode.""Halloween VI: The Curse of Michael Myers"" is six years removed from ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers."" You may remember that in part 4 Michael Myers was after his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris). That ended with Michael being pumped full of lead by the police whereby he fell into a hole in the ground in a cemetery. Part 5 picks up with him crawling from that grave into a river so his pursuit of Jamie could continue. Now, in part 6, Jamie (J.C. Brandy) is an adult and with child.The movie starts with her giving birth to a baby boy in some dark ominous institution. It's not clear what this place is or what they want, but she's bound, and the baby is taken from her. What we find out is that this institution is run by a cult and they needed Jamie's child to offer as sacrifice to Michael Myers. Through revisionist history, in order to continue the Michael Myers thread, we now find out that Michael Myers has always been tied to this cult and that there always has to be a sacrifice to save the rest of the people from eminent death. We also find out that Michael is not human, but some supernatural force of evil. I guess we always kinda knew that, but now we can dispense with any poor explanations to the fact he never dies and can accept that he can't be killed.All of this was just lazy, and it got lazier. Michael finally was able to kill his niece, but that wouldn't be enough any longer since her bloodline continued in her fatherless baby (it seems Michael's prey keeps getting younger and younger). She was able to stash her baby somewhere before being killed. The little bundle of joy would be discovered and protected by Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), local Michael Myers expert who was but a boy when Michael first unleashed his fury on the town of Haddonfield.Another historical revival in this movie was the Myers house. It has now been reoccupied with a bunch more Strodes (distant cousins of Laurie I suppose) though it was an abandoned derelict edifice in parts 4 and 5. Apparently, the Strode clan moved to Haddonfield, Illinois to live in a house in which untold horrors happened just so we can have some more Strodes in the movie. They were largely irrelevant besides the little boy Danny Strode (Devin Gardner). It's clear they were setting him up to be the heir apparent to Michael Myers by him hearing the same ""voice"" Michael heard before he butchered his sister.Tommy Doyle, Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan), Danny Strode, and baby get away in the end by pumping Michael full of tranquilizers and beating him with a lead pipe until he stayed still.Just like the last few episodes there was nothing redeemable from this one. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) was back for his last hurrah (he died before the movie was released), but his character had long since become an automaton. No other character was remotely lifelike. Every character was a cliché as were the deaths. The two a-hole characters were summarily killed as though they were created for that purpose. The two sexually active teens were killed because that's also an automatic in scary movies. The other half dozen or so were killed just to keep the body count high, while, of course, one woman lives as well as any kids. The whole thing was a fruitless grasping of straws to try to revitalize the ""Halloween"" name. The way I see it, if it had a pulse, they snuffed it out.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
19,Uriah43,If at First You Don't Succeed...,4,25 November 2019,"This film essentially begins with a young woman giving birth to a child in a makeshift prison where she has been held against her will. As it so happens, the woman is none other than ""Jamie Lloyd"" (J. C. Brandy) who was kidnapped at the end of the preceding film and the baby she is delivering has been fathered by ""Michael Myers"" (played by George P. Wilbur) and soon to be sacrificed by a Druid cult who has kept Jamie alive for 6 years for that specific purpose. But before their plans can be realized Jamie manages to escape with her newborn son and flees in a pickup truck in the direction of Haddonfeld, Illinois with Michael and his Druid followers right behind. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this particular installment of the Halloween franchise turned out to be somewhat confusing due in part to poor direction and also the fact that an alternate version was released after the first one tested poorly before a selected audience. So some scenes were deleted in favor of others which subsequently changed certain parts of the overall story-to include the ending. Yet as bewildering as much of this is-while neither of the two versions were terribly bad-both could have used a bit more suspense and for that reason I have rated them equally. Slightly below average.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Brandy: Perhaps the best sequel to Halloween while still being a graphic mess. Broader plot concept emphasizes the curse that killer Michael Myers left upon a small town. Jamie Lloyd gives birth to a son that is to be the final sacrifice to Myers but she flees and makes a frantic phone call to a radio station in hopes that Dr. Sam Loomis will hear her. A now grown Tommy Doyle watches the Strode house from across the street and overhears her cries over the radio. Upon arrival at a bus station he finds Lloyd's baby but she has been murdered. The rest is numerous graphic murders. Directed by Joe Chappelle with Donald Pleasence playing Loomis for the last time. He overhears Lloyd's cries for help and travels to the scene only to unearth old secrets that lead to a questionable ending. Paul Rudd plays Doyle who watches the house and determined to protect the child from Myers. Marianne Hagan overacts as the heroine living in the Strode house. Mitchell Ryan plays the mysterious man in black who knows not what he is attempting to control. J.C. Brandy gives a riveting performance as Jamie Lloyd who escapes her captors leaving her baby to safety knowing her fate is sealed. Cursed as pointless graphic mayhem but at least given a decent send off. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Absolutely amazing entry without any real flaws,10,1 November 2012,"Trying to move on with her life, a woman moves back to her hometown unaware of her connection to the Michael Myers bloodline and faces his wrath when he escapes from a sanitarium and resumes his blood-soaked rampage in town.This one here manages to be one of the more enjoyable entries in the series and might very well better than the original. One of the strongest elements for this one derives numerous positive attributes from is the fact that this is pretty creepy at times as it adds an extra layer to the film with a large quantity of quality suspenseful scenes, which this one has in spades. From the opening underground escape where the different tunnels coming out leads to several impressive and chilling confrontations while the candle-lit walkways and raging thunderstorm create and wonderfully chilling air, and the later bus station stalking during the storm is truly unnerving, while the other great stalking scenes here include the house stalking and a second time where a fellow one returns home to suspect something's wrong only to find nothing there. The best attack here comes from the sneak-attack on the couple in the house where the whole thing is watched from a telescope across the street only to learn her son has wandered over to check out the house and the later encounter in the house with the cult members also come off really well and are quite suspenseful. As well, there's plenty to love about the graphic kills and deaths here, which is one of the best angles here with just a ton of greatness provided with a wide variety of kills delivered with a generous dose of methods, from stabbing to impaling to thrusting into the body and bare-handed, among others, to provide a spectacular array of bloody deaths dished out rather nicely. Another fun part here is the really enjoyable action all throughout here, with the massacre of the family home alone delivering some solid fun here with the great kills pulling them all together, the grand encounter back in the house trying to get back her son and confronting Michael inside leading to a fantastic stalking scene through the house and out to the street to safety and the rampage through the hospital which has an utter ton of fun where the chase along the hallways to get her out and into the tunnels along with the highlight sequence of him absolutely massacring the operating room team leading to the escape back through the tunnels and out through the main room which is a thrilling series of scenes as it provides some really chilling moments that work well and give this an outstanding pace. The last part that works well here is the fact that, as a straight slasher movie, this delivers impeccably, which is important since these should feature an imposing killer. The creepy mask has never looked better, with the face seemingly rougher and even colder looking than ever before, the more hulking shape to his body is more credible for doling out the more strenuous physical action and the walk is genuinely creepy, a complete stalk and slash attitude, coming relentlessly with no remorse offered to his victims. These here give this one so much to like that even the film's lone flaw doesn't mean much. This one strains a lot of credibility here with the fact it's trying to ascertain the fact that Michael Myers was a druid and able to be protected by a strange cult of genetic scientists carrying on that legacy, has nothing remotely plausible and should've been rejected here for how little it connects to the series. While the story might be give-or-take depending on how you feel it connects to the rest of the series, it's really the only thing wrong here as this is an otherwise outstanding effort.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, and a brief sex scene.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
22,AaronCapenBanner,A God-Awful Mess.,1,12 September 2013,"Part VI takes place six years after the fifth film ends, with a young woman(said to be Jamie Lloyd, but played by a different actress) escaping the mysterious cult that held her prisoner, along with her baby, with Michael Myers once again in murderous, relentless pursuit. She leaves the baby behind in a bus depot for safety, only to be brutally dispatched by Michael... However, a now grown Tommy Doyle(one of the kids that Laurie Strode babysat from the original) tracks down Doctor Loomis(played for the last time by a sickly Donald Pleasance) to take the baby themselves, leading to a showdown where many shocking revelations will be uncovered...Though well intended by writer Daniel Farrands as a satisfying finale to the series, this entry proved to be an unmitigated disaster, sabotaged by atrocious & shameful rewriting, editing and directing, rendering the film a crass, incoherent mess.

23,movieman_kev,The Producer's Cut,4,14 April 2005,"After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers we flashback to 1989 where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby. In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut. The Score is much better, more in line with parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitar BS. And the ending makes a tad more sense. For these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and cuts back on the gore factor (Halloween, unlike say the ""Friday the 13th"" Franschise, was never about blatant gore) is why I prefer this bootleg Producer's cut. Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold, it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible. The whole cult plot is still very stupid, as is Micheal fathering a kid My Producer's Cut Grade: C- My Theatrical Cut Grade: D-",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
24,Aaron1375,"Well, it wasn't good, but they did try something different...",4,28 September 2015,"This was one of only two Halloween films I had not seen yet (Resurrection being the other) as it was one I kind of put off because I heard it was not that good. I had it on a horror movie collection so I decided to give it a shot as I felt like watching a horror film. Suffice to say, it was not that good of a film, but I thought it would be worse. I actually like this one more than H2O; however, that is not saying much as I absolutely hated that one. Here they were trying something different, but in the end thanks to last minute changes the third act is very much an incomprehensible mess. I have seen some of what was going to be the ending and it manages to explain things better as far as what the deal was with the cult and baby, but it too, was no masterpiece as it did some very strange things too. This was Donald Pleasence's last role, and seeing him in this one you can tell he was not going to be around much longer. He apparently liked what they were planning to do with this film, but apparently a lot of changes were made on the fly which resulted in a big train wreck at the end.The story tries to explain Michael's killing tendencies...which is probably mistake one. Never try to explain things in a horror film as you take away from the mystique of premise and at worse makes the killer seem less threatening. Well, the girl from the previous films has had a child and a strange cult is after said baby and they may or may not use Michael to get said child or he could be acting on his own as the ending I saw has him going into super kill mode killing everyone. Apparently, the boy from the first one is all grown up and sort of crazy now and he thinks he has figured out why Michael does what he does, while Loomis enjoying retirement comes out to hunt Michael again, while a family has arguments about the daughter coming to live with her parents and attending college and the mom is the same one from the film Better Off Dead. A lot of subplots going on here! So the film did have an alternate ending, which focused more on the cult than Michael at the end. I think Michael literally stops in that one using the thorn symbol. It may not have been the mess this ending was, but from what I have heard the character of Winn passed the responsibility to being Michael's keeper onto Dr. Loomis. This is insane as why would a man who is younger make the older and much more feeble man his successor? That was just insane! The ending we do get though just has Michael randomly begin killing all the cult and you do not even get an explanation as to what they were exactly doing and the ending looks incomplete, almost as if it were a deleted scene or something.So, this film was not good, but it held my interest. I liked that they tried something different and while bad as least it was not H2O suck. That film is an hour of hand falling on shoulder, music cue and then a ""Don't do that!"" as it is revealed said hand did not belong to Myers, but some dopey friend. There were some good kills in this one and this one had more of a Halloween feel to it than did the previous two films. Those two looked as if someone half halfheartedly draped a few Halloween decorations here and there. The cast is interesting featuring a very tired Donald Pleasence and a lot of people whose acting is like cardboard or over actors chewing the scenery. The lead girl was also one of the most unattractive girls I have ever seen in a film of this type. She looked anorexic and from what I read the producers thought as much too. She almost looked like she were on crack or heroin. So, another Halloween film down leaving only Resurrection as a Halloween I have not seen. Do not want to either as that is a continuation of the H2O time line and I fear that one may be the worst one to me in the series!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
25,Wuchakk,A mess of a sequel,4,7 November 2018,"Six years after Michael Myers previously terrorized Haddonfield, Illinois, 'the Shape' returns in pursuit of his niece, Jamie Lloyd, who has escaped some shadowy Druid cult with her newborn. Marianne Hagan and Paul Rudd play the main protagonists while Donald Pleasence returns for his last portrayal of Dr. Loomis. Mitchell Ryan and Kim Darby are also on hand.""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" (1995) is also known as ""Halloween 6,"" but it's actually only the fifth movie featuring Michael Myers seeing as how ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch"" (1982) is totally disconnected from the Michael Myers story arc.I'm a fan of ""Halloween 4"" (1988) and ""Halloween 5"" (1989), especially the former, as it was actually better than the original movie (1978) and is one of the finest examples of 80's slashers. Naturally I was expecting a quality sequel but, wow, this installment lacked any sense of cinematic finesse whatsoever.The entire opening act is a tortuous mess and the story didn't even start to get interesting until past the 50-minute mark. Unfortunately, it failed to build on what little interest it mustered, trading it in for conventional horror thrills at a hospital à la ""Halloween 2"" (1981). But the characters are too weakly developed to care about; it's like the 'writer' had no concept of how to establish characters or even tell a compelling story. Meanwhile the sudden-shock scares that kept surfacing were eye-rolling hackneyed and anything but scary.This installment was the equivalent of Conan the Barbarian picking up an expensive guitar and trying to play for a classy prog band like Opeth.The movie runs 1 hour, 27 minutes and was shot in Salt Lake City, Utah.GRADE: C-",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
26,The_Void,Complete waste of time,3,27 April 2006,"Halloween 6 was the only Halloween film I hadn't seen (before I watched it), which means that I've now completely wasted my time on no less than eight Halloween films. Given that each film has an approximate running time of ninety minutes, that means I have wasted 12 hours of my time on this rubbish, which of course, amounts to half a day. I feel sick. Quite why I worked my way through a series that I don't like is anyone's guess, but anyway...let's get on to reviewing this film. In fairness, at least Halloween 6 tries to do something a bit different than the usual slash-fest. It fails to create anything interesting, but the fact that it tried is admirable. We follow the birth of Michael's child by his niece(?!) Jamie Lloyd. The film harks back to the original by throwing in series stalwart Dr Loomis again, as well as some boy named Tommy, who was apparently the kid that was being babysat by Michael's sister in the first film. The film introduces the largely unoriginal idea of a cult worshipping Myers, but the real crux of the story follows the idea that maybe Michael isn't solely responsible for his actions.Michael Myers has always been a rampant and really rather dull man with a knife, but The Curse of Michael Myers attempts to give him a little backbone by way of the idea that maybe he was possessed by demons that made him kill his sister and all those other people. This is obviously just an attempt to inject some life into a very much dead series. It fails because there's barely any interest generated. Scriptwriter Daniel Farrands tries to create some mystery and intrigue, but personally I just didn't care. The main reason why many people find Michael Myers frightening is for the fact that he is cold, completely insane and relentless, so the idea of his actions not being his fault is as stupid and needless as a sixth instalment of the Halloween series. The acting is typically rubbish, with the only standout being Donald Pleasance, who chews the scenery once again in his (unfortunately) most famous role. Pleasance died before this film was released, and in my opinion it's a shame that he wasted so much of his time in the Dr Loomis role. After seeing his early performances in films like Cul-De-Sac and The Flesh and the Fiends, it's obvious that Pleasance was a talented actor who is better than films like this. I don't know what Halloween fans would make of this movie and I don't care. To be honest, I'm too upset about the fact that I've wasted half a day on these films.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
27,trashgang,try to see the producer's cut,7,17 November 2011,"Dimension was the new name in horror and they bought the rights of the Halloween franchise. So after half a decade Halloween was back on the map. Dimension asked to the producer Moustapha Akkad to bring Michael back to the screen. Not without a few problems. Halloween 5 was a big flop and ended with a mystery man, dressed in black. On the other hand 1995 wasn't a time were horror was popular. We had to wait one year before the horror hype restarted with 'Scream'. But there were other troubles too, the film's troubled production history didn't bode well, as Halloween 6 sort of set the precedent for Dimension Films to screw up sequels to horror franchises. Dimension asked to have a few audience tests to see their reaction but it failed which led to the decision to recut Halloween 6. By recutting it they brought the movie back from 96 minutes to 88 minutes. What was left was a mess of a flick and was brought out as The Curse Of Michael Myers. What's in a name, it became a curse and Halloween geeks cursed a way to see the producer's cut. Up to today the producer's cut hasn't been available on official release. But there are ways to find it, on many sites you can find the way to see the original flick edited by fans. By doing that you can easily see the difference because it's made with DVD and VHS (producer's cut)material. They brought back Donald Pleasence who was a sick man by then it became his last flick he made before he died. But Halloween 6 flopped even more in the franchise then 5 and 4. Even though I liked it more then 5 or 4. You are attached to the screen from the beginning until the end. Of course the story sucks a bit here and there especial in the part of the Druids. But the director Joe Chappelle didn't copy John Carpenter and he kept the mystery of Michael Myers. You could even hear him breath like in the original one. And George P Wilbur is doing his best here as Michael and it was a good effort he did. It's also a slasher made out of the slasher era and is really overlooked by many fans. If it would have been released one year later it would have been a blockbuster due 'Scream'. Sadly, it was released earlier with a story were nothing is revealed...or you must have seen the producer's cut.I did and by seeing that I thought that there would have been cuts in the gory part as it did, there's a lot more of Dr. Loomis in it and there's more into the Druids part which explains a lot. And that was a good thing, Part 5 left us with a few questions, who was the man in black, what happened to Jamie LLoyd and what did the tattoo mean on Michael's arm? The producer's cut explains it all, the theatrical didn't. If you see the theatrical cut then it's simple, the tattoo didn't man anything and Jamie dies quickly, okay Jamie's dead is more cruel in the T-cut. Nobody picked it as a fan of the genre and I said it before, the producer's cut explained it much more. The exploding head in the T-cut was left out of the P-cut, there are so many differences but you really need to see the P-cut. It goes deeper into the characters.I won't go too deep into the end scene but it explains a lot more then the T-cut ending.But at the end of the day, it's so strange that part 3, without Michael sold more and is more hyped then part 4 or 5 or even part 6. But I loved part 6 as I said before more then 4 and 5 so it's essential that you watch it. Go to the dark passages of the web and capture yourself a copy of the P-cut. All your questions will be revealed an you won't be cursed with the T-cut anymore. To say it in other words, nothing is explained in T-cut bit it's much gorier then the P-cut. Both have a completely different ending so you have to see both, but I prefer the P-cut. Maybe they should have left the gore in it then it would have been perfect. So with this flick you can see what can happen towards a flick. A director can make a good flick but if Dimension decides to cut out the story and put gore into it you have a complete different flick.Gore 1/5 (P-cut) 3/5 (T-cut) Nudity 1/5 Effects 2/5 (P-cut) 3/5 (P-cut) Story 3/5 (P-cut) 2/5 (T-cut) Comedy 0/5",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

29,Smells_Like_Cheese,Not too bad actually,6,8 November 2004,"Actually, after seeing the rating on Halloween 6, I have to admit that I was a bit scared to see this movie, not because it's a horror story, but because it just had a low rating. But still I wanted to complete the Halloween series and when I rented this movie, I was really surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I think the rating is a bit harsh, this story brought us back into the story with Jamie, even though a warning in advance, she does get killed off with this sequel, I liked how they continued the story with one of the original characters, Tommy Doyle. It was cool to see him grown up and how the events of 1978 effected him. Honestly I don't know why this movie has a lower rating than Halloween 5, but I guess to each his own, but I really do think this story carries itself a lot better.Michael Myers, his niece Jamie Lloyd, and the mysterious Man in Black have all been in hiding for six years. It is revealed that the Man in Black is the leader of a Druid-like cult, and the Man in Black kidnapped Jamie and had her impregnated. The baby is born on Halloween Eve and is carried away by the Man in Black. Later that night, a nurse helps Jamie and her baby escape. Michael Myers, in pursuit of Jamie and her newborn, kills the nurse. Jamie, meanwhile, steals the truck and flees to a dark and empty bus station where she calls in to a radio show that happens to be doing a broadcast about the Haddonfield murders. Jamie gets on the air, begging for help and warning of Michael's imminent return. Beaten and exhausted, she makes her way inside of an old barn where Michael is waiting for her. He kills Jamie, only to find that Jamie does not have the baby. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house across the street from the boarding house where he lives. The boarding house is run by a mysterious old woman named Minnie. Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind the murderous motives of Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie begging for help on a local radio show, Tommy finds her baby at the bus station and takes him into hiding. The people living in the Myers house are relatives of the Strode family, and among the current residents are Kara Strode and her son Danny. The plot takes a turn when the Man in Black finally reveals himself as Dr. Wynn from the original Halloween. Wynn has been experimenting with pure evil, does he think this is a good idea? Happy Halloween.Granted, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is very different than the other Halloween stories, but I think this was a good pick up. Plus you have to admit that Jamie's death is very effective and scary. The whole cult thing was a bit much, but still I think it was a good scare factor to add into the story. The acting is better I think and the writing was a little more accurate. Plus unlike Halloween 5, Michael actually scared me again, thank God, I was getting a little frightened that he was loosing his touch and his butcher knife. So I do recommend this movie if you're looking to complete the series or if you're just looking for a good scare.6/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Micheal's story starts getting worse by adding occult elements and having Michael to become more of a virtually indestructible being than before.I watch the movie more as a guilty-pleasure rather than for a good movie to view. It is quite entertaining but definitely a stereo-typical slasher film series by now.

32,thesar-2,"Cursed, the audience is",1,22 August 2009,"'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' was absolutely, utterly, disgustingly bad. Suffice to say it's the worst of the 'Halloween' franchise. Easier for me to say it's on my list of worst movies ever. Incoherent, inconsistent, incomplete, unsupenseful, unforgiving and wretched this vile was. As a childhood (not so much anymore) fan of the series, I was dying to see the loose ends #5 left wide-open and had to wait 6 whole years in excited anticipation. (I guess I never learned my lesson about time apart from sequels make a better follow-up; I still had high expectations for 'Indy 4.') This garbage is what they came up with their time off? Plot holes (a dozen never fleshed out) the size of the Grand Canyon, unfinished script – see jaw-dropping finale (?), original story lines changed – I guess in #1, 6-year-old Michael was being babysat by a third-party never shown before and a case for CPS to sue Director Chappelle on how a baby, in character or not, was treated, abandoned (multiple times) and has a knife used on him. Paul Rudd, dear God, I know this was your first film; you probably needed a start and may have been a Myers fan as I was growing up, but really? Thank goodness, you did grow out of this and become a fine actor. Needless to say, I hated this movie. It's hard to give a plot breakdown, but I'll try: some cult apparently kidnapped Jamie & Michael 6 years ago at the end of #5, but Jamie waited until about 9 months ago to conceive and the movie opens with her giving birth. Obviously, Michael, bent on being the last Myers is after the child.

There's also some nonsense about Tommy Doyle (from the first Halloween movie), a baby, a man in black, and a cult called Thorn.It's really hard to fathom how the Halloween series went from the atmospheric brilliance of the original film to the Gawd-awful mess called Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I really don't have much of anything positive to say. Most importantly, the script is a disaster. I know there's a longer cut out there that's supposed to clear-up some of the problems with the script, but no thanks. I'm not going to watch an extra 45 minutes just to get more on the utterly ridiculous man in black and Thorn. Who could care less? You have to work hard to write a Halloween script that's this boring, predictable, and unscary. Add to that mostly bad acting, unlikable characters, silly dialogue, terrible music, and a complete lack of logic, and you've reached the absolute nadir of the Halloween series.Watching Paul Rudd in Halloween 6, it's hard to imagine he would go on to have the career he has.

Still, I found the attempts to explain his origin mostly fascinating. It's the easiest, the laziest and the greediest thing to present a killer without a motive and to keep bringing him back for more sequels even though he should be dead. Why do people say that this series never contained supernatural elements? When Myers is shot six times in ""Halloween"" and nevertheless lives, was that ""natural""?  Script and direction were a bit muddled, but not TOO muddled: I've never seen ""Halloween 5"", yet the plot made sense to me, even if some details didn't. The classic music score has been unfortunately altered, but as a whole this sixth entry seems to be somewhat underrated - ""Halloween II"" is much more boring.

The cult want's to keep Michael's bloodline going to have him in many future Halloween sequels.In what looks like a boiler room we see Jamie Llyod give birth and then take off with her new born son with the help of a nurse as Michael goes after her. The movie never explains what exactly Jamie or Jamie's child has to do with Michael Myers unless you saw ""Halloween V"" and even then it's a bit confusing. We get to see Michael Myers in action all throughout the movie murdering a number of people with what look like the local police being on strike. I can't remember seeing a single cop during the entire movie! It's also a bit confusing in just what the Druid angle in Michael Myers life is? Since he seems totally oblivious to their mumbo-jumbo about him being some kind of Durid cousin to the Demon Torn. Michael just goes through the motions killing people like he did in the previous five movies as if he could't care less if he's a Druid or not.The entire Druid connection to Michael Myers completely falls apart in the last ten minutes of the movie with Myers going nuts, as usual, and killing the Druid Cult that's supposed to be worshiping him! Which showed to me that he didn't fall for their BS about himself being one of them.Staking out the Strode House, where he was brought up, Michael goes to work killing both Debra and John Strode with Kara, Debra's daughter, taking off with her son Danny to next door neighbor Tommy ""Peeping Tom"" Doyle. A survivor of a previous massacre engineered by Michael Myers. Besides the slaughter of the Druid Cult at the end of the film Mayers not only killed the people, or their relatives, who he was somehow involved with in the previous five ""Halloween"" movies. Micael also ends up killing the obnoxious and annoying shock-jock Barry Simms who tried to do his Halloween Show at the former Myers, now Strode, house.It's hard to make sense of the movie since it never tried to make any sense at all with it having every few minutes in it a brutal and bloody murder, in care of Michael Myers, just to keep you from realizing how senseless it really is! The fact that it's star Donald Pleasence died while it was being filmed left a giant hole in it that the makers of ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" weren't able to fill.Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis looked like he was dying in the few scenes that he was in the movie and it wasn't because he was told by the director that he was supposed to look that way, he just could't help it. The end has Myers, after taking about three dozens whacks to the head with an iron pole, disappear into the night leaving only his William Shatner mask behind. Were never told what happened to Jamie's baby that Michael seemed so found of, was he the baby's father? We can only guess that he'll be back again and as it happened ""Halloween VII"" did have Michael Myers return but it. That movie completely forgot in it's storyline what happened in ""Halloween VI"" as if it were never made!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
36,lost-in-limbo,The curse is here to stay.,4,6 February 2009,"Ah, the 'The Curse of Michael Myers' what a particularly odd inclusion to the series. There was a time when I didn't even know this entry even existed, until a friend brought it up. When I first watched it, I was left with a bitter taste in the mouth that I probably had wished it stayed out of my mind. Halloween 5 (where my memory of has faded, so another viewing is in order), followed by Halloween; H20 sounded good enough. Over time the often mentioned producers cut has peaked my interest to see how/or if this cut could improve on the theatrical version. But first I'm curious to watch the original take again to see if the film is as bad as its labelled, or it was just disappointment that filled my first viewing.You know what I didn't seem to mind it all that much the second time around. That's not excusing the problems the feature does have though. Mainly due the confusing plot (involving the occult Thor theory and the influence over Devin Gardener's character) and messy editing and what was with that groan-inducing ending. The to-the-point simplicity is what made the original great and to a degree the first sequel, but trying for depth it becomes overly convoluted for its own good. Where credit is due, at least it's trying take it in a different direction (leading off from 'Halloween 5') even though the concept is bewildering as I guess you can only go so far before getting stale with the standard stalk and slash formula. The opening sequence involving Jamie and her baby being stalked by Michael Myers is atmospherically done (surprisingly there are few inclusions), but it does seem to drag on. Even the heart-racing violence is bloodier, and quite nasty with little in the way of thought. Myers is more like a furious predator here, where he seems to pick up the pace (power walking which leads to very heavy breathing) and lose that silent manner in the way he went about things. There's something quite different to his presence, and a brittle-looking Donald Pleasence returns to preach his 'pure evil' theory. Too bad his role is so minor, that now his Loomis character is a throwaway part to be there for the sake of it. I don't remember him even sharing any screen time with Myers. Having the Tommy character (who Laurie Strode was babysitting in the original film) played by with a weird intensity by Paul Rudd was a neat touch. Marianne Hagan is wholesomely solid too. Leo Geter is amusing as radio disc jockey.Director Joe Chappelle persistently engulfs the films with stark and flashy visuals, but there was a professional slickness and tightness about it. The jolts are foreseeable, but there are moments of creepiness and dash of suspense. The zesty pace helps too. The positioning work with camera and the use of shadows seem to play an important part to the Myers character. Makeshift editing aside, I can't put a fault on Chappelle's handling. The score keeps the traditional edge, but packs a screaming sting with its squealing electric guitar cues. I have really done a back-flip on my initial thoughts.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
37,ericstevenson,Stupid as always,3,25 October 2017,"When I saw the beginning of this movie, I thought it was showing Michael Myers being born. I mean, the whole movie is about Michael's origin, right? Anyway, it was actually an older Jamie Strode giving birth. We don't get to visually see Michael Myers' origin which was a huge negative in this film. It's mentioned that there's this cult called the Thorn that apparently made Michael kill his family. It's led by a guy named Dr. Wynn who was also in the last movie. He's described by Dr. Loomis as being more evil than even Michael Myers.This is an interesting character and they do practically nothing with him at all! Loomis gets captured and he escapes with no explanation. He wonders why the cult didn't kill him right away and we never find that out! It's just the villains being morons. Slasher movies can't kill children so instead they age up a character and then kill her. How nice. There's more deaths like in any other movie and it's to be expected of these dumb movies. It's poorly shot, pointless and ugly. *1/2",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

39,Bored_Dragon,"So far, the most boring part of the most boring horror franchise",4,17 March 2019,"Even when they are born from an exceptional movie, franchises rarely reach the sixth part, and when they do, it usually does not work. Then what to expect from the sixth part of the franchise in which even the earlier films were nothing special. Moreover, it is a mystery to me how a mediocre horror such as ""Halloween"" ever grew into a franchise, let alone how this franchise came so far. Although filmed quite decently, the movie is totally meaningless, dull and boring, and the only good thing in it is a legendary music theme, which is essentially the only good thing in the whole franchise.4/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
40,ironhorse_iv,If there is a motion picture from the Halloween franchise that might cause me to curse a blue streak. It would probably be this. It's awful.,4,30 October 2020,"Formerly called 'Halloween 666: The Origins of Michael Myers' before the name change. The story written by Daniel Farrands really did strayed too far from the concept of the original film that was praised for its simple slow burn story of a suspenseful mask murderer killing babysitters on Halloween night. Now the plot of this rapid 1995 slasher film directed by Joe Chapelle is over complicated. Set six years after the events of the last movie ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', the flick now has a now adult Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) trying to save the last surviving relatives of the Strode family from the hands of a sadistic cult ordering the shape (George Wilbur) to murder; in order to gain his gift of immortality through genetic engineering. Without spoiling this horrible horror movie too much, this flick suffered not only from a poorly executed backstory for Michael's killing spree that diminished what made him scary in the first place, but it really killed the lore of the first movie. Apparently, it was the cult that babysit Michael on that fateful night in 1963 rather than his sibling. Don't get me wrong, the concept isn't a bad idea, but they wasted a perfect misopportunity to tied 1982 film 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' with the rest of the series by having Silver Shamrock company be the villains. That would be a lot better than what we got. Although, I wasn't disappointed with the mysterious Man in Black revealed. It does explain how Myers was able to learn how to drive. Nevertheless, the plot change yet again from heavily executive meddling when the original version ending involving Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) performed poorly with test audiences despite decent acting from him. Because of that, the movie went through a series of reshoots that Pleasence couldn't take part with, due to his death from heart failure. Not only was a new out of place clumsy horror comedic style ending shot anyway without him, but over twenty minutes of other footage was cut down or changed such as his voice over narrative in the beginning & his interaction with the rest of the cast. Other cult plot was also change as the new version really tries to downplay the highly unlikeable incest rape angle by having the baby's father be more ambiguous. Another thing that was altered was Michael Myers style of killing. In previous movies he would time and choose who to kill and not to, based on relationship and logically reasons. In this movie, he's more like a mindless tool that murders anybody with no reason but his own. He even became sloppier, as the film wanted a more over the top campy 'Friday the 13th' monstrous gory feel with his murders. It's kinda out of character. Along with that, this version of the movie had more annoying cliches lame false jump scare sound effects that add little to no spine curling thrills. The music that went with Myers was also completing change from the classic sounds of the original two films to a really dated rock-oriented post grudge era version of the Halloween theme. Then all of this was badly edited together by Randolph K. Bricker with rapid visual epilepsy strobing effect with the original footage and released to the public by Dimension Films. The results were gaping plot holes like why the Strode family were living in the supernatural every changing Myer house in the first place. Things like that rendered the movie nearly incomprehensible. While the film did make some bank at the box office, the negative response from critics and fans hurt the home video market. It got so bad that people started to seek out a bootleg of the original workprint of the film. This version dubbed the Producer's Cut despite them being the one to blame for the mess; featured 45 minutes of cut footage. Most audience members seemed to think that the film is more watchable with those scenes. Sadly, I really don't think the same, as I don't give a tinker's curse about it. I found both versions to be equally as terrible. All of them kept the radio shock jock Barry Simms (Leo Geter) subplot. Even if the filmmakers got their original choices for the role, Howard Stern or Mike Myers. It should had been cut. Those scenes were a total waste of time as it adds nothing to the overall plot. Pointless. Then there is the mistreatment of the previous movie protagonist Jamie Lloyd now played by J.C Brady who replaced Danielle Harris due to salary dispute. The whole 1960s 'Psycho' shock vibe opening was a bit overkilled. That character deserved better than to getting kidnap, rape and then brutally murder. It's depressing and tragic. The replacement final girl Kara Strode (Marianne Hagen) didn't really stand out for me even with the unrealistic stunts that the character is put through. As the other main lead. Rudd's acting for the most part in this film is very unconvincing as a reclusive post-trauma trouble youth. Toward the end he falls back into his normal comedic skit. Still it's lightyears better than the nurse actress that broke character by laughing in the beginning. If you take away the disbelief of an ex-child prisoners being able to drive and nobody noticing a baby at a bus station. Her reaction perhaps ruined the overall thriller suspenseful mood of the film as it became a laughing stock as the flick went on. The tone of the action was all over the place nor did it make much sense. Overall: This might be just a stab in the dark, but this movie has to be the most butchered film from them all. No wonder why 1998's 'Halloween H20' was a partial reboot. In the end, even with the 1980 'Shining' references. This movie was overkill. A Halloween film neither a sweet trick or treat.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

42,zkonedog,"A Curse, Indeed",1,11 March 2017,"After watching the fourth and fifth installments of this franchise, I found myself wondering how things could possibly get any worse. I now have my answer.For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween 6"" sees Michael Myers (now controlled by the curse of Thorn) continuing his reign of terror directed at the Strode/Lloyd family. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is back on the case, while Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), the little kid from the first film, once again comes out of the woodwork to try and protect Jamie Lloyd's child an destroy Myers.Basically, unless you get a supposed ""director's cut"" of this film, which does not exist on DVD at this time, this movie (in the theatrical version) is one of the most disjointed pieces of cinema you will ever see. It tries to establish some inkling of the evil forces that drive Myers, but fails miserably and only ends up confusing things further. There is also no continuity from the previous films, with certain elements just dropped or forgotten.The acting isn't any better. Pleasance hobbles around and spouts the same tired warning and evil clichés, while all Rudd does is walk around with a dazed expression on his face. No cute little girls (like Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5) to save this dreck.To add insult to injury, the Myers character is (by this point) so screwed up as to be almost unrecognizable from the original. The new mask evokes laughs, not horror, and he looks pudgy and even runs after a victim on one occasion.Basically, this is a terrible film by any and all accounts. It has actually achieved a sort of cult status for its terrible-ness, but don't let that bait you: if you don't watch this movie, you aren't missing a thing.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

So lets move on from that.We now have something new, the cult. It was introduced if you look for clues in the previous movie and some argue it was introduced in part 2. I like the cult aspect and I don't. I like how it gives more backstory to Myers beyond the desire to exterminate his whole family. I don't like how it's a bit of a distraction from Myers himself who now shares his power with others (the cult) instead of just being his uniqueness.This is the end of the trilogy within the sequels as this stage.

However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

It was a non sense scene that only confused fans of the series for years! The explanation couldn't be worse.Thorn? 666? Astrology? That has nothing to do with the Myers we love. Come on, his butcher knife was more interesting that the sub-plots in this movie. Dr. Loomis' obsession with him was something interesting but having a sub plot about the occult was just pointless and absurd.Donald Pleasence is the best thing about the movie. He delivers a solid, creepy performance. Sadly, this was his last movie. One of the best characters in Horror cinema history.Anyways, there's minimal gore and no scares. This is the worst Halloween movie that was influenced by the ""Scream"" era. Myers is not the main character anymore, now he's just a stupid killing machine whose motives are really stupid.I recommend this movie only for die hard fans of the series.

Prom Night 1 was enough for me and Nightmare on Elm Street was played out for me by episode 3 (until much later, after A New Nightmare). Leprechaun in Space was enough of THAT franchise for me and after Hellraiser 4, I lost interest in those too...for a while. I must admit, that after Halloween 3: Season of the Witch, I lost interest in the Halloween line until H20 was released. THAT was a kick @ss Halloween movie. It inspired me to catch up with the rest of the series I had missed over the years. Now, I own the whole set. This franchise is not yet tired. It is not yet trite. There are still elements and plot lines which can be followed, and Hall6ween: the Curse of Michael Myers is a worthy installment to this franchise and far superior to H5.SPOILERSThe story attempts to further explain the actions and behavior of Michael Myers. In this installment, we discover that there is a black cult behind Michael; fostering him, helping him magickally heal, and driving him to kill and kill again.Donald Pleasence is a sheer delight delivering nothing less than the poignant and dramatic performance you expect of him. Alas! This was to be his last Halloween. RIP, Mr. Pleasence. We will miss you. The direction this time around carries the movie through with an even flow, decent portrayals, and a strong climactic ending to a suspenseful edge of your seat horror movie. I found it was one of the superior films of the line. Some critics have discredited this particular installment for trying too hard to be intelligent, aspiring to be more than what is possible for a movie of this sort, and taking itself too seriously. I find all these statements to be untrue. It does not try to be intelligent, it does have intelligence in the story. One has but to possess the intelligence to understand the plot. I think Wes Craven demonstrated all too well what is possible for the slasher genre, as he redefined this genre with his latest trilogy. It also does not take itself too seriously. This is one of those horror movies which knows it's a horror movie and does its best to convey that feeling and atmosphere with keen precision.There were a few things I would have done differently, were I the director, however. The first and foremost being making Michael at least as tall as he was in the first few movies. I mean, he's not short, by any means, but he's not nearly as tall as he was. He seems to have lost about 6 inches this time around. Platform shoes would have made the difference, but apparently they thought no one would mind or notice?The chase down the red corridor scene. As Michael is chasing the doctor down the hallway, and ends up squishing his face between the bars, it occurred to me that Michael is slower than usual. To make up for the attempt to bestow him with ""Mummy's Walk,"" the director also had the doctor fall down five times to compensate. That was an obvious contrivance and it lessened the value of that scene. The hair on Michael's mask appeared to have been sucked on by a thousand dead rats and the face was whiter. I realize at some point they changed out the ""Shatner"" mask, but (as in 4 & 5) they could have at least made the attempt to keep them similar in final appearance.Back to the positive, this is one of the less splatter-oriented and more psychological chapters in the Michael Book. Instead, the cheap Hollywood gore was replaced with intelligence and story, but not all together, as this was billed as one of the more violent of this line.It rates just below the original at a 7.7/10.the Fiend :.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

51,Polaris_DiB,Form of explanation,3,5 May 2007,"After the complete inanity that was the last film, producer Moustapha Akkad had an extremely damaged franchise, and this movie pretty much advertises itself as an explanation for everything that has preceded it. The first half of the film works overtime to bandage the damage done by the last movie, but unfortunately the audience is here for carnage and no one involved really has the energy. By the time the movie ends, we have some explanation but the film itself is still not really complete.Six years after Halloween 5, Jamie is raped and gives birth to a child by a cult that is somehow connected to Michael's strange ways (oh, and his somewhat supernatural ability to survive copious amounts of gun shots, explosions, beatings, and stabbings). She manages to escape and heads to (where else?) Haddonfield, where the local populace is trying to bring back the joy and fun of Halloween after their horrible experiences from previous films. Introduce a cast of characters including the Strodes, who have moved into Michael's house, line them up, and let the carnage begin.This movie does some pretty decent work backing up a bit and finally explaining some of the mysteries of Michael's ways. On the other hand, one of the best parts of Michael's character is simply the fact that we don't know who he is--we never see his face, he never talks, and there's little reason why he kills (the first was psychosexual in nature, from there it's been mostly typical random slasher flick stuff). Now we have to deal with cultists and the supernatural (probably the series' single tie to Halloween 3), and it all gets to be so much that by the time the film starts making sense, it abruptly ends... something like the abrupt end of the first one, but not as crafty.This movie is also kind of modernized, with a rock score and a lot more attention to making it cool for a new generation. This is unfortunate because it makes it needlessly flashy and loses a lot of Carpenter's original creepy score. But at least this is the last one with Dr. Loomis. Loomis way overstayed his welcome two movies ago.--PolarisDiB",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

I really like it, it injects a new ferociousness and bloodlust that Was missing not the last two. In four and five Michael is there, but he's a shambling, groggy mess, and it's like here he emerged from the hangover with revitalized energy, to enter the nineties with impressive violence and renewed energy. And he's got a good mask again!! It's really a buzzkill when they half ass the mask, but not this time around. He's back and ore violent than ever, and indeed some of the death scenes are incredibly graphic and intense, even for the early stage of the franchise. Could have something to do with is being the first entry to have a nineties style instead of the camp laden ones that came before. Michael is once again on the hunt for a pregnant Jamie Lloyd (JC Brandy stepping in for Danielle Harris). He makes his way to a modernized Haddonfoeld to raise a shitstorm once again, this time focusing on the house where his family used to live. A youthful Paul Rudd plays an adult Tommy Jarvis, who tangled with Mikey wayy back in Hallowoween 1. He's on Michael's trail along with a geriatric Dr. Loomis, Donald Pleasence participating in what would be his last excursion as the doc. Apparently he was deathly ill for filming, what a goddamn trooper. There's one complaint I have about this, and that's the inclusion of a half baked subplot regarding a spooky cult called Thorn, basically redneck illuminati that are responsible for the way Michael is. Way to suck the mystery out of it guys. Nuh uh.

54,drownnnsoda,Underrated Sequel.,7,13 August 2004,"For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate, when I really don't think they're that bad - and this is one of those films. In the case of this movie, I think it is way too over-criticized, I really isn't that bad of a film at all. In fact, I think this is one of the better sequels. ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" begins on the night before Halloween, where Michael brutally murders Jamie Lloyd (who was taken captive by the ""Man In Black"" in part 5) after she gives birth to his baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family, who is now coincidentally living in the old Myers house (which seems to change in each film). Kara and her son Danny are the main characters, along with Tommy Doyle, the now adult boy who survived the original killings. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of Michael, while Michael himself is driven to kill by an old Celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield.This is surely one of the best sequels in the series, in my opinion anyway, and I can't understand all of the hate it has gotten. It had some nice suspense, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I'll admit), some scary moments here and there, and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds. Not all of the acting wasn't particularly great, but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable. Paul Rudd plays a grown-up Tommy Doyle, and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. The rest of the supporting cast (besides the brilliant Donald Pleasance) isn't much to praise, but it wasn't too bad either, all things considered. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why Michael kills was completely necessary, but it turned out to be okay in the end and I wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together. The open-ended conclusion was also kind of eerie, but could have been something more. I have also seen the infamous ""Producer's Cut"" of this film, the original cut of it, and I think that in some respects, it is better. It further explains the Thorn curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film, plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film. I wish that Dimension would release this alternate version of the film, because I personally think it is better. The chances of that are very slim though.Overall, ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series. This movie isn't the best of all horror movies, but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael do his thing. Just don't expect brilliance, and you'll enjoy it. 7/10.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
55,lukem-52760,AN ENTERTAINING FUN & ATMOSPHERIC FILM IN THE FANTASTIC FRANCHISE.,7,12 July 2019,"The Curse of Michael Myers gets alot of hate & i get why people hated it because of ""Thorn Cult"" angle but i don't look into that!!! I just see that as a sicko-cult that worship evil like most Religions!!!
RELIGION is full of evil so to me of course this would happen,a weirdo cult worshipping serial killer Michael Myers.The movie itself is full of gorgeous Halloween imagery,it's one of the best looking films in the franchise!!!
The cinematography is colourful & slick looking.
This is a pure 90's film & i love that as i grew up in the 90's watching Horror movies so there's a nice comfort in seeing the fashion from back then, nice Nostalgia.Paul Rudd is really good playing the now older,rugged & disturbed Tommy Doyle from original night of he came home from 1978!!!
Another great little role & performance is from veteran Donald Pleasance (R.I.P) back for the last time ever as Doctor Loomis,a nice rugged & bitter aging loomis who ia retired but comes back to haddonfield.
The cast is all good.
There's some excellent suspense in this exciting Horror Thriller,the opening rain soaked scene is spectacular!!!
The main reason we all love these Horror franchise's like Halloween,Friday the 13th & A Nightmare on Elm street is because they're entertaining & fun & that's what The Curse of Michael Myers was another fun & gory entry.Despite all I've heard about the troubled production of this film it's still one hell of a fun atmospheric & gory as hell Halloween film.
The Curse of Michael Myers is one of my favourite of the great Franchise.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

He had the task of making phenomenal movies without the big studios. Come on the thing amazing!!!, they live, amazing!! Escape from new york!! You get the point. This featured the star Paul Rudd in his 1st film and it shows it's not his genre. Overall it was just eh....",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
57,davispittman,"Better than 4 and 5, but still nothing to be proud of....",4,22 December 2015,"OK they should've just stopped trying, like seriously the Halloween movies passed number 2 were just crap. I mean 4 and 5 were just embarrassments to the Michael Meyers franchise. I'm telling you, they should've made Halloween, Halloween 2, then skipped to Halloween H2O, and left it at that, that would have been perfect! But here we go I'll jump into Halloween 6. Halloween six was somewhat entertaining at times, but it was just mildly entertaining. The acting really isn't anything to brag about at all, sorry it's just not. And the script was just eh, nothing that great. Probably the most exciting part of the whole movie is the first five or six minutes, but I did have a problem with the first five or six minutes. SPOILER ALERT!!!!! Laurie Strodes daughter and her baby escape from this secret society or whatever that cult thing was, and the baby makes it out alive, but the daughter gets brutally murdered, and I really took issue with how graphic and disturbing her murder was, she could've just been stabbed or thrown up against something, but no we have to see her get thrown onto some corn thrasher thing and then see her get grinded up and see her scream and suffer. Like really I didn't need to see all the garbage!! And then the movie is just a bunch of pointless killings with a sliver of a plot line. I did like Mark Ruffalo and I thought he did well. So there you go that's one positive, Mark Ruffalo was pretty good, because I just don't want to sit here and bitch about the whole movie. Thank God we got Halloween H2O after this, which in my opinion, is the best Michael Myers movie of all time. I will get this movie credit for being better than the previous two, but on its own, it's just not that great. 4/10 for Halloween 6",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

He finds the baby in a bus station and ended up protecting the new born. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is been contacted by Tommy and they know that Michael is back but he's not alone. There's also the old Myers place is been restored and now a family lives there. Michael stalks them one by one.Directed by Joe Chappelle (Phantoms) made an unusual, interesting sequel to the Halloween movies. Chappelle pays some homage to the original. Although the film suffered after the production was over. Since it was released by a major studio and it tested poorly at the test screening. The picture had to be re-shot and changing the premise of Daniel Farrands' already heavy script without his knowledge. Most of the third act was changed.DVD has an fine non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good-Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD doesn't have any features. Die Hard fans of the Halloween Series will appreciate the movie more than the others. This film did some business at the box office back in 1995. But thanks to horror films like ""Scream"", which it was released by the same studios. Halloween:H20 came out, three years after Halloween 6. Since H20 has Jamie Lee Curtis coming back in the lead and she had an effective cameo appearance in Halloween Resurrection. Hopefully, Dimension Films should make the right choice of releasing the original version of Halloween 6 as it was originally intended by the screenwriter, producer and the cast. Since most of the cast and crew were disappointed by the theatrical cut. Still it's watchable and it is improvement over Halloween 5. For the original theatrical version (*** 1/2 out of *****).The Producer's Cut of ""Halloween 6"" is a much better film, although the video quality of bootleg version is a mixed bag at best. The new scenes are in dark quality from the bootleg print but nicely mixed together with the sound. Although the conclusion is different but just as flawed from the original theatrical cut. It has more scenes with Donald Pleasence and a few more scenes with J.C. Brandy (Who plays Jamie Lloyd in this movie). The best thing about both versions is Paul Rudd's performance, he is good in the movie. Not to mention... his career is quite good in movies, especially high concept comedies he stars in lead roles or in supporting roles. I wonder... when Dimension Films will released this version in good quality. If Anchor Bay Entertainment had the rights, it will be released shortly. If u never seen the bootleg quality of The Prodcuer's Cut, see it now. (****/*****) for the Producer's Cut.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
59,aidanratesmovies,Enjoyable and campy horror trash,5,6 July 2021,"Hardly as dull as the previous two films, and yet 10x as campy- Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers may not be a quality film, but it certainly is a fun one. Although I found myself oddly enjoying most of it, I found it largely to be in an ironic sense. Besides that, there are some legitimate problems with the film i'd like to discuss- largely, the films editing. I don't know if they were pushed for time or hired someone who had never edited a film before in their life, but this film is so badly edited at times it's almost laughable. At times the film can have absolutely no transition between two scenes, or simply locate from one room to another whale your mind just goes...what? Other times the film lingers on a scene for too long, like they forgot to stop rolling and just left it all in there anyway. I find the whole cult of Michael Myers subplot completely ridiculous, and they never really explain any of it, which is also hard to understand- but somehow past the first 15-20 mins or so, they are able to make an enjoyable film out of this mess. I don't know if it's the fast paced writing of the film Chappelle's direction, or the fun campy performances of all the actors involved- but something is just so entertaining about the latter of this film, and as messy as it is- it certainly does work. I'd like to see what they were originally intending for this film before the production issues took place, but what resulted, as messy as it is- does prove to be a stupidly fun time.My Rating: 5/10.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
60,truemythmedia,The Worst of the Series... besides Resurrection.,2,31 October 2019,"I know it's weird to say it, but I was kind of looking forward to this film. ""Halloween V"", while not that great of a film from a cinematic perspective, was a lot of fun, and it was the first film in the series that I thought did something fresh and cool with the character's in Michael's world. The way that ""V"" ended- with Myers escaping with the help of a mysterious man in black- I thought was ambiguous enough to be interpreted a few different ways; the way I took it was that Michael made a deal with the devil for his escape. The problem that every ""Halloween"" sequel has faced is that they have to figure out a way to write themselves out of the (sometimes literal) holes the last entry put them in. Michael keeps dying in the first few movies, so usually the sequels recap what happened in the last five minutes of the previous film, and change the ending ever so slightly so that Michael is once again alive- it totally ruins continuity, but whatever- it's just a stupid slasher series. Well, ""V"" actually ended in an interesting place, so I was hoping that this film would head in an interesting direction. Instead, it fell flat on its face. This is easily the worst ""Halloween"" movie since ""Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers"", and it might be the worst of the series.

61,Movie-ManDan,The Worst Halloween.,2,1 November 2014,"This is the worst of the series. Much worse than 2002's Resurrection and both Rob Zombie remakes. At least those were fun. This has awful acting and a bad story which make the whole thing nearly unwatchable. Most death scenes are good and there are some cool filming elements, but that's not enough. The whole time I was praying for Michael to come in and start killing and would cheer whenever would come in and kill. A slasher is bad when you want a death scene to happen right away and you cheer for the killer. In all the other movies, the stakes are set high, the acting is good and you're cheering for the victim to somehow find a way out of Michael's clutches. But Dr. Loomis is an exception. He carried the series and was the only redeeming quality (aside from Michael). I like Paul Rudd, but he really wasn't good in this. Maybe it was because this was his first screen role. He plays a grown up Tommy from the first film who finds the answers surrounding Michael Myers' motives and invincibility. He also finds the baby of Michael's niece, whom he must protect. He teams up with Loomis to protect the baby and save Laurie Strode's adoptive family. I thought Michael's curse was a bit cheesy, but it did fit.Only watch this movie for the deaths and Loomis.0.5/4",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

And as we all know, the HALLOWEEN series, like the JASON franchise, seems to know no end. In this one, Jamie has a baby and Michael is after her an it. Before Michael catches up with Jamie, she has hidden the baby and, of all people, Tommy Doyle (from the first HALLOWEEN) finds it and protects it. Meanwhile, what's left of the Strode family has moved into the old Myers house, and Michael starts picking them off one by one. And the evil cult is back, basically directing Michael's movements. Busy busy busy. Bot not terribly scary. And Michael is as usual boring self. He is no Jason. Maybe Kane Hodder should put on the mask and play Michael one of these days. Strictly for the fans.

63,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Really doesn't clear up a lot,4,16 March 2019,"Watching the deterioration of a franchise that began so strong is quite disheartening. John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and following sequel of Halloween II (1981) were films that told a tense but gripping story. After the flop that was Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), producers wanted to turn back to the Myers story, thus leading to Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) and Halloween V: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) revolving around Laurie Strode's daughter Jaime. Unfortunately, the attempt wasn't enough with the last two having a bunch of continuity issues and other subplots being introduced without exploration. This entry really doesn't conclude that.It's six years later and viewers see that after the events of the last film, Jaime Strode (J.C. Brandy) is back but now with a newborn child. With the same cloaked villain from the last entry on the chase, she flees to get away from not only them but Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) himself. Meanwhile, more Strode relatives such as Kara (Marianne Hagan) and her son Danny (Devin Gardner) move into the house that belonged to Michael Myers, however they don't know that. Next door is Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) who ever since the first film has been studying Michael to understand him better. At the same time, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is requested from colleague Dr. Wynn (Mitchell Ryan) to come out of retirement.Written by Daniel Farrands, the screenplay to this sequel tries to make sense of the confusion but fails in almost every way. While the story itself did go through several re-edits, it still suffers from lack of clarity. The unknown cloaked man is touched upon now as well as the new thorn tattoo that was featured in the last film. But this doesn't really solve the haphazard story. Kara's son Danny sees visions of the cloaked figure but the reason for them influencing him isn't explained. Nor was it really explained as to why exactly Michael Myers is involved with all this. It's just very muddled and adds unnecessary complexity to it all. The film was directed by Joe Chapelle, who has had no experience with the franchise prior to this. Sounds about right.Of the characters, the only two to come out seeming somewhat likable was obviously Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis since he's been at it since the beginning, and Paul Rudd as Tommy Doyle. Everyone else from Marianne Hagan, Devin Gardner and even George P. Wilbur don't really don't stand out. They're just actors playing characters that feel highly remote to the story at hand. It's actually more surprising Paul Rudd even has a role in this film considering where he is now being Ant-Man and all. The fact that his and Donald Pleasence's role have a connection to the beginning is what makes it more interesting. Yet, that's really all the audience has to go on because everything else is so remarkably dull.For a horror film, it too is a bumbling mess. The violence and gore is fine if weren't chopped up so much by editor Randy Bricker. Having all kinds of flashing lights and random scene cuts is annoying. Hopefully his skills improve. The cinematography by Billy Dickson isn't that great either. Having much more experience filming for TV movies, his camerawork isn't that special nor does it even try to emulate past DPs from other sequels. Thankfully music is a slight bit better. While the re-edited score contains guitar rips from Paul Rabjohns (most likely), Alan Howarth returns once more to score the film. And while it's not as great as his past scores, it still manages to hold up.With the second story timeline coming to a close for the silent killer, this entry in a string of sequels neither concludes all of the questions from the past film nor answers the new ones it creates. While the gore, music, Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence remain the highlights, the rest of the cast is boring, the cinematography is uneventful and the editing is obnoxious.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
64,alexanderdavies-99382,Flogging a dead horse.......,4,23 October 2018,"For fans of Donald Pleasence, this 1995 ""Halloween"" movie was his final appearance as Dr. Sam Loomis. The actor passed away before the release of the film - which is just as well.
There is absolutely no inspiration or imagination here. Only the usual bloody murder scenes where some idiot of a target allows himself/herself to be cornered and killed off a bit too easily!
The script is one of the most stupid that I've had the misfortune to listen to. The explanation offered with regards to Michael Myers and his immortality, is so ridiculous! His mask isn't frightening in the least (hasn't been since the second film).

65,Sandcooler,"Wait, what?",2,31 October 2011,"The ""Halloween""-franchise has definitely had its ups and downs, but I don't think the campy fun of this bizarre sixth entry can ever be topped. It's the ultimate self parody of the slasher genre, it's an absolute masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. Every long-running horror series has that one part when things just get totally kooky (yes you, ""Jason Goes To Hell""), but when ""Halloween"" totally loses its mind, it does so in a splendid fashion. Oh, Jason Voorhees can switch bodies right? Freddy Krueger has a daughter? Well eat our dust, Michael Myers is being mind-controlled by a bunch of Celtic druids! Of course, it all makes so much sense now. The film encounters one big problem though: finding characters relevant to the original that aren't dead yet. By total lack of better, it has to center around I kid you not, the boy Laurie Strode babysat in the first one. Wow, was the dude with the boom-box from ""Halloween II"" busy? All for the better though, because at least Donald Pleasence can finally get all the attention now. He absolutely shines in this one. He's not even in it that much (allegedly because director Joe Chappelle found him boring), but every moment and every line he gets is just classic Pleasence. Everyone else in this movie has absolutely terrible dialogue (""tonight's gonna be killer"", hahahahahahahahahaha), but the makers seemed to have done special efforts for old Loomis. ""Curse"" is awful, but in the most entertaining of ways. I'd pick it over lackluster entries like ""Resurrection"" any day.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
66,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Its behind-the-scenes problems are clearly evident,3,5 November 2013,"An unusually lame, almost nonexistent title scene opens this, the most over-plotted and confusing Halloween of them all.In this, the third film in this series which retroactively changes the previous film's ending, Myers is now part of some obscure Druid cult. They apparently never interact with each other, or communicate with him, however, and he still hasn't taken off that mouldy, rancid mask of his. Has he worn it ever since 1978? It is implied that he kidnapped his niece at the end of H5, held her captive for the next six years, and impregnated her, just so he can chase her and her newborn kid and try to kill them, as part of some curse put upon him and his family, by unknown individuals for unknown reasons. He then returns to his hometown, and goes after a family dwelling in his restored childhood home.The gimmick ""Man In Black"" from part 5 is explained by retroactively inserting a character into the storyline, as the leader of this Druid cult. His accomplices are never explained at all (What could they possibly have to gain by having anything to do with Michael Myers?) and are quickly and conveniently killed by Myers, and a strobe light, rather than have to explain any of this crap regarding them or their motives.Film seems like it was written by many different people who did not know what each other was writing, and then heavily edited down from a much longer film, with annoying flashes and noises to try to bridge the gaps left by the heavy editing. It is too bad they didn't edit out the character of the obnoxious radio broadcaster.Occasionally atmospheric, and with a few good visuals, that can't compensate for a mindbogglingly confusing screenplay, and yet another pointless, and anticlimactic, ending (which will doubtlessly be retroactively changed in the following sequel, as is usual for this series)",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
67,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A bizarre relic of the slasher genre, ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" is a decidedly odd 90's time capsule that never quite comes together.",4,2 September 2016,"The ""Halloween"" franchise is a strange beast indeed. Covering the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows in it's thus far ten entries and a near forty-year history. From the ground-breaking and trend-setting 1978 original from cinematic mastermind John Carpenter, through a slew of hit-and-miss sequels from a small army of fellow directors, to the most recent rebooted franchise courtesy Rob Zombie... ""Halloween"" is very much a franchise that has remained relevant and recognized in the public eye, even as audiences grow and change with each generation.One of the more peculiar entries in the franchise, however, is 1995's ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers""- a film that suffered a strange and turbulent production rife with writing and editing problems, and ultimately was released in a more-or-less butchered format in theaters. Many major sequences were re-written and re-shot for it's theatrical edition, and even several key plot points were completely removed and left on the cutting room floor, where they remained for nearly 20 years before the long-fabled original cut of the film (from before the re-shoots and re-edits) was finally released on Blu-Ray as the ""Producer's Cut.""However, I'm not going to focus exclusively on this long-fabled alternate edition, and instead am going to focus predominately on the original theatrical edition- the version of the film that was most readily available in theaters and on home media since 1995. And the theatrical version is... well, a bit of an interesting failure.It's fun and even somewhat nostalgic to revisit, and is most definitely a quirky time-capsule of its time period, feeling ""oh so 90's."" But it's plot is messy and clearly negatively swayed by the troubled production, the acting is mixed, and it feels very much a movie that is missing key pieces of the puzzle.Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd) must team up with his beautiful neighbor Kara (Marianne Hagan) and the troubled former psychologist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) in a desperate bid to stop the psychotic killer Michael Myers once and for all. However, revelations about Myers' past and the dark forces at play just might change the twisted game of cat-and-mouse that they are struggling to survive...To get things out of the way, there are some strengths to the film. Pleasence, in his final turn as the iconic Sam Loomis, is a joy, and is able to elevate the material he is given to work with. He's easily the best performer on-screen and he is able to make any and every sequence he's in thrilling and compelling with the class he brings to the screen. Hagan is also quite good and makes for a compelling heroine and makes for a good team with Rudd, who is portraying one of the troubled child survivors from the original movie, though I personally found Rudd so socially awkward and subdued, he's frankly boring. Which is a shame as Rudd is one of my favorite actors and he's been great fun in films like ""Role Models"", ""Knocked-Up"" and ""Ant-Man.""There's also some very good moments of blood-n-guts, a handful of creative kills and some suitably moody, 90's-music-video esque visuals that make it one of the more visually interesting and stylish entries of the series. It may be a bit of a jarring contrast to the slow-building and deliberate original... but it's still quite well put-together....it's just a shame the story is such a huge pile of dreck. This is one of the most disjointed, random and head-scratching films of the slasher genre. Plot points seem to crop up and disappear on a whim, there's too much reliance on convenience and coincidence (Strodes living in the old Myers house... really?), tropes and clichés run abound... And the film can't decide what to do with itself. It begins to build up a misguided but slightly amusing plot line revolving around curses and evil runes and whatnot, presumably to explain the supernatural side of Michael Myers in a pseudo-magical way, yet this is basically kinda dropped and changed-up halfway through the film... it's like they realized how silly it was and then tried to re-cut the second half to ignore this as much as possible, which is just strange and gives the viewer story-whiplash. (Surprise, surprise, this is the biggest change that was made from the original Producer's Cut, which focused much more on this side of the story.) It lends to the film feeling like two completely different scripts that accidentally got mixed together in some sort of accident.Add to that jarring pacing and tonal issues from the well-known re- shoots and re-edits, characters that are barely defined and written out haphazardly, a few scenes that are clearly thrown in for nothing but padding, and some nauseous attempts at satire (a woman on a radio show is in love with Michael... come on!), and it's just a mess.""The Curse of Michael Myers"" is just such a weird little flick. It's probably the worst-written film in the entire media franchise, and it's clear that the production troubles have all but ruined the original intent of the script. And that does make it hard to take seriously. But the likable performances, creative kills and stylish camera-work do make it something of an enjoyable watch... you'll laugh and wince at the proceedings. You'll just also be scoffing and rolling your eyes a lot.The theatrical edition of ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" gets a below-average 4 out of 10. Hardcore series fans might get a kick out of it. But it's not really worth seeing for anyone else. Although I would highly recommend checking out the Producer's Cut, which is a slightly better film. Yes, it's silly with it's occult and magical elements... but at least it isn't butchered by re- shoots and bad re-editing like the theatrical edition.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

70,Analog_Devotee,Never understood the overwhelming amount of hate this movie receives.,8,14 April 2020,"Back in the mid-2000's when I was on my initial Halloween franchise kick, I was admittedly a little nervous to try this one out. Why? Well, the general consensus back then from most outspoken horror/Halloween fans was that Halloween 6 was a complete dud, only slightly better than the debacle that was Halloween: Resurrection. So when I finally decided to bite the bullet and try this movie out, I told myself to go in not expecting much. I'd already been a little disappointed in Halloween 5 (certainly didn't hate it by any stretch; the laundry chute scene from that film will forever stick in my mind) so it wasn't hard to go in with a neutral state of mind.And because I went in with such a let's-not-get-too-excited-here head space, I was completely blown away by how much I enjoyed the film. Does the film have issues? Sure; of course it does. One of the biggest issues for most people is the fact that Danielle Harris does not return as little Jamie. I'll be completely honest: While I thoroughly enjoyed Danielle Harris's acting in Halloween 4 and somewhat in Halloween 5, I saw her level of acting in the 90's through other outlets (like in the television sitcom Roseanne) and was not all that impressed. And therefor, I didn't really care all that much that she wasn't in this film. What does suck, however, is the entire backstory as to why she wasn't in this film. I won't rehash the entire thing here, but it is rather unfortunate and I felt bad for her.Where this film does disappoint is the fact that there are two different versions, and both of them leave things out that could've been better if handled by a better editor. I would recommend watching the theatrical version, and if you enjoy it somewhat, then seek out the producer's cut. As for the longtime fans out there, I recommend looking into the Blu Myers Cut, which intertwines parts from both cuts into a great, truly fan-servicing cut.As for this film itself, the atmosphere and set design is probably the best since the original, and dare I say, better in certain areas. The problem with the original film is that it's filmed in sunny southern California. Couldn't they have at least gone a little north? Anyway... Halloween 4, 5 and 6 were all filmed in Utah and it really, really shows. These movies are supposed to take place in the mid-west, and it doesn't matter how much you doctor-up southern California, it's always going to look like southern California. Utah, however, is much closer to Illinois in atmosphere and setting. The way the neighborhoods are decorated will feel familiar (and even nostalgic) for anyone who's lived in a suburban setting before. Lots of fall leaves and Halloween decorations; exactly what a film like this calls for. During the night scenes, the atmosphere feels dipped in this dreary blue and it really helps pull together the isolated-among-many feeling a slasher film should have.The characters and acting performances in this film are great. No cheesy dialogue, no corny one-liners, nothing to make you cringe and say, ""Oh, my God, did they really just say that?"" These characters feel real. And that's because you know these characters. They're everyday people; struggling single mothers, college kids, arrogant, boozy husbands/fathers, weird guys demented and haunted from their past, young kids dealing with living in a dysfunctional family... I mean, you KNOW these characters! While all the performances in this movie are good, I have to specifically point out Bradford English's performance as John Strode. This guy makes playing a rude, arrogant middle-aged man look easy. You really want to lay into this guy while watching him perform - that's how good he is!The score/soundtrack in this film is stellar - especially in the theatrical version. It's dark and gritty, and stands out among the others in the franchise. It's debatably the best in the franchise, however I still prefer the somber, darker than the original, Halloween 2 score. Of course, most purists will refuse to acknowledge any other score in this franchise being better than the original.The most well known fact about this movie is that it's Donald Pleasence's final on screen performance. In fact, he passed away 8 months before this film hit the theaters. It's one of the many reasons why I hate that so many people crap on this film any chance they get. He was one of the most well-respected actors of his generation, and he never turned down a Halloween role. He knew how much this franchise meant to the fans, and he took the role of Dr. Sam Loomis as serious in his final performance as he did in his first. That kind of commitment among well-known actors is rare.All in all, if you're a fan of Halloween and have been on the fence about trying this film, I implore you give it a shot; going in with an open mind.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The 6th film in the franchise tries to explain why Michael is the way he is. He's being controlled by a cult who gives him the Thorn curse. (The Producer's Cut is a much better film if you want to make any sense out of it. The theatrical version is too watered down and difficult to understand at times) Tommy Doyle is back, and he fears for the people living in the Myers house, who happen to be related to the Strode family. When Jamie Lloyd is found dead and her newborn baby turns up, Dr. Loomis comes out of retirement to try to find and kill Michael for one final time. He teams up with Tommy and Kara Strode. Dr. Loomis is baffled when he comes face-to-face with the man who has been controlling Michael all these years. This film is a lot better than part 5. I highly recommend HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
72,mentalcritic,The absolute nadir of the series...,1,20 October 2004,"On the basis of efforts like this, Halloween could rightfully be divided into John Carpenter's atmospheric original, and the worthless sequels. However, even those worthless sequels had a few selling points. All of them except for this one, which tries to wrap up a story arc with yet another lost relative we were never privy to before, and doesn't do a very good job of it.Part of the problem here is that we are told too much and shown too little. We are told that Michael Myers is some sort of avatar in a pagan cult circle, but shown nothing that would sell this illusion. In the real Halloween, we were simply told that Michael was an example of a mind gone so far that what was the modern psychiatry could do nothing. I know which explanation works better, especially given that Michael is fundamentally a human being. Maybe it is time that Hollywood stopped getting its ideas about Paganism and how it relates to today's world from the likes of Jack Chick. It would certainly make their films a lot more credible.Another problem comes in the shape of the cast. Take a good look through the listing in this IMDb entry and see if you can recognise one name other than Donald Pleasance. Now that you have that exercise out of the way, think of the impression this gives of their performances. That Pleasance died during production suggests to me that he saw the future of B-level actors and decided that he'd had a gutful of this world. I know that feeling all too well, myself.The next two sequels basically act as if Halloween four through six are not canonical, and this is the main reason why. Even hardcore fans, such as I was during the mid-1990s, were thrown off by the tacked-on elements of the central character. You can only add so many tangents to a story before it collapses under its own weight, and Michael Myers collapses here. Like A Nightmare On Elm Street 2, one could erase this entire entry from the canon and nobody would notice the difference.Danielle Harris, who has since gone onto such bright things as a cameo in Urban Legend or vocal work on Rugrats episodes, asked a mere five thousand dollars to reprise her role as Jamie Lloyd. That Dimension Films refused elegantly sums up the philosophy of this film. Everything is so cheap, so low-rent, that the thought of this turkey getting a theatrical release is flabbergasting. That skit in South Park involving Sidney Poitier's performance in a production at Straight To Video Studios is made accurate by films like this. Harris must be pleased to no end that Dimension Films turned her down over a mere few grand.I gave Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers a one out of ten. Nothing can save this entry from the abyss of irrelevance. It is a textbook study in how not to make a horror sequel.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
73,mattymatt4ever,"Far from a masterpiece, but a well-made slasher film",6,26 July 2002,"""Halloween 6"" doesn't contain any real scares and is a far cry from the magnificent original, but let's face facts:  horror movies almost never spawn good sequels!  And considering how bad some sequels are, this is above average material.  The acting is good, the directing is good, the lighting is good and we still get to listen to that good ol' creepy ""Halloween"" theme.  And no matter how many times we've seen him pop up, Michael Myers is still quite creepy.  There are some really cool f/x, including one head explosion.  I did not place high expectations on this film, and that's why I just had fun with it.  But even though, it's still a notch above a guilty pleasure.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
74,Fernando-Rodrigues,The Last Vengeance (?),4,6 February 2021,The whole Thorn premise is UNNECESSARY. This movie is dull (there are many incoherences like a bus station where none of the employees clean Jamie's blood stains or even realizes there's a baby in the bathroom!!). I think I said enough.,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
75,ODDBear,Released version vs. the Producer's Cut,6,10 August 2008,"This sixth Halloween entry is a tough one to call. On the one hand we have a fairly interesting version of the film that has never been officially released and a released version that is mediocre at best.The fifth film introduced a man dressed in black (and sporting a weird tattoo) who freed Michael from jail. What the heck was that about? Well, it seems that Michael belongs to some sort of cult who adore him and once the stars in the sky form some sort of pattern Michael gets the urge to kill. On the next Halloween night the baby of Jamie Lloyd, Michael's niece, has to be sacrificed and Michael is the one who has to make the kill.I really can't make much sense out of this drivel. Giving Michael a supernatural background story was always going to end up badly and here the script (for the released version) is all over the place and nothing makes much sense. It does have a number of effective murder sequences and director Chapelle (who all Halloween fans hate, by the way) does an OK job at giving the film a stylish look.Then there's the infamous Producer's Cut version which made better sense of the whole supernatural element behind Michael's origins (initially the film was to be called ""Halloween 666: The Origin of Michael Myers). Ironically that version is much more similar in style and atmosphere to the original. There's less bloodletting and mayhem and the supernatural element is handled pretty well and it has a shocker of an ending. It's more stylish, somewhat Gothic and caps the whole story off in a much better way.Why this ""Producer's Cut"" was axed and a more confusing version released is baffling. Everybody seems to agree that the released version is inferior and much more senseless. I have to jump on the bandwagon and support those who like the unreleased version better.Donald Pleasence is very old here but he's a joy to watch as Dr. Loomis, Michael's main nemesis in the series. It was reported that director Joe Chapelle had no respect for Mr. Pleasence and tried to keep him out of the movie as much as he could. Apparently the guy thought it was beneath him to direct a Halloween movie and somewhere he stated that this was merely a price he had to pay to move on to bigger and better things. Nice! No such problem was with the film's screenwriter Daniel Farrands, a big fan of the series. He relished the chance of writing a Halloween movie and his original script (used for the Producer's Cut) is actually very decent. The whole Thorn aspect is explained in as good a way as possible (although I never liked the concept).Other actors are pretty good, especially Mitchell Ryan who gets a much bigger role in the unreleased version. Paul Rudd pulls off his role well but it bugs the hell out of me the way the actor has talked about this film after it's release. He and Chapelle must have been big pals as Rudd offered to refund those people who had paid to see the movie. This to me is an arrogant and unprofessional move from this overall very decent actor.The verdict here is that the unreleased version is a solid film overall. The released version, while not all bad, is mediocre at best with some effective set pieces that compensate for a truly confusing story. The ""Producer's Cut"" should be released on DVD so every curious horror fan can take a glimpse at what should have been.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
76,fernandoschiavi,"The plot is not convincing. It tries to provide some sense and coherence to the different events in Michael Myers' life, but fails to descend into utter absurdity and ridicule",4,4 September 2021,"The plot begins with the scene of a sect and a woman giving birth in a macabre hospital, soon we discover that it is Jamie Lloyd, the niece of Michael Myers. We discover that the girl has been captured by an obscure cult that has ties to murderer Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur), presumed dead by the media. With the help of a nurse, Jamie picks up her newborn son and manages to escape from the hospital where she was being held hostage, but behind her is Michael, who was also being held in the same hospital. Jamie's baby ends up in Haddonfield, in the hands of Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), Laurie Strode's neighbor who witnessed Michael's murders in the franchise's first film. As an adult, Doyle has become hooked on the killer and to protect the baby, he teams up with Kara (Marianne Hagan), a young single mother who lives with her family in Michael's old home.All of this happens within the first few minutes of the film, including the return of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) to Haddonfield, who travels to town suspecting that Michael has returned to claim more victims during Halloween night. On the one hand, you need to give screenwriter Daniel Farrands some credit. In the whirlwind of pre-production for chapter six, Farrands painstakingly sketched a franchise timeline, a family tree of the main characters, and even turned to the writers of previous chapters, seeking explanations for the mysterious Thorn symbol that appeared at the end of the previous film. The survey response? A classy ""turn around"", which resulted in Farrands trying to use The Last Revenge to tie all the movies together logically - excluding Halloween, of course. And that's just the problem with trying to extract juice from a fruit as simple as the one created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in 1978, which was a basic, straightforward killer story: Farrands doesn't make any sense, and it's laughable as exaggerated. And forced in his explanations.The introduction of the bizarre Myers cult doesn't work in any way. According to Farrands' text, Myers is a channeler of the ultimate evil invoked to destroy his entire lineage, an argument that collapses on its own when we wonder why he would be freed in the first instance. Of course, Halloween 6 is notorious for having different versions, and the ""official"" one featured several cuts, including one that would make it clear that Jamie's baby is Michael's own, who would have impregnated his niece after a rape. What the hell was Farrands smoking? The only minimally curious connection comes with the presence of Tommy Doyle, the character who was the child taken care of by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original film, but is nothing more than a mere fun fact.The connection to the previous movie is by names only, because nothing is shown or explained about what happened to Jamie who was just a child at the end of the previous movie, when she and Michael disappear from the police station. 6 years later the character appears to me much older, but like, much older, pregnant (!!!) and in the hands of a cult of Michael Myers who nastily tries to explain the origin of the character's powers and immortality. It's crying. The whole part involving the sect and the Myers followers is laughable. To complete the confusion, they involve ancient runes and druid rituals, in an attempt to add depth to the story just by throwing information to the audience. There is not the slightest development of the story, nor of its characters... One of the great breaks of the franchise and its villain was precisely all the mystery that surrounded it. We didn't need any explanation or reason for Myers' actions, and rightly so, so that it wasn't something that wasn't worthy of the character or that would mischaracterize him.Seeing Michael standing there, surrounded by a bunch of people and even following orders is disappointing.Axes, shocks, glass, etc. Myers' repertoire is expanded. He wants to destroy any trace of his family, as well as setting out on a constant hunt for Jamie's baby, an interest not only for him, but for the Cult of Thorn. In an attempt to pay homage to the universe itself, there are a series of scenes that use excerpts from the original film, with a view to creating some identification with the audience that gets tired in the first half. As final girl, we have Kara Strode, her son's defender, supported by Tommy, the traumatized 1978 Halloween youth who discovers where Jamie's baby has been hidden and protects him with all his might.Furthermore, back to the bizarre script, we find out that this sect wants to continue perpetuating the evil and that is why it does genetic work for the emergence of new babies who, in adulthood, will become killers. Absurd, excessive, crazy, insane and clueless. That's the explanation. Everything doesn't get worse because there's a basic side story that's pretty typical of the movies in the series: Tommy has become obsessed with the mysterious killer, just like Dr. Loomis. This, by the way, was Donald Pleasence's last film. The actor died still in the finalization process. After the producers rejected parts of the story, a stuntman was called in for the remakes, a strategy to reconfigure a product already destined for limbo. Even though Tommy's story has some promising spark that soon fades, the project around Halloween 6 was something already doomed to failure. These explanations are too bizarre.The aesthetic structure as well: Alan Howarth's musical conduct does nothing more than emulate some points of John Carpenter's main theme, Randy Bricker's editing struggles but can't cope with the lack of cohesion of the filmed material, the direction of photography Billy Dickson's very poorly gets it right, and Bryan Ryman's production design is one of the few traits that stand out, but it fails to project because of the script, the script, and the fragile development of the narrative. Actor George P. Wilbur manages to shape the monster in Michael Myers' figure, but even his performance doesn't save this sixth episode from near-total artistic disgrace.As for the cast, rookie Paul Rudd's performance here is something to take note of. Emerging as an accidental guilty pleasure, Rudd tries to portray Tommy as a traumatized survivor from his encounter with Myers in the original, but his expressions, stare, and delivery of lines give us the impression we're dealing with a sexual pervert; and I confess that it's hard to hold back the laugh in some supposedly ""serious"" scenes. About the rest of the cast, Donald Pleasence offers his final performance, as the actor would die shortly after filming, and manages to deliver a soberer and rational Loomis. The supporting cast are completely disposable, with a dishonorable mention to the core family of other members of the Strode family, which only makes Laurie's insertion into this universe even more confusing.In his second foray into film, Joe Chapelle does very little to yield something memorable. It's not really a harmful direction, but it's unimaginative and it finds the franchise at a point where all of Carpenter's charm and atmosphere seem completely forgotten, as the production is marked by uninterrupted jump scares and the worst quality: those where the sound design offers an inelegant onomatopoeia to frighten us whenever any character enters the scene. The only moment when Chappelle brings something interesting is when he bets on special lights for a sequence of deaths, ensuring a dynamic montage and a really striking visual effect, and that refers to that used by Ridley Scott in Alien, the Eighth Passenger. Hopefully, Chappelle would regain his morale by directing and producing several episodes of the hottest The Wire.In general, in the eagerness of wanting to innovate, Halloween 6 - The Curse of Michael Myers turns out to be unengaging and even confusing. The plot has a similar rhythm to the first film, but it is not convincing. It tries to provide some sense and coherence to the different events in Michael Myers' life, but fails to descend into utter absurdity and ridicule. By the way, something that drew a lot of attention in a negative way is that Michael is shown as almost an immortal, he is even shot, hit in the head by a fire extinguisher and doesn't even faint. But, to end with a positive point, the characterization of Michael is a point to be commended, his mask is very similar to the one presented in the first movie of the franchise and already it leaves a good feeling of nostalgia and fear when seeing the killer in action.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
77,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,It's a shame that this doesn't have the original's charm,6,20 February 2013,"After watching the 5 Halloween films, I heard that there was another film in the franchise and watched it to see if it would satisfy me. Then, I became a bit disappointed, but I don't think this film is as bad as the critics suggested that it was. It's flaws in it's own ways, but it does have some redeeming aspects that save this from getting a lower rating.While some of the actors fell flat, it's great to see Donald Pleasance again as Dr. Loomis (it's sad that he died since this was his last film role) and the new actors including Paul Rudd did fine with their roles. Michael Myers is spooky and scary once again and his make-up never fails to amuse me. The death scenes are both gory and very satisfying especially the part where Jamie Lloyd from Halloweens 4 & 5 died which gave me some chills here and there. The scenery is breathtaking and the directing is above-average. The music is pretty good captures the same suspenseful tone of the previous films very well along with some haunting moments.Now for the flaws. The story is pretty predictable. I liked the concept about the Thorn which was the reason why Michael Myers killed his sister in the original and is well explained, but it suffers from too many plot holes like one scene for example, how the heck did Michael move from one place to another so fast? The script is pretty messy with an abrupt ending that leaves sometime to be desired and the dialog is unbelievably terrible with some unfunny moments. The main protagonists are interesting enough, but most of the characters are flat and are only used at victims to Michael Myers. Even the pacing is a bit sluggish.Overall, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers would've been a much better sequel, but it's not as bad as some say it is. Recommended to those who haven't seen it, but for others, I'd stick to the previous films.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
78,movies2u,One Of The Best Out Of The Halloween Series!,10,30 July 2002,"Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is one of the best ones in the series. I also liked Halloween: Resurrection, and Halloween H20. This one is one of my favorites. It is more my cup of tea than Halloween 5 was. I liked this one better. Joe Chappelle, the director of the brilliant Phantoms did a really good job, I thought so. The guys who play Michael Myers are always big and scary, just like a boogeyman. This movie also had plenty of gore, which is a horror lover's festival. The acting was okay, and the first time actors in this movie did well for their first big screen performance. The storyline didn't weaken hardly at all. The plot was good and thick, and there was so much going on in this movie helping to tell this story. When you see the beginning of the film, you won't understand it instantly, so don't think your watching the wrong movie. It is a little confusing at the beginning, until the story moves on about ten minutes after the opening sequence. Then everything begins to come together. To me, the movie didn't seem very long, I mean it was only 88 minutes, but still, it seemed really short. I also recommend Halloween 4: The Return Of Michael Myers. If you want to se a seriously fun, entertaining, scary, and good horror movie, surely see it. I give Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers a 10 out of 10! :)",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

This is a comment on the alternate Producer's Cut version of the film, not the original theatrical release, and since IMDB doesn't have a page for the producer's cut since it wasn't released, I'm leaving this comment for it. I have compared the producer's cut and the original cut together. There are things I liked about the producer's cut, like some of the dialogue and such, but there were some things I didn't like. The ending of the original version was very well done, but in the alternate cut they were in a big room and Kara was laid down with a crown on her, and they began to perform the ancient ceremony. I thought that it brought the subject of the overall film too far off the Michael Myers subject. It just brought you into this whole other side of the movie, which was strange and didn't even out the film. Also, I like the flashing montages Joe Chappelle added to the original cut, and also I liked the original soundtrack better. The producer's cut only had the classic Halloween theme, which was okay, but I think the other soundtrack added a little more spark to the film. All In all, I give Halloween 666- The Origin Of Michael Myers(The Alternate Producer's Cut) a 5 out of 10. I recommend that you see the original first, then the producer's cut, so that you can have your chance to compare.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

I will disregard III because it doesn't involve the chief protagonist of the series Michael Myers. I couldn't find prints of IV and V!Here Myers 'returns' yet again to Haddonfield like a stale odour under the cover of a Druid storyline.It was a little sad seeing a screen legend like Donald Pleasence, on his final role before his death, returning as the very frail Dr. Loomis.
The violence seemed visibly upscaled compared to other entries I have seen. Perhaps to cover a convoluted mess of a screenplay.It looks re-written, re-shot. A mess.

83,acidburn-10,Lacks that something special,6,10 January 2012,"The plot = A few years after the events of Part 5, we now see an older Jamie Lloyd whose now being held prisoner in an asylum and has just given birth to a newborn baby, so she manages to escape with the baby in tow, but Michael is soon on her trail, she manages to hide the baby in a nearby bus station, before she gets killed. Luckily the baby gets found by Tommy Doyle.This was the first Halloween movie of the 90's and by this point you can already see the quality has gone downhill, after the poor reception part 5 was met with, It seems that the film crew were running out of ideas and so they decided to add a pagen/cult roots to this film with mixed results. This entry is also infamous as it had so many re-shoots and cut out scenes that there are so many different versions of this movie out there. Which is probably why this movie doesn't really flow that well throughout. But underneath it all it's still a pretty decent slasher movie along with some decent characters and some good kills.However though this being the sixth entry in the series does complicate things by attempting to give Michael an origin and by introducing the Thorn Cult. As I've said in other reviews, I prefer for Michael to be a mysterious character, as he works better as an enigmatic boogeyman; however, I will give this film credit for at least trying something different in this respect. But way too much is thrown in towards the end and leaves me wondering what exactly is the point of all this.The cast are at least on fine form, we still get Donald Pleasance playing Dr Loomis one last time and, even better, Dr. Loomis actually acts like himself again. Instead of being a completely deranged old man who terrifies children (as was the case in the previous film), he's back to being a compassionate and likable character again. Paul Rudd played Tommy Doyle really well and really likable, while Kara Strode and her son are characters that you care about. My only complaint is that I'm still undecided about JC Brandy playing Jamie instead of Danielle Harris, she just doesn't feel to me like she's playing Jamie it feels as if she's playing someone else completely.All in all Halloween 6 is a bit of a hit and miss for me, it does shine in some moments but completely falls apart in others, not the worst entry but lacks that something special that the early Halloween movies had.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
84,Darkside-Reviewer,The only slashing in this movie took place in the editing room,4,1 August 2020,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is an absolute travesty of a movie it barely even qualifys as being watchable.The previous entry in the Halloween franchise was Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers which came out six years prior to this movie in (1989) and was a financial disappointment making only $11.6 million dollars (US) at the box office against a $6 million dollar (US) budget because of this producers were unsure of where to take the series next. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers took six years to make and went through production hell with various script's being written some were even rejected for being too scary and serebral. In the six years it took to make this movie producers couldn't settle on a script or a director they couldn't even decide on a proper tittle with the movie at one stage being called Halloween 666. Then Dimension films took over the project and directing duties were given to Joe Chappelle.Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers originally tested negatively with test audiences who saw the movie uncut labeling it as ""boring"" a huge portion of the test audiences were teenage boys who just wanted to see Michael Myers kill anyone for no apparent reason so director Joe Chappelle took the advice of the teenage test audience and ordered reshoots of the movies climax but due to the terrible loss of actor Donald Pleasence the ending was changed and a huge bulk of the movie was cut and heavily edited removing most of Donald Pleasences scenes as Joe Chappelle found Donald Pleasence to be ""boring"" this led to the movie being very badly edited so much so that you would swear someone spilt coffee on the editing software and just left it that way.The movie is filled with obnoxiously loud and cheap jump scares that wouldn't startle a cat let alone make a movie goer jump. One of the worst things about this movie is during certain cutaways there are flash cuts of scenes from the movie that rapidly flash together with a strobe light effect while a woman screams and you hear what sounds like slashing knifes (It's almost like getting an inside look at how this movie was edited just someone with a knife hacking away at the film reels).The movies storyline is filled with plot holes and continuity errors this is again due to Joe Chappelles decision to cut most of Donald Pleasences scenes from the movie even the one's with critical story information in them so throughout the movie it looks like Loomis (Donald Pleasence) just hangs around every corner until the ""main characters"" show up.Donald Pleasence performance as Dr Samuel Loomis is the best part of every Halloween movie he stars in including this one and this was sadly the last movie he ever worked on and they ended up cutting most of his scenes from the movie which is a real shame because Donald Pleasence was the only reason fans of the Halloween franchise went to see any of the sequels including this one.If you have never seen a Halloween movie before don't start with this one.

The editing is kind of bad and some parts of the movie just doesn't make sense, although i hear there's a ""Producer's cut"" somewhere that helps improve the movie and even uses an alternate ending.

87,raypdaley182,Awful,4,15 March 2006,"A really awful and confusing start with a woman having a baby in a basement and Myers coming from no-where, a cute shot of a guy holding a phone in his right hand AND typing with the same hand. Super goof! The radio jock laughing at the idea of ""Micheal Myers in space"". (pretty much the plot of Jason X).Once you discount how stupid the fact of Myers even being alive is you have to nod and know this film is just a slasher flick designed to scare as often as possible.Surely someone who had killed as many people as Myers would have been executed on reaching adulthood? He seems to get vehicles easily and often so had no-one ever considered dismembering him, cutting off an arm or a leg, or his head for that matter. Everyone seems to do stupid things, set him on fire, stab him, shot him.Surely dismemberment is something even he couldn't overcome (In the film Jason X this concept is addressed and put to rights). The women who had literally just given birth took her new born out in the cold. the fact that she's in any fit state to go running round partially clothed. Surely the baby would have died from exposure in the rain.Myers seems to have some magical power which allows him to find whoever he is after, no matter where they run. After making a statement like ""that crazy old lady wouldn't hear a truck go through her living room"" you pretty much know that exact thing is going to happen later in the film.Also when we're introduced to the basement/washing room in the Strode (Old Myers) House you know we're going there later as well, it's an establishing shot.The whole ""satanic"" thing at the start and marking the baby isn't a good idea and needs much more explanation. And despite the fact we are told several times Haddonfield is ""The Town that banned Halloween"" lots of house are decorated and we see lots of kids in costume.When Mr. Strode finally goes home (and goes to the basement like we predicted) he is in a black-out. The power is out but the washing machine is still working? Also Dad Strode is electrocuted from a fuse box in a house where the power is out. Super Goof!Myers gets from his house to the town center very quickly. (Too quick) I find it hard to believe the Strode's son didn't know anything about Myers living in his house (kids at school never told him?). Myers got from the town center back to his home very quickly again. Tim managed to have a hot shower in a house with no power (Another major goof!)And Mikey kills the couple who have had sex, major horror film mistake to do that. Despite being told NOT to go back in her house Kara does even though she's just seen Myers kill someone in there. Does Kara not know how to call 911? Myers is pushed down the stairs (this would cripple most people) and Danny appears next to Myer's body, you know he was going to grab Kara.Then finally the whole ""Satanic"" thing is explained in bits and pieces. The man in black is revealed and Micheal's former baby sitter is found to be part of the whole Satanic rite.The film is then taken back to where it started, the hospital (is it the asylum where Myers was sent after killing his sister? I think it must be!)Now an issue with Tommy. If he were 8 when Myers attacked the 1st time as an adult and must have been roughly 23-25 in this film, this would make Myers at least mid to 30's or even 40's. Far too old to be strolling around and getting hurt like he does in this.Myers kills all the ""Satanic"" people who are worshipping him in a very heavily cut scene with lots of strobe so you see hardly anything but the results of his work.I am amazed that Tommy and Kara don't pull shut all the lockable doors as they are running from Myers. Myers sees exceptionally well for someone in a mask, I think. Also you hear him breathe but there is no mouth hole or any nostril holes to breathe through on the mask he wears (A Captain Kirk mask painted white we're told!).I really don't know why after what Myers put him through Tommy doesn't beat him until he's a pile of liquid.The film has no actual ending. It's awful. Truly awful.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Heading to Haddonfield to go after Laurie Strode's daughter Jamie (who we met and followed in the last 2 films), only to find that she and her young son have escaped. Michael, and a cult group, have nefarious plans for her and her son...This movie is perhaps the lowest point in the Halloween franchise thus far in the viewing journey.Parts 4 & 5 weren't awful movies, but they were definitely far from perfect and weren't satisfying to watch. This film is the lowest of the low, almost exclusively because of how strained and tired the plot is by this point.Prior to viewing these films, I was adamantly against the idea of retconning your films. I always said that, if you put it out, you need to be proud of it and work off it. However, after seeing Halloween 4, 5 and 6, my opinion on the matter has changed quite drastically.Choosing to do a partial reset after this film was a smart move, if not a couple films too late. This is for diehard fans of the series only. For casual viewers, this is such a soulless piece of filmmaking so far removed from everything that made the original great that watching this is akin to suffering.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

It isn't scary, there's a very little tension and Michael Myers doesn't creep you out, he's just there and he's annoying. He looks like a husk of him former self and story makes him look weak and useless. All in all, even the ""Halloween 4"", which was your run-of-the-mill slasher, did a better job as a horror, or a thriller. Even Donald Pleasance with his last bits of energy and legendary acting couldn't save this movie. It isn't so bad you can't watch it, but you feel so empty and ""oh, ok"" while watching the movie. It almost makes you sad that it had to come to this. Still, if you are horror fan and fan of the franchise, you could still squeeze a little bit of enjoyment out of it and there are some homages to the originals, but that's as far as it goes. 6/10 from me, glad it's not canon!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Paul Rudd as Tommy Doyle, yes the kid that was babysat by Laurie Stroke, does a great job as the co-lead to the movie alongside Donald Pleasance. Dr. Loomis returns to his last movie of the franchise to stop Michael, only to run into a person from his past, The Man in Black. The Curse has a really good story and atmosphere but I have to really knock on the ending for being what I felt very incomplete. In order to satisfy the urge for a better ending, there is a Producer's cut of the film out there but sadly it isn't as strong as I hoped it would be.

97,theshadow908,This movie is just too weird.,2,18 May 2006,"Michael Myers, his niece Jamie who's now 16, and the Man in Black haven't been heard of for the last 6 years. They've been in hiding at Smith's Grove Mental Institution where we learn that Michael's origin involves a Celtic curse that keeps him immortal. Michael has impregnated Jamie, and she gives birth to a child. Jamie ends up escaping and the child falls into the hands of grown up Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the original Halloween). Michael tracks the baby down and goes on a murderous rampage. This Halloween entry just baffles me, and it probably baffled John Carpenter too. What happened to the Michael Myers that was a silent, mysterious killer? Why is he now a monster controlled by an evil cult? No one will ever know the answers to these questions.The plot of this film is horrible. I don't usually enjoy horror movies about cults and witchcraft, and this is no exception. I have to give it to the screenwriters...They really screwed up something good. I mean, they made an effort to explain Michael's origin and why he is the way he is and for that I compliment them, but did they have to use the stupidest and most unbelievable idea that popped into their heads?Michael having sex with his own niece to produce a child that he is meant to kill doesn't seem like something you'd see in a Halloween movie at all.The acting in this movie is okay, but not great. Donald Pleasance returned for his last film role before he died, and he gave a good performance...Better than Halloween 5 anyway. The twist ending on who the Man in Black was seemed pretty ill conceived to me, but that's just me. Overall, stay away from this movie. It's best to just watch Halloween II and then skip right over to H20. That's the way I like to watch it anyway.2/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
98,bh_tafe3,Dreadful,3,1 February 2009,"Scanning through the comments, there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie, and it's not very hard to see why, it's rubbish.Now, I will start by saying that the finished product was hurt, in any number of ways, by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with Loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with mysterious ""Man in black"" and I do not mean Johnny Cash.Now to the story. The fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from Dr Wynn's lair and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew.We hear some ludicrous explanation to Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal's home town for some reason, which gives Micheal some more hapless victims.In the end the movie, just like this review is vague, confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending.Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor plot, passable effects, with some good run of the mill slasher kills, but severely lacking in motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything, this only stirred up some new questions, made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Jamie Lloyd, Michael's niece is kidnapped by the man in black that appeared in the last film. It turns out that the Man in Black is the leader of a druid like cult tgat wants to clone Michael's evil. Yes, it's that bad!!! Jamie is pregnant and Michaeal needs to sacrifice her baby. She has the baby but escapes the cult. We also meet Tommy Dotle, played by Paul Rudd. He is the kid that Laurie Strode was babysitting on Halloween in the first film. He is obsessed with finding out Michael's origin. It's all so convoluted and unfocused. Donald Pleasence is back as Dr. Loomis but in a cameo role really. He died during filming apparently so he is not in the film very much. So Michael goes around again doing his thing, kills Jamie in the hunt for kid which is now protected by Tommy. All of this is done with virtually no tension.

Both seem to have been nightmares behind the scenes. But I think the only reason I liked this more then the last is because there are actually things that happen in this.They managed to take the black dressed character that was thrust into the previous film and stretched that into a feature around Michael Myers. It dives head first into being an outright cult movie. Runes, rituals, and blood sacrifices reign supereme in this. Which is the stuff I liked. It's so weird and different that it works.That said, it's a little bit much. You have that story on top of Michael Myers, Paul Rudd, Jamies baby, and a lady with a son. There's just a lot to this and at times it's hard to keep up. The first act is specifically atrocious. It's nightmare of exposition and bad editing which results in a head scratching opening.The editing is really the stand out in terms of how bad it was.

However when watching the producers cut which I think is the true and intended version in my own opinion, since it restores many of Sam loomis list scenes and explains the story. Six years after Michael was presumed killed in a fire that destroyed the haddonfield police station, Michael returns yet again but this time is after his son Stephen who he plans on using as his final sacrifice As a way of passing his thorn curse which explains why Michael wanted to kill his family line.

The movie has the original Halloween survivor, Tommy Doyle, in it along with a few other 1-D characters.  You've got the Fred Flinstone, the pot-smoking son, an easily disposable girlfriend, and a few other victims.  You still continue with The Curse of Thorn, a curse put on people so that they kill all of their family members.  The only characters that worked for me was Sam Loomis and Debra Strode.  Sammie is hunting down Michael, still.  Sam, just leave it up to the army or something.  Debra Strode is there long enough to die but her character was the only one that had sense.  The only good thing this movie had was the pretty cool strobe-light effect. That's about it.The acting was OK but the screenplay was bad. VERY bad.  The deaths were gory and stupid.  Even Michael's ""ending"" was stupid.  Overall this movie should be roasted at a bonfire or something. Avoid this movie if it comes on TV and don't dare rent it.

108,Toronto85,Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,6,30 June 2013,"After the major disappointment of the fifth one, 'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' delivers the goods for fans as we find out the motivation behind Michael's killing spree. As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer.I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career.The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'.Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'. And we get some good eerie atmospheric scenes within the streets of Haddonfield. It brings back some genuine scares to the series. Check it out! 6/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Not only does Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers feature cheap jump scares, but it also features even more cheap jump scares, followed by even more cheap jump scares! Okay, but in all seriousness, this film truly was atrocious. It's quite disappointing considering the beginning of this film was actually somewhat interesting. I'll admit it, I was hooked! I had hope! Unfortunately though, what followed was an abundance of muddled plot holes, an uninspiring storyline, and predictability at an all-time high. Funny enough, some of Michael Myers's kills were hilariously absurd. There was also a handful of hysterically bad moments in terms of character decisions that certainly had me laughing. The film additionally feels highly unfocused in the predicaments it presents which can majorly create confusion among viewers like myself. Overall, the film's attempts at being horrifying usually comes off as comical, and it's strive to revitalize an already dying franchise feels substantially inconsiderate.

However, I don't think it is: the Attitude Era was the time of isolated vulnerability, which mirrors Kara's time.And why not boxing? That has a roster. It's because the WWE and WCW are/were fictional storylines, and because the gothic defined all of the Attitude Era.Mortal Kombat Annihilation is fictional, and gothic, so again - what's going on?It's because Halloween 6's story is sets, and is sets of demonstration.

111,homecoming8,"Better than ""Haloween 5"", but that's not saying very much...",5,1 January 2013,"""Halloween 5"" (1989) was a rushed project with a ridiculous story and a stupid ending. It pretty much killed the franchise and it took six years before a new sequel was released. The rights once owned by Transcas Films were bought by Miramax/Dimension (a division of Buena Vista/Disney). The one brave thing this sequel has is that it's trying to explain the mess ""Halloween 5"" was. But unfortunately, the new story is potentially even dumber than Part 5. According to the movie, it's six years later. Jamie is being held by a cult and gives birth. How can than be, she's what, 14 years old ? We get a new actress, J.C. Brandy (the producers didn't want to pay Danielle Harris the 5000 euro for her return) who looks like she's almost 30 years old. She flees with her newborn baby (according to the producer's cut, Michael is the father (..)) Eitherway, the introduction of the baby is dumb. Michael Myers is not skilled or cunning in this one. For example, he's not able to figure out that Jamie hid her baby in the women's room of a bus station. Even though he's been there chasing her, and after he kills her, he even finds a paper roll of that same restroom in her car. It's a shame Jamie was killed off so quick in the Theatrical Cut, it was as dumb as killing off Rachel right at the beginning of Part 5. Than we're introduced to Tommy Doyle. One of the kids who Laurie Strode babysat in the original ""Halloween"". He's obsessed with Michael and finds the baby in the bathroom the next morning. Apparently, it's not a popular bathroom since no one has been there that entire time for about 12 hours. Must be because of the massive blood trail Jamie left the night before that no one bothered to clean up.There's also a new family in the old Myers house. They are relatives of the Strode family who adopted Laurie after Michael killed her sister in the original. Besides the father, the family doesn't know that they live in the Myers house. Rather silly when you think about it. Again, it's not the original house they used in the classic, but it's not as silly as the ""Old Myers house"" in Part 5. The story makes no sense at all, trying to explain why Michael kills. The evil cult thing is awful. The reveal of the mysterious man in black is unbelievable. Remember, he's the one who took out an entire police station like the Terminator at the end of Part 5. Main reason for the messy story is that half the movie was re-shot and re-edited. The Producer's Cut has a way better story but it's still not a very good movie. It has much more scenes with Donald Pleasance and the music is way better. This Theatrical Cut suffers from a lame and incoherent story, very bad editing, unnecessary gore and an unsatisfying ending. Michael Myers is once again played by stuntman George P. Wilbur (he was also Myers in Halloween 4) but here his moves and posture are just not right. He looks more like Jason Voorhees in this one. The cast is not even that bad compared to Part 5. Paul Stephen Rudd (he also starred in ""Clueless"" that year) plays his part very well, just as Marianne Hagan. Mitchel P. Ryan is underused since he's a great actor and has more potential (Lethal Weapon).It's sad to see that Donald Pleasence's role has almost been reduced to a cameo. He's the only one who held up the ""Halloween"" franchise. Too bad director Chapelle cut out a lot of his scenes for the the Theatrical Cut. I'v always been a big fan of ""Halloween"" and horror films in general. The first one remains the best. ""Halloween II"" (1981) was a very well made sequel that was almost as good as the original. After that, my most favorite ""Halloween"" is ""H20"": It was fresh, revived the franchise, had Jamie Lee Curtis and a scary Michael again and went back to the roots of this franchise. ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" (1988) was a solid entry with great performances by Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris. Since that one was a success, a sequel had to be in theaters the next year to compete with Jason and Freddy. Unfortunately, 1989 turned out to be a very bad year for horror: ""Friday VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan"", ""Nightmare 5: The Dream Child"" and ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" had 2 things in common: they all did very poorly at the box office and were among the worst in their franchises. ""Halloween 5"" was bad. The introduction of the man in black is the worst thing of the entire franchise. I didn't like that direction with the matching tattoo's and the cult that controls Michael. That's just lame. I'm glad that the far more superior and successful ""Halloween: H20"" totally ignored the events of the previous three films.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
112,Mr_Censored,The Curse serves as the franchise's Hearse.,3,26 October 2008,"There is a lot wrong with this movie. It can be said that doing a sequel to ""Halloween"" was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel lucky that the previous entries, even at their lowest, were still watchable. But even still, ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" -- even today -- is so bad, it's shocking. Poor movie-making at it's worst, indeed. There is so much blame to go around. But where to begin? Whose shoulders does this blame rest on? Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-substance directing? Well, at the very least, the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as far the visual effects go, you get to see Michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways, even if it doesn't quite fit in with the overall tone of the series.So, could Daniel Ferrands' troubled script be the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series, you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme to Michael's reason isn't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one, especially the way it's handled here. And it really doesn't help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the end.Perhaps Dimension/Miramax could have botched the whole thing. Afterall, this was the first studio film in the ""Halloween"" series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen. Heck, look at the unbelievable lows they dragged ""Hellraiser"" to? I guess everyone is to blame, because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys, it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick.The bottom line, though, is that no matter how you cut it, slice it, dice it or electrocute it until it's head explodes, ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" was never a good film. Marking an all-time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for Michael Myers, ""Curse"" is just that: cursed. The thorn angle was never interesting, nor was it probably expanded upon. The needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the ""Halloween"" name. Towards the end, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there's other strong cast-members in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle rather naturally while Marianne Hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead. On the other side of the coin, the re-casting of Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thank God Devin Gardner doesn't do movies anymore. As the child in the film being pursued by the ""Man in Black,"" Danny is the anti-Jamie in that he is annoying, whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film. But I guess that's ""Halloween 6"" in a nutshell. Essentially, this is the anti-""Halloween"", made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy-""Halloween"" because of it's sci-fi twist, but really, it's just stupid. Save for some good visuals and decent characters, ""The Curse Of Michael Myers"" is just about as bad as it gets. And this is coming from a fan!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
113,dormesher-21565,A really good sequel,8,7 October 2018,Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers the concluding part of the Thorn Trilogy in this Franchise and a great and fun sequel with interesting yet flawed story and a brutal Michael Myers (Mostly in the Theatrical Cut) makes for an interesting and fun sequel that his much better than 5 but still not perfect.The Thorn storyline comes to an end in this movie and what an interesting story it is the story of a cult which uses Michael for family sacrafises on the holiday of Halloween. Now I will say the story is explained alot better in the Producers Cut of the film and the story it's self makes a alot more sense in that version. However they do go Abit to far in the that cut with Michael being the father of Jamie's baby which his neice that was way to far in this movie and Michael being controlled just looks weird and stupid for this character and I much prefer the Theatrical version because to me it plays out more like a theory and is never really confirmed weather Michael is controlled or not and going by the great scene with hospital massacare proving that you can't control pure evil.I do prefer the Theatrical version just slightly they are both great versions and get the same rating from me I was thing this version is alot more fun with a brutal Myers and alot more brutal kills especially Jamie's kill right at the beginning one of the best in my opinion and I have to say this is my favourite look for Michael he just looks so menacing in the story. The story is flawed in both versions w sometimes with the producers cut going to far and the reveal of the man in black is just such a let down in both versions with it being Wynn from the first movie a character we saw for like 10minutes in the first film the reveal felt a little rushed.Donald Pleasance once again is brilliant in this movie and this is the last time he will play role as he sadly passed away when this film was released such a shame and he will always be missed. However the end with him in the Producer Cut is just plain weird and I much prefer the ending in the Theatrical version because we never truly learn is fate and it's left to you're imagination.Verdict 8/10 for both versions a bit flawed,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
114,CMRKeyboadist,The Producers Cut Review of Part 6,5,6 September 2006,"Well, I should start by saying that the ""Halloween"" series is not among my favorite of the slasher genre. I will certainly admit that the first of the series is a genre bending movie and a horror classic. I just never was able to really connect with the series (minus part 3). So naturally, Halloween 666 was not what I would call a great movie. I thought it was confusing and had very little direction. What I didn't know was a producers cut of the film had been made adding in much of what was cut out. Interest got the better of me and I searched and tracked down the film. This is what I thought...For those of you who have seen the movie I won't give a summary of what the film is about. But for you haven't seen the film, I suggest you read a different review as I don't want to spoil anything for you.For one, this version of the movie is virtually gore-less. In the theatrical cut there are several moments in which the gore is rather extreme. The scene in which Jamie being impaled on the farm equipment is gone. She is merely stabbed and actually doesn't die until later in the film. Also, the scene in which the nasty Father comes home and Michael electrocutes him until his head blows up is gone also. Michael pulls it old school and just stabs him and pins him to the wall of the basement.As I said earlier in the review that the movie was confusing, in this version much of those questions are answered. The whole storyline about ""Thorn"" and how they have control over Michael because of some strange ruins. This makes for a much different ending then what was original seen in theaters, but it still leaves you with an even more confusing ending then the theatrical version does. The best part of the producers cut is the fact that they bring back all of Donald Pleasence's scenes. He is the best part of any of the films and is what really keeps the original film interesting.Overall, didn't really like this film. But, it is definitely worth seeing, especially if you do like the series. I think this is worth the time looking for a copy. 5/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

This movie could give you seizures just like RZH2 so if you're epileptic then don't watch this movie. This movie is gory I have to admit but in my opinion it's unnecessary because Michael is not that type of killer like Jason Voorhees is. And what's with the cult thing? It almost ruined Michael Myers like as a fan of this series, this sequel needs to get better writers. I haven't watch the producer's cut so I hope that version is better.

117,FKDZ,Contrived and messy.,3,27 October 2020,"I hate to see this be one of the worst Halloween movies in the franchise but it sadly is to me. What an incredibly sloppy mess. The only highlights are seeing Pleasence and Rudd but besides that this movie is a downright disappointment.The movie already starts with a very out of place feeling Cult scene where michael apparently needs to have a kid with jamie... but then also later in the movie has to kill both Jamie and the kid? Maybe because the story is so terribly written I missed it but why did Jamie have to be impregnated by michael in the first place?! It's just all sorts of weird. Also considering its only 6 years after the explosion and Jamie was really young in the previous film, it's just all sorts of weird/f-ed up.The whole cult subplot also really brought this movie down, and I hoped they didn't do it but they actually went there and started talking about ancient runes and mythical stuff. Tommy even uses it in the most odd way in the finale with some very awkward editing and acting. Suddenly michael is frozen...but also not..gotcha! I guess. Saying that, this movie has a few twists but none of them are any good. Mostly just for plot reasons and there is just zero hinting at Wynn, who was also introduced in this movie being a traitor.They just really messed up the story in this movie and it's really hard to look beyond that.Additionally the movie is a lot slower, the acting is very straightforward and plain again. Something that wasn't the case in H5 and which I enjoyed. But here it's back to plain jane. The only somewhat interesting character is the abusive father because he has at least one character trait. Everyone else, even the micheal prodigy Danny (which was also a awful plot point) is as boring as it can get.The kills are very underwhelming and a big downgrade from previous films, most kills are cutaways blood splatters with only some body reveals as actual ''bloody'' moments.Michael looks okay in this movie and he has some good reveals, so props to the directing for that but besides that the directing is worse than H5 with odd stylistic choices here and there and just not really doing much for me.The music though... I have to guess but I think I have heard the same looping tune for almost 40 minutes of the movie, it is especially egregious in the last 30 minutes. The way the music is utilized and edited in this movie is terrible.Besides all of this, the few positives are the two actors, some michael moments, and an attempt at some decent buildup for scary moments, the best one being the laundromat scene.Knowing that this movie ends this ''trilogy'' hurts even more because I thought H5 and 4 were fine, had their faults no doubt, but H6 really went threw so much of it out the window and went way to messy with its script.3/10 it really is that bad.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
118,LanceBrave,A Deeply Unsatisfying Explanation,3,5 November 2013,"""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" has many flaws but none is greater then its story. For six years, Jaime and Michael Myers have been in the care of a druid cult. Jaime escapes with her newborn baby, is pursued by Michael and killed. But not before leaving her baby in a safe location. The baby is found by a now-adult Tommy Lloyd and a retired Dr. Loomis. Meanwhile, a branch of the Strode family, fathered by Laurie's previously unmentioned uncle, takes up residence in the Myers house. Michael returns to Haddonfield on the first Halloween to be celebrated since his absence and begins to kill the remaining Strodes. The cult attempts to abduct not just Jaime's baby but the son of the oldest daughter of the new Strode family. They succeed, grab her, the kids, Tommy, and Dr. Loomis, dragging them all to Smith's Grove for our conclusion. Considering this is a series that started out with ""crazy guy escapes hospital, kills babysitters,"" that's some needlessly complicated nonsense.I don't know if we needed an explanation for Michael's powers. Being ""pure evil"" was always enough for me. The titular ""Curse"" is the Curse of Thorn, a Celtic rite in which one member of a family is cursed to become a super-slasher and murder his family as a sacrifice to the god Samhain. (Which is actually pronounced ""Sah-wan"" and also not a god.) Myers annual appearances are tied to a corresponding constellation appearing in the sky. Instead of revealing this information gradually, this is dumped on us as raw exposition.Tying the Shape's origin in with the history of Halloween makes sense but this is a deeply unsatisfying explanation. Instead of being a naturally occurring evil, Myers was chosen by a cult. Instead of killing randomly, Myers is eliminating his family. Instead of being a normal boy who became a killer inexplicably, young Michael heard voices urging him to kill. Myers isn't a unique phenomena but instead one in a line of many ceremonial killers. This goes against what the original movie was about.The screenplay structure is all over the place. The extended Strode family was obviously introduced to up the body count. Older brother Tim and girlfriend Beth are attempting to bring Halloween back to Haddonfield as a political statement, which doesn't make sense. In order to do this, they invite obnoxious shock jock Barry Sims, a cross between Howard Stern and Art Bell, to town. Sims is murdered for no reason while Tim and Beth get naked before getting murdered. This subplot has little impact on the film. The Strode parents aren't much help either, existing only to die. This business is unrelated to the cult storyline.The direction is frequently questionable. Scenes are repeated in slow motion, color is inverted, and the editing haphazard. The sound design is atrocious. Punishingly musical stings pop up. Slashing sounds are randomly inserted. The music switches between the traditional ""Halloween"" theme, an awful techno remix, and heavy metal guitars. This is more frustrating since director John Chapelle is not without visual sense. The blinding white hallways of the sanitarium are striking.The film completely implodes in the last act. The identity of the Man in Black is underwhelmingly revealed. The cult is planning to perform a surgery. This is not elaborated on. There's a suggestion of genetic manipulation, which has no business in ""Halloween."" Myers turns on the cult for no reasons, signaling the film's transformation into a chase-and-slash flick.The acting and characters are terrible too. Barry Simms, performed by a shouting Leo Geter, is incredibly obnoxious. Amazingly, he's not the most annoying character in this film. That dishonors falls to John Strode, the constantly ranting patriarch of the Strode family. Actor Bradford English plays it as exaggerated theater. Mom Debra is played by Kim Darby, who deserves so much better then this. Darby plays a bitty version of Velma from ""Scooby-Doo,"" even loosing her glasses at a pivotal moment. Marianne Hagan, as the final girl, is incredibly flat. Her screams of help during one moment are hilarious. Young Paul Rudd plays Tommy Doyle. He's obviously set up as the new Dr. Loomis, the well-meaning but possibly unhinged knower of evil. Rudd can't pull it off, acting like a socially awkward conspiracy theorist. All the acting is exaggerated, lending an air of unreality. Even the random old lady is a terrible actor! In the middle of this is dying Donald Pleasence. Donald is in high spirits, laughing and smiling in-between dialogue about evil and rage. A consummate professional up until the end.The only thing ""Curse"" gets right is Michael's look. Part 4's George Wilbur returns but skips the shoulder-pads. The mask is the best since part two's, even if the long hair throws me off. Michael, once again, is tearing people apart with his bare hands, using axes and machetes, teleporting all over the place, and playing possum on the floor. The gore is exaggerated, including an exploding head.""Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers"" was a troubled production, with daily rewrites, extensive reshoots and re-editing. Still, I can't imagine any movie hassled with the Curse of Thorn plot line being good. No wonder all future sequels ignore mess of a film. I known I still have other stinkers to work through but I'm prepared now to declare this my least favorite ""Halloween"" film.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
119,MovieFan983,"Not bad, but not particulary great either",6,10 January 1999,"At least its better than part 4 (I haven't seen 5 yet). It was ok, the gore made it good. 6 out of 10.

120,MovieFan983,A fair Halloween sequel,6,10 February 1999,"Actually, this was a pretty good Halloween flick, that is under rated. Although it didn't make much sense, and was overly gory (which I like), it was still good. The story has Michael returning to Haddonfield to kill the people who live in his house. Well the old Myers house, someone has bought it and is living in it. This movie has some of the best killing scenes and very bloody results.My fav: When the guy's head explodes, that was awesome. Now in the opening sequence, Michaels niece, who escapes from the mental institution, has a baby, and is trying to hide it from Michael. She does, he kills her, and he can't find his nephew. The boy from the first, Tommy the boy who Laurie Strode babysitted, find the kid, and takes him in. Inevitably Michael goes after him, tries to kill him. Some of the sequences are a letdown, as is the ending, but over-all it's a good Halloween installment. 6 out of 10.

121,refinedsugar,Jekyll and Hyde,6,31 July 2000,"Halloween 6 isn't the unwatchable mess some people make it out to be, but after the original, the series has been hit 'n miss and that's being kind. Fan or not. That puts H6 in a weird place. It's not great, but it's not entirely awful either. In fact, through all the silliness and absurd turns, it perhaps had the most promise of any Halloween sequel. It delivers on little of this by the end, but the feeling remains. If this had been done right, Halloween 6 could have been the final and most respectable sequel in the franchise. Back in 1995, when it was still relatively fresh. Of course, how things should go doesn't dictate how they will.The majority agree H4 was an upswing in the series, but then came H5. Now whenever you found it entertaining or not, it was a definite misstep in the series. It was up to H6 - six years down the road - to repair all the damage done to story, character and still be an entertaining product on its own. Did it falter under it's own pressure, time lapsed from the previous installment, massive human error or fan hype left unchecked? Let's say all of the above.H6 is sporadically entertaining and effectively dark. Michael is scary. Donald Pleasence is still a treat to watch as the tireless Loomis, but it's also got a lot of things both big and small wrong with it that cannot be dismissed. Hence the disappointment on the part of many including me. I remember with nostalgia when H6 was about to come out. I remember those awesome trailers. Finally after six years we'd get to learn what the heck was going on. What happened to Michael. Jamie. Who the MiB was. What that symbol meant. They botch this delivery, but I appreciated the effort if nothing else the series was taking to flesh out Michael and keep a flow of continuity, story and mythology going. Along with Dr. Loomis, the rock of the series in my honest opinion, bringing back earlier established characters like Tommy Doyle and Dr. Wynn and expanding 'em was a nice touch on the hand of the writer. Anything else positive could be said in bullet form. Good mask. Bits of real suspense. Nice track by Brother Cane and select pieces from series music stable Alan Howarth. Paul Rudd pre-stardom doing his thing. The Myers house looks right again.What's wrong? Almost everything intermediately. It all leads back to the same point in the road. The level of interference involved. We all know the story. Bad test screenings, meddling by the director / producer / studio, the reshoots, rewrites and all the problems they brought about. Donald Pleasence's passing, amping up the gore factor, the infamous bootleg P-Cut that made the rounds, not paying Danielle Harris a measly five grand to replay her role, releasing a Halloween film in September, etc. Honestly you couldn't plan to mess up this bad and then mess up this bad. It's truly epic how in the pursuit of making a relatively cheap film on five million dollars this went the way it did. No one expects world class cinema from a horror franchise ... especially by the point you've reached the fifth sequel, but it boggles the mind how easy it is to bang up a series so badly over time, but they've done it.Where does the fault lay? Ultimately it doesn't matter. Sufficient to say the end product known as Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers is a jumble of two different movies merged into one that is by and large suffering an identity crisis. It's still fun in places, but those parts (and the film's sordid history) are worth more than the sum of its whole unfortunately.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
122,Condemned-Soul,Manages to take a memorably scary villain and turn him into a lumbering idiot,3,20 March 2020,"'Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers' turns the series from a horror to a comedy, as it disastrously tries to give its titular villain an origin story. When a constellation aligns into the mark of a cult on October 31st, that's why Michael comes out to play. It's so obvious once you give it some thought, as why else would he come back every now and then on Halloween night and murder?But in all seriousness, the once frightening image of Michael Myers, who carefully stalked his victims from the shadows, has now been reduced to a lumbering idiot with teleportation abilities. He pops up wherever he wants, has knowledge of where his victims are at all times (a nice nod to Jaws 4), and takes pleasure in inflicting vicious violence, which the character originally never did. Gratuitous violence can't hide the lack of imagination when it comes to scaring the audience; and if that wasn't enough, the obnoxious sound design that punctures scenes intermittently saves the director from putting in any effort to clever camera placements or lighting techniques; the ""horror"" can all be accomplished in post-production instead!John Carpenter's theme is butchered completely, there's a nice homage to David Cronenberg's 'Scanners' with an electrocution that leads to an (implausible) head explosion, and finally, if you aren't suffering enough as the plot nosedives towards a ridiculous ending, there's plenty of dull characterisation to mull over.Donald Pleasance once again appears as Dr Loomis in what would be his final film role, and he does a commendable job with what dialogue he's given. Plus 'Halloween 6' would give debutant Paul Rudd a chance to laugh in the decades to comes at his awful beginnings in cinema.3/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
123,shaun98,A mess,3,24 April 2002,"[possible spoilers] The sixth ""Halloween"" film is an utterly depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the manner envisioned by the filmmakers. By now, everyone knows the story of how it was butchered and released in such a sloppy, incoherent form. The second half, in particular, makes little to no sense, as plot elements are introduced and dropped, seemingly at random. The very ending left me scratching my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture. It's not a pretty sight. On a related note, this is the most graphically violent entry in the series. I have no problem with gore if it's in the right place, but this movie takes it to absurd levels. The infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series. Michael himself even seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being, inconsistent with his efficient, methodical approach in the John Carpenter original. I'm not quite sure who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I'd be perfectly happy to grant a pardon to all concerned if only they'd release the legendary ""Producers' Cut,"" a more complete version of the film that is a vast improvement from every account. From what I understand, it's like a different movie altogether. I offer to pay full price to purchase the DVD if Miramax comes to its senses and releases it. There are a handful of good elements, however. The idea of Michael being controlled by the Druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a neat tie-in with the original. The slick visuals help make the proceedings a bit more watchable. But these meager offerings are overshadowed by the overload of drivel we have to put up with.
Finally, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" is noted for being Donald Pleasance's last film. Many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut, and when he does appear, he seems frail and unhappy. The movie is dedicated to his memory, a blatant (if unintentional insult) if there was ever one. The fact that a talented performer should end his career like this is too depressing to even think about. *1/2 (out of ****)Released by Dimension Films",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

126,TheMovieDoctorful,Surprises Abound; The BEST Halloween Movie In EVERY Aspect,10,28 February 2017,"To date, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is the worst critically received Halloween film to date. Earning a mere 6% on Rotten Tomatoes, it's often regarded as the franchise's ultimate failure by fans and critics alike. I'm here to tell you that, in my opinion, they couldn't possibly be more wrong. Apart from a couple minor goofs, (And, contrary to popular belief, nothing that clashes with canon) I found Curse of Michael Myers to be the best acted, best characterized, most atmospheric and, most shocking of all, scariest film in the whole franchise and one of the most underrated slashers of all time.Curse of Michael Myers was released in the mid 90s, a time when many popular horror franchises had descended into pure camp and borderline obnoxious self parody completely devoid of character development or even a hint of depth, let alone scares. (""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Jason Goes To Hell, both noxious) How unexpected it is then to find that Halloween 6 is not only a dark and serious slasher film, but remains the darkest franchise entry to date. Michael's kills here are more than just brutal, they're truly painful and sadistic in nature. They're the kind of kills that had me tensing up before they even began and outright cringing when they were executed. More frightening still, the film makes it clear nearly right off the bat that nobody is safe from Michael's wrath here; EVERYONE is fair game to be grotesquely murdered at a moment's notice. When Michael is on screen, the film makes a real note to have him often be unseen by his victims, his appearance briefly shown in lightning or flashes of light. Add in George P. Wilbur's frightening and imposing screen presence as The Shape and you have a genuinely frightening ride. Even the atmosphere of the film is significantly darker than the other Halloween entries. It's hard to describe, but there's a real sense of evil in the air throughout the production that really made me uneasy and just generally uncomfortable. Maybe it's the heavy use of dark blues, maybe it's the unnatural and ominous music. Either way, more than any series entry, Curse of Michael Myers has that Halloween FEELING.The creepy, off-putting nature of the film is greatly boosted by the performances. Paul Rudd is criminally underrated as the tortured Tommy Doyle; the constant trembling of his voice and his twitchy facial expressions do an excellent job portraying the character's disturbed and haunted nature. Particularly impressive is a scene near the end where he confronts Michael in a hospital, the unimaginable stress and horror of the scene causing him to almost laugh out of pure shock. Donald Pleasence has never been better as Dr. Loomis, giving nothing short of his all in the final acting role before his tragic death. Janice Knickrehm's performance as Mrs. Blankenship has been tragically overlooked by fans of the franchise. While her screen time is limited, her almost babying vocal delivery when describing Myers' origins and the cults intentions is downright bone chilling. Particularly frightening and disturbing are her interactions with the young, impressionable Danny Strode; the faux motherly sincerity combined with her sadistic intentions for the child make their scenes together scary as Hell.The social commentary in the film is incredibly well done as well. The main theme of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers seems to be individual and community reactions to tragedy. Michael Myers has almost become a celebrity in this film; a boogeyman to most, an icon to some and even, in one of the film's few light hearted and comedic moments, a sex symbol to a few. The common connection between everyone seems to be the focus on Michael rather than his victims. Tommy Doyle's mental and emotional scars run deep from witnessing Michael's horrific rampage as a young child in the original Halloween, to the point of severely stunted emotional and social development. Yet, despite all the trauma and pain he suffered, the town of Haddonfield is less concerned with the well being of the victim then they are in their borderline worship of Michael, even going so far as to dismiss Tommy as a ""creep."" Most concerning of all, despite Haddonfield's borderline obsession with Michael, they don't even remember Doyle was one of his victims. This kind of celebrity treatment of mass murderers over the innocents whose lives they destroy is as prevalent and relevant to American media today as it was back in 1995, if not moreso.Many audiences have taken issue with Michael being a sexual predator and having been revealed to be under the control of the Cult of Thorn. To address the first point, I have no problem believing that Michael would resort to rape. Michael is a sadomasichist with an all-consuming obsession for his family, one who snapped well before he reached puberty. It makes sense that his deeply repressed sexuality would come out in unhealthy and dangerous ways. Second, the Cult of Thorn was not controlling Michael. They were merely pointing him in the right direction, mistakenly believing in their hubris that they could harness Michael's power as a weapon. But as Tommy Doyle ominously foreshadows in the beginning, ""You can't control evil. You can lock it up, burn it, and bury it, and pray that it dies, but it never will. It just...Rests awhile."" And awaken the evil does, slaughtering the Cult of Thorn one by one in that nightmarish Hospital scene, a force of evil delivering penance on foolish mortals for their arrogance. In a way, the Cult subplot only strengthens the concept of Michael as The Shape, The Bogeyman.On every level that matters, ""Curse of Michael Myers"" is leaps and bounds above any of the other sequels or remakes. I may have been able to understand if the film had mixed reaction, but for it to be the most hated film in the series baffles me (Seriously? Critics thought Halloween III and Resurrection were better than this? Wow...Words escape me.) Don't listen to the critics. Curse of Michael Myers is truly the gold standard of the Halloween franchise and the best Halloween film since the original.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

128,chucknorrisfacts,Not too bad.,6,5 September 2007,"""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" is a film I didn't really like when I first saw it, but after having given it a second chance several years later it was not quite as bad as I had remembered it. It's still better than most horror movies out there.Paul Rudd plays Tommy Doyle, one of the children Laurie Strode babysat in the original ""Halloween"". After his encounter with Michael in the first film, Tommy has become obsessed with unlocking the mystery of Michael Myers.Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Sam Loomis, and very sadly for the last time in the franchise. He joins forces with Tommy in trying to put a stop to Michael once and for all.This film builds on the continuity set forth in the fourth and fifth ""Halloween"" films, ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" and ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" respectively. In all honesty, for the sixth entry in a film's franchise, it's pretty good. Overall, I'd say check it out. In order to enjoy this movie at its fullest, I'd recommend seeing parts four and five first.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
129,piratecannon,Cursed Indeed,4,27 December 2012,"The sixth entry in the Halloween franchise picks up some years after the conclusion of Halloween 5. Jamie Lloyd is now a full grown adult, and she's just given birth. Unfortunately for her, Jamie has been kept in the basement of Smith's Grove Sanitarium (the facility that has housed Michael during his stints in and out of custody) by the likes of an underground Druid cult that seeks to somehow restore the once great night of Halloween to its former glory. What that former glory entails is anyone's guess; some gibberish about mayhem, bonfires and star alignments is thrown into the mix, but said references are every bit as vague as they sound.The question you likely have is this: How does Michael Myers fit into all this ridiculousness? Well, as the previous movies have indicated, he's somehow connected to the Druid sacrificial rite, but a lucid explanation of the exact role he plays is—yet again—conspicuously absent. I suppose it doesn't really matter, though; he's still alive, still angry, and still killing people. Once again he's after the last living remnant of the Myers bloodline, the newborn baby of his aforementioned niece. Oddly enough, Tommy Doyle—one of the children from the original Halloween that Laurie babysat ""the night he came home""—has become obsessed with the persistent rumors about Michael and has rented a room across the street from the Myers house to keep tabs on its residents, one of whom is a kid with the same penchant for murder that Michael himself demonstrated so many years ago.Loomis is back, too. He is, of course, not surprised in the least when Michael reappears in Haddonfield, and the usual hijinks ensue (namely, people don't believe the famed serial killer is still alive, make the mistake of writing him off, and end up getting axed in oh-so-creative ways). The atmosphere generated in the movie is admirable, and this is one of Michael's more menacing outings. Still, one can't help but feel disappointed by the lack of story development, and the movie's conclusion feels much too abrupt. This almost certainly is a direct result of director Joe Chappelle's apparent distaste for Pleasence. According to the Internet Movie Database, Chappelle found many of Pleasence's scenes ""boring,"" and thus engaged in heavy editing in an effort to trim down his presence in the movie. The result is a disjointed affair that's not nearly as effective as it could have been.In short, The Curse of Michael Myers is a convoluted mess that only pretends to answer some of the longstanding questions surrounding the Halloween mythology. The movie has its moments, and the presence of Paul Rudd as the now adult Doyle adds some memorability to the cast of characters.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

But the movie was great. Michael was strong, big and his killings were great. Like at the start he slammed the women head in to the sharp point and broke the guy's neck with the flick of the wrist. The dark atmosphere was great and Michael was wicked. Overall this movie was cool, some new killings by michael, a freaky music score and some pretty good acting. But the THORN thing wasn't a good touch.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
131,CowherPowerForever,It's over! It's finally over. It's all over.,6,24 October 2014,"The following review will contain spoilers.Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers takes place six years after Halloween 5. The film was also released six years after Halloween 5. As most hardcore fans know, the production on Halloween 6 was one of the biggest disasters in the horror genre. Splitting opinions caused a mayhem on events that lead to the theatrical version being one of the worst pieces of film in the entire franchise. The only thing that saved it was the Producer's Cut, and even that version wasn't amazing. The following is my review of Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers.Daniel Farrands wrote the film and is know more recently for his work on some fantastic documentaries His work on this film will always be a point of controversy. His original screenplay for the film was apparently a very good effort, but studio heads(The Weinstein Brothers) wanted a more slasher take to the film, and thus things got twisted and turned around. The basic story of this film is that we find out more about what drives Michael Myers to kill. Basically he was called upon as a young kid to kill for a group called Thorn. The idea is a giant step in the wrong directing in my opinion, but because Halloween 5 set this up, ending this story had to be done. The story itself is very strange as we find out at the start of the film that Jamie Lloyd has died following the events of Halloween 5 in the prison escape. However, the truth is she is actually alive, and she is seen for the early part of this film. We find out later in the theatrical version just in passing that the child Jamie is carrying in the early part of the film is actually Michael's child. Yeah, very strange stuff. However, in the Producer's Cut we get a much more stern hint that the child Jamie has is in fact Michael's Child. Either way you slice the cake, the story of this film is very odd. The Producer's Cut excels in other areas which I will be getting into soon. Overall, the story itself is very odd, and certainly one of the worst of the franchise(second worst in my opinion). Farrands apparently had a good idea for the story, but it got lost in the shuffle, so I cannot really blame him for the mess that is this film.The film was directed by Joe Chappelle. Chappelle will take a good bit of the blame on this production as he was the director, but he was young and wanted to please the studio heads. The Weinstein's are the real villains behind this awful mess called Halloween 6. The Theatrical version of this film actually underwent some re-shoots because the Weinstein's wanted more gore. The Theatrical Cut of the film seems to be a Friday the 13th type rip off, instead of being a nice thrilling horror film. The Producer's Cut of the film excels in the regard of letting you use your imagination instead of overloading on the gore factor. While there is still blood, and more than the original film, it certainly doesn't compare to the mess that was the Theatrical Cut of this film. The acting is pretty bland once again as the film stars a young Paul Rudd. Sadly, this was the final Halloween film for acting legend Donald Pleasence. He sadly passed away before the film was ever released in theaters. While this wasn't exactly the best movie for him to go out on, just seeing him one last time take a strong command of the Dr. Loomis role was such a great joy to see. Halloween fans will always remember the legacy he created for himself doing a total of five of these movies, never thinking twice about it. He loved the role as much as us fans love the entire franchise. Overall, Joe Chappelle was a young director trying to become famous and he got himself into a battle that no one was going to win. The end result was a sub par film.Alan Howarth also came back for this outing, this would be his last try at the Halloween score, as the later films went a different route. The score is this film, is once again dependent on which version of the film you are watching. The score on the Theatrical Cut is bizarre at times. There is some almost heavy metal added to it, and some 1990s grunge rock added as well. While Howarth is credited for some of the bad scoring of this film, during the re-shoots for some of the scenes, Paul Rabjohns actually came in to finish off the score for Howarth. The end result was a giant mess of a score for the Theatrical Cut. The Producer's Cut however has a much more classic John Carpenter feel to it, and it really makes that version of the film so much better. Howarth deserves some blame here, but not that much,In closing this film wasn't really the best effort to end on. The Thorn storyline frankly shouldn't have even been considered, and should have never moved along as far as it did in this film. While the Theatrical Cut is a giant mess, the Producer's Cut is much more watchable even though there are still some ludicrous story lines in it. Fans of the franchise like myself will not only watch the Theatrical Version, but also watch the Producer's Cut, and while the Producer's Cut has been on bootleg version for over a decade, it has finally been released on Blu-Ray in stunning quality for everyone to finally see. It might not be the version that should have been made, but the Producer's Cut is the best version of the film that was shot.Theatrical Cut: 3/10 Producer's Cut: 6/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
132,BlueSkies765,Donald Pleasence's farewell,10,25 November 2019,"Halloween 6 the bad memories the fans have. Loathed, considered one of the worst in the franchise, the weird Halloween movie. I liked it however! Maybe not for the best reasons but I still liked it.First reason is this is the last movie with Donald Pleasence aka Dr. Loomis. He's an integral part of the Halloween franchise. The soul of Halloween is simply not the same without the original Dr. Loomis. He understands Michael when few do and is one of the few who can somewhat tame him. He's noble and brave and almost like the comforting father figure in the madness called Haddonfield on Halloween. No matter how absurd the plot gets when he gets on it always captivates me.Second reason is nostalgia. Halloween is one of the first horror movies I've watched. Michael always scared the heck out of me somehow. Always being able to catch up to his prey all while calmly moving around. I can't remember seeing Halloween 6 as a kid. It was always part 2, 4 and 5 on television.
I discovered part 6 years later. The nostalgic value for part 6 is that it takes place in 1994/1995. 2 of my most favorite years of the 90s. So seeing the fashion and settings just gives me a good feeling.Third reason is that Michael is big and bad in this one. Terrifying as the unstoppable bogeyman. I can see how fans dislike part 6 because they feel this movie is far removed from the original. Some of the scenes require suspension of disbelief as things happen that are clearly impossible. But if we want to be honest every Halloween movie had some of these scenes.
Ultimately I felt there were enough scary scenes that captured a bit of that frighting Halloween vibe which makes me like part 6 and makes Halloween my favorite horror franchise.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Tommy has become obsessed with Michael Myers and has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house. The family it self are a relatives of Laurie Strode, that's why Michael stalks each of every Strodes and trying to get the baby. Together with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance), Tommy tries to reveal the secret beneath the mask of Michael Myers's life.

Michael Myers is still looks so scary. The gore scene is good. Frankly, this is a decent sequel.

138,scott-sw,Awful,4,30 December 2007,"Halloween the Curse of Michael Myers was one of the last movies I critiqued before I left movie reviewing for good. In any case, it takes place several years after Michael disappeared from Haddonfield. The little town is about to end its moratorium on celebrating Halloween. At this time, a woman escapes from a hospital and calls a local radio talk-show. She claims to be Jamie and tries to warn the people that Michael Myers is back. We then go back to Haddonfield and meet a grown up Tommy (Paul Rudd) teams up with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). They visit some of the Strode family, worried that Michael might return to take their lives. Of course, no one listens, but Michael does come back and lets his havoc reign down. There were problems with this movie from the get go. The film went through a few directors. It also went through several re-writes. Danielle Harris did not reprise her role as Jamie. And, Donald Pleasance died before the film was finished. The first mistake of this movie is trying to explain why Michael kills. There is no need to do this. Screenwriters feel the need to do this in order to frighten the audience, or out of a need to feel superior. The idea is ""we know why, and so we have to explain it to you."" Let the audience fill in the rest. Let us try and figure it out on our own. Our most frightening thoughts will find the explanation. Just as Dr. Loomis said in Halloween II, ""We are afraid most of the dark inside ourselves."" The second problem is Michael again betrays his character. In the original concept, he only kills to set a trap, or when he is cornered. He also relies on brute strength. In this outing, he goes on a raging rampage. Michael needs no rage. His is simply pathological. Finally, the absence of Danielle Harris is sorely missed. She was magnificent in Halloween IV and V (in fact, she saved V from being a total bomb). In case you are wondering, I have seen the producer's cut (since when do we have producer's cuts?) and it did not help this terrible film. It is the worst of the Michael Myers franchise. Sure, Halloween III was boring, but this one was plain bad.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
139,Eraser81,"Before studio interference, this is a great sequel",10,16 December 1999,"After years of unused scripts and studio limbo, Halloween 6 finally began rolling in fall of 1994. The legendary Donald Pleasence returned in what would be his final role, as did George P. Wilbur who donned the mask in Halloween 4. Alan Howarth also returned to score a Halloween film for the final time. Characters from the orginal Halloween also return, in the form of Tommy Doyle and Dr. Wynn. This Halloween is known for having two versions, the original cut, known as The Producers Cut, and the theatrical version. The Producers Cut is more coherent, has better music, and features more of Dr. Loomis. The theatrical version is incoherent, has a pumped up Halloween theme, and more gore. This being a Halloween film, I'll take more Donald Pleasence as opposed to more gore.This Halloween installment is dark, weird, well shot, uses different camera angles, and an improvement over the troubled Halloween 5. Where they went wrong however, is they listened to 14 year old boys after a test screening, and butchered the entire film. Reshoots took place in late July 1995, after much footage had already surfaced in trailers and on tv horror specials, making it confusing to whomever saw the film in the theater expecting to see those scenes, as I did. Luckily, after years of dark blurry bootleg copies of The Producers Cut, Dimension Films finally released it in high definition Blu Ray discs. My favorite Halloween films include John Carpenter's original, the underrated Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and this one.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

142,Phantasm01,Michael's work isn't done in Haddonfield yet...,8,2 August 2006,"By now, everybody knows that Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers was butchered by Dimension Films prior to release. Several scenes were cut out of the film, others were shortened and the ending was entirely (and probaby for the best) reshot. That's not to say that this theatrical cut ending is anything good...but acceptable and a little less silly than the original ending.This sixth entry in the Halloween series has its problems to be sure, but it's also pretty scary. Picking up six years after Halloween 5, we meet up again with Jamie Lloyd who has just given birth to a child in the confines on the Thorn cult compound. Jamie escapes with her baby and Michael follows. From here on, Michael returns to Haddonfield, Dr. Loomis (the returning Donald Pleasence in his final performance) is in pursuit and the mystery of the man in black is finally revealed. The problem with this theatrical cut is that it's largely incoherent. Most of the plot seems to have been removed, several key character development scenes have been snipped and what remains, is basically, the stalk and slash carnage that Michael Myers wreaks on the family living in the Myers house.All of this may sound like carping, but far from it, this Halloween is actually one of the scariest (right behind 1 and 4), although it never quite matches up to those superior Halloween films, this one gives the viewer plenty of spooky scenes and some undeniable suspense. Rising star Paul Rudd turns up in an early starring role as Tommy Doyle who Laurie Strode babysat for in the original film. Tommy is now obsessed with Michael and knows that he has returned. Rudd's Tommy is a great character, Paul Rudd brings a lot of charm and charisma to the role-he makes for a great screen presence, it's too bad the series wouldn't revisit this character, for he is much more interesting than the sniveling alcoholic Jamie Lee Curtis gave us in Halloween H20.Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is widely debated amongst Halloween fans, while it's flawed to the extreme, to deny its impact is to be ignorant. Director Joe Chappelle takes a lot of flak for this film, but he actually infuses a lot of style and suspense into the 88 minue running time. The operating room massacre scene is a highlight among the Halloween series..not to mention the cool quick cut opening. In an earlier cut of the film, Chappelle actually comes off as a much stronger director, we see lots of awesome homages to the original Halloween such as a scene of Michael stalking Kara as she walks home from school, and a scene of Dr. Loomis fighting with the local police. Many nice touches were abandoned in favor of a shorter film...it really is a shame.In the hands of a more capable, competent studio, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers may have had a better chance...the makings of a great sequel were definitely there (track down the infamous H6 producers cut). As it stands, turn your brain off, turn down the lights and be ready to be scared. Michael has come back to Haddonfield to kill and Halloween will never be the same.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
143,BenTramerLives78,Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers,8,15 March 2021,"Many fans of the Halloween films were disappointed after Halloween 5 (1989) and rightly so. Towards the end of that film, we saw a mysterious man in black that helped Michael escape from his cell, so the writers of Halloween 6 had to come up with a way to tie up the loose ends of the previous film. They came up with a whole backstory on why Michael Myers is a murderer, and it's not great, but I guess they had to do what they had to do.The Curse of Michael Myers is actually a decent film despite the backstory because it has the creepy feel of the first two films and Michael's mask looks better than in did in the last two films. This film marks the film debut of Paul Rudd. In this film, Rudd plays Tommy Doyle, the little boy Laurie babysat in the original film.I think The Curse of Michael Myers is a decent entry in the series overall.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
144,michaelgarykelley1994,A Review For Both The Theatrical Cut And The Producer's Cut,7,2 November 2018,"Yes, I finally bought and watched a copy of the Producer's Cut, after seeing the theatrical version about three times, over the years. I have some interesting thoughts on these films, and you might just be interested in them. And, yes, this is not the usual situation of having a separate film that has extra scenes added-in. This is almost like a completely different movie, at times.I'm not a huge Halloween franchise fanatic, but I enjoy some entries quite a bit. I mentioned seeing the Theatrical Cut of ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" three times, and I must say it has slowly grown on me. I love the soundtrack for that film, and I think the look of it (and editing, as well) come across as if the film is a made-for-TV movie (which I have no problem with). There's something about it I like, even though I know many people are more fond of the Producer's Cut and it's editing technique (if you can call it that).I will say, up front, that I can't stand the Thorn storyline. For anyone who doesn't know what that is yet, I won't spoil it for you, but-in either film release-it's so out-of-place for this series, no matter how dumb ""Halloween 5"" and it's ending may have been. In the Producer's Cut, the finale heavily includes the Thorn storyline, and I just don't like it as much as the Theatrical Cut. It all comes down to personal taste, here, but the Theatrical Cut just feels right, for the direction the creators chose to go in, for this particular film. I don't exactly understand the love for the Producer's Cut that I've seen all over the internet for YEARS.In the Theatrical Cut, we had some chilling, hypnotic songs that felt so much like October, for me, and we also got an amazing electric guitar cover of the Halloween theme song. Here, in the Producer's Cut, we actually got the original theme identical to the one from ""Halloween"" (the first film), on piano, which is actually pretty effective, in some areas. So both versions definitely have a solid soundtrack, in my opinion, for building some solid tension.The acting, no matter which version you see, will baffle you. It's ALL bad. This is the last Donald Pleasance performance we get, in the series, and it's so bad, there's no words. I just don't like it, whatsoever. Every character-especially the main character, who's a single mother-is awful. Paul Rudd (Ant-Man himself) is in this movie, and even he's terrible. I like his particular character (which, for the sake of anyone whom hasn't seen this flick, I won't ruin his identity), but the writing and direction for Paul's performance are absolutely insanely stupid. However, I do enjoy the Uncle. He's a younger fellow, and I think he's decent, for what this script is giving him. Again: it doesn't matter which version of the film you're watching, when it comes to the acting; it'll all sink your boat, my friend. All of it. But the ""Halloween"" films have never had the best acting, no matter what anyone tells you, anyway. Let's be honest.Regardless of the theatrical release or the producer's release, I love the look of the film. It FEELS like Halloweentime, and that's an atmospheric element I think is essential to make this series work in a proper and effective manner. Definitely gives me something to smile about, whilst watching.I have to say that, if I had seen the theatrical version as a child, I believe I would've grown to consider it my personal favorite of the series. I don't know exactly what it is, but that particular cut just impressed me, for some reason.I'm avoiding spoilers, but I have to mention, at least, the quality of the scenes that were spliced back into the Producer's Cut. Some of this newly-released content is absolutely ridiculous. I don't like those new elements, even though I went into the film knowing they were there (due to the insane debate over which of these versions is the best, all these years). Some of these new moments have nice execution, but most others are absolute garbage that just feel incomplete and over-the-top in a way that makes me sort of cringe. ESPECIALLY one of the things involving Michael. Ugh. I'll never unsee-or unTHINK-that scene.Even though my star rating is a six, that's exclusive to the Theatrical Cut.My rating for the Producer's Cut of ""Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers"" is a four-out-of-ten stars. I can see the appeal of the Producer's Cut, but it's definitly not for me-especially with how fond I've grown to the Theatrical Cut. But, again, that's all just personal taste.I'd never recommend someone who's not a fan of the series to check this out, but if it turns out you fancy Michael Myers flicks, then-by all means-take a chance at getting both versions of this film, because you may enjoy one, or both, in the end.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

146,CalDexter,"Another comedy, another waste of a budget",1,13 October 2008,"If this, the sixth in the Halloween series has got anything going for it, its a classic scene where Paul Rudd as the Tommy Doyle character is trying to bang open a door with a fire extinguisher, then he notices Michael Myers sleepwalking towards him and the expression on his face and reaction with the extinguisher is worth the price of admission alone. The Halloween films continuing on from 1988's Return Of Michael Myers are watchable horror comedies, with the fan base knowing exactly what they will get for their money: slashed teens, slaughtered bystanders and a parody of the original movie and its fantastic sequel.Special mention must go to Donald Pleasence for giving us the wonderful performance of Doctor Samuel Loomis. I always enjoyed how he was a calming and assuring influence to the frightening force of evil he was tracking in Halloween I and II. By Halloween 4 he was clearly doing it for the bread.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
147,culmo80,Probably one of the worst Halloween films...but still worth seeing,5,4 March 2013,"Here's why.Through 4 movies leading up to Curse of Michael Myers, we see him get stabbed, shot, run over, set on fire, blown up, etc. He always comes back stronger than ever though! This film explains that Michael was given special powers by the Cult of Thorn on Halloween night when he was a boy (the opening scene in the original Halloween). Aside from that, it's just another chance to see Michael Myers in action. Pretty weak reasons, I know, but if you love the Halloween franchise, you can't not see this movie...if for anything for the last appearance of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance).This film could have been better if it worked on the plot a little better, however. Of course Halloween, like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street was just about squeezing out the dollars...much like the modern Saw films or Paranormal Activity; the idea is to do as many sequels as possible before the franchise completely dries up.Still, this film at least has some connection to the original film unlike Halloween Resurrection or Halloween III. Not that I don't like Halloween III...",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
148,cheighlee,The one with Paul Rudd in it,3,18 June 2018,"Whoo boy, now we're cooking.So, the last movie ended with a bang, prison exploded, Myers vanished, Jamie vanished and all that thanks to mysterious cloaked stranger with some serious firepower.Fast forward few years and we get a ritual, druids, robes, tombs, hallways, satanic panic rituals, altars, curvy daggers and all that. Jamie is now giving a birth to Michael Myers baby! Deal with it. She get's deaded soon after, baby ends up with Paul Rudd in the most idiotic way possible, who by the way plays that kid Tommy, that Laurie babysits in the the original movie. There is some chick there also, who cares. Loomis is retired, Paul Rudd is a conspiracy theory whackjob.And this is when it gets crazy.That sign that we saw in the movie few times, is a sign of Thorn, ""Curse of Thorn"", and this cult, which mysterious stranger is a part of, wants to something, something, demon, spirit, whatever with a baby. Oh and that stranger is just some random guy, pal of Sam Loomis, I mean, the whole plot is just garbage.This movie is garbage, acting is garbage (YES, EVEN PAUL RUDD!), it's shot like garbage. From the get go, it's crappy .90's shot for TV vibe all over. It ain't scary, it's just convoluted and dumb. So, Halloween 4 through 6 is now known as a Thorn Trilogy. Also, there are two versions of this movie. Movie was so bad that they tried to salvage it by completely re-editing it with Producer's Cut, but that went even worse somehow. Sadly this is also the last movie with Donald Pleasance in it who died shortly after filming it. Because, how could he not die after this garbage.If you only saw the original Halloween and skip all in between and watched this one, you would be like ""What is wrong with these people, how could they ruin it so much?"".And you know what - still not the worst movie in the franchise, it's only third place for me.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
149,richard-wheeler,""" He walks amongst us , brother; he has come back. And he is very angry"".",8,15 October 2005,"This Halloween film and Halloween 5 were very interesting from all the rest because, it had something to do with symbolism. It was the symbol of the thorn which causes the person to KILL when a constellation of stars are seen on Halloween nights! The story begins when Jamie (J.C Brandy) had a baby and she had to save it from the murderous brother Michael (George.P.Wilbur) and then she got killed in a barn close to Haddonfield.Now, a family had moved into the Myers' residence called the Strodes, these were relatives who adopted Laurie when she was a child.A grandmother, mother, father, girl and two boys were living in the house together.They were being watched by a man who lived across the road from the unwary family and he could remember last seeing Michael on October 31, 1978. The man's name was Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd).Soon, the family's youngest son Danny (Devin Gardner) was having night mares about the ""Boogey Man"" and he started to draw thorn symbols on paper. Tommy decided to track down where Jamie's baby was and he discovered it in a bathroom at a train station. He decided to call the baby Stelia.The detective is now Dr. Winn (Mitch Ryan) because, Mr. Loomis ( Donald Pleasance) had retired. Loomis decided to go over to the Strode's and tell them what happened in the house they were living in. He told the story to Mrs.Debra Strode ( Kim Karby) she was horrified by the story and called up John Strode (Bradford English). Fortunaely, he didn't believe her and not so soon, she was killed by Michael in the courtyard.When the daughter, Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan) returned home, Debra was nowhere to be found and suddenly, she discovered Danny in his room with Tommy and he brought Danny and his mom over to his place and he explained the story to Kara. Suddenly, Danny saw Michael outside Tommy's window. And when Tommy's mother mentioned to Kara that Michael heard a voice that told him to kill his own family. As this was all happening, Mr. Strode came home and noticed that Debra was nowhere to be found and when he went into the basement; he noticed that the washing machine was on and when he opened it, he pulled out a shirt covered in blood. And then he got pushed into the main power of the house, got stabbed and then he got Electrocuted!!! Oh, I could remember this freaky part when a little girl was dancing under a tree, and her mom noticed blood on her dress and then; this dead body DROPS OUT! Gruesome. And when the oldest son, Tim (Keith Bogart) followed by his girlfriend Mary (Susan Swift) while the mom was watching through Tommy's telescope from his room. And when the mom went into the house to look for Danny because, he went in there, and when he went upstairs, her mom's body drops out of the ceiling and she discovers Tim's and Mary's bodies' under a duvet in Tim's bedroom.And to end this review, there were some kiff scenes too! When Kara saw Tomy's mom coming after her with a knife; she goes through the window to save herself and when she woke up, she was in a maximum security ward. Another was when Michael went into a surgery room and then, STAB! SHRIEK! HOWL! CRASH! BOOM! BANG! Everyone's dead. And the last one, was a full shot with Michael throwing Tommy across the room in the maximum security ward and when Tommy smacked Michael so hard against his head with fluid squirting from his eye with him screaming so house that it goes through Haddonfield, to the Strode's house, and with a medium shot set on a Jack'O' Lantern which was on the veranda and it went out.This movie was the last Halloween film that Pleasance stared in when he passed away in the Alpes- Marines in France from the complications from heart valve in surgery.

150,mercury4,Give up now,1,22 August 2003,"This is such a terrible movie. I don't know why I rented it. Maybe it was because I still thought that some day someone smart would come along and make a good Halloween sequel. It will never happen. I have a message for all of you Halloween fans. Do what I'm doing. Give up the ghost. Don't expect a good Halloween sequel to come. After this terrible movie I gave up hope for a good sequel. Comparing this movie to the very first Halloween would be a joke. First there was a great horror film made called Halloween. It had John Carpenter and he did a great job. Then after seeing how well Halloween was received they decided to make more money and make Halloween 2. No Carpenter, just Rick Rosenthal. By the way, years later they were so desperate that they brought him back for Halloween Resurrection. AKA Halloween Homecoming. Halloween 2 was definitely the last you were supposed to see of Michael Meyers. It's obvious at the end of 2 that he's dead and it's not even left open for a sequel. A third Halloween was made. There was supposed to be a whole bunch of Halloween movies with different stories. The idea fell through and they brought back our chalk faced murderer again. I guess after 2 he survived after being burned alive. I guess he also got a new pair of eyes because last time you saw him he was shot in the eyes and swinging his knife around. After that they just couldn't leave him dead. With Halloween 4 you got a not so bad, but disappointing sequel to the Halloween series. Still yet another movie was made that couldn't hold a candle to the very first. I was disgusted after 5, but after seeing this movie with bad writing, directing and acting that's when I knew they finally lost it. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After this I didn't bother anymore. I heard from people that the best part about a recent sequel; H2O, is that it ignores 4, 5, and this garbage. That's sounds okay to me. I'll check it out, but I'm not expecting anything fantastic. The people who are making the Halloween sequels are making suckers out of us. I think we should let the next one fail at the box-office. They're not movies they're magnets that attract Halloween fans with high hopes for a good sequel. Don't waste your time or money. Give up on the Halloween series. Just see Michael Myers as I do.

152,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,"""An Underrated Installment of This Franchise!"" - Theatrical Cut",7,13 June 2020,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is one of the most hated films in this franchise, and understandably so. The performances are awful (sorry, but that goes for Paul Rudd as well) except for - of course - Donald Pleasence. The characters are all either doll and/or uninteresting, and most of them are there just to expand the body count. If you don't believe the fact that this is a very hated movie, just read some of the other reviews. In short, this movie is miles away from being a great - and some would even argue good - movie.
But let's focus on all the good stuff this installment has to offer:First off, Michael Myers is really awesome in this movie and among the best portrayals of the character in this entire franchise. The kills are among the best in the entire franchise. The movie has a really unsettling and creepy atmosphere which undeniably is a plus. As mentioned above; Donald Pleasence is great playing Dr. Loomis his last time (Rest in peace).Even though this movie is very much flawed, the positives really make up for it. This is might not be a great movie, but it's a great Michael Myers movie and one of my favorites for sure! I really think it's an underrated installment of this franchise.Horror: B (Creepy Scenes, Good Atmosphere, Kills are Very Brutal)Entertainment: A- (Very Entertaining for Fans of the Franchise)Acting: D+ (Pleacense Stands Out, Sadly Nobody Else)Suspense: B+ (Some Very Suspenseful Moments, Good Chase Scenes)Characters: C (Loomis, Myers and Tommy are Interesting, Others are Quite Doll)Script/Story: C+ (Nothing Special, Some Good Elements)Overall Rating: 6.66/10 😱",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
153,tampaaries,Scariest Halloween movie,10,3 May 2021,"This was without a doubt the scariest Halloween movie, Michael was straight vicious in this movie.

154,PlayerSS,Tries to repair the damage,1,27 September 2003,"Following the events of number 5, this one tries to capitalize and repair what mistakes were made in 5. Unfortunately, part 6 was also out to make new mistakes. It explains more of the ending to 5.  The character of Jamie was back in this one, but she wasn't played by Danielle Harris. That was one mistake. Another mistake is one I don't really understand...SPOILERS At the beginning of the movie, it insinuates that Michael is the father of Jamie's baby. Why? Now we're making a incesting serial killer!? The whole storyline since the second movie has always had Michael trying to kill his family.  Why would be make more members by raping his niece? The only explanation I want to give is that it was artificial insemination. The man in black (later revealed in the movie) probably did it while Michael was knocked out. That is the major thing I hated about the movie. END SPOILERSPart 6 also tried to give reason as to why Michael kills people. That was told very sloppy and completely out of context to any believable reason. Now, all of a sudden, they have Michael associated with druids and curses? That was too unexpected. It should have been told a different way, if even at all. Do we really need to know why Michael kills? Kind of takes away from the character if you add a big pointless back story. Tommy Doyle (the kid from the first movie) makes a return; a different actor of course. That was cool that they at least tried to tie it into the first movie in a way. I didn't care for the Strode family. The actor that played Danny Strode was one ugly kid. George Wilbur also takes another shot a playing Michael. I liked him in this one better, although 4 is a much better sequel. Most of the kills are pretty standard. I liked the little girl with the ""it's raining red"" bit. That was cool. Sadly, it had an ending that didn't make sense, and an introduction with a story that was very poorly told. Those both brought the movie down greatly. Still, this movie IS better than part 5...",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

157,darryl-jason,Halloween: The Curse Of The 6th Installment!,6,17 November 2018,"Probably not the best Halloween movie out of the complete franchise, however I will say this one did give me a few scares throughout, especially the beginning scenes. The first 15 minutes or so always make me feel so intense I suddenly become like a big kid & have to leave the lights on. The whole barn-yard scene where Jamie (J.C Brandy) is silently trying to escape Michael Myers & although we know he's there somewhere in the darkened storms, he just gives me the chills. It's scenes like this that prevent me from ever walking through secluded barns alone (not that I ever would!). This really is one of the most scariest moments in the movie.I also have to say what a shame that Danielle Harris never reprised her role as ""Jamie Lloyd"", instead J.C Brandy takes her place which Is where I felt the movie lost connection to the previous films. Why they have to replace an actress with someone else I don't know. Harris was awesome in Halloween 4 & 5, I just wished she could have returned for this 6th installment even if it was to be her last appearance.Introducing Paul Rudd in his movie debut I do have to say he's a great actor & I can't fault him in this movie, he did an awesome job.All in all it's a good film, like I said, not one of the best ones but it certainly gives those chilling moments when you know Myers is back once again & for those of you who haven't seen it; I will say this, never walk alone. You never know who's around the corner.
Enjoy the film!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
158,MissCzarChasm,Words Almost Can't Describe How Bad This Is,3,30 April 2002,"If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series, than Halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult. The storyline has gone to the dogs everyone. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isn't at all scary. He reminds me of an over-weight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original. There are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and i'm so glad H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our minds.Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here(in his last performance...what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on). When he's on screen he makes you remember the good old days when Halloween was actually scary.That's about it my friends. The stalk sequences are unoriginal. One of them being a blatant rip-off of the Laurie/Michael chase in the original. The other characters are terribly under-written and just aren't likable. The music, on of Halloween's highlights even when the film is bad, is tortured in this film. we get a silly rock version of the stalk/chase theme. What were they thinking when they made this film.*SPOILER*Their biggest mistake was killin off the character of Jamie(Now played by another actress who isn't worth mentioning)We watched this character escape death in two films. We rooted for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a film.*END SPOILER*The less said about thi embarrassment the better. I wish it didn't exist. I suggest skipping this film, and even 5, and just going straight to H20 because if you watch this you may not want to see another Halloween film again.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

161,Zod-2,Most confusing entry in the series.,5,30 January 2002,"Right off the bat I'd like to state that I like all of the Halloween movies that have to do with Michael Myers.  He is by far my favourite slasher serial killer due to the fact that he is the most vulnerable.  He can be hurt and possibly even killed.  When hurt bad enough he goes into a coma so his body can heal itself.  While he does possess super human qualities the viewer gets the impression that he can be killed.  Sadly Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (H6) takes the story of Michael Myers, that was developing nicely through parts 2,4 & 5 and tries to do too much with it.  The revelation of the Man in Black is disappointing and the movie tends to ask more questions then it answers.  This entry tries to put to bed some of the story lines started in parts 4 and 5 but in doing so the conclusions it gives cause even more questions to be asked.  This is due in part to the conclusions not being very clearly presented. 
Overall the movie is okay.  The director keeps Michaels presence felt by having Michael continuously shown to be present in many scenes by appearing for a moment in the background.  It's nice touches like that that make the movie more interesting to watch. Story wise the movie seems rushed.  The director and writer capture a bit of the magic that made the original Halloween so much fun to watch but the story is far too convoluted to make much sense.  Overall I give Halloween 6 a 5 out of 10.  Halloween H20 is much better and makes for a nicely trilogy with parts 1 & 2.  Apparently Halloween: The Homecoming is due for release this year (2002) and follows H20.  Why can't they just leave well enough alone?  H20 ended the story very nicely.  I would however like to see someone clean up the plot holes that H6 made.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
162,jadediamond,Loved this movie! One of my favorites in the Halloween series,7,6 October 2018,"I liked this movie since I was kid and as I got older, I understand the hate. Jamie being impregnated by her uncle. The weird Satanic cult. The unnecessary cliche sex scene. Paul Rudd's weird voice. The crazy edits and being able to survive and still walk from falling out of a house. This movie was a hot mess but the edgier score played over the bad edits gave me life and I loved Paul Rudd's facial expressions especially when facing Michael. He was all of us the hallway scene. Of course, Donald Pleasence in his last role as Dr. Loomis was always refreshing and gave a sense of legitimacy to this franchise being in five Halloween movies. It's quite obvious he enjoyed giving his Shakespearean presence to this franchise for seventeen years. He was ill during the filming of this movie and died the year it was released. I loved Paul Rudd. This was his first starring role, but I'm confused because the first time I saw him on screen was in Clueless which also came out the same year. Yet, he looks the same in Knocked up, Ant Man, etc... The man doesn't age but he's a great actor and he was fun to watch playing Tommy, the kid Laurie babysat in the original Halloween. I have nothing to say negative about this crazy, ridiculously fun movie with a great score bringing a new life to the series and a dash of classic Michael Myers' horror. The movie went through production hell: delayed production for years due to poor audience reception of Halloween 5; legal issues; lowballing and insulting Danielle Harris out of reprising her role as Jamie; studio changes; poor audience reception then having to rush in post production to re-edit the movie, the death of Donald Pleasence, weather issues, and so on. So yes, it's obvious it's been heavily edited but it's the best they could under the circumstances. So I enjoyed the final product and the conclusion to the Jamie Lloyd trilogy of the Halloween franchise.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
163,Cole_Early,FAR Too Many Holes...,3,22 June 2007,"Egh... In all honesty, (and only in my opinion), this film's lack of existence would have helped the series over-all. It was intended to tie up all of the loose ends, but personally, I think this film created more holes than it patched.First off... the actress of Jamie Lloyd in parts 4 & 5 should have been played by Danielle Harris herself, IF the movie absolutely HAD to be made. Second, I'm aware that the ending occurrence of Dr. Sam Loomis was in reality, unexpected, but... perhaps they could have went about announcing it a bit differently. I didn't really like the way that they let the audience know about it in the end. Also- as most of us that have seen it before know, the film introduces Jamie Lloyd's son, (which is obviously Michael Myers' 'grand'-nephew, and therefore explains why Michael wanted him- because of his family/blood relation to him,), but it never offers any kind of follow-up to what ever happens to the baby.The following sequel, ""Halloween: H20"" didn't provide any kind of information on Jamie's baby, or Jamie herself, yet featured what would be Jamie's biological brother, ""John"", as Laurie Strode's son. ...Which was a mistake on their part. (The writers of H20) To top all of that off, just the simple idea of Michael being involved in a cult is rather... disappointing. I think it's more enjoyable not knowing what's behind Michael's actions. It's better being kept in suspense and in wonder, rather than having it be explained. If they absolutely HAD to explain it, they could have at least made the viewer do some thinking to figure it out on their own.With so many things wrong with this sequel, it's a wonder why I'm giving it even a 3/10. I suppose that 3 can be divided into three parts: A) It at least HAS Michael in it, unlike Part III. B) It's at least a good stalker/slasher flick if you're dying of boredom. C) Dr. Sam Loomis' story is explained and the occurrence is made know, as opposed to what they could have done, and left it unknown, and that would have caused viewers and film-researchers to complain wildly. So those three things exist, which makes this film just above Halloween III, but it's still the worst sequel made with Michael involved.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

And the whole thing with Thorn and Michael's curse, that was the absolute worst thing they could possibly do to the series! Why couldn't they leave Michael's story a mystery? He's supposed to be the Boogeyman, not part of some stupid cult!! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, which wiped out Halloween 3-6! They all sucked!

It would seem like a good idea having Tommy all grown-up after the event in the first film but instead it was a desperate attempt to write-up another sequel. Michael returns to finish off the remaining Strodes living in his very house where he killed his sister. Little do they know, Michaels hot on their trail with Loomis in the lead! Overall there was a good lot of gore, a fair few jumps and a better looking Myers mask but it still doesn't make up for the cheesy storyline.A good Halloween fan should watch this, otherwise avoid at all costs!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
166,jpasols,This is the Weird one!,7,11 May 2019,"Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers....oh boy!. We have quite a bit to go over here. Not all bad...not all good either...So Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers is set six years after the events of Halloween 5, and Jamie Lloyd is being rushed into some kind of under ground hospital where she delivers a baby...Michael's baby. Yes you read right...MICHAEL'S BABY!. So the whole concept of this film is Jamie has Michael's baby because Michael is inflicted with the ""thorn curse"" which is the reason why he cant die. Michael shall be cursed with the thorn power until he kills off his entire bloodline and anyone associated with them. Now, Jamie has his baby and Michael finally kills off Jamie in this film so he can be ""reborn"" while the thorn curse is passed to someone else. That's the main concept of this film, theres a lot to understand here, and that can take some of the enjoyment out of this movie because theres so much you have to pay attention to and pick up on if you want to follow along with the film's plot. All of these things is why this is called ""the worst Halloween sequel ever"". But it isnt THAT bad of a movie, while it's a weird movie and not an easy plot to follow, Halloween 6 still has some good scenes and kills that feel a lot like Halloween 1, 2, and 4. Michael Myers, however doesnt seem to be as scary in this film as he was in the previous and future films because there is TOO much being explained about him here, in this film they make Michael seem innocent with him being inflicted with a curse an all you cant help but feel kinda bad for him, Michael has to kill everyone in his family and associated with them in order to get rid of his curse. So that strips Michael of a lot of his fear factors! So that there was a bummer and its why I took some points off of this movie. Another reason why I took points off this movie was because of Paul Rudd's horrific acting as now grown up Tommy Doyle (Tommy from the 1978 movie). Paul Rudd was a BAD choice for adult Tommy Doyle! His acting was WAY too much and he over did it. There was a scene where Michael grabbed Tommy by the neck and lifted him into the air, and Paul Rudd actually stuck his tongue all the way out and made horrible and FAKE choking noises. His acting was SO bad it was laughable!. So I took points away for Paul Rudd's over the top acting!. Bad casting people! However not the entire cast in this film was bad, as usual Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis (mind you this was Donald's LAST appearance in the Halloween films due to his death before this film was even released), The actress of Kara Strode wasnt too bad either! I kinda liked her actually. The score to this film is okay but not as good as the soundtrack of the previous films, Halloween 6's soundtrack had a goth guitar vibe, the Halloween theme had guitar riffs so I mean the H6 soundtrack wasnt bad. But didn't entirely work to set up the atmosphere and tone for the film.That pretty much sums up my review for Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. If you havent seen this installment of the series and are thinking about checking it out, I'd say go for it but DONT watch the theatrical R rated version, look for the UNRATED PRODUCERS CUT of this film. The unrated cut provides a better explanation with better scenes so I recommend the Unrated Producers Cut of Halloween 6. You can find it on amazon video for around $2.99ish.My final rating for Halloween 6: 7 out of 10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
167,nmp381,Ive Seen Worse,5,15 July 2000,"This 6th entry in the film is probably the 4th best film in the series behind the original, part 2 and H20. Unfortunately that is not saying much. Michael Myers and the thorn cult killer plot was ok although it got tedious at the end. The movie was not fun or enjoyable to watch, it looked like it wanted to have a really dark, stoic atmosphere but the director just can't pull it off. Donald Pleasance seems to have lost the appeal he had in the other films and overall it is a forgettable horror movie.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
168,HOPSQUIAT,Strange Halloween Movie,5,7 September 2020,"Rest in Peace Donald Pleasence. He is a true legend. This movie is very weird. It has some creepy moments, but it just feels like they were running out of ideas very fast. I understand the effort to explain what makes Michael Myers...Michael Myers. But just why? What makes him scary is not knowing about him. I will say And Fools Shine On is a great track though.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
169,sammy-s-801-770969,Why so low ????,6,18 June 2020,"Simply misunderstood and underrated ... Halloween 6 is a great development from the last few parts.... Micheal Myers appears much frightening than he was in the last one... The evergreen John Carpenter theme and some frightening scenes adds upto the eerie flavour. Good performance as well from the cast especially Donald Pleasence in his last movie and Paul 'Antman' Rudd in his debut film. The addition of the cult to explain the backstory of Micheal may be very subjective to many and maybe thus lesding this one to such low rating. . The climax could have been better though . Nevertheless, Halloween 6 is a very enjoyable and thrilling ride and a good finish to the original story ...",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

171,very_doubtful,Halloween 6 is ... different (!SMALL SPOILERS!),4,21 March 2000,"I am not quite sure what to say/think about this movie. It is definitely not the worst in the series (there's still ""Halloween 3""). The style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor did. It tries to explain why Michael Myers freaks out on Halloween and starts butchering around. Well, all that stuff about Michael Myers being cursed and the evil cult was a rather nice effort, but I didn't buy it. None of the other installments in the series tried to come up with any fancy explanations.The movie contains lots of gore. Actually it's plain carnage. If you haven't seen the other Halloween films you will probably like this one for its blood content. But for a real Halloween freak this sequel might be just too different to be seen as a good one. Suspense was turned into terror and carnage (exploding heads..., you get the point).The ending (theatrical cut) is simply awful. Michael gets stabbed with a needle, then beaten up with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beaten up a little more until there's slime running out of his head (where did this green stuff come from anyway?). Basically it's nothing more than trash worth 5 million $.There was one good thing though: Michael's mask!Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite a disgrace. My rating: 4/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
172,borowiczlucky,Theatrical and producers cut I actually don't hate it,5,1 November 2021,My headline says it all. After not seeing this film since the theatre as a kid I had to rewatch in my Halloween binge. The idea is solid and if it was better executed could've been a great film. It caps off the 456 Jaime trilogy. Left with many questions about Jaime and how this baby business started. Paul Rudd is the standout. I saw someone else Pointed out they made him like Tommy Jarvis and completely agree. I loved his weirdness and ptsd which made more sense to me than the current iteration in Halloween Kills. Though I digress it's a cool idea. You add it or leave it. It reminds me of scream 3 where you could watch 1 disregard 2 and watch 3 because it ties up 1. Or you can take it or leave it. Just my opinion go watch for yourself and get your own opinions!! Happy Halloween.,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
173,Ride-3,"The Best Sequel Since The Original ""HALLOWEEN""",10,12 April 1999,"Halloween:The Curse Of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel out of all of the Halloween flicks.  Jamie, serial killer Michael Myers' niece, bears a baby who is then taken by the Man In Black from the conclusion of Halloween 5.  A kind nurse helps Jamie escapes but Myers quickly tracks her down and kills her.  Jamie's baby is found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the kids Jamie Lee babysat in the original film, and Myers arrives in Haddonfield and begins to kill off the Strode clan living in his old house. The film concludes with scenes revealing clues to Michael's evil, the identity of the Man In Black, and a close to the whole Dr. Loomis/Michael Myers storyline.  I highly recommend this brilliant horror masterpiece.Halloween:The Curse Of Michael Myers is Rated R for strong graphic violence, extreme gore, brief sexuality, language, and brief nudity.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

There is some pretty decent kills going on and a fairly high body count. If u can get past the cult story they threw in here then it's a good Halloween flick.,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
178,davidhutch007,Is Halloween The Curse Of Michale Myers A Real Thorn In The Series Side?,5,14 January 2007,"Well to be fair this film has everything to go for after the lackluster Halloween 5 disappointed most Halloween fans.The films sees Michael returning to Haddonfield to find Jamie Lloyd's young child that is now in Tommy Doyle's (Paul Rudd) possession. But Michael is coming home to a surprise as now the Strodes are living in his house and he isn't best pleased to find them there.The plot of this film is one which has continued to cause controversy since the very release of the film yet all the plot tries to do is give Michael reasoning, reasoning to who he is, what he is and why he is which in this reviewers opinion wasn't a bad idea but came a little too late in the franchise for any real Halloween fan to accept. While the narrative is driven with good characters such as the Tommy Doyle character and of course Dr. Loomis the films seems to suffer in other areas.Of course as most Halloween fans know the theatrical cut is not the only cut out there. A producers cut can be highly sought after and is often talked of as being better than the theatrical version and this may very well be a factor in the poor editing and at many times shoddy directing.The film suffers from poor editing as it tries top cover up and bridge scenes obviously taken out from the final theatrical cut of the film, this in effect takes you right out of the film and at times makes you think how in the hell could they release this to theaters? The direction suffers in places but doesn't exclude Joe Chappelle from leaving his mark on the franchise with his music video approach to the film.OK now your wondering why i have given this six out of ten and only gone on about bad points, well there are a few but it does have some great things going for it. The film's narrative is clever and Daniel Farrands should be praised for a different approach to the film from what could have been the simple hack and slash that we'd expect of Myers by now. This film however refuses to fall into that trap to some extent and deliver a clever story.The acting should also be commended for this entry in the series, Donald Pleasance is as good as ever but fails to gain the amount of screen time he deserves for being with the series as long as he did. Paul Rudd plays the total opposite of what we would expect today playing a character who knows he must stop Michael but also has the demons within. These two performances alone made the film gain the extra mark to give it a six out of ten for me, had these performances not been there then this probably would be a lackluster five out of ten.Of course it wouldn't be right for me not to talk about George P. Wilbur who of course plays Michael Myers for his second time and is still the only person to do so. Michael in this film feels a little different to what he has been in previous incarnation yet it is still the Michael we know and love. Wilbur does however give a good turn as Michael as he did with Halloween 4 and i believe is one of the stronger performers of Michael even if he did look as though he had a beer gut in the film.Overall the film was everything i expected from a 90's horror cliché film yet i wanted more than the total runtime would allow. The ending feels altogether rushed and rather OTT and you are left feeling there was no resolution and of course we do not find out what happened to certain characters which is a real downer. I feel a great warmth to the character of Dr. Loomis and yet i think the director felt that his character was none too important well to you sir i say you do not know this franchise! The films worth seeing just to see the idea being played out which continues to cause controversy amongst fans today. Although considered one of the weakest films in the franchise i'd say give it a shot, i was very unwilling but upon watching i saw something different to the masses and you might do too. All i'll say is it's better than H5 and certainly on par with H4! So is the film really a thron in the series side? in my opinion certainly not. ****** out of **********",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
179,RebelXStar,"If there's one thing I know, you can't control evil",4,11 April 2016,"Poor Jamie Lloyd. After being kidnapped at the end of Halloween 5 and held captive by the Thorn cult for six years, the movie begins with her giving birth to her uncle Michael Myers' baby after being subjected to the cult's ritualistic experiments. She manages to escape along with her newborn son, with Michael in pursuit, but her victory is short-lived when he successfully tracks her down and kills her.Luckily she manages to hide the baby, who is later found by the now adult Tommy Doyle (the boy Laurie Strode babysits in the original movie), played by Paul Rudd in one of his first movie roles. Tommy is deeply affected by his brush with Michael in his childhood and now spends his time obsessing over him and even rents a room across the street from the Myers house, now inhabited by his former babysitter's adoptive family, The Strodes. Among them, a young single mother, Kara Strode and her son, Danny who is seemingly succumbing to the same voices and visions that befell a young Michael Myers.Kara, Danny, Tommy and the Strode family are now the primary targets for Michael's wrath.Donald Pleasance reprises his role of Doctor Loomis for the fifth and final time, showing his love and dedication to the character.I must admit that when I first watched this movie as a teenager in the mid-nineties, I didn't have access to the internet and wasn't aware of the all the production problems the movie had. Looking back now as an adult it definitely shows. This was the first Halloween made in the nineties and it has a very noticeable shift in tone from previous entries. Michael is notably bigger, more savage and mean-spirited. Unlike popular opinion, I actually do like the Thorn Cult storyline and don't think it diminished Michael's menace as much as everyone says. I just think it was very sloppily executed. I can see why it was scrapped in subsequent entries of the franchise.There exists another version of the movie known as the 'Producer's Cut' and after watching both, the Producer's Cut is arguably the better version.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
180,marcfantozzi,The second best sequel in the series.,10,17 April 2001,"Wow, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" what a great film. Suspenseful, entertaining, creative and a clever plot which I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept, I love it. I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance, especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are great also. My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this film as Jamie? She wanted to return, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Danielle Harris. Still, I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful, Halloween 6 rules! I adore this very violent, but immensely enjoyable film.

181,Jodie-4,John Carpenter would NOT be pleased...,3,1 February 1999,"Normally I wouldn't go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel, because it's usually assumed that they're BAD, and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and enjoyable to taunt/laugh at. However, this chapter of the ongoing Halloween saga came close to gumbing up everything the original stood for. In the very first movie, Dr. Loomis said (very pointedly I might add), that Michael Myers was evil, and this tries to explain why (doing a bad job of it I might add). In my opinion, he was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry freak. The whole goth/cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
182,ryannemetz,"Good, but I was expecting more.",7,14 February 2005,"""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" was a movie that as a kid, I was anticipating for quite some time. Growing up, I was infatuated with the character of Micheal Myers. I remember seeing both sequels of parts IV and V in the theater with my Dad. After watching the fifth installment, I was puzzled by the ending. Immediately, I wanted to know who that man was with the black trench coat and black boots that had pointed silver tips on the front of them. I couldn't understand what connection this man had with Myers, especially that strange tattoo marking on his forearm. I felt cheated with the ending where this man bails Michael Myers out of jail. In this case, it was without currency. Instead, he bails him out with an arsenal of high powered assault rifles. Once I heard that a sequel was being made, I totally got excited. I thought, finally all of my questions were going to be answered. That was really not the case, though. For starters, Jamie Lloyd's character gets killed of in the beginning of the film. I was upset about this because I thought that after she made films IV and V, she was an asset to the series. However, it didn't bother me too much because Danielle Harris didn't reprise her role. I guess she wanted $5,000 and Dimension didn't want to give it to her. I think that was Dimensions loss because for a kid, this child could act. All of the basics settings are the same. Everyone in Haddonfield seems to think that M. Myers is forever gone because he was killed in the fire at the police station at the end of the fifth sequel. Nope, it's now six years later and Myers is back. This time Dr. Loomis comes back for one last battle with his estranged patient. Unfortunately, it was Donald Pleasance's last role in movie cinema. He died shortly after completion of this film. The character of Dr. Loomis could have been better used. I am not sure that I agreed with the approach that the director, Jim Chappelle, took on this film. Still, the movie left a lot of questions to be answered. I heard that Daniel Farrands wrote a total of 11 drafts for this script. Well, the one that he chose to go with didn't impress me, as I was expecting it to. The movie certainly isn't the worst sequel in the series. I did think that it is better than ""H20"" and ""Halloween: Resurrection."" Both of those sequels stunk. Stay away from the genre LL Cool J, Busta Ryhmes and Josh Hartnett. All of these jerks really screwed up some potentially good movies. Both of these sequels had good directors attached to the projects and I think that casting these characters might have ruined the films altogether. Both Rick Rosenthal and Steve Miner were good choices. Anyways, back to Halloween 6, once it ended I got to see who the ""mountain man"" was all about, I was disappointed after waiting all these years for a good follow-up sequel. It just didn't fall into place, as I thought it should have. Maybe it is hard to do a follow up to a sequel with such a strange ending, as did ""Halloween V"". I don't know what the problem was, but I felt that I was shorted on this film.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
183,cny_cd,so bad it makes part 5 look like a classic.......,1,22 January 2010,"This series should have stopped after the fourth movie. That movie was at least decent. The fifth movie was ridiculous, and quite frankly, boring. But this movie should be the ""poster child"" for sequels that should never be made. Absolute rubbish! The whole ""man in black"" storyline and the cult is absolute nonsense, and really makes no sense whatsoever to the storyline in parts 1,2 and 4. It's like they added it to simply add some excitement to a badly failing franchise. Oh, and by the way, it was an abysmal failure. In my thirty plus years of being a horror movie fan, this is quite possibly the worst ""horror"" film I've ever seen, and without a doubt the worst of this series.

184,troutman,Not that Bad,6,5 February 1999,"Halloween 6 is not that bad a film (though it is not exactly good either). So Michael looks like he's been at the burgers (and it was so surprising how the weight just fell of him in the last 15 minutes of the film, perhaps he had an operation while at the hospital) and that mad Doctor still shows up in Haddonfield Spouting on about ""pure evil"" every five minutes and the actress who plays Jamie looks about 90 when Jamie should be in her mid teens but the film itself is no worse than parts 4&5.The big fault with the movie was the Tommy Doyle character - he was so annoying he was begging to be slaughtered but alas not. The main problem with the series as a whole has been the Dr Loomis character - each sequel they tease us with the fact that Michael might have finished the old git but he keeps coming back - by this point he is more deranged than the killer he's after.The best part about the film is the character of Kara Strode. Her's is about the only character that is at all of interest. The plot while stupid is probably the best they could have come up with given the mess the awful part 5 left behind. The gore while a bit excessive adds some interest and the film itself is more exciting than parts 4&5. The plot may seem confusing if you've not seen part 5 but it does not matter that much as this and the other sequels after part 2 were ignored with the best film in the enitre series Halloween: H20",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Her baby is found by Tommy Doyle, the young boy Laurie Strode was babysitting in the first film, who's developed an obsession with Michael in the years since his encounter with him. He lives across the street from the Strode family who have bought and fixed up the Myers house after not being able to sell it for all these years and, now, people have been led to believe that Michael wants to kill anyone who is in his house as well as anyone who shares his blood.Halloween 6 doesn't make a lot of sense no matter which cut you see, but at least this ""producer's cut"" does attempt to build some suspense and tension instead of the loud, schizo shock cut version that was released theatrically.

187,Dellamorte_Dellamore07,An exercise in style over substance (and producers thinking they know something),5,10 April 2008,"Halloween 6: The Curse of Micheal Myers (1996)Director: Joe Chapelle (Phantoms)**out of****ReviewAfter the 6 year wait from the ambiguous, hated by most, loved by some ending of 5 I finally got to see it, being I was only 11 at the time I unfortunately did not take the pen to paper for my first impression (which was positive if I remember correctly), but alas, I'm now 22 and I can clearly see the movies flaws, as well as good intentions and the bad (producers?).The movie opens with 15 year old Jamie (now played by the 25 year old looking J.C. Brandy) screaming in labor while a MTV like montage of blood soaked carnage is shown and the soundtrack is filmed with screamed filled horrors of the past. We then have a pointless narration by Paul Rudd, who more or less solemnly describes the events of the franchise till now. It seems Jamie was kidnapped and kept hidden underground (or something, the movie is to breathless to ever tell us what this place is) and is now in the Man in Black's evil scheme of world domination or something crappy like that. She is rescued by a nurse (who is rewarded with a spike in the head) and runs screaming into the night in the hopes of finding help.I must state, that the first 20 or so minutes of the this movie are really well done, the suspense was high and a sense of nihilistic dread was rampant, the movie was fast paced and the Bus Depot and Barn sequences were awesome highlights for me. The Farm Machine death was grisly and down well (considering whom it happens to) and I felt that the movie was quite entertaining up until the point when it is day. Title inserted, ""Halloween"" ""Haddonfeild"". The movie then proceeds to slowly (but surely) downhill from here on as, we are introduced to a despicable batch of characters with the least appealing types of conflicts. Angry dad is mad at moody daughter, while weepy mom sits about, awful child actor tries and acts and the son/brother makes an ass of himself, by trying to be ""hip': I lost all investment in the characters (I will mention the likable and competent Marianne Hagen though) so suspense was cut short. The movie is another one of those 90ies flicks that constantly has mundane objects or people usually being the cause of the false jump scare, accompanied by a loud ""DUUUNT"" noise on the soundtrack, followed by the person out of frame usually saying ""sorry"" or ""it's only me"". Urban Legend did it, Candy Man: Farewell to the flesh did it as well as all the Screams. So if jump scares are your thing, you wont be displeased, as for me, I turned it into a drinking game, take a shot every time you here ""DUUNT"" and you will be nice and sauced after wards. The plot is such a god awful confusing mess that it leaves a lot to be desired after the final frame. I could go into specifics, but it won't matter, NOTHING will ever help to explain weird druid cult nonsense that inhabits this movie. I mean NOTHING. So try and ignore the mumbo jumbo and you can just see the movie for its slasher tendencies. The kills in here were far more violent then 4-5, so I guess it served some redeeming qualities. Snapped neck, a spike in head, farm machinery, axe fun, exploding head(!?!), and a brutal machete killing spree (Jason would be proud) abound, so I was pleased to see Micheal being so po'd in this one. Still, the lackluster plot still got in the way time to time.Although nothing to write home about, Chapelle injecting a very kinetic and vibrant look to this movie that will have MTV purists taken a back. Compared to any of the other Halloweens, this is the most visually appealing. Horror Candy for the fans. It's bleak and flashy and quite colorful, think ""Nightmare 4: Dream Master"" and you'll get the idea. It's too bad the director gave up on suspense the 20 mark in. It also seems pointless to mention Dr.Loomis this time around as he was brutally wasted. A shame, that Loomis was so arbitrary to the plot. Apparently his plight is far more better handled in the producers cut, but since I cant see me seeing that any time soon, it doesn't help me change my mind that the movie was a disservice to Pleasance. The guitars twang revamping of Carpenters score was actually quite good, and really upped the suspense in scenes that though they were far scarier then they appeared to be. I dug it. After waiting six years, I also though that the revealing of the man in black was sooooo lame, and quite boring, should have just stuck with him being Micheals brother as opposed to the stupid character this time. I really wanted to like this movie, I like its look, sound and gore, but content wise it's an embarrassment to the series and in film-making in general. Producers, screw off, you have no linear thought o fans of the genre, and you certainly ruined what could have been a awesome sequel. Micheal and the Druids? What's next, Freddy and Scientologists? This movie is only slightly acceptable because it eons ahead of H20 and Resurrection, which are insults to any fan of this weirdly made series.Watch to see style over substance at it's best, but unfortunately it doesn't follow up to 5 even!!!. That must be all the advice you need.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

189,Was-it-All-a-Dream,Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995),3,2 May 2009,"When thinking about the worst sequels in horror history (which I do quite often), few films elicit as many groans from me personally as this one. A Dimension films hack-job (from the same people who brought you the six Children of the Corn sequels), about the famous Michael Myers- now something of a hometown hero and a lame controversy resulting in the town banning the celebration of Halloween, stalking anyone who lives in his former house. And, just who lives in that house, you may wonder? Why, the Strode family of course. Cursed, the same way the family who lived in the Amityville house seem to be, with physically abusive relationships, children out of wedlock, and even possible discussions of incest. What can you say? It was the 90's; teen angst was in, and artists like Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor were superstars (rightfully so, they were both insanely talented). It was the era of extreme self-analysis, which unfortunately resulted in mostly underwhelming horror. Though Halloween's ""Curse"" does manage to be slightly better than the childish and offensive Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday. Though not by much.As a matter of fact, the major edge Curse has over other bad sequels is style. The film doesn't look as cheap as Leprechaun 4 and Jason Goes to Hell did. The director is something of a genius of the pace of the stalking scenes and knows how to use shadows and camera angles to achieve some creep outs. Most noticeably in the sequence where Tim and Beth return to the Myers house after their run-in with the wannabe-Howard Stern ""shock"" jock talk radio host Barry Simms (who looks and acts a lot more like Harry Anderson), and she tries to spook him. But, for every hint of a positive in Curse, there are 5 negatives. Back on the positive side (because you know it's going to take me some time to run down the negatives), the film's ending isn't as bad as it could be- featuring a quite impressive strobe effect (though not as colorful as the type seen in, for example, Nine Inch Nails' video for ""The Perfect Drug""). And best of all, Curse has the greatest looking autumn season set-up of the entire franchise. The film's daytime outdoor scenes are simply breath-taking. You really just want to live in this town. It's beautifully picturesque. Oh, and, there's one great death scene involving a washing machine, an electrocution, and an exploding victim. Probably the only one of John Carl Buechler's outrageous special effects that made it into the movie.Those are the positives. Now, for the negatives. Donald Pleasence was a great actor. But in the last years of his career, he seemed to form a sorry attachment to the character of Dr. Sam Loomis. At times, watching him on screen is a downright tragedy. Not because horror fans miss him, which we do. But because, of all the great work he did (including Disney's Escape to Witch Mountain, Dario Argento's spectacular Phenomena, and just an immense body of film and television work running a mile long), this part will be the one he's most remembered for. What makes that so tragic is that after John Carpenter's original masterpiece... there is no more character. Not only do we have to watch the poor man age and become weaker, but he nearly humiliates himself trying to inject the character with vitality and humanity to make up for the writers' terrible scripts. The rest of the cast is pretty much wasted as well. Bradford English (from the much better Wolf and Basic Instinct) plays a sadly unrealistic father. Comedic actor Mitch Ryan (hilarious in Jim Carrey's Liar Liar and the TV series Dharma and Greg) tries his best to play dark and menacing, to no avail. And the underrated (and incredibly sexy) Paul Rudd (of Clueless and Reno 911! fame), playing the grown up Tommy Doyle... with a mission. And here I was hoping he would have been given a life.The writing is so uninspired and stupid; veering off into cockamamie subplots involving Michael Myers' ties with astrology, ancient Druid history, and a cult of trench coat-wearing worshipers, which have absolutely no bearing to the films previous. Except for, possibly Halloween III, the film about a novelty costume manufacturer plotting to take over the world by killing children (the film which had nothing to do with the character of Michael Myers, ironically). The dialogue is gratingly shrieking, melodramatic, and painful to listen to. The characters are uninteresting and under-written. The music score is ghastly. Especially when it attempts to re-play its' own version of Carpenter's original pieces, in the scene where we first meet the new generation of the Strode family. Or worse still, in the opening scene featuring a new actress playing Michael's niece Jamie trying to escape him in the rain. A kind of electric guitar and tin-can drums hard-rock version of the most famous theme from Carpenter's score.What else can be said? The film's a mess. From top to bottom. What were these people thinking? Or, perhaps the better question is- has Halloween super-fan Daniel Farrands ever been involved in a quality project? His resume also boasts the horrifyingly juvenile, offensive, and brainless Friday the 13th franchise ""documentary,"" His Name Was Jason: 30 Years of Friday the 13th. Which the little cretin also directed. I was told he had his hands all over the far superior Halloween franchise tribute, Halloween: 25 Years of Terror. But after inspecting that rumor using IMDb, it merely says Farrands provided archival material for it. As well as was interviewed in one of the panel discussions. Good going, because that's about as much of that guy as I can handle. Thankfully, Stefan Hutchinson and Anthony Masi were the brain-children for Mikey's doc. Which I'd recommend you rent or buy before even considering this pile of smelly trash.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The plot is dull and uninteresting as are the characters. There is nothing really all to good to say about it except how bland and boring it is. Tommy Doyle returns from the original and Jamie is killed off within the first 20 minutes. This movie has no entertainment value to offer.

However, this movie is not as bad as some of the others. I enjoy this one more than Halloween: Resurrection and more than Halloween 5.The guitar riffs in the background whenever Michael Myers is stalking his victims enhances the eeriness of the impending doom that is about to come. And they got George Wilbur back in the mask, which was certainly a plus.I'm not ready to write this movie off as if it never happened. It's certainly not the best in the franchise, but it arguably is not the worst.

192,reiss-ferlance,"Surprising interesting, despite a few thin scenes, but this is the least entertaining installment in the Halloween series",5,5 January 2008,"I was surprised at the way Halloween 6:The Curse of Michael Myers turned out. I expected this movie to be a terrible addition to the Halloween cycle, and after while watching H5 one can begin to see the drawbacks. Halloween 1-4 were very interesting, and so was H2O and Resurrection, Halloween 6 is good too but there are flaws that the fans probably noticed in Halloween 5 that were passed onto this installment. Halloween 6 is an OK movie, and it is notably the darkest film in the series, it mixes typical horror with a sort of sci-fi theme squeezed into it. A few scenes in the movie even slightly, just slightly creeped me out, and the flashing images in H6 are creepy too. What I like about this movie is that it has some creative death scenes and as I mentioned before,it mixes horror with sci-fi, it also has some creepy scenes, and in my opinion it will probably be the scariest Halloween film the fans will see (not necessarily the best, but just the scariest. What I don't like about this film is some of the thin scenes that it has, and flaws such and some wooden acting. So overall, Halloween 6:The Curse of Michael Myers is the lowest film in the Halloween series, but it is an OK film and some scenes of this movie will generally freak, and creep viewers out. ***/*****",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
193,DJBlackSwan,Haddonfield is the problem that gave them Michael Myers,6,25 November 2005,"Hey, at least there are now some Blacks and Asians in 1995 Haddonfield. Progress..yay.Nature/nurture anxiety comes back to haunt Haddonfield, again. Will they never learn/Hall6ween reprises the Samhain/evil witch/pagan ritual/blood sacrifice theme from Number 3, and introduces another subtheme of Michael Myers ""hearing voices"". For the rest of us who exist outside the Halloween 1 Death Cult, it helps explain coincidences and gaps in the series, as well as Michael's fixation on killing blood/natural family members.Only trouble: it does so without irony and with zero humor, two elements of Halloween 1, which would be successfully re-appropriated in H20, much more so than Halloween 6.I'm convinced the reason people despise the Halloween series has little to do with the Halloween series, at all.People hate these films not because they're poorly acted, or don't have Michael or Jamie Lee, or weren't directed by Carpenter; no, those are all superficial ruses. People despise these films because they disrupt the concept of the ideal American natural, adequate/orphans-should-be-grateful foster, selfless adoptive or magical extended family, too many of which depend on secrets and lies to persist. Nobody fills out an application to be an ""orphan"". To be called a ""bastard"" is the most disgraceful thing on earth. Yet, adoption fantasies among naturals is, well, a part of their self development. And foster kids and borrowed children, well, they should just be grateful to still be alive.In such a climate, all it takes is one screwup, one black sheep, one person who deviates from the socially conservative norm and hey kids, let's put on a show!Or a murderous, sociopathic boogieman with a ""contaminated soul"", one.The Halloween series underscores these fears with a super thick Sharpie: discovering one is adopted after everyone else on earth finds out (Laurie Strode, H2); being destroyed in the simulated sancitity of the nuclear home (H3); 2nd hand foster-sister love (H4), the imagined bloody horror of natural childbirth (H6), you get the idea.What's Michael have to be so angry about, at age 6? That the Halloween series never lets on and we're left to wonder in denial, is what perpetuates the series. In our top-down, instant answer society, people are not comfortable with ""i don't know"". Not knowing is precisely what makes the Halloween series successful, despite all protests. Hall6ween just continues that cycle.Note to Haddonfield: As long as you continue to subsume repressive little secrets behind tree-lined sidewalks, picket fences, and pre-fab clapboard houses, the curse of Michael Myers will continue to sell movies and sell movies and sell movies. Until then, the suburbs will continue to breed abusive, alcoholic patricarchs like John Strode and murderous psychotics like Michael Myers, in their studied ignorance and whispered scandals.RIP Moustapha Akkad...a true genius of our Marketing Age.

I have to admit though, the mask was quite good, and definitely the best one the sequels have come up with.Why did they recast Jamie Lloyd?  She's supposed to be 15, and she looks 25!! And, if she's been held captive for the past 6 years, where the hell did she learn to drive a truck?!!!All in all, a distinctly uninspiring entry in the series, and as bad as any of the dreadful Friday the 13th movies - I was bored out of my skull!!!!!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

I have both this version and the Producer's Cut and I think the PC version is better because it explains more about Michael and the Thorn cult, which by the way is a real cult that happens every so often on Halloween night. So in closing I hope the makers of this film decide to make a DVD that has this version and the theatrical trailer, because we owe it to Donald Pleasance to show as much of him in the film as possible.

199,EricVierthaler92,Turns a scary horror icon into a unscary horror icon,4,8 July 2009,"This movie was very disappointing. The acting was very bad. I've seen better acting in a porn movie. It was very boring. And the hole Thorn thing makes the first Halloween less interesting. The Boogie man should never be revealed. The boogie man should always be kept a mystery. Revealing why Michael Myers would not die was a huge mistake because it makes Myers less scary. It makes him less scary knowing that he could only kill his family members. So if your not a family member of his you don't have to worry cause Michael won't come after you! This didn't even feel like a Halloween movie! *Sigh* no wounder why they decided to ignore the events of Halloween 4-6 in H2O. The people who said on the DVD cover that 'The scariest Halloween of them all!' are either complete idiots or they didn't even watch this movie. And I'm a fan of the series and I still thought this was a horrible movie. It's better then the god awful Halloween 3 by only 1 percent. Joe Chappelle should of never directed this movie. Instantly the wrong choice as directer. He chose to delete most of legendary Donald Pleasence's scene's because he felt his character Doctor Sam Loomis was ""To boring"". Joe you are a complete idiot. That's one thing that made the original movie work so well. Hearing his character tell us how evil Myers really is. That's what ruined this movie. Fred Walton would've been much better as directer. He was considered to direct this movie. He also directed the original 1979's 'When A Stranger Calls'. The replacement of Danielle Harris sucked. Looked nothing like her. The only positive thing about this movie is the song used at the end credits. Hearing the Halloween theme on the rock guitar does not sound as scary when it's played on the piano. The script was poorly written. The sound effects in this movie sounded very fake. The sound effect when someone got stabbed sounded fake. The ending was cheesy and didn't make any sense. Sadly this crap-tastic movie was legendary Donald Pleasence's last movie. He past away right after finishing this movie. The people who made this movie should be ashamed. They tried way to hard to make this movie scary. Well I guess they needed to try better. Even the producers cut was boring. This movie was very disappointing. Where is Debra Hill and John Carpenter when you need them the most?",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

202,PhillipMichaelH,The darkest of all the sequels. Very entertaining.,8,29 May 2011,"Warning: This review contains spoilers.This is another film in the Halloween franchise that is hated by most critics and fans. While I agree that all of the Halloween sequels suffer major flaws, they still are (I think) great attempts at making good quality sequels that are fun, entertaining and even scary. This film is another example.After Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Micheal Myers (1989) (which I also feel is underrated) bombed at the box office and was even released straight to video outside the United States, six years had passed and the future looked bleak for the series. In 1990, a year after Halloween 5, up and coming writer and long time horror fan Daniel Farrands began meeting with Moustapha Akkad and discussing new ideas for the next installment. He would eventually come up with the plot for this film and after many rumors had been floating around about Quentin Tarantino writing the next installment and John Carpenter returning as director, this was the film that came to be. Production began in late 1994 with Joe Chappelle as director and a new cast including Marianne Hegan and Paul Rudd, J.C. Brandy took on the role of Jamie after Danielle Harris was denied. Donald Pleasence returned to play Dr. Loomis for what was to be his final film performance, he passed away during post production. After the film received negative responses from the test screening audiences, the film was rushed back into production and a different ending was added, along with different edits and much more gore. Also, Jamie's death scene was changed (the version that I didn't care for).All of these changes really hurt the film badly but I still feel that this film is actually quite good, the atmosphere is all there and it includes some of the scariest scenes since Halloween 2 (1981). Of all the films in the series, this one truly captures the look and feel of Halloween. I actually like the Thorn idea, it brings new depth to the series, I loved the Man In Black idea in Halloween 5 and I was glad that it was brought back for this movie and that it was revealed who he really was.If I had to pick between the theatrical or producer's cut, I would pick the producer's cut but I still enjoy the theatrical version for what it is but it feels a bit out of place from Halloween's 4 and 5, while the producer's cut feels like a true sequel. All in all, this is a good movie, both versions work very well but I can only hope that the producer's cut will be released on DVD someday.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Myers. Although H:20 and Resurrection are somehow better I declare myself a fan of this movie. Furthermore, I think it is better than Halloween 1, although Doctor Sam Loomis is a bit too crazy in this one. After the old-camera-and-style-Halloween 5 this movie makes a fresh start. To bad it has been retconned like part 3, 4 and 5, which deserved that (except for number 4).

The film is dark and scarier than The Producers Cut (which I also love). I see alot more positive reviews of this film on imdb these days which is good to see that this film is more appreciated than it used to be.

205,I_am_worst_at_what_I_do_best,One of the worst,1,16 October 2009,"First off, Michaels mask doesn't look a single bit threatening. It might be emotionless but I have to admit it looks like a mouse and it's kind of cute. I can't help think that Michael is always smiling beneath the mask and making it give it a goofy grin. The movie is not scary with Michael walking around with a goofy smile like DDDUUUHHHH.The acting is very unbelievable. The movie lacks a climax (or a big enough one anyway) and the acting doesn't help. The whole point of Michael being a part of a colt is ridiculous in so many ways. It wipes out the whole original idea of the movies. The evil grew inside him, Michael couldn't stop it, making it genuinely scary. But in this, it forces you to think Michael was pushed to start killing through the colt. It lacks suspense and is at every angle predictable. It is marred with old horror clichés and you spend your whole time through the movie thinking ""I wish I made this myself with a better storyline.Lastly, Haddonfield is huge. I didn't like this idea as I thought I liked it as a small town where a murder is anything but predictable. But no, in this you can feel free to think that these murders and things happen every day in towns like that. What's the point.Stay away from this movie 1/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Because of the ending of Halloween 5, I thought this was going to be great but I was totally wrong! The story is really bad, the music is like it was made for an action film and the acting wasn't very good (Apart from Donald Pleasence.) But the stupidest thing about the film is Dr Wynn. It turns out he is a leader of a group of evil druids who study pure evil, they kidnap Jamie Lloyd and make her pregnant so the baby will be a final sacrifice for Michael Myers and he will be able to kill it. What makes it so stupid is that he worked with Dr Loomis for all those years and was worried when Michael escaped from Smith's Grove sanitarium in 1978 and it turns out he was the voice that told Michael to kill his sister and he was the 'stranger in black' that lurked the street and set Michael free in Halloween 5.Nearly every time Michael kills someone you see him in the background or know it is going to happen, So this film has no suspense also and not one bit scared me!

209,aro-2,Critically panned sequel deserves real recognition...,4,22 August 1999,"The Curse Of Michael Myers has been trashed since its release. Nobody has ever given it the credit it deserves. Sure, it doesn't live up to the original, but this is a sequel. What were you expecting? Out of all the sequels, though, this one would be the best. It attempts to explain the origin of Michael's evil(like ""Jason Goes To Hell""). Not a great success, but it does explain why nobody has been able to kill him. Bothering to explain why he's killing isn't really important. A killer is scarier when he doesn't have a motive, right? Anyway, he's been killing off his family(and anyone else who happens by). The only survivor is a newborn baby. He spends the rest of the film chasing the baby as the rest of the cast is slowly eliminated. That's the story.What makes this film the best of the sequels isn't the story. I mean, let's face it, there never was one. It's the style. Director Joe Chappelle(Phantoms) brings with him some of the style of Carpenter's original. However, there are significant differences: terror and violence.I can't say the original Halloween was all that terrifying. It had all the suspense of a Hitchcock film, but no terror. Chappelle takes the accent off suspense and puts a healthy dose of terror in its place. Why? Well, this was made for a 90's audience. Slasher films aren't suspenseful anymore, so all that's left is pure terror. Any director can create terror, but it takes one who understands a bit about fear to do it with style. Chappelle is such a director. Particular scenes to pay attention to are the barn and the disappearing axe. Then, of course, there's the finale. Just to tell you, there is one scene that qualifies as the most chilling moment in the entire Halloween series: the conclusion to the family argument at the breakfast table.Over the course of the Halloween films, the depiction of violence has changed. The first was completely bloodless. They got a bit more violent, in order to keep gorehounds from falling asleep, but it was still very tame for the genre. No matter how violent they got, they never included any gore. This one, on the other hand, is a full-blown horror film. All the gore you didn't see in the previous installments is on display right here. We have, in addition to the obligatory axe murders, more creative deaths, like: an electrocution, followed by an exploding head; impalement on farm equipment; a man being pushed through a steel grate. It should be noted that one murder is staged without gore, much like Carpenter would have done.As you can clearly see, this was meant to be the last of the films. All the terror and gore were meant to give the series a big slasher film sendoff. It worked perfectly. That is, until the overrated H20 hit theaters.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

211,Porkchop_Express,A confusing mess,6,10 July 2002,"Now before I comment this, supposedly a director's cut of this movie exists, with an additional 45 minutes not seen in the original release. Maybe if this was the version I saw, I would understand the movie more. Anyhoo, here's my review... This movie is a mess. For us fans of the series, it is moronic at times. The movie opens up with Michael Myer's niece who for some reason is living in some underground facility. Was she kidnapped? Plus, she has a child...who is the father? Huh? Ok...then all of a sudden Michael shows up. Did he sneak in there, or was he there all along? None of this is explained. His niece escapes with her child, & hides it at a bus depot, with Michael on her tail. She doesn't live long, but of course, Mr. Myers heads back to Haddonfield. Now fastforward to 'Halloween' part 1...remember Tommy Doyle, the boy who Jaime Lee Curtis was babysitting? He's all grown up & is the main character in this movie. Tommy somehow hears the niece's 911 call & miracously realizes she was calling from a bus station & retrieves her child. Then he also realizes that Michael Myers is insane because he is part of a cult. Huh? In the 1st films, he was just a child who went nuts, & killed his sister. Now almost 20 years go by & they try to throw this in the storyline. I don't think this is what John Carpenter had in mind. The main focus in this movie is the late, great Donald Pleasence who makes his last appearance as Dr. Sam Loomis. He returns to the film to try & stop Michael. Now when you watch this movie, try & figure out what the last scene is about. I still don't understand. I feel this movie is hurt the most with horrible editing. Hopefully a director's cut will appear, & give this film a better chance. If you are a fan of the series, see this one. Just don't expect the greatest sequel to the series.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Now you see why the producers changed their minds) They cut a lot of scenes out that they found disturbing. Several other stupid, unlikable characters are killed off before the big climax doesn't do much to convince us that H6 is the end. What Dimensions Films should have done was to completely redo the script - make it sensible, smarter, logical, etc. that way the fans can enjoy H6.

This implies that Michael Myers was always ""the victim"" and Wynn was the real villain from the beginning..I dont think so. I know alot of fans hate this film, well I mean, they hate the theatrical cut because that version makes no sense, ok I agree, and that the producer's cut is recommended. I've seen both versions and prefer the theatrical cut. I dont care if the plot/story is messy my only concern was the Michael Myers character. The theatrical version is scary, dark, brutal, creepy and Michael Myers is a badass and a monster compared to the producer's cut. Another reason why I prefer the theatrical version is because it shows that evil cant be controlled. Michael brutally kills ""his creator"" Dr. Wynn and his staffs.

218,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers,4,23 July 2012,"Halloween 5 came and went at the box office. Although a better movie than part four, it didn't perform as well at the box office. Audiences it seemed, were tired of the slasher genre of films. The last Friday the 13th (Part 8) and Nightmare on Elm Street (Part 5) had bad performances at the box office too. After 11 years it appeared that the slasher film was dying out.In 1993, Jason goes to Hell: The Final Friday was released and was poorly received by both critics and audiences. The lack of horror movies and the lack of box office gold for horror movies seemed to have put a dent in the plans of Moustapha Akaad in regards to the Halloween franchise. Halloween 5 ended with lots of mystery and intrigue and, even more so than the first four films, was begging for a sequel to continue the story.Thus production began many years later and on September 29th, 1995, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was released. It continues the story of Jamie and Michael Myers, and answers who 'the man in black' was. It brings back Tommy Doyle, the boy that Laurie Strode babysat in the first Halloween and it ups the gore to levels never yet seen in a Halloween film.But Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is also the worst film in the series. It is terribly directed, has even worse editing and for the most part the acting is terrible. The cinematography is terrible and Michael Myers doesn't even look right. It feels rushed and choppy and really has no ending.Other than Paul Rudd (in his big screen debut) and Donald Pleasance (in has last performance), the acting in Halloween is sub par. The girl who plays Jamie (formerly Danielle Harris) is a terrible actress and many of the supporting roles are so stiffly acted that it's a wonder that Rudd and Pleasance come off as good as they do. Michael Myers too, is terrible in this film. He seems shorter, and has a pot belly. He walks and acts differently and the thing that is most off is his mask. It just doesn't look the same as it always has; and with all those changes Michael Myers comes off as an un-scary, pale impostor of the real menace from the previous films.The look of the film is terrible too. For the most part it is to dark and things can't be seen well enough. It has shaky and badly choreographed photography and abysmal editing. For no reason at all, and in impossible and stupid ways, there is an abundance of gore that makes absolutely no sense. Gore works well when it's done right, but to have a head explode, in glorious detail, just because, doesn't work. In fact, virtually every death in this film is very un-Michael Myers like.Coming out of part five, the filmmakers attempted something very ambitious with this film, but ended up failing more often than not. The resolution of 'the man in black' story is rather weak and disappointing. It was a great idea to have Tommy Doyle back, older and wiser, who states over and over again that he knows how to kill Myers. In the end, he beats him up and runs away, again very weak. There is a scene where Loomis and a cop are looking at a murder scene. There is a large (re-occurring symbol burned into some haystacks. The cop asks what it is and Loomis says 'it's his mark', referring to Myers. This makes no sense in the context of both the previous films and this film. The whole first hour of this film seems to be building to something. Although badly shot, badly acted and badly edited it is somewhat watchable. Then as the resolution to the film begins it starts to fall apart. By the time the end rolls by the editing and story both become incomprehensible. There is actually no ending to this film. It just ends. The last 15 minutes of The Curse of Michael Myers is so badly edited and put together it almost feels like the filmmakers just gave up and never finished their film.Other than Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasance (who isn't even utilized enough), the only other merit to this film is the fact that, unlike part five, the Myers house is actually the Myers house. The last film used his house in the storyline but used a house that looked nothing like the house from the original films. This film at least brought back the original house, which turned out to be the scariest thing in the movie.Although slightly enjoyable for the first hour, with uncharacteristically great murders, and a little bit of nudity thrown in for good measure, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is a big mess that is a complete waste of time. With high ambitions it had the potential to be great, instead it is a muddled heap of confusion and incomprehensibility. There is really no reason to watch this film, unless you are ploughing through the Halloween series and if you are, when this film ends you will be left with a very strong feeling of sadness. Sadness for Donald Pleasance, who's great career ended on such a poor and utterly terrible note.Film Rating: 36%Breakdown (How Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers scored 36%):Production Design: 5 out of 10 Cinematography: 3 out of 10 Re-playability: 4 out of 10 Originality: 3 out of 10 Costumes: 3 out of 10 Directing: 3 out of 10 Editing: 3 out of 10 Acting: 5 out of 10 Music: 5 out of 10 Script: 2 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
219,steveneven,Halloween: The Curse of Seeing This Movie,4,4 July 2014,"Michael is going to get you! Well, it would not be such a bad thing. He would save me from watching this movie again.""The Curse of Michael Myers"" does not lie. Michael Myers is back a fourth time (remember, ""Halloween III"" had no Michael), and he is a curse to everyone in Haddonfield! This time, Tommy is older, the Strodes live in Michael's house, and we are back in, of course, Haddonfield. I can say this much: The kills are more brutal, the cinematography is surprisingly decent, and the film moves along at a fast pace. What is not so good? Everything else. Let us start with the characters. Kara Strode, the lead protagonist, is one of the weakest main characters I have ever run across. She does absolutely nothing to save her family, she cannot defend herself to her husband, and she should win the worst mother award. Her husband? Typical self-absorbed scum that knows ""the family secrets"", and the character that everyone hates. How about Tommy? Paul Rudd tried, but you can tell this was one of his first major television/film roles. With his emotionless expressions and his attempts at being a heroic character, the guy falls short. As for anyone else? I liked Debra, but maybe that is because she did not have much to work with. You do not really come to these movies for the performances. The story? I mean it is Michael Myers reeking havoc on Haddonfield. Must I go on? Alright. I will. Michael's niece, Jamie, has disappeared from Michael's original town, and she runs off with Michael's child. Flash forward six years and the Strodes adopt Laurie, Michael's niece, who still has the baby. But, Michael is not too happy that he does not have his child, so how is he going to get it? What Michael Myers does best. Kill! Now the whole Strode family is in danger because they have Michael's baby.Well... at least this film tried to do something different as opposed to Michael coming back another time and just trying to kill everything he sees in plain sight. Yet, I would have preferred that storyline, if I am being honest. The birth of Michael's child and his revenge just do not work. However, the most interesting part of this movie was when the old lady told Danny about the origin of Halloween. Had the movie gone in that direction, the direction this movie would be far more interesting (maybe that is just a ""Halloween III"" fan speaking here).Yet, we cannot forget the body count. Impalements, electrocutions, suffocation- ""The Curse"" has it all, especially a particular scene at the town's party in Haddonfield, without giving too much away. The film is also paced well. I mean the ending sags a little, but Michael is always lurking around the house or in the town. Or, someone is talking about Michael. The movie never veers off of him, which makes for an entertaining movie. The look of the film, like I previously sad, was nice. You have some nice blue hues and some of the Halloween scenes make you feel like it is October 31st. The plethora of pumpkins, the orange-y leaves, the candy-corn lights. Whenever a movie makes me feel like I am in Halloween, it is just that much more atmospheric.Overall, ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" was not an awful movie, despite my rather pessimistic review title and opening sentence. The story just is not strong enough to hold this movie for 80+ minutes, the characters were really nothing special, and the ending was nothing less than unsatisfying. I would say if you are a big fan of body counts, Michael, or a particular visual style, give ""Curse"" a chance. You will get plenty of those three. As for anyone else, for a good Halloween sequel, try ""Season of the Witch"". It might not have Michael in it, but the story is one of the more original and entertaining of the series. And, the set design is more impressive than the set design in this movie.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
220,FAIZ555,This is why rewrites and re shots ruined films!,2,18 February 2018,"The trouble production ruined the film for me. This is the same problem with Fant4stic and it is the Fant4stic of Halloween movies. And this is the worst out of the John Carpenter series (even more insulting than Resurrection). I guess we need more rewrites to make the movie better! Bad writing, poor acting, weak script, and bad story. The Michael Myers Character is almost ruined by the cult background story that could been easily removed. We don't want to know that as a die-hard fan. Thank god H20 is created!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
221,theverysmellyone,Ugh! Avoid!,1,5 September 1998,"This film is the worst sequel, I have ever seen.  Ever.  Really. It's just brainless carnage.  It also throws in some confusing junk about Michael Myers being cursed.  Wow!  Funny how it was never mentioned in the other films.

223,savagerocks,Curse is right!!,1,2 September 2007,Not withstanding the other persons comments on the producer's cut version of this movie(I have not seen that version) This movie is a mess and makes no sense. Halloween 5 gave us the set up for this movie that Michael Myers was under a Celtic curse(thorn) . Furthermore this hooded assistant to Michael Myers is a Doctor at the mental hospital where he was once a patient. The Doctor gets some crazy notion that this evil can be controlled. Michael of course murders all the doctors and nurses at the asylum. Most of the characters in this movie you could care less about so you don't have a real issue with Michael knocking them off.As I may have commented before Michael pursues his victims at a break neck pace. In the earlier films he moved more slowly and still caught up with his would be victims. Which I think is scarier than him just killing them with no rhythm just a fast pace. This marks the first entry under a different studio. Finally a sequel worse than Halloween III.,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
224,Doom,"Hmmmm, I'm confused...",2,19 October 1998,"OK, just what the HELL is all this supposed to mean???  Halloween 6 (let's just call it that, OK?) is, without a doubt, the most CONFUSING film in the series (and from what I've heard, seeing the original ""producers cut"" doesn't sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the ""official"" release).  What a mess.This isn't a really bad film, as some have said.  It has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments - it just DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!  Don't tell me that Michael was ""engineered"" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah.  It was bad enough when they turned Michael into Jamie Lee Curtis' brother (just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film) - this is too much.It would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be ""too smart"" by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all.  Bad move, guys.  We're not looking for an explanation of why Michael kills, so please don't try and feed us this crap.  Show me Michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people.  Show me Dr. Loomis trying to track him down and, as always, coming up just short.  Don't waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of Donald Pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that Michael was ""created"" by some cult from hell and that his ""seed"" will be passed on to another and...  oh, brother.Halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know there have been FAR worse sequels than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) so get what you can out of it (the scene toward the end of the film with Michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the screwball plot.  Hopefully one day we can all see the ""producer's cut"" and maybe get the chance to make (a bit) more sense out of all of this.  Till then, this will have to do...-FTM",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
225,spikejumper,My review,2,13 October 2021,This was a terrible movie but it had a little bit of good stuff at least the mask was cool The kills were cool but other than that this movie was terrible.,Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
226,smoothgroove16,Surprisingly enjoyable!!,8,6 November 2002,"A few years ago when I got into the Halloween series, just as H20 was coming out I watched all the Halloween films before its release. It was only after I watched H20 i even realised there was a Halloween 6, it was no where to be seen in shops and I only found out when it was on Channel 5! That alone tells you this film isn't highly rated!So I watched expecting very little, if anything hoping it would explain the end of Halloween 5. I have to say it was a thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes and passed all expectations. Not only did it bring back Jamie, but introduces her new born child, and brings back old characters such as the popular Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle (now a slightly ecentric loner). The start is very shocking, especillay the grizzly death of the nurse! In my opinion this film had Michael Myers at his meanest and best I've ever seen him since the original (Unlike Ressurection...that was very frustrating!!) He looked good, the mask was great, and he didn't toy with his victims, he was just his ruthless self (the hospital scene at the end!!)**(Spoilers follow)** The death of Jamie was very dissapointing, especillay after all the cheering her on, everyone did in Halloween 4/5, but this has to be expected with todays horror movies (we see this at its worst in Halloween Ressurection!). But when she got, boy did she get it! By far one of the most gross Halloween killings. Dr. Loomis does look too old in this but this can't be helped, and its great to see him back. The main reason people hate this is because the explanations of why Michael is the way he is, ok the whole star thing is a little exaggerated, but surely its better than H20's explanation...are we really meant to believe he just waited around for 20 years! I really liked Tommy Doyles character in this, and the way he stood up upto Myers. The Strode family were easy targets to raise the death toll of this movie, haha but you have to love John Strodes death, no matter how stupid it is! He's not shown as the nicest guy in this film so you know he's gonna get it bad! The final finale is fantastic, and Myers is truly scary, especillay the tunnel scene (does Michael actually run there!). Overall no this isn't the best in the series by far, but it's definitly up there with the most enjoyable! I give it 8/10.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
227,TheDustFactor,Better then most say (SPOILERS),7,5 July 2003,"Now I would like to say that this is a very interesting sequel, and it's pretty good only one thing that really bothers me.  I was very sad to see Jamie Lloyd come back casted as someone else, I mean how so what just give Danielle Harris the $5,000.00 to come back, and what a discrace the way that they killed her.  I think that it would have been more appropriate to have been killed the way Jamie Lee Curtis was, then by some farm equipment. Other then that I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie alot.  It was very scary, the story is a little bumpy, but highly enjoyable and interesting.  I really can't believe people say that this is the worse one, when in reality the truly pathetic Halloween was Halloween Resurrection I mean seriously any Halloween fan that thought that was better then this one should watch this movie one more time.  The true Halloween fans willl like it 7/10.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
228,savagebiteme,Pretty Bad Sequel,1,20 September 2013,"I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. The first film since Dimension (Disney) took over the franchise. The two movies that followed were considerably better H20 and Resurrection were better movies than this.This movie plays with the idea that Michael Myers can be controlled is ludicrous. It plays off the storyline from the last film that the curse came from something astrological, a constellation called thorn if memory serves. This movie lacks real scares. It replaces them with violent shocks. Sadly this would be Donald Pleasance's last appearance as Dr.Loomis.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
229,powersd-48281,Abysmal,1,30 October 2020,"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is about as much fun as being gutted. The concept behind the movie, its clearly rushed and half-assed production, and cast of mostly unlikable characters are a concoction for disaster. Somehow, it looks worse than the previous two movies, and its kills are fairly average with a few exceptions. A lot of people like Paul Rudd's acting in this one, but I think he's just alright. The movie's depiction of Michael Myers as Uncle Dad, and with his poor mask and bulking physique are all unbecoming of the Boogeyman that the original did so well. The film has very few redeeming qualities, and I find it most sad that it was the final film of Donald Pleasance who died before this film hit theatres. It's kind of hard to believe that a film series that arguably should never have spawned from the 1978 original sank this low. I'm glad they decided to scrap this ridiculous idea and make a move back toward the basics with H20 a few years later. Halloween: Curse is a blight.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
230,lumpydumper,The worst Halloween movie,1,12 January 2021,"This is the worst Halloween movie!
The characters are not interesting they are very boring
Tommy was completely cringe through the entire movie
The movie was poorly written, directed, and produced. I will never watch this movie again",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
231,chrisbarker187,Not as bad as people think. It's good for what it is.,7,24 October 2014,"Now granted Halloween 6 was confusing as hell. It took me a while to understand what was going on. I personally find it better and more enjoyable than Halloween 5. The story was inventive, and ambitious but the problem is that it wasn't executed very well. However, I still enjoy this film. In fact, I counted it as one of the best ones, of course now I know it is one of the weaker ones, but it is still entertaining and it could have been much worse. The main problem I have and pretty much everyone who hates this, is that Michael is now part of some cult that every once in a while, someone is chosen to sacrifice their family to spare the lives of thousands of people. Now as cool as that may have sounded, it didn't end very well. First of all, it took away the mystery and creepiness of Michael. That was a huge let down. Second of all, in the Producer's Cut, you find out Michael impregnated Jamie. Now that was just horrible. Now making Michael incest? Really?? Terrible move. Now, having discussed all the negatives, I will now move to the positives. Firstly, Michael is awesome. I know he is always awesome but in this, his brutality is immense. Secondly, the characters are very interesting and likable. The kills are brutal and inventive, and the setting was also very well done. The score for the Theatrical Version was okay. I liked it but it could have been better. However, the score in the Producer's Cut is much better. It is spooky, creepy and very chilling. In conclusion, I understand why people hate this film, but I enjoy it. It is entertaining and I actually find it underrated. I like it.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
232,KristofferAG,An OK fantasy horror.,4,23 October 2014,"Reading what others think of this movie really makes me wonder if I'd be enjoying the later movies in the Halloween series a lot more if I wasn't obsessing so hard about the original cult classic, and to some extent, it's sequel. It's entirely possible that I'm simply setting my standard way too high, and getting annoyed when these movies don't fulfill the criteria I've set for a movie in the Halloween franchise.Anyway, on to this one, the sixth installment, which explains a bit more about the mysterious man clad in black that we saw glimpses of in the previous movie. Not a whole lot is explained other than that they're experimenting with pure evil, and Jamie's baby, who is born on Halloween, plays an important part, in the movie, and for this cult.I'm no longer going to demand goreless killings. The precise Myers is long gone, and the current Myers is all about using whatever he can get his hands on, as well as the surroundings, to take care of business. He still has his patented kitchen knife every know and then, but flashy is the new silent, and Myers at least does that well.This movie however, goes over the top. The cult really adds nothing to the story. It could've been good, but it suffers from a complete lack of backstory, and while it's important for the story to progress, the fact that it is so unbelievable and that very little is actually explained about the cult and its members makes it come off as a bad joke.The movie kicks off with Jamie and her newborn child being saved from the cult by a lady that took pity in her. Jamie makes it to a public bus station with her baby, where she manages to get on air with a radio station covering the Myers murders, calling for help from Loomis. Myers does eventually catch up to her, ending her in a spectacular fashion, but she manages to hide the baby before it happens.The cult wants this child, and Tommy Doyle, the kid Laurie babysat in the original Halloween, takes it on himself to protect the baby, as well as Danny and Kara Strode. Danny has somehow gotten some sort of connection with Myers from sleeping in his room, so he's also of interest to the cult. So now, not only are they running from Michael, but also these cultists clad in black.What this movie makes up for in spectacular deaths and somewhat better acting, it loses in writing. It's too confusing, it doesn't make sense with the lack of explanations, but it's still a decently scary flick. Myers is still a scary bastard!",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
233,WTH_MovieFan,"It Was A Really Good Film, It Could Have Been Better",8,11 July 2003,"This was a really interesting Halloween film.  I wasnt to thrilled with the whole Thorn theory but it still makes for a good film.  I liked getting to see Tommy Doyle back but sadly Donald Pleasance died right after shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who didnt give a flip about the series, from what I heard treated Donald bad, and wouldnt let Danielle Harris come back as Jamie.  Its like he was just trying to bring down the film, but I still liked it.  There were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a whole new movie.

234,chrisfulpfacebook,The best Halloween film - by far.,10,19 February 2016,"The Curse of Michael Myers has and will always be my favorite film of the Halloween franchise. I am a Halloween freak and I've seen each film hundreds of times. In ""The Curse"", Michael is the scariest he's ever been. He's huge, menacing, malicious and extremely violent. Something about the way this movie is filmed, it has the feeling that embodies the spirit of Halloween. Just watching it makes me feel like I'm knee deep in a pile of leaves in the middle of autumn. Paul Rudd is fantastic as returning character (from the original) Tommy Doyle. His acting really pulls off the mental anguish that Michael has caused him since childhood when he had his first encounter with THE SHAPE. Towards the end, when he practically comes face to face with Michael, you can feel the tension and I love it. If you can find the extra/deleted scenes (YouTube, special edition DVDs) it can add a few twists to the film. I love the explanation of Michael's back-story - the ""method"" to his madness. Sadly, this film saw the end of Donald Pleasance - as Dr.Sam Loomis in the movie, and in real life. His death came not long before the Curse was released. He was one hell of an actor. This movie, for me, portrays Michael the way he should've always been portrayed. Terrifying. It was the first Halloween film I saw in theaters. Watch it and love it. The last 20 minutes of the movie are E P I C.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count.  Michael, who originally preferred strangulations and kitchen knives, learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims, and the result is an awful, patchwork, dollar store film virtually unhelped by a few genuinely creepy sequences.  Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story simply so *somebody* could be billed as the star.

238,gibsoncraig,Halloween 6 or Dr. Loomis'last hurrah,4,31 July 2002,"""Curse of Michael Myers"" is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing letdown in Halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in plot lines, with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. ""Curse of Michael Myers"" ups the ante in blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the series' integrity. It's too bad to, as this is the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the  character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments (precious ones if your a fan of the series) as the now very aged and as he says ""very retired doctor"". Sadly he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized. Right from the beginning credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made-for-TV movie then that of the block-buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978.

Donald Pleasance gives a much better performance than the one he gave in Halloween 5. But it wasn't as good as the performance he gave in Halloween 1, 2, or 4. And I think Brian Andrews would've been great if he had reprised his role as Tommy Doyle. But Paul Rudd was good too. And I think J.C. Brandy was a better Jamie Lloyd than Danielle Harris. The deaths were good too. Except Barry Simm's death. It was too similar to Annie's death in the original. Debra's death scene was the best. She was hit in the face with an axe.

241,william81-1,Halloween with a super-government conspiracey,6,11 January 2006,There was an uncomfortable trend in the slasher movie franchises where you had to give a supernatural twist to your maniac and a deeper meaning to what turned them into homicdal maniacs. Halloween 6 gives equal time to both it's slasher franchise and the bizare add-on story of the secret of Michael Myers. Halloween 6 doesn't suffer to much from it's very small budget and the production values are very good and plenty of inventivness in the kills keep the hardcore fans in their place. Like most of the Halloween films there are very few big names in the film apart from Paul Rudd as the messed up Tommy Doyle (Jamie Lee's Baby Sitting Assignment from Halloween) and a very frail Donald Plesence in his cult hero role as Dr Loomis.

242,Moonlit_Sorcery,The second WORST in the series,2,2 October 2006,"This was just garbage, with the exception of a few good scares. The only one in the series that could possibly give me a bigger headache is 8 (Ressurection). There are several problems. Paul Rudd's acting. The Thorn storyline. Jamie Lloyd being killed off. Crappy, cheesy ""metal"" music that occasionally starts up during chases. The little boy having nightmares with Michael telling him to do ""bad things"". Over the top, disgusting gore. And just sheer boredom. It's a travesty that this got the same rating as Halloween 5, which is vastly superior. Go watch 4, go watch 5, go watch 1, but for the love of God don't bother with 6 or 8 unless you're a die hard fan, and only then if you have a bottle of Excedrin on hand.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The actors are not bad, they are good But the script they were set up with was a curse all on its own! Bad! BAD BAD BAD! The only plus was mike had a son, which gave me a idea for a possibly good sequel... I don't know how else to word this and make it long enough to meet the approval. OK ill try. Naming off all the bad stuff. 1. They made this movie into a Slasher/Satan movie. The whole cult like thing is way out there, two elements of horror that should never be mixed. 2.

The death scenes were the most violent and therefore the best of all the Halloween films in that aspect. Tommy Doyle was a cool character, a demented man haunted by Michael Myers.

The plot is basically simple: Micheal Myers was cursed with a spell called ""Thorn,"" which is a curse that makes whoever has it kill people. Tommy from the oiginal movie is back and his main point is to find and kill Myers. However, the most memorable performance was from Donald Pleasance, who turned in a great act but then sadly died a few months after the making of the film. The movie was full or grueling deaths and the body count was high. So to a true Halloween fan, this movie was pobably good, but it was probably bad for a Halloween series hater.

But in my opinion it is better than Halloween 5, although even this does not give many surprising moments. A few scenes are really well directed. But these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in movies, but H6 features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the Halloween-Movies. The most sucking aspect about H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison to the first masterpiece.Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But don't expect a great horror-experience....",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

254,Spencer-Pellegrino,Very underrated,8,11 August 2010,"I was very surprised when I saw that this movie only ranked 4.4 out of 10 on IMDb. Before I even saw it, people told me that it was a bad movie and that it was the worst one they made in the series. I'm glad I still watched it anyway because to be honest I enjoyed this movie.There are two versions of this movie, A) The theater version and B) The producer's cut. The two versions certainly have their differences. The producer's cut gives a lot more detail to the curse of thorn. A curse in which drives Michael Myers madness. A lot of people that I talked to thought that the whole idea of there being a curse and cult behind Michael Myers madness was stupid. However, I have to disagree because it was never explained in the previous films as to why Michael Myers wants to kill his family. The makers of this movie finally addressed this and did very well. The curse was given to Michael Myers at a young age by Mrs. Blankenship a women that lives across the street from the Myers house. ""Thorn is the third rune in a group of 33. Thorn is also known as Thurisaz. This ruin appears every 1,000 years. It is a constellation in the stars which appears on October 31st, Halloween. It is also on Michael's wrist.To the ancient Druids, Thorn represented a demon. This demon spread sickness which killed thousands of people and killed crops. The Druids also believed that one child from each tribe was chosen to be inflicted with the curse of Thorn. This child had to kill their whole family to spare thousands more."" -http://www.angelfire.com/ma/babybrownsplace/thorn.htmlThe curse of thorn is the answer as to why Michael Myers wanted to kill every person in his family. The curse also gives Michael Myers incredible strength and he it makes him immortal. That's why Michael always came back to life even after being burned alive, and shot.This movie also has creative kills with good suspense. I liked how the kills all had different methods (axe, knife, farm machinery, etc.) I disliked how Danielle Harris did not play Jamie Lloyd in this movie. I didn't mind J.C. Brandy doing it, but she looked nothing like Jamie Lloyd and I found it odd how Danielle Harris didn't play her considering that she did in the last two movies.There were two different endings to this movie. In the theater version it is unknown as to what happens. Dr. Loomis walks back into the clinic and you hear him screaming realizing that Michael Myers mask was left on the floor. I assume what happened was that Dr. Loomis saw Michael Myers face and was very freaked out. In the producer's cut Dr. Loomis in the end becomes apart of the curse of thorn and is destined to protect Michael.This movie is very underrated, I don't know why people hate it so much. If you haven't seen it, I would recommend it. I do think this is an out of the ordinary slasher film considering that I've never seen a killer in a slasher film be motivated to kill by an ancient curse. I would give this an 8 out of 10. It had good suspense, with a creative and unique idea.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
255,YakuzaElite1980,And so the series finally hits rock bottom.,1,15 December 2007,"There was a time when Michael Myers killed because he was just simply the bogeyman. It was the reason why we all watched the first Halloween over and over. Six sequels later and someone came up with the bright idea that there should be a reason as to why he kills. Now, this not only ruins what Michael has become, but by taking him out of the realm of what he is and giving him a purpose destroys any mystery about him.To make things worse, the film company decided to allow a fan to write the script for this movie(which ended up being re written itself.What we get is a whole mess of ideas, cheesy dialogue and movie so clichéd, its flabbergasting that it was ever sanctioned. The acting is horrible and dull, the suspense can be seen a mile away, and plot twists ruin what is already a bad movie to begin with. Everything about this movie feels rushed, from the script to the acting. This movie lacks everything set by the previous movies that you just want to keep hitting the fast forward button until ends. With and ending that is so confusing it might actually make you watch the movie again just to decipher it. Do yourself a favour, watch 1,2 and 4. But stay away from this crap. If you have access to the Producer's cut than at least its a far superior version than this.

256,xxxlongislandfilmsxxx,Fantastic Sequel!!!,10,31 January 2014,"The Halloween series like many others had some ruff and questionable sequels. This is not one of them. In fact Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers attempts to fix 4 and 5's plot holes and stupidity, and triumphs valiantly. It even brings incorporates a peace of Halloween 3 into the story. Hand's down one of the much better sequels to the film.The opening scene features an adult version of Jamie (from 4 and 5) being hunted down my Michael Myers as she attempts to protect her newborn baby. Eventually she is able to break into a public transportation area where she makes a phone call to a radio station for help. To her dismay they do not believe her. Luckily for the baby, an all grown up version of Tommy Doyle does. Tommy (who is excellently well acted by Paul Rudd) saves the baby after Jamie's death. Then there is Dr. Sam Loomis still on the hunt for Michael, attempting to warn everyone, and everyone still looking at him like he's crazy. (got to love how in every movie people will never believe Loomis)The film has a very suspenseful Gory ending, that includes, but not limited to: Doctor's being slashed to death, security guards being pushed through steal bared doors, then being stepped on, a bloody death by pipe to the brain box, and the implying death to everyone's favorite Halloween Character. This movie is a master peace in terms of sequels. If this film was the only Halloween to ever come out, I think people would show it the respect it truly deserves.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
257,raouldys7,The best in the series so far.,10,14 July 2005,"I must confess, i am rather upset that so many gave this movie such a poor star rating. In terms of violence it is the goriest Halloween of them all, and on the basis of sheer thrills, it should already get at least 6/10. Having said this, i didn't enjoy Jamie Llyod getting knacked like that. But then again, that sets the tone for this film - it is a very dark and unsettling one. Halloween 6 did do one great thing-confuse the heck out of everyone. It certainly is far better than the rubbish Halloween 5. I was little puzzled at how Jamie had her baby- what i mean is, who was the father? And did the infamous ""Man in Black"" set up her death. Oh, and where was she for the last six years. I mean, surely if she disappeared along with Michael at the end of the last film, he would have killed her then, wouldn't he.Anyway, there are far greater aspects in the film to cover up for this little plot hole, such as the amount of scares and clever deaths. Michael's mask is by far the best in the series so far, and the cinematography, in terms of lighting, helps provide that dark atmosphere of this film. the performances are very good- they convey a lot of emotion and fear. The film ends nicely with a respectful dedication to Donald Pleasance, and leaves room open for another sequel. I am thoroughly upset however, that H2O simply went on by ignoring all the events that took place in episodes 4-6. I mean, Michael still has another living relative. His niece, Jamie Lloyd's baby. I mean really, that seems like a pretty decent aspect to center another sequel around. Instead, they go on and mess up the series completely. However, Halloween Resurrection wasn't a bad film, despite Busta Rhymes terrible performance.I just hope they finish off things with the 9th installment, and that they tie up loose ends, such as what happens with the baby. Afterall, Michaels entire inspiration for killing is to murder all the members of his family, and those that stand in his way. If anyone has anything to say about my comment, please write back. Id like to know what you think",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
258,newchristmasdreams,Any Version Of This Film Is Bad,4,26 September 2017,"In this sequel it has been years since Jamie and Michael disappeared. At the same time ""Michael Myers Survivor"" Tommy Doyle(From Halloween 1) has moved into the boarding house across the street from Michael's original home.

In this we learn who he is. What is shocking was that years later the writer/director of ""Halloween 5"" (Dominique Othenin-Girard) said that was something they added when they were shooting the film. Now much of the production and production problems have been told over the years. One problem was the production budget was cut while they were shooting forcing script changes. When the film was subject to the test audience the response wasn't good and the film was sent back into production. When we finally got to see the ""Producers Cut"" it is slightly better but not much. The Original Theatrical ending was one big What the Heck moment! I was saw it at the theaters and was mad and I thought that would be the last ""Halloween"" movie. It grossed less than $16,000,000. 3 years later however the producers were wise and ignored ""Halloween 4-6"" when Jamie Lee Curtis returned to play Laurie Strode. It was a wise move. ""Halloween 4"" was great. ""Halloween 5"" and ""Halloween VI"" were not only creative failures but box office failures as well!

It deals with Thorn, the curse Michael has been saddled with since he was a little boy, causing an unbearable rage inside of him, that won't go away until he has killed all his still remaining relatives. Yes, Halloween 6 is a very gory movie with lots of bloody and highly inventive killings, but isn't that what good slasher movies are all about?

262,Un2break0able,Great Sequel!,9,17 July 2005,"This film, in my opinion, is one of the best sequels in the Halloween series. Its also very different from all of the other Michael Myers films, which I found to be a good thing. First off, I think that the quick-cuts in the opening sequence at the very beginning are really cool. Also, the soundtrack is great although I wish some of the themes in the theatrical release could've been used a little more often. The film also contains some pretty intense suspense in a few of the scenes and some great deaths. However, the plot is pretty weak, and the ending has little to do with the rest of the story. Therefore, the story makes very little sense in the end, but the ending is still pretty good. Its totally action-packed, and full of thrills. Here's what I make of the ending in terms of the plot standpoint: It seems to me that Michael Myers simply used the cult members to get to Jamie and the rest of his family. Also, I think that the cult was experimenting and attempting to control ""pure evil"" all these years. And all those test tubes, DNA profiles, and charts laying around are all a possible reason for Michael's ""curse."" I know this seems dumb, but this is really the only explanation I can obtain. The details are very sketchy.Although the plot is weak, we do get some answers. We find out who the ""mysterious man-in-black"" is; it turns out to be one of the main characters. We do find out a little bit of what happened on the night Jamie was abducted in Halloween 5.However, the plot raises many new questions that are never answered. Even though there are a few negative aspects in this movie, I still recommend it. I also recommend Halloween I, II, IV, and H2O.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

What I mean is that this film seemed like it was made in a hurry. I seemed like the producers were trying to make this film as quickly as they could so that it would hit theaters by the release date. This film is still OK. It has Michael and all of the trimmings. Takes place in the wonderful town of Haddonfield, and Michael is after Jamie's son! SPOILER: Jamie dies at the very beginning. She is thrown onto some farming equipment and is chopped up into little bite sized pieces. Gross! Acting and directing is good, but not great.

266,mattstorm-12206,2 different story lines trying to live together,2,11 October 2021,"By this point lets face it, the ""Halloween"" series had run it's course and then some. The whole point of Michael's appeal is he's the unknown, he was never ""Jason"" or ""Freddy"" just there for the gore and kill count, the more you do with him the less effective he is.So now here we are at the 6th film and the 5th had taken a turn that left quite a mystery for even the best writers to answer. That's not to let this film off the hook, it's horrible and I don't know what on earth anyone was thinking here.The most glaring problem is evidenced by the fact that there's 2 different versions, a Crazy Thorn Cult film and a Michael film both unable to ever truly tell their story because they're always having to try and somehow tie into the others story line.Had the ""Producers"" just been a standalone film not named ""Halloween"" about a cult who create a brutal juggernaut to kill for Thorn it might've worked.Had the Theatrical solely focused on the Michael story it wouldn't have been on par with the earlier sequels but it would at least have been a step above your usual mindless slasher as for all it's faults 6 did maintain the eerie feel and look of small town America at Halloween.It's a shame, I would really like to have seen the 2 ""camps"" have been given the chance to fully make the film they wanted, coulda got 2 decent films instead of 2 horrendous cuts of the same film, at least Danielle Harris was spared this embarrassment, too bad she later did the Zombie films :-/",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

Secondly, it was a great idea to have little Tommmy all grown up and in this movie, but his part was too strange. And the actor was terrible. He was way too ""drama queen"" with every line he said. It would have been better if Jamie had been allowed to stay around a little longer. The Strode father was very good, or rather bad! Overall the movie was pretty good.

But recently I gave it another chance and sat down with a bowl of popcorn and began watching it again and yep, its still terrible. Being a fan of the complete series, I had always felt that it was the weakest entry in the series from the bad jumbled plot to the disgusting rock-ish score. But finally after hearing of the long-discussed Producer's Cut...I want online and found a copy of it. And after watching it I found the differences between the two versions to be huge. I've read good reviews and heard positive things from fans about the Producer's Cut but never fully believed that it would help. Well it did. I thought the story was so out of left field and crammed that I thought nothing could save my view on the film..But it did. The Producer's Cut runs much more smoother, without the much hated score and with less gore. It works so much better, and is actually a worth entry in the Halloween Series. The finale of the film works so much better on different levels and still kept me on the edge of my seat unlike the boring take down of Michael in the theatrical version. I will admit this entry wasn't the easiest to plan out - story-wise. Halloween 5 kinda set things up without any plans or preparation in the direction of the series. Even if you watch the featurette on the Halloween 5...no one knew what was the deal with Thorn or the Man In Black.

272,acdcrocks11,Not the right Halloween film to be hating,9,25 April 2009,"I only have one question about this entry. Why do so many fans hate it? It leaves me to wonder what all the anti-Halloween sixers would have done if they were stuck with the task of explaining a raging psychopath's motives.Let me start off with the story. Surely not a bad one at that considering it had to pick up with the problematic status left on the table by Halloween 5. It starts six years after 5. Jamie and Michael are presumed dead after an explosion. In all reality, Jamie has been kidnapped by a cult lead by the mysterious man in black, and she is pregnant (we are never officially told who the guilty party is). She gives birth on Halloween eve. The man in black takes the baby but Jamie manages to get him back and escape the cult's dark, underground domain. The cult seemingly frees the shape and sends him after Jamie. After she escapes him at a bus station, Myers catches her and unfortunately completes her story. However, the baby is nowhere to be found. Michael stays in Haddonfield and wreaks havoc on a family living in his home, more Strodes, while searching for the infant. The man in black's identity is finally revealed and Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle prepare for the last act back in a familiar setting.Now, some of the acting here is really thin, but we must remember that this film is primarily story and atmosphere driven. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is amazingly strong here. The lighting and look of the night is purely excellent and the look of the day scenes are surprisingly great as well (gray and loomy, rather than bright and sunny as in H5). The Myers house also gets a nice makeover and we no longer have the ever-terrible mansion. The mask in this film is the best since H1, and the shape is acted very well.All in all, I actually like this film, and it is in my top 3 of the series. The only thing that weakens this film is some of the mystery surrounding the Cult, and Dr. Loomis' lack of lines and speeches....damn you Joe Chappelle.9.5/10",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

This is on par with Jason Voorhees really being some hell spawn demon that can body hop, just leave it alone.I seriously enjoyed how Myers was just a crazy guy and he just wanted to kill his sister. In this one hes even got a local cult following, he can teleport apparently to kill people for no reason(Goes from his house to a county fair in about 3 minutes to slit a dudes throat in a van then hang him up in a tree with Christmas lights or something then he goes back home, it had NO BEARING ON THE STORY.) He likes doing elaborate deaths all of a sudden as opposed to the quick knife to the neck. You got someone impaled on some industrial power box to make his head explode, impaled on really Gothic looking farming equipment and some other over done kills(which all have the sound of someone crushing a bag of potato chips every time a knife is thrust into the body).I'm glad H20 totally neglects 4,5 and this movie and goes back to Myers just being crazy and leaving it at that. The Thorn idea really was just stupid, crazy psycho killer is really the worlds savior but he killed a lot of people he didn't even have to...that doesn't make sense.Don't waste your time, this movie was just horribly stupid.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
275,seasonalsofbarmouth,Producers cut or theatrical?,7,19 February 2020,"Having watched both versions I must say that the theatrical cut is the better version for gore and jump scares, whilst the producers cut was better for the storyline.
The producers cut removes the infamous surgery room massacre and a lot of the gory scenes and Donald pleasence gets more screen time.
The victims are killed differently depending which version you watch, producers cut isn't as scary and makes the film a little boring to watch, if you hoping for jump scares and gore stick to the theatrical version, its 13 minutes shorter and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
276,Dr_Cosmo_McKinley,An absolute mess...Producers Cut is way to go,4,2 April 2008,"I had the fortunate experience of watching the Producer Cut of this movie before I saw the 'official' version and may I say i'm glad I did otherwise I might have been too shocked and hesitant to watch another version. The official version is an absolute mess to say the least, it has deleted and shortened SO many scenes that were crucial to the story and simply replaced it with blood and guts with no real explanation besides a small scene with Tommy Doyle talking about 'Thorn' and its history. Overall, this version of the movie was simply re-made for mindless idiots who only view a movie for possible breast exposure or violent madness. The final nail in the coffin is the editing and and scene skips. Watching this you can plainly see that it was an ATTEMPT to re-do half of a movie with frequent black outs to scenes where people have magically appeared and scenery changes with no explanation to why those people are either there or what happened between the skips. These fade in/fade outs in the movie left me feeling weird and irritable about the lack of story telling and ability to draw in the audience. I ask all who read this and agree with me about 'this' version to not give up hope, check out the producers cut and see the dramatic changes and superior story that will leave you satisfied and not confused over what you just saw. It's your game now, Doctor Loomis!(sinister laugh)",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The acting isn't THAT bad, although it could have been better. One thing I didn't like about it was using the Thorn symbol. I mean, it hasn't been mentioned once in the series yet (although we do see it one other time) and then Dr. Loomis says ""It's his mark"". What the heck? He suddenly adds this mark into the series in the 6th movie? And then it is never mentioned in Halloween H20 either.

284,johnnyblaze420-1,Halloween 6 Worst Horror Sequel Ever,1,3 May 2006,"I am a huge Halloween fan but my feelings towards this sixth installment is when this came out they f'd up the whole series. After 7 years of waiting for the next one to come out I was forced to watch this piece of crap. Which did nothing to further the Michael Myers legacy. The story was so ridiculous and off, the writers should be banned from ever writing again. The whole thing with the cult was so not the right way to go in continuing the franchise. The thing that made the previous movies so great was the keeping us in the dark about his motivations for wanting to kill his family. It just made it scarier and more mysterious. I have seen the producers cut after hearing this version was so much better. And to me it still sucked. Yeah it had a lot of different things going on in it, but it still basically had the same story and had even more to do with Michael's crew (THE CULT) Michael always worked alone and now he has a crew of loyal cultists and what appears to be a bodyguard (THE MAN In BLACK). Even Michael Myers himself wasn't the same, he didn't really look like he did before or walk the way he walked. I myself wasn't impressed with this movie. And do not recommend it to no one.

285,jackson-219,Producer's Cut,3,26 June 2008,"The producer's cut is an example of studio interference gone haywire, or should I say the theatrical cut, or maybe both versions. This version of the movie is a lot more character driven and has some moments that are alittle creepy but the cult element really seems to be the one factor that faults both versions of the film. In the Producer's cut, Dr.Wynn's explanation of the thorn cult is better and I must say kind of creepy but the SPOILER ALERT! reason for Jamie's babies existence is absolutely absurd and is definitely not in tone of any Halloween movie. Michael raped Jamie! Come on! What a loud of trash. The film would have worked if they added more chase scenes and went further with the cult ending, or make it exciting or suspense instead of just having the kids run out the building and Tommy stopping Michael with mystical ruins, that did suck as a kid said in a test screening. The chase ending of the theatrical cut could have been added and just gave Michael a better death than the stupid lead pipe gag. Halloween 6 is a prime example of pre-packaged crap!

It wasn't, but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths.The thing that I disliked, however, was all of the plot complications. Those could have been okay, if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through.  But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution, specifically?  Why were they protected from Michael's damage until a certain point? What exactly were they going to do with the baby?  How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant, for that matter?  Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant, too?  Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab?  The actors seemed to have ""figured it all out"" once they saw the fetuses.. But it was never explained to the audience.If you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed, then this'll be okay for you..

Some say the 'Curse' plot-line is crap, but I dont think so, it does explain a few things, ie, why he lives alllll the time.  Also the 'cut' version is much better than the normal ending, contary to popular belief Sam Loomis does not die, he as to return in H20.  Doing Halloween 6 was a good move to the future, because Mikey is back in H2K, and it may be linked to H6, apparently that was not Mike Myers' head at the end of H20...you live and learn.!!EVIL NEVER DIES",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

297,wolfy2789,"For true fans, this is one of the best.",10,23 December 2007,"So what is it with everyone hating Halloween 6? Yes, Michael Myers wasn't nearly as scary as he was in the first one this time around, because you know his face inside and out. Look at the fourth and fifth Halloween, look at the mask in those, listen to the horrible sound effects and stupid sounds when the cops come around, and tell me that is more entertaining than this one. The great thing about this Halloween was that it showed the true evil behind Michael Myers. At no moment did it stop to show you Michael with a tear in his eye like in 5, or giving his niece an obvious second chance at life through making stupid mistakes. This Michael is a monster filled with nothing but rage. From the gruesome death of his niece to the death of the entire Strode family, this gets you inside the house and mind of Michael myers more than ever before. Paul Rudd has an outstanding performance that makes you actually think that Michael Myers really screwed him up when he was a kid. (Hell it would screw me up), and and also great performances by the rest of the cast, most notably Maryanne Hagen. No tag line saying ""Michael lives, and this time their ready..."", this tag line is honest and makes sense. It says the scariest Halloween of them all. Well, besides the original, this movie can give you some serious nightmares. Just go into this movie open minded and willing to learn more about Michael Myers, even if you don't believe the ancient ruins. My perfect recommendation would be to watch this movie on a Sunday evening before bed, because this is one of those movies that you will want to think more into during the long work week. A perfect, chilling, gruesome, and relentless movie to for a cold Autumn night. Whoever believes that this movie is bad isn't a true fan of Michael Myers, they just stick with the original, but if you are a die hard fan, even if you hate to admit it, you really do wish you knew what would happen if they followed into the 7th film with continuity from this one. This is also a movie that in about 20 years will still continue to scare you just like the original.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The atmosphere is Scary as Hell, the acting is pretty good, and Paul Rudd gives an EXCELLENT performance as Tommy Doyle. The only thing I can say bad about this movie is that the theatrical cut of the film does leave many questions. Really to me that makes it even more scary, as you cant fully comprehend why Michael does what he does. If everything was fully explained, it would take away some of the suspense of the film. Most of these questions, however, are answered in the underground producers cut of the film which has become somewhat of a ""holy grail"" for hardcore series fans. Really, I think this movie is, without a doubt, the most underrated film in the history of the horror Genre. Dont let what critics say deter you from this movie. Watch this film if you havent seen it, and if you can, try to find the producers cut and watch that also. I think you will agree that its not nearly as bad as some people have said.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

302,tsl87,"My opinion of ""Halloween""",10,3 May 2008,"I love the series and am just really getting into it. Im 20 years old and can still remember as a younger kid being so scared of Halloween. I love watching the older movies. It just seems creepier with the 70's and 80's feel to it, the wardrobe, the town of Haddonfield... Not to mention the music by John Carpenter. I have seen all of the films in the series but do not remember the plot of each. To this day the films still creep me out. When I watch one, the next morning on the way out the door to go to work, I see him standing on my porch when I open the door. Even walking down the sidewalk to my truck I look over my shoulder. To me that is what a true horror movie should do to you. I am a fan of Rob Zombies new addition to Halloween. I thought the cast was great but seeing Michael as a young boy kind of made him less scary to me. You kind of feel sorry for him where in the original films you were more scared than anything. Not knowing adds to the fear of the character. I've read quite a few comments on this site and it seems like there are a lot of fans of the series. To me, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St, and Childs Play were scary to me when I was a kid but now I laugh when I see them. I hope to see another Zombie directed film but I would like to see an add on to the series instead of a ""re-telling"". If I remember correctly, the last time we saw Michael was in the morgue when his eye popped open. I would love to see the series pick up from there. It would be better with Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance but if Scout Taylor-Compton and Danielle Harris can hook up with Tommy Doyle and Lindsay Wallace to run from Michael again I'm sure they can make a great film.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers

The three of these actors are all brilliantly cast.Watching the movie a week ago, what I experienced was honestly a ""life experience"". The texture. The maturity. The music and settings - the aura of dread!

307,romertutor-99598,A skewered diamond in the rough.,8,27 December 2016,"For years, I could never figure out why this sequel was so strange and flawed in a lot of ways. But I recently listened to audio commentary by Daniel Ferrands and I found out how ambitious and dedicated he was to making this a worthy sequel... Until the suits came in and raped what was once his vision (Jamie living until the end and dying in a fight with Michael, more Loomis for the fans, a bit lighter on gore, a classic score from Alan Howarth, etc). It was only implied that Steven was Michael's child, rather than confirmed... Which was a good choice for such a bizarre subplot. What takea me out of this flick is J.C. Brandy, she just wasn't Jamie to me. And Paul Rudd having more screen time than Donald Pleasance was disappointing. H6 is one of the more mean spirited entries and as far as spirit, it looks and feels like Halloween. The performances are strong, Kara Strode being the most grounded next to Loomis, and Michael is the most bad ass we've seen up to this point.

It's not the best of the Halloween series by far, but it isn't the worst either. I think it continued from part 5 very well and was actually better than that movie. It's definitely dark like the original two and brings some needed character development to the series. The back story of Michael is very intriguing, and it's about time someone explained why he is the way he is. I say don't listen to negative reviews.

309,spj11,Halloween Six eh i could think of another word beginning with S,1,23 January 2006,"Okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, H20 alright, Resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, heck maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way round, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap, oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid, i wish he had got it he's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers < By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act, he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish, oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.",Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers
