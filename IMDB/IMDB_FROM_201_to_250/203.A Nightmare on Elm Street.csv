0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not the worst remake, but still pointless...",2,9 September 2011,"I wasn't expecting the remake to Nightmare on Elm Street to be as good as the classic original, but I was expecting a decent enough film. As a remake and on its own terms, this Nightmare on Elm Street is a mess. Is it the worst remake out there? Not quite, Psycho and Wicker Man were worse. But it is among the most pointless, at least to me. This time round, the story is over-simplistic, the characters shallow and dull and the script jumbled. And apart from one, the acting is terrible, especially from Kyle Gallner. The editing in general could've been tighter while the effects lack clarity and distract from the atmosphere rather than enhance it. Speaking of the atmosphere, it seemed bland here, the nail-biting suspense and build ups seem very subdued and I don't think I remember being shocked by any scene from this movie. The only redeeming quality I feel is the efforts of Jackie Earl Haley. Robert Englund's performance was iconic and wonderfully creepy so Haley had big shoes to fill, and while he is a little too small for the role his makeup is believable and he does make a valiant attempt with his characterisation. All in all, pointless and messy. 2/10 Bethany Cox",A Nightmare on Elm Street
1,Leofwine_draca,Nearly a good film,5,11 February 2012,"As remakes go, this new version of the Wes Craven classic turns out to be not so bad – providing you discount the original film which did it all first, and better, of course. This NIGHTMARE greatly benefits from a better script than usual, which contains more characterisation than you might expect from a teenage slasher, and a decent cast for once.Rooney Mara (THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) stars as Nancy, a high schooler plagued by nightmares involving the sinister Freddy Krueger. From the very first scene, she and her buddies are being decimated in their dreams by the knife-fingered maniac, and it becomes a battle to stay awake as long as possible.This film boasts fast pacing and a refreshing attitude in playing everything straight. I suspect the scares and kill sequences will be a lot more effective to those unfamiliar with the Craven original. The direction's far better than you'd expect from a guy straight out of making music videos, and really there's only one thing at fault.Sadly, that's Freddy himself. For some unknown reason, they decided not to bring Robert Englund back, instead replacing him with WATCHMEN's Jackie Earle Haley). This was a BIG mistake. Not only is Haley bland, playing a stock psycho part, Freddy's iconic looks are gone too. This time around the burn makeup is more realistic, and CGI is utilised to create a missing-face look, but the effect is terrible. Freddy becomes just another bland and generic mutilated killer with absolutely no gravitas or power.Sadly, when a character like Freddy is portrayed so badly, it sours the whole experience and makes this another remake to avoid. It's a shame, because A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET has more going for it than most of the other remakes I've watched.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
2,SnoopyStyle,Krueger without Englund,5,25 October 2015,"Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley) is back haunting the nightmares of his victims. Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz) is desperate to stay awake. Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy) meets him at the diner after breaking up with Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker). Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara) is their friend working at the diner. Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner) secretly likes Nancy. Freddy kills Dean but it looks like Dean stabs himself in front of Kris. Gwen (Connie Britton) is Nancy's mother. Alan Smith (Clancy Brown) is Quentin's father. Kris starts to have nightmares and investigates the truth of Krueger's origins from her buried past.This is a reimagined remake of the original franchise. It's darker, moodier but less exuberant. It feels a bit lifeless which makes the movie less intense. The young actors are all great especially Cassidy. Jackie Earle Haley is doing a creepier, more serious version of Krueger. All of it could work if the original isn't there. This doesn't have the edge or the life of the original. There's no need to recast Krueger with Robert Englund still willing to work. It's simply wrongheaded. If this is the first Nightmare, I can see the possibilities and maybe have a better opinion about the movie. However, the changes are not big enough to be interesting.There is a moment midway in the movie where Krueger's guilt is called into question. That would be risky and gutsy. I don't know how that would play out but I would love to see them try. It would cast the franchise into a whole new light where Krueger is actually the hero and the kids are the villains. The problem is this movie would never have the guts to do the unthinkable.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
3,claudio_carvalho,What For?,5,14 October 2010,"Freddy Krueger is my number one maniac of horror movies and I have watched the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise many times in the movie theaters, on VHS and on DVD. Inclusive I have a wonderful memorabilia of this great villain in the shelf where I store my horror movies. Robert Englund became a cult-actor because of his magnificent interpretation of Freddy Krueger, blending humor and cruelty in the right proportions.This remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" does not add any value to the franchise, with a story that does not show anything that has not been seen before, except the awful Freddy Krueger, performed by Jackie Earle Haley. Anyway, the acting is decent and the special effects are great. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Pesadelo"" (""The Hour of the Nightmare"")",A Nightmare on Elm Street
4,kosmasp,Different Beast,5,20 October 2010,"You might not like the movie, but the makers did exactly what they set out to do. A straight dark thriller picture. Gone is the dark and twisted sense of humor, that was developed especially in the latter installments of the Englund starring series. But I won't tell you, if you will like it or not. One never can tell those things. Plus it really does depend on a few things.Like if you have watched the original Nightmare movie. There are Hardcore fans out there (and I really love the Kruger character, because he does have a personality, at least in the old series that is), who will not forgive the producers for taking it away from Robert Englund. Englund on the other hand, did not mind that much, when they were making the movie (at least that's what he was saying in public during conventions).If you haven't seen the original, I would urge you to do so. Even if you already watched the remake, you will enjoy the Original Kruger. And you will detect that some things seem to have been copied (character wise), but it will depend on your taste, if that makes any difference between the movie.Mr. Watchmen himself (Jackie Earle Haley) tries very hard and he is not really bad. It's just that one movie has not changed my view on who the real Freddy K. is ...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
5,Sleepin_Dragon,I really did enjoy it.,7,15 May 2020,"I had a feeling this was going to be slated, and some of the criticism is justified, but in all honesty I liked it. The opening scenes are fantastic, it's a very smart looking film, it looks great. The content of the film is decent, it's such a shame that Robert Englund didn't do the film, but I can imagine he feels it's a role that's well and truly in the past. That fact was a nail in the coffin for the film, I'm not sure what many were expecting.Some of the scares are a little on the tame side by today's standards, but the story is good, it deserved a bit more loving that it got. 7/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
6,jboothmillard,A Nightmare on Elm Street,3,8 November 2010,"There are certain horror films I think shouldn't be remade, and this was one of those films I was really unsure they could pull off, naturally I had to see it no matter what. Basically the first twenty or so minutes of the film focus on Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), who lives in Elm Street, who watches his boyfriend Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz) die in his sleep cutting his own neck, but it was actually the cause of his dream. She sees photos of Dean at the funeral, noticing herself as a little girl, but they seemed to meet each other at high school, and then Kris starts having the same nightmare he did. In the nightmare is a burned man wearing a green and red striped sweater, brown hat and a glove with knives for fingers, and even with ex-boyfriend Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker) keeping her an eye on her, she still gets slashed in her sleep. Jesse goes to see his friend Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara) and they realise they too are having the same nightmare and every time they fall asleep they will encounter this boogeyman, Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley). While Jesse gets arrested for suspected murder, Nancy try to stay awake and investigate more about this guy in their nightmares, and specifically while they were children. Nancy's mother Nora (Lia D. Mortensen) reveals, and Alan Smith (The Shawshank Redemption's Clancy Brown) confirms, that while they were children Freddy Krueger was a gardener working at the school, and there was evidence that he may have been molesting the kids, and the parents took revenge by burning him alive. After Jesse was killed in the jail cell, the struggle to stay awake increases for Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner), and they are getting closer to finding out what really happened to Freddy, and they are devastated to find out that their parents were right about the past. Nancy decides the only way to kill Freddy once and for all is to do what she did with a piece of his sweater, bring him out of her nightmare, and Quentin ready to get him. In the end, the plan to bring Freddy out worked, and he seems to be defeated being burned alive, but of course he reappears in the end in the mirror, stabbing Nora and pulling her through, with Nancy screaming in terror. Also starring Connie Britton as Dr. Gwen Holbrook and Andrew Fiscella as Inmate. My main problem with this remake was Freddy, he is a little sinister I'll admit, but Haley just doesn't have the same evil charm and fun factor as Robert Englund does, with a less wide-eyed look and unfunny one-liners. I did like the ironic use of The Everly Brothers song ""All I Have To Do Is Dream"", which also has suitable lyrics (""I'm dreamin' my life away, I need you so that I could die""), and some of the deaths were good gore, but overall a disappointing and not worth it remake horror. Adequate!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

8,BA_Harrison,Try to stay awake.,3,7 December 2019,"This 2010 remake of the 1984 Wes Craven classic received a lot of flak from the moment it was announced, much of it from fans incensed at the idea of their beloved Freddy Krueger being played by anyone other than Robert Englund. I, on the other hand, was open to the idea of a remake: while I love Englund as Freddy (especially in Dream Warriors and A New Nightmare), I thought it would be cool to see another actor's take on the role. I also felt that a remake might improve on the one or two moments in the original that have always prevented it from being one of my favourite horrors.I was wrong on both counts.Jackie Earle Haley's version of Krueger is not good: his new appearance - realistic burns scars - is bland and forgettable, the character is now a child molester NOT a child-killer, and Haley gives him a silly gruff voice in an attempt to be more menacing. As for those 'wrinkles' that I hoped would be ironed out this time around... they aren't: I always disliked that shot of Freddy looming over Nancy in her bed, clearly achieved by Englund pressing his face against a fake rubber sheet wall, but the CGI equivalent is so much worse. And that silly final scene in which Nancy's mother is pulled through the door... you gotta give them credit for not scrapping the death entirely, but the new ending is just as stupid.If this was the sum of all that is wrong with the film, it would still be reasonably enjoyable, but the problems don't end there...The feature debut of music video director Samuel Bayer, A Nightmare On Elm Street '10 substitutes genuine chills with lame jump scares (that rarely work), stars a miserable looking Rooney Mara as Nancy (the once likeable teenager now an awkward social outcast), features unremarkable fates for its cookie-cutter characters, suffers from occasional use of gimmicky editing, and fleshes out Freddy's backstory with little concern for logic (a preschool is closed and left to stand derelict for years just because the gardener disappeared!?!).",A Nightmare on Elm Street
9,moonspinner55,"A dead-end on ""Elm Street""...",2,1 May 2010,"Dreary group of high school kids, all apparently suffering from some form of youthful Alzheimer's, do not remember attending the same nursery school together when they were toddlers, several of whom were molested by maintenance man Fred Krueger. Freddy was burned to death in a fire set by their enraged parents, but is now seeking his revenge on the teenagers by slicing them up in their dreams. Reworking of Wes Craven's 1984 cult hit, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a slickly-produced dead-end, an endless series of kids walking slowly through deserted rooms, dreading what's around every corner. The screenplay by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer adds pep pills, an adrenaline needle, computers and cell phones to the mix, but neither writer is able to make these youthful victims interesting or engaging. Part of the problem may be the casting, with the principal actors looking too old to still be in high school. Although it was equally illogical, the original film stayed true to the rules that Wes Craven set. Here, a swim-team member gets a visit from Freddy while in the pool (was he sleeping in the water?), while a guilt-ridden mom keeps a school photograph tucked away in between two drawers as if she and old Fred were in-cahoots! Despite an early funeral, there is no sympathy--or even invested interest from others--for those who die. Some viewers will enjoy the obvious ""BOO!"" factor (which has been carried over from the predecessor), but Jackie Earle Haley's sex-obsessed Krueger presents a problem. These hack 'em-up horror movies are supposed to be gory fun, but once the filmmakers introduce pedophilia and child-molestation into the equation, every ounce of fun leaks out--leaving behind an unsavory, unseemly aftertaste. * from ****",A Nightmare on Elm Street
10,paul_haakonsen,"What was this all about? Not another ""re-invention"" of a horror classic!",5,25 September 2010,"There are just certain things that should not be tinkered with. I don't understand Hollywood's perverse desire to take old classics and try to shine them up fit todays standards and to appeal to a new crowd. Leave the old movies as they were, and if anything, then make new follow-up. Don't touch the original movies! I had heard lots of bad things about this new version of the 1984's classic horror movie, but still I had to see it.Now, of course, I can understand that this might be a good way to get new fans drawn into the whole ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" franchise. But for us who was young teens (or adults) during the mid-80's, we are already well aware of the story and the wickedness of Freddy Krueger.There were some nice new touches to the story, but they weren't enough to carry the movie.What were they thinking when they came up with the idea of how to make Krueger look like? He reminded me of that creepy creature from ""Pan's Labyrinth"" more than he reminded me of Freddy Krueger. Krueger is, was, and will always be Robert Englund. End of story! The effects in the movie were cool, of course, given todays standards. So that worked well for the movie at least.And also the cast, they were well cast and they performed their role quite well as well. As for Jackie Earle Haley in the role of Krueger. Well, he had quite a legacy to live up to, and honestly, he got nowhere near the shadow of what Robert Englund had made Krueger into. Now, I am not saying that Haley's acting is bad or anything, but he just didn't fill out the role nowhere near Englund. But I think for the new audiences, Haley would be quite alright in the role as Krueger. But for us who went over the ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies back in the 80's are more than well-familiar with the tone of Krueger's voice, his sarcasm and his perverse wicked comments.This movie, is in my personal opinion, one of those things that should not have been tinkered with. They should have left it as it were, and perhaps make a whole new movie, not try to re-invent a classic horror tale.For new viewers to the ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" franchise, this movie should be creepy enough and provide good, thrilling entertainment. But for us ""older"" Krueger fans, this is a slap in the face.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
11,Quinoa1984,Ho-Hum on Elm Street,3,4 May 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street, just as an idea, has so much potential. A remake/reboot is not something, despite being from the studio Platinum Dunes that has not, to my point of view, made a significant contribution to horror (remakes of Friday the 13th, Amityville Horror and Texas Chainsaw Massacre all included), that could have gotten a good boost from an imaginative mind. What would happen if we went back to Elm Street and got back to the serious Freddy Kruger who was mostly in Wes Craven's original film (not the jokey one of the sequels), and all new fresh dark-surreal-horrifying images were put up there with a Freddy that is scathing and awful and can chill you to the bone, or later on after the movie ends in your sleep? Sadly, the remake/reboot doesn't do the possibilities justice. It's what the layman might call 'dullsville'. The director, Samuel Bayer, is interested only in getting some ""cool"" lighting in certain scenes, and over-using his CGI effects, He doesn't even get good work out of Jackie Earle Haley, the new Kruger and a fantastic character actor whose had a comeback in recent years, who just snarls and does a cross between his Rorscach and Ledger's Joker. He's not scary, and his make-up is not good, like a badly done job of someone trying to get more hardcore than the original Englund look without getting how to improve on it. Not jump scares like in the use of ""micronaps"" or the re-makes of full scenes (i.e. the body bag in the high school hallway, Freddy coming through the wall, the glove coming out in the bathtub) all fall flat.Nothing in it is worth getting too upset about, but nothing excites or sparks creativity. Bayer shows more of his hack-ness as a first time director by also not getting one actor, outside of Haley who maybe tries what he can in a very thin role, in the teen group to convince. The actress who plays Nancy especially looks bored and ineffective in the movie (should someone take this girl to the Kristen Stewart school of emoting? just saying). And in the script we don't seem to be able to latch on to a central character; Nancy only becomes really prominent a half hour into the film, after several other kids have already been killed, and by this point it's hard to really get worked up about her being killed off. Even a disturbing twist from the original - that Freddy was a pederast instead of just a child killer - doesn't go anywhere past a brief mystery of 'did he really do it'? Yawn.I'm not saying the film may find some fans; Michael Bay and the producers and Bayer are clearly aiming for the teenage set, most of whom (at least they hope) have never seen a Freddy movie, not even the Freddy vs Jason from 2003 which, compared to this, fares much better. Nothing is inspired here, and when the script tries to make sense it just reverts back to killings... in micronaps. It's another missed opportunity by Hollywood, at least creatively.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
12,BandSAboutMovies,What a waste of everyone's time,1,31 October 2018,"Samuel Bayer directed the Nirvana video for ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" amongst literally hundreds of other videos and commercials. For his first movie, he was selected to remake the first Elm Street, a task that had to feel herculean.Produced by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes team, the goal was to do what they had done for their Friday the 13th remake: take the best parts of each film and make one new story. However, they soon learned that going back to the first film was really the only way to go. They also made Krueger an actual child molester and not a killer, as well as making him meaner, with a look more like an actual burn victim.Robert Englund endorsed the film (and Jackie Earle Haley playing Freddy), but Craven was not as kind, perhaps because he wasn't consulted before the movie was made.Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy, Black Canary on TV's Arrow) meets her friend Dean (Kellan Lutz, Twilight) at the Springwood Diner, but soon, Dean is asleep and dreaming of Freddy Krueger, who slices his throat. In our reality, Dean cuts his own throat as waitress Nancy (Rooney Mara, the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, who hated being in this movie so much that she nearly stopped acting) watches.The children of Elm Street soon learn that they all went to pre-school together, where they were abused by - you guessed it - Freddy Krueger. Now, they're all dreaming of the burned killing machine. Kris is soon killed by him, with her murder blamed on her ex-boyfriend Jesse (Thomas Dekker, John Connor from the Fox Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV show, who called this film a horrible mess). Of course, he's soon dead in his jail cell.Quentin (Kyle Gallner, American Sniper) and Nancy begin investigating and soon learn that once the parents of Elm Street learned that Krueger was molesting their children, they hunted him down and burned him alive. What follows is pretty much the same tale as the original, with Freddy being pulled into our world and a similar shock twist ending.I really have no idea who this movie is for. You can just go watch the original to see a much better, more imaginative film. Bayer has a great visual style - he came up in directing with Bay and David Fincher - but between the CGI makeup for Freddy, the portrayal of him and the general been there, done that nature of this film, I was bored throughout. Then again, I realize that millennials don't have as many DVDs as me or any interest in watching a movie from the early 80's.Platinum Dunes producer Brad Fuller has been quoted as saying that while the film was a financial success, the backlash didn't stop for two years. The company wouldn't make another movie until 2013's The Purge and hasn't remade a horror movie since.While a talented actor, I just don't like Haley in the Freddy role. Maybe its because he has referred to the original as, ""The worst movie ever."" Or perhaps that's just sour grape, as there's a rumor that Johnny Depp tagged along when Haley auditioned for the original and got the part while his friend didn't.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
13,Coventry,"Don't listen to opinions and don't read any reviews! Except this one, of course :-)",6,1 May 2019,"I like to think of myself as an open-minded horror fanatic. Like most people, I'm not very fond of remakes of classic genre landmarks, but at least I try to give them a fair and unbiased change. Admittedly I didn't do this for the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" remake. For practically 10 years, I deliberately ignored this film because literally every opinion I heard and every review that I read were extremely negative. Well, once again it's proven that you should always form your own opinion instead of blindly relying on those of others. The 2010 remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" obviously isn't a masterwork, but it's a respectable effort that tries to remain loyal and bring tribute to the 1984 original, yet simultaneously has its own personality.Why does everybody hate this film so much? Simple, because a lot of people consider the Wes Craven original as sacred and inimitable, so the opinions were largely established already before they even saw the film. Remaking the classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is supposedly blasphemy, but let's be honest, most of the sequels and notably Craven's own and dreadful ""New Nightmare"" were far worse than this film!The initial idea apparently was to make a prequel to the 1984 original. Makes sense, because the plot deep-dives a lot more into the persona of Freddy Krueger and his past as a (possible?) child molester at a kindergarten school. Naturally, and understandably, the producers couldn't resist recycling the still brilliant premise of a killer stalking his victims in their dreams, so it became a remake. You don't have to take my word on it, but ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has a lot of positive things going for it. For starters, it's an R-rated horror film and it is quite full of nasty murders and gritty set-pieces. Many horror remakes are softened in order to obtain a PG-13 rating and reach wider audiences, but this isn't the case here. The character of Freddy Krueger, as depicted by Jackie Earle Haley, is also a worthy successor to Robert Englund's iconic role. Perhaps Freddy's voice isn't as menacing as it used to be, but he's certainly intimidating and scary, and his facial makeover make-up is very good. I even daresay Freddy's burning wounds and facial scars are more realistic now. There's also a decent amount of suspense and the characters' deaths are often unpredictable and surprising, making this a for more enjoyable horror remake than I ever assumed it would be. Therefore, don't take the opinions of others for granted and discover for yourself whether this is a worthless horror remake or not!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
14,Scarecrow-88,A Nightmare on Elm Street,4,1 July 2011,"Child molester Fred Krueger was burned alive by outraged parents and now returns to kill those kids who pointed him out as a pedophile through their dreams, a nightmare monster who preys on them as teenagers, having first encountered these high school students as the gardener of a preschool they attended. Nancy (Rooney Mara; The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo remake), potential boyfriend Quentin (Kyle Gallner; Jennifer's Body), Kris (Katie Cassidy; Black Christmas remake), Kris' ex-boyfriend Jesse (Thomas Dekker; Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) and Kris's friend Dean (Kellan Lutz; Twilight) are all seeing Fred Krueger in their nightmares, eventually each are stalked after, trying to escape from his clutches—will any of them survive? Soulless remake is handsomely produced with an attractive cast. But the film is absent any personality, including the characters, without any fresh ideas for the Krueger character. Even classic scenes iconic to the first film are recycled here, such as the razor blade gloved hand rising between Nancy's legs while she is about to doze off in the bathtub, the bloody body bag of a victim pulled down the high school hall, the victim hurled across her bedroom (up the walls and ceiling before Fred silences her screams with a slash down the chest), and victims running in fear throughout Fred's boileroom. The film, while beautifully shot, lulls quite a bit, lacks impactful violence, and doesn't offer a very satisfying Freddy character, either, as he does appear from time to time, but unforgivably is rather ever scary as much as sleazy (which is probably the intent; there is more emphasis on his past and that reverberates when Fred toys with Nancy, his *chosen one*) . Jackie Earle Haley impresses more as Fred before he's burnt alive (in flashback memory sequences) than as the nightmare monster, with some rather disappointing burn make-up as well. I have to admit, there were times where I almost dosed off, never a problem with Wes' film. I kind of prefer the lack of polish in Wes' film while this remake is quite glossy—I imagine the director had a lot of money thrown at him while Craven had to work with peanuts yet delivered a thrill ride with some genuine atmosphere and chills. I will say that the filmmakers pulled a nice PSYCHO on me as I was expecting a certain character to be the lead, since she is rather established from the start as the possible ""final girl"", the way slashers are known to do so which does fall in line with Wes' film as well. Mara might have gotten the DRAGON TATTOO gig, but I hope she shows more of a pulse in that movie as her performance here was lifeless. Haley, a gifted actor, just had nothing to work with here: his lines were flat, yet he was able to evoke a level of perversity and maliciousness under the unimpressive burn make-up. Just as poor are some instances of CGI which pale next to the practical work in Wes' film(again reiterating how man-made effects can sometimes leave more of an impression than creating computer graphic images in a Hollywood studio). The Hollywood machine continues to churn these out, barely any leaving much to be desired.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
15,Hey_Sweden,A yawn on Elm Street.,5,15 April 2012,"Remake of Wes Cravens' landmark slasher hit is watchable but only just. If one had nothing to compare it to, it may serve as adequate, if generic, modern fright fare, but the makers of this film just don't have as much fun with the whole notion of nightmares, preferring to have it play out by the numbers. The actors do serviceable jobs, but they won't make anybody forget the cast from the original film.Jackie Earle Haley inherits the role of nightmare haunting, vengeance crazed, burned to a crisp ghoul Freddy Krueger, and is reasonably entertaining. The story here differs on a few points than Cravens', but basically amounts to the same thing, as Freddy, fried by a lynch mob infuriated by what they believed he'd done to their children, returns in the nightmares of the children to slaughter them. Eventually, outsider teen Nancy (Rooney Mara) and boyfriend Quentin (Kyle Gallner) find out the whole back story and determine to find a way to stop the psychopath.And therein lies one of the problems: the appeal of the heroine is diminished by having her be somewhat less of a ""take charge"" individual and by not having her on her own in her fight. Now, director Samuel Bayer and company rely on the standard jump scare approach a little too much, although in all fairness some of these jump scares *do* work. Visually the crew keep the movie stylishly connected to the original, with nice production design, by Patrick Lumb, and cinematography, by Jeff Cutter. Fans of Cravens' film will also be quick to notice whenever this one directly quotes memorable 1984 images. The story overall isn't as strong, despite attempts to go in some different directions, such as the parents going off half cocked before Freddy can even get a day in court, or floating the possibility that the guy with the glove just might be innocent.Mara is sullen as our heroine; overall, the young cast fails to leave much of an impression, while veterans Connie Britton and Clancy Brown (who's kind of wasted) fill out the other major adult roles. Special effects aren't bad, but Freddy's makeup is highly ineffective; here he looks like a human turtle or something.From beginning to end, this 21st century ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is about what many of us could have expected: strictly forgettable stuff - if not badly made on a technical level - with acceptable gloomy atmosphere, and a fair amount of gore, but it just doesn't have a lot of heart or soul, remaining a strictly commercial venture.Five out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

For one thing three attractive and good actors (Kellan Lutz, Katie Cassidy and Thomas Dekker) are killed off early on (about half an hour in) and we're just left with Mara and Gallner--and they're terrible. They're both physically unattractive (Gallner's hair especially is frightening) and lousy actors (Mara shows even less expression than Kristen Stewart). You want Freddy to get them quick! Also Freddy. Haley does a good job with he voice and acting--but he's too small! The guy is only 5'5"" in real life...and it shows. The two full figure of shots of him are laughable cause he's so short. Still it DOES work. The opening killing of Lutz is actually quite frightening (and bloody) and sets an appropriately grim tone for the rest of the film. Also the plot is changed a little...and to better effect. Krueger is given more of a back story here and they don't have him cracking stupid jokes like he did in the previous series. The special effects are superb and the attack scenes are brutal and bloody. I was actually scared more than once--and I don't scare easy! There's also a few nice redos of sequences from the original movie. I was never really bored and the climatic fight was exciting and extremely well-done. (Usually they're drawn out to the point that you just want to scream) The ending doesn't make a bit of sense (neither did the original) but it was exceptionally gruesome and gives you a nice jolt. Also (thankfully) there's no gratuitous female nudity. A good solid redo that's been a huge hit at the box office and (of course) they already have TWO sequels planned! I give it a 7.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
17,dbborroughs,When you make a movie a script helps,4,5 June 2010,"Must stop basing choices on what I can see RIGHT now.Re start and rethink of the Freddy Kruger franchise, has the cast and the cool effects but is missing the pacing and a script.Did we really need to restart the franchise...no wait did we need to restart the franchise with this script? The pacing is off with the film seeming to take forever to get going. The script lacks imagination, and while pieces work the whole thing has a sense of ""Been here and done that"".Its not bad. Its really not but its the sort of thing we've seen before better, never mind in the original films but in the rip offs as well.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
18,utgard14,Well it's a nightmare...,3,28 October 2015,"This is a textbook example of a bad remake of a horror classic and why it's such a creatively bankrupt idea to begin with. You take said classic, strip it bare of original ideas, remove all atmosphere and scares, and make sure you ""update"" the effects and cinematography to make it slick, polished, and pretty like a music video. Most importantly, you cast gorgeous young mactors in all the big roles. The exception to that last part is the guy behind the Freddy makeup. For him, you cast rat-faced Jackie Earle Haley. It should come as no surprise to anyone over 21 that Haley is the best part of this otherwise bland cast. But he's still no Robert Englund. Plain and simple there is nothing about this remake that is equal to or better than the original. As with the other remakes in recent years, the attention is on all the wrong things. More time should have been spent on a quality script and crafting some good scares. God forbid we try to make this thing frightening or creepy in any way. No, it's better that we set out to create a vehicle for Hollywood's overflowing gutter of beautiful young models, actors, and pop stars with no talent. The end result is a shallow, lifeless movie with nothing of value. Avoid this please and stick with the Wes Craven film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
19,zardoz-13,An Excellent Remake of A Classic Original Exercise in Terror!,10,4 May 2010,"The remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" illustrates the rare exception to the rule that remakes are always appalling. Anybody who walks into this first-rate horror chiller expecting a scene-for-scene rehash of Wes Craven's 1984 original may be disappointed. Although music video director Samuel Bayer and ""Cape Fear"" scenarist Wesley Strick and freshman writer Eric Heisserer have retained most of the same predicaments and characters, they have altered what happens to whom and provided us with more background about the heinous Freddy Krueger, the vengeful parents, and developed the unspeakable events in greater detail that triggered the nightmares than the original dared. Mind you, nothing in this R-rated remake approaches Johnny Depp's audacious death scene in the original. Nevertheless, Bayer and his special effects gurus have considerably ramped up the blood, gore and violence without making it unduly offensive. Virtually everything in this movie looks sinister. In other words, whereas the early Wes Craven remake of ""The Last House on the Left"" never lived up to the original, Bayer's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is as good as the original, with a superb performance by Jackie Earle Haley as the nefarious Freddy. Haley has the look of an extraterrestrial alien with his face wrapped with what resembles a cheese pizza. He scrapes his razor-sharp knives together that serve as his weapons and delivers his dialogue with an edgy rasp. If anybody can replace the iconic Robert Englund, Haley is the actor. He makes a fiercely grim Freddy. Admittedly, Bayer and his scribes don't give Haley the juicy morsels of memorable lines that Englund had, but it appears as if they wanted us to take Freddy as more than a sarcastic goblin. An occasional line that reminds us that the people who made the remake are having some fun occurs. One of the teenagers is told to stay awake during a swim practice match, and the end theme song is a melody about dreams.\ The remake of ""Nightmare"" opens with Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz of ""Twilight"") trying to make it to dawn in the Springwood Diner without falling asleep. Predictably, Dean has no luck. He looks like death warmed over and has been up for so long, past 70 hours, so that he is experiencing micro-naps. Meaning, every time he falls asleep, he is menaced by a bizarre ghoul in a dark fedora wearing a striped red sweater with a modified glove on his right hand that features knives for fingers. Freddy taunts him and stalks him. In his dreams, the diner turns into a replica of Hell with chopped off animal heads and huge fires raging. Freddy attacks Dean, but Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy of ""Taken"") only sees Dean struggling with himself. In Dean's dream, Freddy has his knives deployed to slice through Dean's neck. When the cutting starts, however, Kris watches in horror as Dean cuts his own throat. Non-surprising, Kris has nightmares afterward, disrupts her history class, and scrambles out. Kris' boyfriend Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"") spends the night with her while her flight attendant mother catches a red-eye express. Just as Kris consoled Dean that his dreams were harmless, so Jesse tries to console Kris. Kris knows that what she saw was real and was she has experienced is no apparition. The same is true for the waitress, Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara of ""Youth in Revolt""), who kept Dean's coffee cup filled. Eventually, Nancy adds up everything that is either suspicious or mysterious with the help of her new boyfriend, Quentin O'Grady (Kyle Gallner of ""A Haunting in Connecticut""), and they discover that they went to school with Dean and Kris. Previously, their protective parents destroyed all photographs of Dean, Kris, Nancy, Kyle and others as a group. They have sought to repress the memories, but the memories come back to our heroes as a really bad dream.New Line Cinema spun an entire franchise of films off the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" along with a television series, all of them starring Robert Englund as the infamous Freddy. Seven movies about Freddy and his murderous killing spree with teens toppling like ten-pins appeared between 1985 and 1991. Craven helmed the final ""Nightmare"" in 1994 as ""The New Nightmare,"" before New Line pitted Freddy against Camp Crystal slasher Jason in the 2003 nail-biter ""Freddy Vs. Jason."" Again, Bayer and his writers don't deviate for the source material. Instead, they rearrange the events. While an original ""Nightmare"" character climbed stairs that turned into oatmeal, Nancy plunges into a hall that turns into blood. Nancy has the scene in the remake where she snoozes in the bathtub where Freddy strikes, but their battle doesn't go into the bottom-less depths of the tub. Bayer saves this scene for Quentin when he has a dream while swimming in a pool. Not only is the remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" imaginative, but also Bayer doesn't lets the characters loiter. The fun of watching a ""Nightmare"" movie is trying to guess what constitutes a dream and what doesn't so that the surprise doesn't catch you off-guard. Freddy has a habit of appearing suddenly in the foreground and the background. Any time that he does appear, the filmmakers want the audience to scream and the audience that I saw this slasher with screamed and screamed often. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" qualifies as a top-notch remake of a cinematic classic.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Well... it didn't quite put me to sleep,6,31 January 2011,"A group of teens are having the same dream. Hunted by a man in a red and green-striped sweater, wearing a fedora and with a glove that would make for a painful handshake. They begin to investigate who he is and why he is after them. But what he does to them in their dreams happens for real(...except for when it doesn't)... can they figure out the mystery in time? While this doesn't misunderstand everything that made the original(that they take very direct inspiration from here and there) work, it gets very little of it right. The sparse lighting, the base concept of not being safe in bed, and sometimes, it is creepy(opening and ending especially). Those work. However, it doesn't build atmosphere(there are excellent sets... why on Earth do they spend so little time showing them to us?), the iconic killer(who looks much less grotesque, or maybe it's just me) is shown too much early on(only later do they realize how terrifying his silhouette is) and talks constantly(they even have conversations with him! At least, he doesn't tell jokes, still, it takes away from it), the characters(who make idiotic mistakes, as they know what's going on from almost right away because the crew are inept) are plain(John Connor isn't given enough to do(ditto Clancy Brown; I'd watch an entire film centered around his role in this, and I'm not kidding), he's the best of the younger ones... instead, we spend time on less pale and shiny Twilight dude), and they explain *everything*(we should never see you-know-who before the burning... nor the attack itself... both happen here). Acting is average, mostly. Jackie Earle Haley makes a definite attempt at a performance, and doesn't copy Englund, without it leading to him being that scary(it isn't really his fault, he clearly tries). This sets up a twist(the only thing it puts effort into), and the reveal is a humongous anti-climax. There are few effective deaths. The nightmares are obvious instead of smoothed into, so you instantly know when you're in one. They end(often the person just... wakes up, not by someone else's doing) before anything happens and there are a ton of them, removing a large chunk of the tension. In general, this takes a few great ideas and repeats them ad naseum until we're used to them. FX are usually good(other than at least one instance of obvious CGI). The dialog is poor, at times exposition-happy and always written for the trailers. There is a bit of bloody, gory violence, and a little sexuality and strong language in this. The DVD comes with the well-done 13 minute promotional featurette, Freddy Krueger Reborn, that doesn't spoil the movie. I recommend this to those who are willing to sit through the mess this is for the few positives. 6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Yet another unnecessary, Michael Bay executive produced horror film franchise 'reboot' this time with everyone's favorite bad dream: burn victim/phantom killer Freddy Krueger (Haley acquitting himself nicely as the deranged slasher under a ton of realistic scarring make-up) in this origin story about the fate of him and his chilling legacy of pedophilia (thanks to the streamlined screenplay by vet Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer) leading to seek vengeance against the brood of those who doomed him to his crispy fate. While long-time music video director Samuel Bayer delivers the visual goods in his big-screen debut the film feels re-heated especially when it liberally lifts remake shot-by-shot sequences (i.e. the bathtub shot) and just goes to show that even though new generations want to be scared they'd best rent the original screamer.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
23,neil-476,Remake which adds nothing,6,12 May 2010,"It has been many years since I saw the original Nightmare. I don't remember many specifics, but I do remember that it was both original and scary. I think one must accept that a remake is, as a matter of necessity, likely to lack originality, but one can hope that it will be scary, and also that it will bring something new to the table.If you've never seen a horror movie before and you're keen to see one, then this Nightmare remake will probably fit the bill quite nicely - things suddenly appear behind people, or just out of vision, there are sudden loud noises and so on - all the horror techniques are used. Plus most of what made the original movie is also there, updated a little in terms of current movie-making technique (ie. more blood), but otherwise as one would expect.And that's the problem. It brings nothing new to the table. Even Jackie Earle Haley, an actor who I greatly respect for his work in Little Children and Watchmen, can't add anything of any great significance to the depiction of Freddie Krueger (admittedly he is hamstrung by a facial prosthetic which is particularly unhelpful to facial acting, and Freddie's backstory, an area where he could have added an additional dimension to the character, is skipped through so fast you nearly miss it).The kids are no more than slaughter fodder. The only one I had ever heard of is Kyle Gallner who, by virtue of the number of places where he pops up, must really appeal to casting directors although he really irritates me.This is adequate, but no better than that.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
24,ferguson-6,Cuz Fred is Dead,6,8 May 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, if you are seeking cinematic genius, no need to check this one out. On the other hand, if you enjoy a good scare, a creepy story and a really messed up bad guy ... the latest reincarnation of Freddy Kreuger may be just what you have been dreaming of.The list of Elm Street alums is pretty impressive: Johnny Depp, John Saxon, Laurence Fishbourne, Patricia Arquette and of course, Robert Englund. Sadly, the new one only gives us a bunch of mid-20's types as high schoolers (yes, STILL a pet peeve of mine), though Kate Cassidy is the daughter of former pop star David Cassidy, and Rooney Mara is Kate's sister. Kyle Gallner and Thomas Dekker are familiar enough and wear sufficient bleary-eyed make-up to help us forget their real ages.Of course, the real stars here are Freddy and the dream sequences. We get a decent enough scrip without the total camp of the later Elm Street films. The first time director is Samuel Bayer, who made his name as a video director. His eye for visual effects and camera shots is a plus here. I really enjoyed some of the spectacular individual shots, even if the overall flow was a bit choppy.Wes Craven's original creation lives on through the fine work of Jackie Earle Haley as Mr. Kreuger. Many will remember Jackie Earle as the dirt bike riding center fielder in the first ""Bad News Bears"". He is all grown up now and experiencing a really nice career revival. He possesses the necessary creep factor to pull off this nastiest of nightmares.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Director Samuel Bayer stays as consistent with the original as possible by avoiding a huge body count and going for character. Rooney Mara plays Nancy who learns of the history of Freddy Kruger and why he is targeting herself and various friends within their nightmares. Kyle Gallner plays her friend Quentin who uses pills to remain awake. He and Nancy attempt to team up in an effort to pull Krueger into reality where his power will be limited. Katie Cassidy plays a classmate who becomes an early target after initial investigating into a previous murder. She will become the famous bedroom kill where her body shifts aimlessly about the room. Thomas Dekker plays her boyfriend who witnessed the bizarre murder and is arrested. Strangely enough his nightmare murder is not the same as that in the original. Why the change is not given. Not all ends well for these teenagers as Krueger gets to them with only Nancy able to spar off in the end. Jackie Earle Haley takes over the role that made Robert Englund famous and his version of Freddy seems darker or more sinister. The special effects are updated with the latest CGI and despite their effective translation, they lack the originality given the Wes Craven version where it was a landmark. Not as good as the original, which still remains a notch above the imitators, but still a worthy visual update. Score: 7 / 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Far better remake than expected,8,17 September 2012,"When a group of teens find themselves victims of the same recurring nightmare about a deranged serial killer, they realize there's more going on than their parents are willing to admit and battle him to be able to sleep again.Though there's some good stuff here, this one isn't as good as the original. What really helps here is with the trips into the nightmare world being incredibly well-done and being far more frightening in concept and execution than expected, starting with the opening attack at the diner and the jail-cell dream that lures him down into the boiler room for a rather chilling encounter. There's also the freak-out in the school where the one falls asleep and is chased through the school playing a demented version of hide-and-seek along the way through the halls before confronting the stranger in the classroom, a spectacular confrontation in the aisles of a supermarket and the big, final chase around the boiler room at the end which instills the full ramifications of their previous are put to the test here in rather freaky encounters which was a nice touch. As well, there's some that outdid the original without much difficulty, including the attack on the girlfriend which gets much more impressive actually going up to the ceiling and delivering a greater, more dynamic kill here as well, the bathtub scene is a lot of fun and there's a greater and more pronounced back-story revelation here to fully explain the origins of Freddy which goes for the explanation quite nicely along to really explain what's happening here. Some didn't work, either being too short to mean anything or simply just being there to pay homage to the original but most did and it worked rather well when it kept itself in that world, the kills were good and bloody and the story kept moving throughout here which has more than enough positives here to hold it up as it does have some major problems. The biggest issue here is the fact that Freddy really doesn't look as scary as he should have, as for some reason, especially around the mouth and lips, he doesn't evoke a sense of fear and looks more like a skinned pup-seal rather than a burned human. The make-up needed a lot of work, and relies more on his actions to really sell the fear. Almost as likely here is the being-a-remake that makes this one supposedly scary and it really does take a lot out of this one. Another problem here is the fact that the investigation into Freddy occurs so late into the film, making it seem like the revelation of him being a pedophile as a big shocker comes out of nowhere since it really didn't have much wrong with the pedophile angle, but we don't know anything at all about what's going on at the time, and it's only once we know that when we get into the rest of the back-story that it's really cleaned up, which leaves it a little disjointed. The other flaw with that apart is the actual killer's motive here, since the action was justified in what happened to him, and the connection to the dream world had nothing to do with his actions so there's little possible reason here for him to do what he does here as there's little here that makes sense. Overall, it's much better than expected, though it still has some flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, strong themes of child abuse and children-in-jeopardy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
27,FlashCallahan,i'm your boyfriend now....,6,26 June 2010,"Death stalks the dreams of several young adults to claim its revenge on the killing of Freddy Krueger. Chased and chastised by this finger-bladed demon, it is the awakening of old memories and the denials of a past of retribution that spurns this hellish vision of a dreamlike state and turns death into a nightmare reality....So it's another remake of an old horror classic. And so what? I am one of these rare people who couldn't care less if an old classic is remade. it doesn't affect my life in anyway, and if the trailer looks half decent, I will give the movie a go.So the film isn't great. But the addition of Haley, instead of some hulk of a man in the feet of Freddy, is a good move. He isn't a patch on Englund, but he makes the film watchable. Bay has a knack of really irritating fan-people in remaking classics, but these people still go and pay good money to see what he has churned out.Anyway, back to the film. It's not the best film out there, but to put a back-story into the film, makes it that little more watchable than others, because the killer has reason to go after the teens, rather than the dream just being the major part.The actors are not up to scratch, but the support is excellent, especially Brown, who is quite restraint compared to other roles.The editing is good, i was expecting flashy, fast cuts, but it wasn't like that at all, and while it did hark back to the original in a few scenes, it made the film on it's own.If this was an original idea for a movie, thid would have bombed, no doubt.But Bay, genius that he is, has made a really cult film for the 2010, made it average, and has got angry fan-people to turn it into a profit.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
28,Aaron1375,Did not hate this nightmare as much as I thought I would.,5,7 December 2010,"Not saying this was a particularly good remake, but it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. However, make no mistake no one can top Robert England as Freddy, throughout this movie I kept thinking that it was not all that bad, but it would have been so much better had England simply returned once again. Haley was not as horrible as I was led to believe, but he just was not as sinister in the role. There was something more creepy about England's laugh, the way he talked and though this is not Haley's fault the makeup was better in the original as well. This one has the usual formula of teens having trouble with a recurring nightmare featuring a burned man with stripped sweater and knives on his fingers. When he strikes them there wounds appear in the waking world and if he kills you, you are dead in real life. They have some instances of really doing the same thing from the original such as a death where the girl shoots up to the ceiling and a bathtub scene, but for the most part a lot of the stuff is new. Including a strange twist where they make one question if Freddy was wrongly killed. The film moves kind of slowly in places and I was feeling it was a bit tedious until the end where I thought it picked up the pace and became more enjoyable. Some good kills here and there, but once again the use of a computer instead of simple makeup or nice blood packs deters from this movie as it does from nearly every movie made these days. I will never understand why filmmakers have become so lazy and would rather use a computer than good old fashioned splat. I mean the computer would be fine if it looked real, but it always has the look of not being there to me. There is also no nudity, that made me sad too. Though with all the negatives, I still found it having some interesting stuff in it. Like I said this was not as bad as I was expecting, it was not good mind you just not all that bad.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I think Jackie Earle Haley works well as creepy Freddy Krueger and I like the more realistic tone, which some say makes the movie bland and boring. Rooney Mara (Nancy) and Kyle Gallner (Quentin) are decent as the main protagonists and I think the bedroom scene is superior to the same attack scene in the original; it's more shocking. The prison scene's great too.Unfortunately, the concept of Freddy is a bit of a mess. For instance, his bladed-glove is never explained. And what was the point of the boiler room since he was just a gardener at a small preschool? The filmmakers just threw in these elements because it's Freddy, figuring people knew the character. But how do these components fit into THIS movie? And what about viewers who never saw the original flicks?The film runs 1 hours, 35 minutes and was shot in northern Illinois and nearby Gary, Indiana, with reshoots done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-/C+",A Nightmare on Elm Street

So I was influenced by the reactions and thought, well, it's going to be a real nightmare. Still, I don't really know what to think about it. It's a bit of a prequel and a bit of the best off of the original flick. The bed scene with the blood, the hand coming out of the water in a bath. The movie on his own wasn't that bad, there is a bit of a storyline in it but of course the best off is a bit too much to take. The one-liners by Freddy aren't really convincing and his face was a bit of a let down too. Some killings were really enjoyable but sadly some blood is CGI, Watch the killing of mummy at the end, pure CGI and a real failure. You can easily spot that the blood was CGI. Another thing, the bad scene, here we only see the girl naked from the back. In times like these it's normal to show some tits.

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A Nightmare on Elm Street,5,7 June 2010,"Michael Bay has probably developed a strange fetish for wanting to recreate, reimagine or just plain want to remake every classic horror film out there, taking its icons and trying to craft something new and just as enduring. From the Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Friday the 13th's Jason, he now turns his gunsights to Wes Craven's A Nightmare of Elm Street with the irrepressible Freddy Krueger, played to perfection and stereotyping Robert Englund in what would be the role he's best remembered for, with that disfigured face, hat, claw-like gloves and a wicked (pardon the pun) sense of humour, being the ghoul that haunts one's dreams, living in another parallel where he's lord and king over the sleeper.Director Samuel Bayer's version begins his series in the thick of the action in a diner, where we see a young chap Dean (Kellan Lutz) being sleep deprived for three days before finally succumbing to Freddy's dominance in his dreamworld. One by one a group of teens fall into their slumber and to their deaths, and it's up to Nancy (Rooney Mara) and Quentin (Kyle Gallner) to figure out how the sins of their parents, and of their repressed memories of their childhood, all play a part in the recent gory deaths of their high school friends.Which will leave the fan wondering, just exactly what sort of reimagination goes on here. There's really nothing new to add to the established mythos, and there's actually little point in trying to revive a film whose icon has spawned countless of films to varying degrees of success. Moreover, compared to Robert Englund's turn, Jackie Earle Haley seemed to be rehashing an amalgam of his previous roles from Little Children and Shutter Island, and unfortunately, his makeup and wardrobe as Freddie projected less of a real menace than it should. As an origin film we cannot stray away from the retelling of how Freddie came about, but stopped short of how it took so long before managing to exact revenge, probably it really takes that long for mastery of the dreamworld complete with snazzy looking special effects.But of course I'm not dissing Haley's performance because there's really only so much he can do with such a weak story, though his Krueger seemed to have lost his sense of humour until late in the show. Other than that, his iconic character suffered less drastic changes than say, other Hollywood needless remakes such as Clash of the Titans. Gore is kept to a minimum, with the body count for a horror film surprisingly kept very low. Bayer also didn't break any new ground in the generation of scares, dipping his hand into tried and tested, though cliché and unimaginative techniques of sudden turns and loud music to try to make you jump in your seat, until it becomes really boring as every upcoming scare got preempted by its impatient musical bars that come on too early.One thing's for sure, the sequel for this rebirth has already been greenlit and set in motion, and going by the way this film ended there's no prize for guessing just who else is next on Freddy Krueger's hit list. I still bear the slightest hope that films should not be remade just for the sake of, especially when they don't offer anything new nor innovative, and come across as just another bagful of rehashed elements that don't add value to the mythos. Now that's the real nightmare for an audience in watching something on repeat with deja vu elements being touted as something unique.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
32,StevePulaski,Freddy Returns....After Going Through Puberty.,5,3 July 2010,"One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better make no more. Five, six, reviews for this were mixed. Seven, eight, all fans did was hate. Nine, ten, never come again.It's been seven years since Freddy made an appearance on the big screen with other Horror icon Jason Voorhees, and has been sixteen years since Freddy starred in a movie of his own. Back in 1994 he was in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. This time the villain returns to give us a remake of the classic 1984 film of the same name. I guess the moral could be ""Same name, different game"".Freddy Krueger has never been one of my favorite Horror slashers. He is third behind Chucky, and my all time favorite, Jason Voorhees. Still, when I heard a remake for this was coming. Couldn't say I was shocked, though could say I wasn't happy. I must agree with Roger Ebert, just say goodnight Freddy. I'm not going to restate the plot of the movie once more. I think we all know what happens. A group of teens are haunted in their sleep by Freddy Krueger. If they die in the dream world, they die in real life. Oops, I did it again. It may seem like the same old thing again, but oh no, Freddy returns yes, but he is portrayed for the first time, by someone new. Jackie Early Haley takes the hat and sweater away from Robert Englund and plays the killer poorly. Everything about the ""New Freddy"" is butchered. The comebacks are dry, the voice is abysmal, and the appearance of the killer is disappointing and unappealing. I feel like I'm watching a five year old kid's view of the movie. His face resembles more of an actual burn victim, but the CGI hole in his cheek ruins the whole image. As you can see. His nose is a bit more of a triangle and doesn't protrude out like the former character. Take a look at the resemblance for yourself. Even the voice is enhanced way to much. It sounds like Batman from The Dark Knight. Some parts of the film were scary, but nothing really stunned me. No kill in the entire movie made me the slightest bit shocked. A scene or two made me flinch, but thats only because of the classic ""fake scare"" BS thats been overused since the damn Hitchcock era. Michael Bay, who worked on remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th, gives his same lackluster and dull intention here with A Nightmare on Elm Street. The only thing that could possibly make this mess worse was if it was in 3D. Along with the bad Freddy, the character design in dreadful. The ""high school"" kids, look and are in their thirties. Whoever thought that they resembled sixteen year olds has a bad eye. The flaws with this movie, could be dug into for two full threads (120,000 words/spaces in total). But it's just not worth it. No one expected this movie to surpass the 1984 film. So digging and de-gutting the flaws aren't worth the wasted typing/Carpal Tunnel. The movie doesn't live up to the original, but in the remake gradebook. It's entertaining and mildly passable. But in ""The Avoid Files it shall go and stay.Starring: Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, and Katie Cassidy. Directed by: Samuel Bayer.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,"1... 2... Freddy's coming for you. 3... 4... crap, we've seen this before!",2,1 May 2010,"So, now we've got to be done, every classic slasher movie has been remade: Halloween, Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes you get the idea. Now we have Nightmare on Elm Street. Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea, I actually don't mind remakes for the most part. Like a remake of a song, I want a different twist. Yeah, Hollywood has lost it's originality, but that's bound to happen as the years go on. Plus now that it's been over 20 years since the original Nightmare, it wouldn't hurt for a reboot and to re-introduce the story to the new generation who didn't have the pleasure of knowing the classic. Well, unfortunately, with all the potential that this Nightmare could have had, it fell flat playing one note over and over again. We are introduced to several teenagers, don't know who they are really, it starts off immediately with them having nightmares, getting killed and I really didn't care, you know why? Because we don't know them! The original the group felt like a tight clan that really looked out for each other, this one I just didn't care about them. Also the girl who played Nancy, Rooney Mara has one of the dullest performances of the year, where I didn't understand why a guy would have a crush on her or why anyone would want to be her friend. The film takes itself way too seriously and that was one of the main problems with the film.While at a local diner Dean Russell falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a red and green sweater and a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat. Kris, his girlfriend, begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. With her friends dying, a young girl named Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Eventually, Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them, including more children, attended the same preschool together. Nancy and Quentin, who both begin sporadically dreaming while they are awake as a result of insomnia, decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can about Krueger and how to stop him before it's too late for them too.One thing I did like about the film was the little twist of not knowing for a little while if Freddy Krueger was a bad guy or not. But even Freddy was not scary to me, his make up looked like a lion that had down syndrome and I couldn't take it seriously. I couldn't take his dialog seriously and nothing about this film was scary, at least to me. It fell into the typical cliché JUMP scenes where they add a loud noise just for the sake of it. This film plays like kid has nightmares, kid dies, kid has nightmares, kid dies, and you get the idea. Also it was extremely unbelievable how the kids pretty much accept that they're having the same nightmares where a guy is trying to kill them and if they die in their dreams, they die for real. They accept it like they just found an extra 20 dollars in their pockets, I'm sorry, but I would question my sanity first before just saying ""oh, hey, a guy will kill me in my dreams and I'll die for real"". Nightmare had a ton of potential to be a great remake, the concept is terrifying, so if given a fair chance, this could have been scary and an awesome reboot, but instead falls flat with a lousy script, horrible acting, bad effects, a boring cast and a lame atmosphere. I'd say skip this lame remake, just stick with the original.2/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

35,Hellmant,Comparing the two performances is like comparing that of Heath Ledger's 'Joker' to Jack Nicholson's!,9,14 October 2010,"'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Fan favorite Jackie Earl Haley takes over one of the most popular and infamously famous villains in movie history, 'Freddy Kruger', in this surprisingly faithful re-imagining of arguably the greatest slasher film of all time 'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET'. If you're a fan of the franchise you know the story: a child molester (in the original film he was a child killer) named Fred Kruger (Haley) is hunted down and burned alive by the vigilante mob justice of the parents of all his victims. He returns to life in the dreams of his young victims, now teenagers, and gets revenge by driving them mad through their worst nightmares and killing them (most commonly using his most notorious weapon, a glove made up of blades attached to his fingers).The movie is so faithful to it's inspiration that some scenes are almost exact imitations of the greatest images from the original. It's just that now they're done with a bigger budget and taking advantage of all the advances in modern special effects and film technology; It's as if Craven pulled a George Lucas and went back to polish up his classic with all the new tools of today (except that these updates are all definite improvements). The film is astonishingly directed by music video veteran Samuel Bayer and very imaginatively written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer (a couple of experienced horror writers). The story is pretty faithful to Craven's original but there are a few changes, which are all improvements in my opinion (like making Kruger an accused child molester who was executed without a trial or jury on unproven accusations from children, the added mystery of that is a creepy and disturbing touch in my opinion). Haley is the most perfect possible replacement to the great Robert Englund and is arguably an even better 'Freddy Kruger', but comparing the two performances is like comparing that of Heath Ledger's 'Joker' to Jack Nicholson's. Haley's 'Kruger' is a much more viscous, scary and disturbing monster and the entire film is like a genuinely real 'nightmare' depicted on screen; that's about the best compliment you can pay a horror movie.The acting, dialog and character drama of the film are all topnotch; gone is all the campy 'B' humor that the original's sequels loathed in, this is a serious hardcore nightmare! It's everything the fans want and have been waiting for, unlike some other remakes. If you're a big fan of the 'Kruger' character and his mythology you definitely won't be disappointed. This film surpasses the original on every possible level, still it is more impressive to make something that works from scratch rather than just improving on something that already worked. That's why this film will never be quite as classic or respected as the original. Still it's about as good as a remake could possibly be.

36,thesar-2,Wes Craven's Brand New Nightmare,1,1 May 2010,"Finally! The untold story of Freddy Kruger's ""slow"" brother, Frankie. I know they don't make a big deal about this revolution, but since this is NOT the real Freddy, it must be his mentally retarded sibling, Frankie.2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street was 99% a complete waste of film. I'll give it that 1% for maybe one jump (of dozens planned) and a lot of great laughs. And no, I'm not referring to Freddy's sense of humor.Where to begin? Ah, at the beginning. Such as, let's change the whole premise on why Freddy's stalking these kids in their dreams. Let's change the house. Let's change Freddy's voice and look, a la Frankie. Let's keep the first name of Nancy and change her last. (Why?? Ah, never mind.) Let's change the fact the original and throughout the series, the idea was to show a heroine with some depth.Okay, fine, they wanted a newer version of the 26-year-old story. Did they need to? Nope. Could they have done a fantastic job. Absolutely. They made the same mistake with 1998's Godzilla. If you combined the budget of both series' original features, you could probably just pay for the posters of the updates and still the remakes couldn't come within 3,000 miles of the talent of their predecessors.Overshadowing the weak story were the horribly thin characters and even worse acting. All around bad acting, but the winner of the Keanu Reeves Protégé Award is Rooney Mara, ""Nancy (why the new last name) Holbrook."" She had two emotions: One with her eyes open, awake and one with her eyes closed, asleep. She literally made me laugh out loud throughout the entire feature. And why they even bothered to call her ""Nancy"" is beyond me. Aside from changing her last name, the only other similarity was she had a single mom. And even Mom changed from being an alcoholic to being a doctor. Why? What the fudge does anyone care? Back to the other characters. Bleah. In the original, and for most of the original series' sequels, you actually cared about the obvious victims. You got to know them and learned of their personalities. Here, they might as well been in a Friday the 13th sequel where the kids were literal cardboard waiting to be sliced by Jason. I mean, you learn one used to date another, and another has a crush on Nancy – again, I can't help but laugh on how bad she was. Seriously, Heather Langenkamp can't act too well, but you still cared for her and her plight.I admit I grew up on the original series, and watch them from #1 to Freddy Vs. Jason all the time, yet, I never really found them scary. Campy, funny, interesting, had a great score and sometimes had equally great soundtrack. This had the opportunity to be scary. To be dark. To improve on the score, or at least mirror it. This accomplished none of those. I did the inevitable countdown, 3-2-1 and poof!, there's Freddy. (Okay, I missed it by 2 counts ONE time in the movie, but got all the other 15 predictable ""frights"" down pat.) The score was terrible and there were no real songs that I could remember.In addition, it was not interesting; I found myself caring even less as more of the ""new"" myth on Freddy came to light. It had some regurgitated lines/scenes from the series that seemed like they were added only for fans and not for the plot. Also, I understand Freddy really wasn't meant to be funny as he became as the original series progressed. But this one was downright depressing on how bland he was. Word to the director: While just about anyone could wear a hockey mask, there can be only one Freddy. Heck, why not remake The Silence of the Lambs with Ben Stein as Hannibal Lecter? (Actually, PLEASE don't.) Generally by this part of my review I've already given the synopsis. Honestly, it would be a spoiler to reveal it, but suffice to say, it's a 180 from the original and it just doesn't work. I even had problems with the 2009 remake of Friday the 13th (2009), but still rated it oodles of degrees higher than this piece of crap. They need to pull a Hulk and reboot this again, but this time hire writers.Final thoughts: Ironically, they include the original's line ""Don't fall asleep"" because you'll have a very hard time staying awake in this boring film. Waitmaybe that's Freddy's plan. So, I guess I'll say: SKIP IT!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
37,Robert_duder,The next Horror Franchise to make a brilliant remake...read on,8,6 May 2010,"Is there a classic slasher/horror film that hasn't been remade in the last ten years? Very few. As an enormous horror/slasher fan it hasn't been a bad thing hardly at all. The exception might Rob Zombies sub par remake of Halloween but consider the truly amazing rebirths of Friday the 13th, Amityville Horror, Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes, The Ring (if you count that.) So I was absolutely pumped about bringing this to life. I even thought that the replacement of the irreplaceable Robert Englund as Freddy might actually work. Not all of the horror 'remakes' were true remakes. Friday the 13th was ultimately another sequel as opposed to a remake, but Nightmare on Elm Street is a true remake in every sense of the word. The film makers redid and paid homage to some of the truly great scenes in the original film, paid homage to every version of Freddy that Englund gave us over two decades from the scary and twisted to the slapstick and funny but never over did the latter given many fans are embittered by the progression of Freddy Kreuger throughout the films. The movie is twisted, dark, bloody, freaky and spends more time in Freddy's dream world than ever before. It is every horror fan's hope for a remake. That doesn't make it perfect...but I'll get to that.I actually had really solid expectations for Jackie Earle Haley. He looked the part, he sounded the part and I thought he would fill some very big shoes just fine and he does. The problem is, and the problem many will have is that he's not Robert Englund. You just see Freddy and you think...that's not Freddy, that's some other dude. That is the problem with an iconic character. Still he is brilliant and freaky and has some absolutely incredible lines. In true slasher style the film is full of young hot stars who could have promising careers ahead of them. Most of them, as a TV fan, I was already familiar with. Katie Cassidy (Melrose Place 2009), is the eye candy and scream queen for the film. She actually plays more of a significant role than 'Nancy' really. Cassidy does a solid job and keeps us interested in the story. The only awkward part was the lack of chemistry between her Thomas Dekker. That being said Dekker gives a solid performance. I loved him as John Connor in the TV version of Terminator and I think he has a big career ahead of him. He is perhaps one of the best performances in the film. Rooney Mara simply wasn't the right choice for Nancy. At least not the Nancy we all know from the original film. Mara's Nancy is a dark, and twisted soul with an 'emo' feel to her. She does alright but she mumbles and stumbles her way through what should have been a much more recognized performance. Kyle Gallner (CSI NY) does a good job as well. He's very baby faced and it's almost hard to believe him as a near adult amongst the rest of the cast but he is a good enough actor to root for him and I wouldn't hate to see him come back in the future.You will find a lot of fan boys that hate this remake and anyone knows that fan boys will find anything wrong with something trying to recreate what they love. I've heard that the back story is not accurate on Freddy...well it's a reboot? It's a remake? Why does it have to follow every bit of the original detail. It's not perfect, the cast is not amazing but the original cast wasn't exactly academy award winners either....yah yah I know Johnny Depp. The film balances cheap scares (noises and things popping out) with a genuine feel of terror. It even tries to make you feel something for Freddy throughout the film until you discover the truth. Remakes will almost certainly always have their annoyances and certain things about performances by Haley, and Mara in particular bothered me but it was still a screaming rip roaring good time. Very clever writing paid the perfect respect to Craven and director Samuel Bayer turned out to be an exception when it comes to music directors trying the big screen. He tells a solid story and knows how to make your skin crawl. I hope Nightmare 2010 brings Freddy back for another two decades!! 8.5/10 One of the best lines of the year from Haley's Kreuger ""Did you know after your heart stops your brain can continue for 7 minutes? That means we have six minutes to play""",A Nightmare on Elm Street
38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not a ground breaking success, but still a praise worthy re-imagining of an original classic",7,7 June 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Like it or loathe it, we're in the grip of Recession Hollywood and as such, remakes are the order of the day. Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery, the classics with the large fan bases will tend to be the ones getting the remake makeover, as it were. After a series of sequels and spin offs, Wes Craven's original 1984 horror flick A Nightmare on Elm Street has been remade and set in modern times and given a slicker make over at the hands of former music video director Samuel Bayer. There's doubtless an army of loyal fans and aficionados of the original, hellbent on slaying it at all costs and harping on about how it'll never hold up to the original, which in many ways it won't. But Bayer's film has some distinctive and effective touches of it's own that hold it up perfectly on it's own.Somehow, a far darker and more disturbing tone is established, even with Krueger still ripping off the odd one liner and creative dream sequence. This is in no small part owed to Krueger being re-established as a creepy child molester as well as killer, and his facial prosthetics looking more like that of a real burns victim than the 'pizza face' look of before. In this sense, Jackie Earle Haley is an excellent choice for the role, making this kind of role his speciality. Most of the 'teens in peril' are pretty interchangeable and unmemorable after the thing is over, despite the various 'inventive deaths' that befall them. But the jump scenes and general blood letting and unpleasantness are kept re-assuringly high, with Bayer never letting any of it become too much style over substance.This is Krueger with a new actor and in the hands of a new director, taking the NOES story in a whole new direction and in a whole new style. To many, it will never hold up to Wes Craven's original creation and in many ways it is the inferior film. But for the first film in the new series of them, this has some highly praise worthy plus points of it's own. ***",A Nightmare on Elm Street

This new guy didn't have a creepy enough voice and the make up wasn't as good. Plus they change Freddy's background story in this remake. You can't do that.In case you lived in a cave, the plot to this is teens are stalked in their dreams by Kruger and if you die in your dream, you die in real life. So teens start getting picked off one by one and it's up to Quentin and Nancy to figure out how to end it before they end up dead.The movie wasn't scary and lacked a lot of ""jumps"" that you expect in horror movies.

These movies were hardly sacred ground, but do WORSE with ten times the budget takes a particular amount of incompetence.Even if you can turn a blind eye to the awful CGI and cardboard characters, the fact that Robert Englund has passed the baton to Jackie Earl Haley makes this an utterly joyless experience. No offense, to Haley, who is a fine actor, but to re-cast Englund is just wrong. Robert Englund IS Freddy. He's not just a silent killer in the vein of Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. Freddy was a character, a personality, a face (albeit an ugly one) and as far as I am concerned Englund is the only person on the face of the Earth who can do this role. Anyone else...just isn't right.The cast of teenage meat fails to engage (though Kyle Gallner manages to rise above the pathetic script). The actors are just way, way too old to convincingly play teenagers. And Rooney Mara, who plays lead heroin Nancy, is a vacuum of personality. I've never seen a more blank and expressionless actress in my life. She barely even blinks! I dread to think what she is going to make of Lisbeth Salander.The dream scenes themselves are, fittingly, yawn-fests. How many more endless 'Freddy's boiler room' sequences must we put up with.

44,Bored_Dragon,"Good, but totally unneeded",7,14 November 2018,"Technically, this movie is probably better than the original, but it lacks soul. Horrors of the '80s had a specific charm that no modern technology could replace. This film is good in every respect, but it's neither terrifying nor mesmerizing. It is trying to compensate the lack of truly dreadful atmosphere with quality effects and really great jump-scares, but that simply isn't enough for a great horror. It lacks fantasy atmosphere. It is too realistic and even dream sequences are not dream-like. The cast is good, but although it may be better than original cast, I just couldn't embrace them. I don't know if Jackie Earle Haley is a better actor than Robert Englund, but I like him better anyway, but still, Englund is better Freddy. Maybe Haley would have been better Freddy if he played this role from the start, but after 25 years of identifying with Krueger Englund definitely became irreplaceable in this role. However good Haley may be, believe me, Freddy not being Englund will bother you. As I'm currently following the ""Arrow"", it was hard for me to stop looking at Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance, and all the time one part of my mind was waiting for Oliver Queen to appear and fill Freddy with arrows. Her death was copied from the first film but, although the effects are great, it was not nearly effective as the most powerful scene from the original movie. There are also John Connor from ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", a vampire from ""The Twilight Saga"", as well as legendary Mr. Crabs, the arch-enemy of Highlander and Superman.Overall, this is a quite good remake, but if you can watch the brilliant original from 1984, why would you watch something that is just fine and without Johnny Depp...7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
45,ironhorse_iv,This movie is indeed a nightmare. A nightmare to watch. It's so bad!,4,21 September 2014,"One, two, Freddy's coming for you, Three, four, better lock your door, Five, six, grab your crucifix, Seven, eight, gonna stay up late, Nine, ten, never sleep again. Directed by Samuel Bayer, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film of the same name, which revolves around a group of teenagers who are being stalked in their dreams by an enigmatic man named Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley). You know that production for the film is heading the wrong way, when Craven expressed his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film, unlike with the 2009 remake The Last House on the Left where he help the film toward production. Indeed, without Wes Craven's blessing or help, 2010, A Nightmare on Elm Street felt like a bad cash-in on the Slasher flicks of the early 80s. It was given little thought, and felt like a waste of time, watching, as the film didn't give much to hook the audience, in. How could they go wrong? Freddy Krueger is a horror icon. The film series is a unique blend of darkly comic and horror with a great premise – the monster is the ghost of a murdered pedophile who kills children/young adults in their sleep. It's a terrifying notion! The reasons why this movie fail is very clear. First off, the direction, the movie doesn't do much of anything new to the series. Yes, it's nice to see, Freddy Krueger's backstory, but is it really what fans really wanted to see?! NO! The reason, why, Freddy Krueger got popular was how supernatural, he was. He was like the devil. To make him seem human, is eliminating the scare factor from his mythology. This film marks the first time Freddy has not been portrayed by Robert Englund. While, Jackie Earle Haley plays Freddy Krueger in a decent performance, but his character has little to no charisma. It's not his fault, but the direction of the studio. He would forever, be overshadow by Robert Englund in this way. I know, for the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, but it's like ripping away the reasons why he became so popular in the first place. People love the dark humor, and one-liners. I'm glad, they didn't use campy liners, here, but the whole movie lacks a lot of entertaining values. His voice sounds a bit off, as if it was recorded and voice over post-production. It doesn't have that much of a menace feel to it. The make-up is a step down when the 1980s versions. He looks a burn gerbil face. It's really off-putting, not in a good way. The teenagers in the film are a little more memorable as they're more likable than your typical mean-spirited disposable teenagers of the past movies. The film generally remains close to the origin of Freddy and the overall events of the original film, though it does make some superficial changes to both. Nothing too major to stand out of its own. It really felt like re-hash retelling of familiar scenes sequences. It's a shame, that they didn't do much to make it, look differ than the other film. Still, there was an interesting swerve with the victims that was pretty interesting. Remind me of 1996's Scream where they killed off protagonists at the start, so you follow other victims. The special effects were hit and misses. There were some good examples of good special effects like the blood exploding, but others like Freddy coming through the bedroom wallpaper looked particularly cheap. They really did miss the entire concept of the franchise. The best part of the Freddy's nightmare scenario is that his victims don't know if they're asleep or not. Freddy intentionally melds the dream and real world in the victim's mind. In this new room, they have a visual cue – green/orange lights flicker, telling you the victim is dreaming that really kill the suspense for the film. The film overly relies on shock-horror, not actual scares or atmosphere. Lots of jump scenes to the point that they're pretty worn-out and obvious. There is little to no suspense, so shock horror really dies out, here. The new music by Steve Jablonsky isn't that good. It does good to set one the eerie atmosphere, but the film score sound so genetic or trying to retune the original. The theme should had the creepy touch of a nursery rhyme, but in Freddy's school it's always naptime. There is no way to keep these teens wholly safe, and the music is the marriage of the innocent and the nihilistic, increasing the goosebumps for the longer you listen. Sadly, this theme is lacking that. Still, I did like the creepy version of ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"" by the Everly Brothers. Overall: This film has very little redeeming qualities. It defines a cash-grab on a famous franchise. It's such a wasted opportunity, with today's special effects. Horror fans deserve better. Avoid, unless you want to be really disappointed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

49,filipemanuelneto,"Worse than being unnecessary, this remake is disposable.",1,8 May 2021,"For those who have seen and enjoyed the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise, making a remake is, in itself, a redundant and disposable idea. Making a remake just because there are other kinds of special and visual effects without being able to be a little better than the original is a mistake.The film begins with the deaths of two teenagers and the heroine fully convinced that there is something terrible happening, and that it kills them without them wanting to. Of course, for us there is no secret: it is Freddy Krueger who, through their dreams, is taking his revenge on those who killed him, years ago. The script, thus, recycles the story of the original franchise, without adding anything innovative or doing better. In fact, the film even copies entire scenes from the first film, reinforcing the lazy and uninteresting aspect that the film takes on.The cast is led by Jackie Earle Haley, who replaces Robert Englund in the role of the steel glove villain... but the truth is that there is no love like the first, and Englund will forever be the ideal actor for the role. In fact, Samuel Bayer should surely be dreaming (or having nightmares) when he allowed the writers to give Haley such bad material, where the character is so mistreated. Without any seriousness or ability to intimidate, Krueger is a ghost of the character he was in the opening film. The rest of the cast does not stand out: it does what it has to do on characters who are nothing more than smoke figures, with no personality or any striking feature. Rooney Mara is the most resonant name, but she looks like an alien here, not quite knowing what she does or why she is really here.Technically, it is an uninteresting film at all levels, clearly starting with Haley's bad makeup: it manages to be less realistic than a Carnival or Halloween rubber mask. The standard cinematography and the poor editing, with a series of badly placed and untimely cuts, also do not help, but the bad sound and the misuse of sound effects was what tired me the most: the film has more squeaks than an oil-free door and tries its hardest to use sound to make the audience jump in the chair, a feature that horror has used until exhaustion due to the director's inability to work with the atmosphere and tension. Krueger's voice also seems anything but authentic and frightening. The costumes and sets are fine, but they can't save the movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
50,leplatypus,Not the final cut (Screen),1,11 June 2010,"I don't really understand the point of this movie. What's the use of making a remake if it's worst than the original? Take Freddy for example: when you see his face, 20 years later of special effect, you laugh! For a comparison, take ""Star Wars"": between Episode III and Episode I, you can tell that something happened in movies. Here, i don't find a quantum of creativity.Well, the movie has been a huge disappointment: the cast is awful, the directing flat, no soundtrack In addition, there isn't any drama because the movie is just a dull collage of murders! Each new character introduced will be slashed in the following half hour! Thus, it explains the talent of Wes Craven!I recall that Freddy was the first brand of horror movie in my teen years and the movies were fun: scary but attracting. I watched them on VHS tapes and even one at the screen very long ago! Maybe such a character worths to be discovered by the new generation but let's release the old movies: it would be better!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

53,insomniac_rod,Could've been a great addition to the series.,8,26 June 2010,"I'm a die hard fan of the series. I'm used to remakes. Heck, what can we do? It's not like the classics are going anywhere else. So what can we do? Nothing. Just watch or not watch the remakes.This is almost a scene-to-scene remake without anything really memorable or original to add. We get some watered down death scenes that were great in the original. For example, Kris's death (Tina in the original) was very lame.We all know the story. We know the character's fates. Only this time it's brought in a gorier manner. Loved the throat slashing, stabbings, beatings, and more.At some points this feels grindhouse (when Freddy is looking after Nancy who is hiding in the closet) and very dark but then it brings us to the reality: it's a modern remake. It offers 2000's clichés, some lame dialogs, but overall, it feels like this new dimension of the ANOES franchise is going somewhere.The worst thing were the CHEESY CGi effects. Come on! Some of them are very cheap, in the likes of ""Exorcist: The Beginning"". We want a suspenseful story, violent death scenes, we are tired of jump out of your seat moments. The characters were darker this time and we could get a little more from their past. I liked the flashback sequence explained during a nightmare when we learn that the kids ""were everything"" for Fred Krueger. And then the shocking moment when we learn that he truly molested them.The acting is very good. Jackie Earle Haley did a great Freddy. My only complaint is that he didn't know when to be 100% dark and when throw the silly one-liners. Still, he was very good. Kyle Gallner works very good as the suffering hero with the always sad puppy face. Rooney Mara is too hot to be true. She has this next door girl look that makes her very pretty. I enjoyed her face and looks but I felt her acting was wooden. She looked disturbed and pale but didn't express much more. Katie Kassidy is one of the most ""blah"" actresses I've seen. She didn't add anything to the movie. Clancy Brown owns every single scene he appears on.The Direction is slick and dynamic. Very 2000's. The settings were creepy and looked really great. The score is great. Loved the ""dark"" tone on music on the important situations.This is almost a carbon copy remake with feels very modern but doesn't manages to be better than the original.

Nancy (Mara) and her friends, Kris (Cassidy), Quentin (Gallner), Jesse (Dekker) and Dean (Lutz) are teens who live on Elm Street. They begin having nightmares about a mysterious, burned fiend (Haley) stalking them. After Kris, Jesse and Dean are killed in their sleep by him, Nancy and Quentin try to figure out who the killer is and why he's after them. They not only learn he was a gardener named, Fred Krueger who worked at their pre-school, but that he was burned alive by their parents for molesting them and is back for revenge.

This also fails to update the franchise in any way desirable. The graphic images are awesome and very well done, but the story itself is very mundane. It lacks all sense of truth.Furthermore, it also fails to possess the charisma generated by the Robert Englund version of this villain. I'm not anti Haley by any sense of the term, but I was not drawn to his characterization of Freddy as I was with the prior incarnation. He sounds like he's attempting a Christian Bale thing with his voice, and it just doesn't work in any way proactive to generating the necessary ambiance or atmosphere this particular franchise needs to succeed.It also lacks one key ingredient to any horror film. This is a more psychological look into the back-story of Kruger than the original, which means by the definition of ""horror,"" alone, it is inferior to a more visceral version.

58,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,7 November 2016,"Freddie wasn't a child rapist in the original. A lot of people believe that, mainly because of the reboot and an interview that stated he was intended to be, but that idea was scrapped.The idea was scrapped because you couldn't really give the killer a sense of humor and make him oddly likable and enduring if he was that awful.The reboot runs with it, and because they decided to make him a child rapist they had to take away all the humor and charm that came with Freddie...besides, statistically speaking, Millennials--the target audience--doesn't understand satire and dark humor.The result is a straight horror movie. It became your standard slasher film minus the T&A that made some of the worse ones bearable to teenage boys--the target audience.So the movie has no humor...and because of that it has no charm...and because they ran with the child rapist idea it has to take itself a little too seriously......And on top of that, the effects aren't really all that better, which is presumably the reason for the reboot. It looks a bit more polished, but doesn't seem as much like a dream world. They aren't as surreal as the original...and again that was part of the real one's charm.Yet again, ladies and gentlefolk and every new one in between, we have a remake that neglects all of what made the original popular and beloved and in the process insults the audience leaving one to ponder why was it even done in the first place?",A Nightmare on Elm Street
59,dfranzen70,It's better because it's grittier and darker,7,13 August 2011,"I'm happy to say that, in my eyes, this ""reimagining"" isn't bad at all. In fact, it's gloriously scary in ways that the 1984 original simply can't match. It's unmarred by cheesy special effects and delves a little more into the psychology of Freddy Krueger, and as a result it delivers a stronger punch than you'd expect from rehashed horror.For those who don't know, here's your story: many moons ago, a man named Freddy Krueger was burned alive by angry parents; now he haunts those parents' kids in their own dreams, and when he kills in their dreams, they die in real life. You can die in your dreams, you know. Just ask Mario Mario.The original Nightmare on Elm Street was mostly about high school kids dying in increasingly gruesome ways, which is where we are today with a lot of horror – Saw, Hostel, House of Wax, and so on. The new one still shows plenty of gratuitous and creative violence, but Freddy is even more diabolical and menacing, less of a sideshow freak and more of a terrifying monster. This is in part due to Jackie Earle Haley, who seems very much a living, breathing demon, every raspy syllable. Haley, so great in Watchmen, Little Children, and even unwatchable dreck like All the King's Men, has turned out to be one hell of a good actor, and I hope that one of these days he gets some real recognition as such.The plot is basically the same as that of the original. If the kids fall asleep, they encounter Freddy, who kills them. So some of them try not to fall asleep (missing, for the most part, is the ghostly nursery rhyme about Mr. Krueger), either by popping pills or just drinking way too much coffee.The protagonist is played by Rooney Mara, sister to Kate Mara and great-granddaughter to New York Giants owner Tim Mara. She's a hell of a lot more believable than any of the other ""good guys,"" which is fine. If anyone in a horror movie should be plausible, it should be the main character. The others can be fodder if they want.The mood is appropriately dark, almost trembling as it backlights the scenes. And although there's plenty of spilled blood to go around, it feels almost more like a psychological thriller and less of a gorefest, and I think that shows some bit of maturity in the genre. Who's to say? Maybe these old franchises will get rebooted intelligently. It could happen.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
60,PWNYCNY,Keep your nightmares to yourself.,4,2 May 2010,"This is a horror movie that is more laughable than horrible. Why is this? Because the genre is fundamentally weak. Ever since The Exorcist Hollywood has been desperately trying to produce another horror masterpiece but instead produces horrible facsimiles. As a result the bar for this genre has been lowered practically to the floor, resulting in laughable hokum. For a movie to succeed, it has to have a credible, plausible story, something that will engage the audience, something this movie fails to do. The more the characters talk about sleep, the more one may want to take a nap. There is so much talk about sleep that after awhile the subject becomes tiring. Insomnia is a problem and should not be trivialized, but this movie does exactly that. Nightmares are preventing you from sleeping? Tell it to a psychiatrist. Take some no-doze. Have yourself a drink, if that's your fancy. Take a walk around the block. Visit a library. And if someone is coming after you with a long metal nails, call the police, but please, PLEASE, don't make it into a movie. (Yawn) Some of the dialog is witty and the acting is good, but the story is just too shallow to prevent the movie from sinking to the level of pablum. However, the movie ends strongly. It's just too bad that the first 90 minutes or so of this movie isn't equally as good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
61,dee.reid,"A new ""Nightmare"" that is not as bad as it appears, but it's still nothing to get worked up about...",6,2 May 2010,"Bias alert: ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" directed in 1984 by Wes Craven, is, to me, the ultimate slasher flick, more-so than ""Halloween"" (1978). I love ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and everything about it: Fred Krueger (played brilliantly in that film and its sequels by Robert Englund), its surreal atmosphere that toyed with the boundaries between dreams and reality, and the girl-power prowess of its young heroine Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp).That was 26 years ago when Fred Krueger, a spectral, razor-fingered night-monster, cut and slashed his way into the dreams of a group of teenagers who were the children of angry townspeople who had burned the accused child murderer alive in his basement hideaway. He swore vengeance upon them by haunting the dreams of their children.Now a new film crew has taken the reins of Fred Krueger and his ""Nightmare."" One of them is director Samuel Bayer. Two others are screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, and their script which is laden with references to the original film (including a direct reference to an iconic sequence from ""Pulp Fiction""). The last is Jackie Earle Haley as Fred Krueger. Haley pours his all into this movie, but is still not able to really become the type of menace that Robert Englund gave birth to in 1984. In short, I deeply miss Robert Englund; he was scary, funny, sadistic, and brutal. His sadistic personality is what made him so memorable as a villain. The fact that he even had a personality is what raised his bar far higher than those other iconic slashers from the '80s, such as Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. Haley's Krueger seems too serious for anyone's liking. He lacks the brutality and penchant for darkly humored witticisms that made the character so iconic back in the '80s.The main difference between the two portrayals lies in their origins and motivations for revenge in the realm of dreams: as stated, Englund's Krueger was a filthy, brutal, child killer who was chased down and burned alive in his dungeon hideaway by angry parents after he was let off on a legal technicality by the authorities. In this new ""Nightmare,"" Krueger is a suspected pedophile who is burned alive by a mob of angry parents and returns from the grave to stalk the dreams of their children. So here, Krueger is made somewhat into a sympathetic character, a man who was wrongfully accused of horrific crimes, was killed for it, and has come back from the dead to exact revenge. In the original, we knew from the get-go that Krueger was evil beyond compare, which is what made him so frightening and compelling as a movie villain.One of the biggest mistakes here is that Krueger is on-screen too much. Krueger was only in a handful of scenes in the original and had a minimum of dialogue, and we never really got a good enough chance to see him. He was the demon in the room that you were never really sure was there, but you still knew you were being watched by sadistically evil eyes. He was scary, he was intimidating, and we genuinely feared him. And any scene he was in cracked to life and genuinely frightened the audience. Here, he's on-screen too much and has too much dialogue. He's no longer frightening because we know what he's capable of and what he looks like.And speaking of what he looks like...The makeup effects employed to transform Robert Englund into the character 26 years ago are obviously dated by today's standards, but re-examination of the original film prompts one to realize how revolutionary the character was all those years ago. His flesh was horribly burned, with rotten teeth, a tattered fedora hat, dirty red and green sweater, and trademark finger-knives. (The filmmakers reportedly studied photos of real-life burn victims to get ideas on how to apply the makeup to Robert Englund's face.) Haley's makeup is ""real"" in the sense that it looks authentic, like he was really burned alive, but that doesn't mean it's better. Haley's Krueger looks like his face was melted off and he also has a big hole in his jaw. In other words, there's nothing remarkable about the character now, despite Haley's impeccable talents.To be fair to the filmmakers, Jackie Earle Haley was the best thing about ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and he was able to provide any scene he appeared him a minuscule amount of fright. His talents, however underutilized here, kept the thing going. Shame none of Krueger's victims stood out, considering the proto-feminist impact Heather Langenkamp's character had on the original series of films, and this film's Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara) is pretty much a wuss. I didn't feel for her character at all like I did Langenkamp's character; Langenkamp was strong and resourceful, which allowed her character to break a lot of ground in slasher films during the 1980s.And as this film's ending would prove, a new series of ""Nightmares"" is surely on the way.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

63,JoeB131,Another Remake we could do without,4,8 October 2010,"It's become fashionable to take all those cool horror movies of the 1980's and remake them. So with Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees getting reboots, why not Freddy Krueger.In some ways, the new era of CGI special effects were an improvement. Things I suspect Wes Craven would have liked to have been able to do in 1984, but the technology wasn't there yet.Sadly, what movies like this gain in technology, they lose in story telling. Freddy in this movie is played by Jackie Earle Haley, who played Roscharch in the adaptation of ""Watchmen"". The problem here is that he tries to play Freddy straight, not as the wise-cracking finding inventive ways to kill you maniac we saw in the later movies. Even the makeup is less scary, making him look more alien than monster.The original film had some iconic images including the scene in the bathtub with the clawed hand coming up between the legs of the heroine. (Or as I referred to it at the time, the ""Gyno-exam from Hell"". My girlfriend slapped me.) They are all reproduced here, but the the problem is, you don't care about the characters.Clancy Brown is in the movie as the father who is the ringleader of the mob that kills Freddy. A waste of a good actor.Then they had the mother who is obviously a Sarah Palin lookalike... I just have to ask why.Again, I think this is another example of the video-gaming of movies.

65,mattkratz,good remake,8,15 January 2011,"This was an effective, scary, and decent remake of the original classic from the mid-1980s. While no one can replace Robert Englund as Freddy Kruger (he was perfect for that role!), Jackie Earle Haley holds in own in the part. The special effects were the highlight, although it kind of brings it down a little bit. It was kind of like the Godzilla remake, where the special effects from the original were so campy it was what made it fun the it damaged it slightly. I'm sure you know the story, where kids on Elm Street start having nightmares involving a burnt, strange guy named Freddy (they even recreated him wholly from the original, right down to the red-and-black striped sweater and fedora hat with garden gloves and razor fingers), and when you die in the dreams you die in real life. They then start to unravel the mystery involving the real life Freddy Kruger and why he's doing this. I like the way they reveal in this one movie what it took the original series about two or three movies to reveal, and it looks like there might be more movies in this series. (or so I've heard) I'm actually looking forward to it-I enjoyed this movie and Haley's performance. You might too. I recommend this one.** 1/2 out of ****",A Nightmare on Elm Street

67,drownnnsoda,"Slick Retelling, Slightly Fun.",6,1 May 2010,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has become a classic of horror cinema and a staple of the genre; though its perhaps not as mainstream as grand slasher series' like ""Friday the 13th"", it has a dedicated audience. This remake takes a spin on the story, and centers on a group of teenagers (much like in the original) who find their dreams haunted by a burned, knife-fingered man who is hellbent on hurting them. After several of them die in unexplained ways, it becomes clear that this man, Freddy Krueger, has the ability to not only kill them in their dreams, but also in real life. Two of the teens in particular, Nancy and Quentin (Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner), are determined to uncover Freddy's identity, while doing anything necessary to stay awake.As far as the original film goes, I respect it. It's an extremely original concept and Craven's directing and writing is wonderful. However, I will also say that it's not in my very top list of best horror films; I like it, and respect its place in the genre, but it's not a film I can watch over and over again and still find amusing (odd enough as it is). Now, onto the 2010 film. It's from the same guys who have remade several horror films in the past decade (2003's ""Texas Chainsaw"", 2005's ""Amityville Horror"", which were both decent films; can't say I liked their rendition of 2009's ""Friday the 13th"", though), and, as expected, the production values are slick and glossy, but at times almost too polished for my tastes. On a visual level, though, I have to admire the work done here; the cinematography is very nicely done, with plenty of dark shadows, pale-lit streets, and smoldering factory basements of fire and brimstone. Nice stuff.Freddy Krueger gets a visual makeover in the sense that his notorious burned face is a bit different from the highly recognizable Robert Englund who originally brought the role to life. Jackie Earle Hayley fills the shoes well enough, though, and he works the menacing-but- sometimes-witty presence that the original Freddy had (which admittedly got goofier in the series' later installments). Unlike the 1984 film, though, Freddy's persona gets a bit of a more sinister spin to it in his relation to the now-young adults that he's sleep stalking; this was touched on in the first film, but not nearly as realized as it is here— this element was one of the more interesting aspects of this retelling, in my opinion, but for readers' consideration, I won't say more.The film makes many nods to the original as well, and replicates some classic scenes in a respectful and competent manner; jump scares are here a plenty, though, and I am not the only one who can say that these do in fact get tiring. In this same vein, I think that Freddy was almost over-used here; we see him too often and we see too much, which slowly diminishes his threatening presence by the time the film gets to the nitty-gritty. As for the acting, I can't say it's Oscar-worthy, but it's good for a horror film. Jackie Earle Hayley takes the most impressive turn as Freddy. The new Nancy is a bit wooden at times, but I found her likable, and Kyle Gallner was very believable. Katie Cassidy replaces the Tina role from the original, and she's good here as well in a role that seems to be reinforcing her status as today's scream queen of horror remakes.I think one of the strongest scenes in the film was near the ending when Nancy is stuck in a sort of dream limbo where Freddy decides to live out a morbid fantasy with ""little Nancy, his favorite"". The power of this scene is not only driven by its visual forces and mechanics, but more so by the pernicious underlying elements which propel it into something somewhat taboo, even for a horror movie. Creepy stuff, I'll admit, and well-acted and edited. That goes for all the dream sequences, in fact. They are well-realized and, for the most part, effective.Overall, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" '10 is an adequate retelling of a cherished horror film. It's visually interesting, has some effective dream sequences, a splash of humor, and a very sinister core to it. At times, however, it does seem too polished, and its exploitation of Freddy and incessant use of jump scares pushes the film to straddle the line between spooky and total cliché. All in all, though, I think it's a respectful retelling of Craven's work, and it's a hell of a lot better than last year's ""Friday the 13th"" remake. They could have done much worse. 6/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
68,kluseba,Your usual American popcorn horror cinema with some nice ideas,6,16 May 2012,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is not directly a remake of the classic movie but rather a story that is similar to the events featured in the original film with its own separate continuity. The movie takes a look on what has made Freddy Krueger the monster he has become and also features a few scenes before he was burnt. At some points, the movie offers a deeper look into the mind of this madman. These scenes are among the most intriguing ones in the movie alongside the nightmare sequences that are quite well done. There are no truly shocking moments though and can't catch up with recent horror flicks like Insidious but at least the tension is always quite elevated.The rest of the movie is not what I would call spectacular at all. The acting is solid but nothing more and can't catch up with the charismatic acting in the early movies. The story is rather predictable and offers no big surprises to fans of the horror genre. This movie lacks of truly haunting or memorable scenes. After all, this is another chapter of repetitive American popcorn horror cinema without any surprises that digs in its own past.On the other side, the scenes from the past and the nightmare passages pardon for the rest and the flick is overall quite entertaining on a little more than one hour and a half. It's a good movie to see with friends at home but definitely not worth a purchase or worth to be seen in the movie theatres. It's probably not the worst movies of the series but not among the best as well. At least, I must admit that the movie is able to inspire a lot to check out the old classics. It's a truly solid horror flick for fans of the genre and the series but anybody else shouldn't care much about this new release.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Rooney Mara was awesome as Nancy! And Connie Britton was also very good as Gwen, Nancy's mother. The other actors like I said, did well In their roles. The script was well put together as well. It wasn't really cliché or cheesy either. I love how Freddy actually did die in the end, and that there were 2 survivors. I hate it when they aren't any survivors in the end of a horror movie. The visuals in the film were cool looking too. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, because honestly I wasn't expecting much based on most of the critics reviews.

70,hu675,Extremely well produced remake of the 1984 classic.,8,23 May 2010,"When a young man named Dean (Kellen Lutz), who seemingly committed suicide in a neighbour restaurant one late night after having an nightmare. Nancy (Rooney Mara), Quentin (Kyle Gallner), Jesse (Thomas Dekker) and Chris (Katie Cassidy) are being having nightmares lately. Appearlingly they have the same dream about an man, who is burned, he wears an dirty red and green sweater, a hat and one genuinely nasty weapon that is knifes for fingers for his glove. His name is Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley), this man, who somehow finds himself resurrected in the dream world wants revenge from these teenagers. But they don't quite remember why... Freddy is getting them one by one and it is up to Nancy and Quentin to find out why before they get killed by Freddy.Directed by Samuel Bayer, who is best known for directing hundreds of music video including the classic ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" by Nirvana. Bayer certainly has visual flair and he keeps the movie moving. The cast are surprisingly good here, especially Haley (Best known for his Oscar Nominated performance in ""Little Children"", Rorschach in ""Watchmen"" and Kelly from the original ""The Bad News Bears""). The actors, who plays the terrified teens are fine here. Connie Britton (Best known for TV's ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Spin City"") and cult actor Clancy Brown (Pet Semetary 2, Highlander, The Shawshank Redemption) appears in small supporting roles. I would have love to see Brown more in this movie. Anything with Brown, it is always enjoyable.Michael Bay (Bad Boys 1 & 2, Pearl Harbor, The Rock), Andrew Form and Brad Fuller produced this remake for their Platinum Dunes production. Who are best known for producing remakes like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Amityville Horror"" and the misfire ""The Hitcher"". This is certainly the best remake, they produced so far. Although there's many people, who enjoy ""TCM"" remake. Robert Shaye is one of the executive producers, since he produced every ""Nightmare"" movie in the original series. Excellent Cinematography by Jeff Cutter (Orphan) and Stong Production Designs by Patrick Lumb (Flight of the Phoenix ""2004"", The Omen ""2006"", Valkyrie) are one of the highlights of the movie.I guess, my only complain of the movie. Screenwriters Wesley Strick (Cape Fear ""1991"", Doom, Wolf) and Eric Heisserer (The Thing ""Prequel"") couldn't come up with an better idea to get Freddy out of the real world or coming up with something better. It is an minor complain. The movie is occasionally scary and the music by Steve Jablonsky (Transformers 1 & 2, The Island, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") is well done, which his score sometimes echos the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" music by Charles Bernstein.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD's only feature is an featurette titled ""Freddy Krueger Reborn"".The Blu-ray edition has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) 1080P transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 HD Surround Sound. The Blu-ray has an solid PIP (Picture in Picture) ""Maniacal Movie Mode"", an featurette, Focus Points, Deleted Scenes and an interesting Alternative Ending. Although it is missing some of the deleted scenes that were seeing in Behind the Scenes features.I felt in the end, this was an good remake. It is much better than the ""Friday the 13th"" remake. Which Bay, Form and Fuller produced. The movie could have used some fleshing out from the characters. But Haley is a terrific Freddy and Gallner is certainly the standout as one of the scared teens. I read in some reviews, there's not much people liked Mara's performance as the somewhat Gothic Nancy, i thought she played her role well. Maybe it would have been more sympathetic, if it was played by Cassidy instead of Mara. Overall ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a very good remake, probably some die-hard fans of the original will disagree with you. But i thought the original was very good and this new re-imagine as well. So, judge for yourself. From a story by Strick. Unlike the remakes that Wes Craven produced like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Last House on the Left"". He had nothing to do with the remake, since they didn't asked his advice or his help. Aaron Yoo and Judith Hoag appears uncredited. Panavision. (****/*****).",A Nightmare on Elm Street
71,TdSmth5,An unnecessary and dull remake,6,29 November 2010,"Deciding on whether to remake a classic is a tricky situation. One question producers need to ask themselves is whether they can improve on the original in any way. I might add that remakes of movies made in the last 30 years are usually not a good idea- even worse, movies made this, or last year (Martyrs, etc.) Some remakes are actually necessary: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a great idea, is awfully filmed for our standards and really not that scary, in my view- it needed a remake. The Nightmare on Elm Street is still a great movie today. And this remake isn't an improvement in any way. Adding CGI a better movie does not make.The story involves several kids who dream with Freddy. Some end up dead, the remaining will try to figure out what is happening. The story is pretty good. The town has a dirty secret which the adults try to cover up. But the kids having these dreams means that the secret will come to the surface. We find out who Freddy was, what he did, but not how we obtains the supernatural power to get into people's dreams.One problem is the casting. Englund's Freddy was creepy, scary, and funny. Haley's Freddy is none of those. For some reason he talks like a puppet, only lowering and raising his jaw. His lines are dull. And he just doesn't look the part. Our lead, Rooney Mara, sleepwalks trough the entire movie. She has no life in her and her character has no personality.Technically this movie is well done, there are few interesting death scenes, but nothing like the original. The poor dialogue and the terrible actors ruin, what could have been a decent movie. But then again, if the original is excellent or perfect (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser, Martyrs) then making a remake is only going to be an embarrassment for those involved.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
72,Jonny_Numb,Hacks and Slash,3,5 May 2010,"One of the main problems with the remakes that spew forth from producer/gorgon Michael ""I Know What You Cretins Want"" Bay's Platinum Dunes imprint is that it's easier to take issues with the cynicism associated with the finished product (and make no mistake – Bay and his stable of music-video whipping boys are in the business of manufacturing films that are as plastic as possible) than matters of narrative, acting, special effects, or even general aesthetics. An objective–no matter how ambiguously presented–is key to the success of any work of art, and the objectives of these remakes is, simply: the cashing in of a recognizable name ""for a few dollars more."" That being said, there are times when the PD Plastics Factory has appealed to my most easy-to-please instincts, whether it be a distinctive performance within something otherwise mediocre (Sean Bean in ""The Hitcher,"" for instance), or adhering to formula to deliver just what the viewer expects (""Friday the 13th"").Unfortunately, those easy-to-please instincts went unstimulated by ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" a miserably dull update of Wes Craven's 1984 original. That film single-handedly put New Line Cinema on the map, and inspired a plethora of sequels that propelled Robert Englund to the top of the B-List of latex-covered character actors. I will put my blasphemy out in the open: despite the fact that the iconic scarred visage of Freddy Krueger terrified me as a child (more out of the sheer grotesquery of the effect than anything else), I never found the NOES films very interesting, always feeling that their central conceit–a madman who can murder you in your dreams–was never taken full advantage of. And after a bunch of sequels and a clever foray into postmodernism (Craven's ""New Nightmare""), what aspect of America's favorite child-killing ghoul is left to explore? Co-writers Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer frame the film as one dream-thread overlapping with the next, allowing the plot to snap into place in a manner that is by turns gimmicky, predictable, and tedious. Rob Zombie took a lot of flak for his overuse of dream sequences in last year's underrated ""Halloween II,"" but ""NOES '10"" doesn't even have the courage to make us care about Freddy's nightmare-plagued victims before they get eviscerated in stunningly bland fashion. The dialog exchanges are flat, and the film seldom slows down to flesh out its internal logic (something that has lost credibility long before the climax anyway). The filmmakers' notion that those sitting in the audience have been down this road before, and know what to expect, is not the mark of an enterprise with artistic creativity on its mind.While the cast of characters exist in a vacuum of sleep deprivation, thus excusing the lethargy of the performances, this is still a yawnsome, one-dimensional bunch to follow. Familiar genre faces like Kyle Gallner (""The Haunting in Connecticut"") and Katie Cassidy (""The Lost"") are stuck in underwritten (or possibly lost in the editing room) roles. Rooney Mitra is astonishingly miscast as Nancy (our Final Girl), her body language and line delivery a model of acting-school boredom. Jackie Earle Haley (a rising character actor who stole one scene in ""Shutter Island"" and many in ""Watchmen"") is wasted in the agonizingly ""serious"" role of Krueger, delivering wooden dialog under an insect-like makeup job. While I hope this role lands him more work, it is a total waste of his considerable talents.Script? Plot? Aesthetics? Damn, I wrote a review about all the things a PD remake avoids in its quest to nestle snugly in the warm bosom of familiar overkill. As with all the other music-video whipping boys in Bay's stable, Samuel Bayer (Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit') brings a predictable lack of creativity to the proceedings; while the editing is less ADHD than usual, the film's only scares are of the LOUD-NOISE-JUMP variety, and its only suspense is in the dream sequences (which are staged in the most painfully obvious ways possible). In its efforts to adhere somewhat to the template that made the original a success, this new ""Nightmare"" has little to offer: maybe this will bring an end to our persistent bad dreams of franchises that just refuse to die.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
73,questl-18592,#NotMyNightmare,2,14 September 2020,"I grew up with A Nightmare On Elm Street. These were my first real exposure to the genre way before I should have been watching them, I'm pretty sure I was still in single digits when I had developed a love for the series. When I heard it was getting a reboot I was thrilled, and with Haley as the knife handed killer? Rorschach as Freddy? Yes please.The tragedy is that Bayer clearly didn't understand what made the Nightmare series great. Englund got it, Freddy is sick and twisted, he wants to terrify his prey. The main difference between the two, England's Freddy loves what he does while Bayer is way to self serious and dark about everything. I wanted to see Freddy doing crazy stuff in the dreams and we don't really get that, instead there's just a focus on the child abuse. No thank you.This is the risk, right? Hollywood loves remakes, but that's tough. Make it to similar and it's just a clone, deviate too much in the wrong way and you alienate the fans. This falls to the ladder. It's just not good. Form the unfortunate direction Haley took, to the poor acting and forgettable dream sequences. This misses with every swing. I want to give it credit for making Freddy a real monster, trying something, it just doesn't work.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
74,aidanratesmovies,"A Misunderstood Remake, An Argument for A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)",8,24 July 2020,"Entertaining, often compelling, and for the most part pretty well acted- A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is a surprisingly decent remake that stays true to the original, while being original enough itself in a variety of sinister fun ways. I have always been a fan of Rooney Mara, and even in a horror film remake divisise in its own set of fans, I still found her performance to be fantastic. She, and many of the other actors in the film, truly give it their all, most of which with success. There has been controversy surrounding Jackie Earle Haley as horror icon Freddy Krueger, but personally, I found his performance to be riveting. I found the makeup job they did for his costume on his face to be a bit messy, but I never felt it attracted to much from his performance or the plot. Many people spend too much time comparing this film to the original, claiming how superior it is. Though I do feel the original film is more consistent than this one, I still feel a need to argue this one for its justice. Unlike the original film, I ended up liking and caring for the characters involved, rather than watching a series of stereotypes walk around the screen until their sudden 'oh so surprising' deaths. The original film spent more time focusing on how menacing its kills could be, and the settings involved in its plot, rather than focusing on the true heart of the film. I feel the remake is quite better in this film aspect, and also feel like it is better in terms of atmosphere and tone. Now granted, the original film was better at earning suspense, as this one more goes for the jump scares instead of true suspense, but I do find the look of the film to feel very interesting, and incredibly atmospheric and creepy in tone. It feels like a real situation, and unlike the original, it feels much more grounded, which I had to say I enjoyed seeing in a slasher like film. In the end, A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) I feel was a victim of circumstance. Horror fans, and fans of the original series, should give the film another chance, and appreciate it for what it is, rather than comparing it exclusively to what it could be. It does have its fair share of flaws, but so does the original, and like the original, but in a different sense, it stands on its own as an original project, and I have to say I enjoyed watching it. Formulaic moments can be found in it sure, but nothing to deteriorate it to being a bad film, and I strongly urge those who want to watch it to keep an open mind.My Rating: 7.8/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
75,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),4,26 December 2011,"I am a huge fan of the original. It's one of those films I watched as a youngster and it scared the living crap out of me. Being haunted in your dreams is a fantastic premise which can have you thinking about the film for days to come. That isn't quite the case with this soulless remake. I couldn't believe how dull and uninteresting they made the film. There were some good ideas, and a time when it could have taken this into new territory. Fred Krueger is now killed based on just the children's testimonies. This creates a sense that there may be some innocence to Krueger. The film also does well in, what I guess, would be surprises for newcomers to the franchise. It keeps the switch in leads, and reveals information at a decent pace. I am a huge Haley fan and he was certainly the best thing about this film, as was the make-up for his character. I felt like this was the most menacing incarnation of Freddy since the original. He was sick, twisted, jokey, but always a threat. Unfortunateky, the imagination of the writers isn't great. About every kill is just a slicing, and the dream worlds are so gritty and grim. The few times it breaks the laws of physics, it uses poor CGI. It's not awful, but it's far from great. Doubtful I will revisit this one over the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
76,Matt_Layden,An Hour and a Half of Cheap By The Book Horror Scares.,5,30 April 2010,"The children on Elm street are all having the same nightmare, a horribly burned man with a glove of knives on his hand trying to kill them. If you die in your sleep, you die in real life. This is the re-invention of the horror icon Freddy Krueger. First it was Leatherface, then Jason and now Freddy. The Michael Bay produced horror vehicles are back in full swing with more teenagers to die, more blood to splatter and more CGI effects in place of actual special effects. It was only a matter of time before one of the most famous horror icons got his remake and here it is, with a new actor behind the hat and sweater. The original Nightmare on Elm Street has a special place in my heart. Watching it at 2 in the morning at a cottage in the middle of the woods really made for a frightening experience. His reappearance in later films made him more of a comical villain than someone to really be afraid of, but now those who are bringing him back want to take him, not only back to his horrific original self, but to dive even deeper and make him more frightening than ever before.They succeed in making this version of Freddy more scary than his previous outings and more real with the make-up of being a burned victim, but in the end, this character just isn't as scary as he once was. Jackie Earle Haley does a magnificent job as Freddy, which is saying something because he's taking over the role of someone who's been doing it for 20 years and he's covered in make up for most of the film. Even though he does his Rorschach voice again, it's still well done and nice to hear. He stands out in an otherwise lame and lazy horror remake. You know the film is going to have problems when you see Freddy in full in the first 5 minutes. To be fair, this isn't a total train wreck. There are worse horror remakes out there *cough* Prom Night *cough*. But this Nightmare is too serious for such a silly concept. We dive immediately into the problem, with a murder of one of the kids. We are then told that the kids have been seeing Freddy for sometime now. Which is lazy writing. We are already too late into the story. We should be with the characters when they are first encountering him, not keeping it a secret from others. We can't connect to these characters at all. There are plenty moments of really bad CGI. The scary and famous scene in the original when Freddy leans out from the wallpaper watching the character sleeping was some pretty scary stuff. Here, it is an afterthought and it looks horribly fake. The film relies way too much on fake, cheap and useless scares. I thought we were getting past these stupid things. The film uses it so much that you expect it to happen and it loses all meaning. Thus, the film becomes formulaic. Character nods off, they are asleep without knowing it, see Freddy, cheap scare, they wake up. Repeat for every other character in the film and you begin to fill up the 95 minute time slot. Now, for fans of the series, I can say this about the films. Every death in the nightmare films were creative. Puppeteering death? Awesome stuff. Here he slices people with his glove. Nothing spectacular. I guess since they tried to make him serious they wanted to take out all the fun and exciting deaths, instead they tried to keep it real. Well, Friday the 13th managed to keep it's fun and cheesy attitude, this nightmare doesn't and it falls flat. It was too serious for it's own good and has no terror, no thrills and no suspense. Our lead, Nancy, Rooney Mara, is not memorable at all. She is no Langenkamp and the whole time I was watching her I kept thinking, ""This is what Abigail Breslin will look like in 10 years"". Clancy Brown is underused and instead of paying attention to Kyle Gallner, I kept trying to remember where I have seen him before. The answer is the equally lame horror film Jenniger's Body.I can give this film praise where it is deserved. Freddy looks great and is more terrifying than what his previous installments had him be and the ending is clearly the highlight. I was cheering, which was a surprise to me. The sound design is really great as well. Freddy's voice is all over the place and at times I thought he was in the theatre. But in the end, this Nightmare remake is really a disappointment.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
77,vengeance20,Some people are just so picky! This was an ace film!,9,21 April 2013,"To start I find it highly amazing how much hate this film's got & the people surrounding it! I thought it was pretty good! Remakes need to be done! OK? It's the way it is! So put up & shut up!I myself found this pretty good compared to the original which I also thought was a good film. Freddy Kruger I wouldn't say looked that much different from the original series but as a remake it worked pretty well! Even if the guy playing him was 5ft 5 1/2 inches tall & bits of his face were CGI! But other than that I liked it! The opening was great! How Freddy cut Deans throat while they were struggling, only for his Ex to watch while she can't see Freddy as Dean is dreaming! Ace! The blood effects were ace! The claw through the bodies was epic too! The story-line was decent as it would, with the original film! The end, was priceless! Freddy coming & clawing his hand through the mirror & piecing A Good film & hope to see a sequel to this film! As I was too young to see this in cinemas! :( Being cos I was 15 going on 16! :(Although I can't help noticing that, a large majority of reviews which are VERY negative which ironically, a lot of people find helpful i.e 150 people out of 98 found this review useful, & the positive reviews have i.e 0 out of 3 people found this review useful, in them.Now, we all know why this is don't we? It is because you lot can't stand a person has an opposing review to yours, because you didn't like the film & also think that everyone else should think like you do! Abusing the system.

78,moviewizguy,Never Sleep Again,7,2 May 2010,"Nancy, Kris, Quentin, Jesse and Dean all live on Elm Street. At night, they're all having the same dream--of the same man, wearing a tattered red and green striped sweater, a beaten fedora half-concealing a disfigured face and a gardener's glove with knives for fingers. And they're all hearing the same frightening voice...one by one, he terrorizes them within the curved walls of their dreams, where the rules are his, and the only way out is to wake up.I have never been a fan of the NOES franchise, nor have I ever considered the original film to be a classic. The film had mediocre to terrible performances, with an exception of Robert Englund, of course, cheesy special effects, and an ending so horrible it ruined the whole point of the film. When Platinum Dunes announced that they were going to remake this film, I was interested. The fact that they casted Jackie Earle Haley to play the new Freddy Krueger as well as trying to get the film back to a serious tone only peaked my excitement. After seeing this film, I'm not afraid to say that this remake, or re-imagining, is better than the original. Yes, I said the deadliest phrase in the movie world.The performances are much more improved from the teens. Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner are the two leads and they do a terrific job. We, the audience, feel sympathy for them, because they can really act. Jackie Earle Haley, although not better than Robert Englund, does a great job as well. What's different between him and Englund is that Haley plays Krueger as a much darker and sinister villain, which I dug quite a bit. Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz are the remaining teens in this film, all pulling off convincing performances.The seriousness of the film worked because it was pretty scary. I was clutching the arm rests when the nightmare scenes were going on and my heart was racing. The death scenes are pretty brutal as well. However, saying that, the first half of the film was pretty rushed. I don't know if this counts as a complaint but there were just too many nightmare sequences, one after another after another after another. Thankfully, the film slows down after a couple of teens get killed off in the middle mark. From there on, the film actually gets better and the third act is just refreshing and thrilling. This is pretty odd because films are usually better in the beginning and get worse in the end. Although the origin of Freddy is similar to the original, we get to see more of what happened to him in flashbacks, something I liked a lot.The visual effects were also improved. Now, I'm usually not the person that would say better visual effects equal a good movie, but in a series like this, the surreal nightmare sequences HINGE upon having convincing effects to cross the worlds of dream and reality. Something this film explored that this series never went deeper into was the literal parallelism of dream and reality. There's a scene in this film where you can see what's happening in reality while the character is dreaming and that's something I would have liked to have seen in the previous films, but I guess the technology never caught up until now. However, saying that, there was one scene in the film where CGI was used that looked horrible where as in the original film, practical effects were used to make the scene much scarier.The make-up effect for the new Freddy is more realistic than the original Freddy, where the new one looked like a burned victim. However, I still prefer the original look of Freddy. The soundtrack is reminiscent of the original. It still has the creepy underlying feel it always does. The cinematography and lighting is slick thanks to music video director Samuel Bayer, who knows what he's doing. There are some really great scenes here.I would be lying if I said this remake was bad, because it isn't. It's a well made film that actually pulls off some great scares and while the film is a bit messy at first, it gets better toward the latter half of the film. The performances and visual effects are improved in this film and while Haley may not be better than Englund, he did a great job as the new Freddy Krueger. Overall, Nightmare fans will get a kick out of this and those who are interested in this film should give it a watch. Oh, and I'll say this again: It's better than the original film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
79,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Despite a Strong Performance by Jackie Earl Haley, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (2010) is Just Lame All Around...",1,4 May 2010,"While I should probably start my review of the 2010 remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with either a sly and witty joke, or perhaps a sentence that summarizes my general feelings towards the film, I don't think I'll do that... rather, I'll start with one simple thought that plagued me the entire running length- Those were NOT teenagers... In fact, they all looked to be about 25-30-years-old.Seriously... Teenagers don't look like that... I'm sorry, but that fact alone almost completely ruins the movie. If you want to cast 25-year-olds, cast them as 25-year-old characters. If you want someone to play a teenager, cast someone whose 18-20 years old.Anywho, back to the review...Director Samuel Bayer and writers Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer (in coordination with producer Michael Bay) deliver us the remake (or reboot... or re-imagining... or whatever they're calling it) of Wes Craven's classic horror film ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" As a massive fan of the original series, I was eagerly anticipating this new vision of the tale of Freddy Kruger.I was let down. Horribly.I want to summarize the film. I honestly do. But the so-called plot is thin. And very inconsistent. While the film wants to center on the character of Quentin (portrayed in one of the film's only good performances by Kyle Gallner), it inexplicably spends unnecessary time with other, less important characters, like the ""New Nancy"" (Rooney Mara), whom clearly was just thrown into the movie for fan service. (she's supposed to be this remake's version of Heather Langencamp's character in the original) She isn't a real character, she's just a plot device to move the story forward, with no personality or development. She's just the ""exposition character"", whom explains the plot to the audience. The film also centers on another character for the first half-hour. Yet she holds no real relevance to the plot. So I'm not even gonna go into her name or purpose.I guess the plot goes as follows: A mysterious and frightening figure is stalking and murdering teenagers in their dreams. That's it. None of the drama of the original's mystery. None of the intrigue of ""Dream Warrior's"" exploration of the Freddy character. None of the silly story lines of ""Dream Master."" The movie is just a series of scenes where characters constantly fall asleep and get picked off by Freddy Kruger.I mean, the script does attempt to create something of a story, with a few flashbacks of Freddy's death, and a cheesy romantic subplot. But really, it's nothing we haven't seen done better before.Samuel Bayer's direction for the movie is pretty flat and uninspired. The dialog is hammy and poorly-written. Almost all of the actors are just reading their lines. It's just a clear-cut example of what not to do when remaking a horror classic.The film's one true saving grace... In fact the only reason I could watch it, was to see Jackie Earl Haley's (""Watchmen"", ""Little Children"") portrayal of Freddy Kruger. While Robert England did immortalize the role of the man of our dreams, Haley does a fantastic job. You can tell he's having a blast playing Kruger too. Each little chuckle... every smirk... the way he quivers his clawed hand... It just looks like Haley is loving his job. And his Kruger is truly well-done.And I actually feel bad for Jackie Earl Haley, because his Freddy is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 out of 10 from me. His passion and skill as an actor deserves a better movie. Freddy also deserves a better movie.This gets a 3 out of 10 from me. Let's hope our dreams (and nightmares) come true, and the inevitable sequel is far better than this.Edit: 18 months later, I tried to re-watch it, and hated it even more, I am lowering my score to a 1.

80,Howlin Wolf,It hasn't been cut up too badly...,10,9 May 2010,"I have discovered I am capable of reconciling myself with both old and new...I knew full well there were certain things I wasn't gonna like about this. Although they do well, NONE of the new cast can live up to the original incarnations (Haley is experienced and an established star, but there is just no way to beat Robert Englund's Freddy) I also dislike Platinum Dunes style of only ever lighting things one way (things are scarier if they happen in the somewhat colourful real world you recognise, rather than if you're watching them take place in a town that looks as if it's permanently covered by a giant cloud of volcanic ash - as a country, we can't blame Iceland for everything!) As a first outing, it also had a disappointing reliance upon setpieces from the original, instead of coming up with fresh scares.I knew it wasn't going to be pure, relying on the modern horror template of jumpy shocks instead of creating an eerie mood, but if you can accept that this is a MODERN horror movie, complete with both the good and bad tropes that come with that concept, then this was a good attempt at rejuvenating the Freddy character so that he fits into today's climate. I liked what they did with his backstory, playing up the child abuse aspect and being brave in acknowledging paedophilia as the 'boogeyman' for the current age. We also got to see the consequences of parents executing vigilante justice, which was thought-provoking, too.In the main I was concerned that they should go back to Freddy's roots and make him really malevolent again, not someone you root for to any degree just because you're waiting for the next sarcastic quip. They accomplished this. Although this new first introductory visit was somewhat staid, there's plenty of time with the sequel for any returning cast to get more comfortable and look for fresh angles, as opposed to pilfering so much from their founding inspiration.Perhaps I'm being defeatist in only comparing it to other recent rehashes; I'd rather it not have been attempted at all, but now that the update is here, I can at least still live with the outcome...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
81,rivertam26,Not the mess it's made out to be,6,1 May 2010,"Look alot of people crap on this flick and I mostly get it. It's definitely a poor representation of one of my favorite films and every scene they try and recreate is an utter failure. Plus Jackie Earle Hailey (Watchmen) just isnt great as Kruger he's not bad but he lacks the charisma and boldness of Englund. As for the film it's not terrible just overly mediocre and best viewed as a separate film than part of the franchise. It lacks the imagination and creativity of even the worst chapters. That being said it's got some good stuff Rooney Mara (Carol) is really great as Nancy. She gives the character a relatable feel that's both vulnerable and resilient at the same time. Cutie Kyle Gallner (Ted State) is good as her boyfriend of sorts and Katie Cassidy (Arrow) is also good as one of her friends. Only Thomas Dekker (Kaboom) feels miscast.

82,Pumpkin_Man,A Great Remake to a Great Classic!!!,10,1 May 2010,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was everything I expected and more. Freddy Krueger is back with a vengeance and scarier than ever for a new generation. Jackie Earle Haley pulled an amazing performance as Freddy. I love his new look and his deep creepy voice. I literally had chills during a few scenes. The storyline is quite different than the original, but still gave a few homages to the 1984 classic. The teenagers of Elm Street are beginning to have grotesque nightmares of a burnt man, and start dying in their sleep. Nancy Holbrook and Quentin Smith try to figure out why Freddy is after them, and takes matters into their own hands. Without having sleep for three days, they begin to dream while they are awake, and can't tell what's reality or not. I highly recommend A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
83,Angelus2,The only thing that is believable is the special effects,1,21 May 2011,"A group of teens find themselves being hunted by a killer in their dreams named Freddy Krueger who has some sort of connection to the kids.The script and actors are perhaps the biggest problems within this movie, he script is full of bad dialogue and plot holes. It seems that the script jumps from one scene to another with characters suddenly out of the blue realising things, the end was confusing to say the least...Then we have the actors perhaps some of the worst teen actors around, models turned actors no doubt. Especially the 'Nancy' actress who whispers all of her dialog, but then you have the actress who plays her mother whose just as worse, repeating all her dialogue and staring at the camera with a blank expression.Jackie Earle Haley does his best as the psychotic killer but his efforts are not enough to save this car wreck.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
84,Stephen_A_Abell,1... 2... Freddy's Boring You... 3... 4... I Don't Want No More...,2,4 March 2017,"Once, the production house of New Line Cinema meant new and groundbreaking films, especially the Nightmare On Elm Street Series, and excluding the terrible part VI - Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, were pretty decent at doing that.So they decide to try and breath life into a long dead Kruger and bring the nightmares back to life for a new set of fans...... er... No.This is a travesty of a reboot. Mistake number one - they try to remake the first film with a few ""adjustments"" to the storyline to make it fresh and bring it up to date. This isn't fully utilised, as we're living in a modern world with internet, cell phones, and all types of other gizmo's that should have featured in the nightmare-scapes of Krueger's victims. See the tongue, out of the phone in the original part two, Freddy's Revenge, and Freddy's knives becoming syringes in the original part three, Dream Warriors.Mistake number two - Bad direction, Samuel Bayer relies on sound bursts way too much to make his audience jump. This is sloppy directing. With a story most people know, if you're not going to give your audience something new then you have to do a good job of being able to really scare them. There's NO build up of tension or suspense and this creates a lack of atmosphere that was very tangible in the original run.Mistake number three - Bad characterisation. None of the cast appears to have any depth, they all feel more two-dimensional than three. This isn't too bad a thing with the minor characters, but with the main characters, it's essential to create empathy and to feel sadness and terror when their situations take a turn for the worst. The major calamity in this instance is Freddy Krueger, where Robert England made it his own, Jackie Earle Haley comes nowhere near. This is more than a shame as Haley is a good actor, who did a splendid job as Rorschach in Watchmen. If he had produced a character similar in mannerisms, as the Nightmare Krueger, this would have helped make him a more terrifying and powerful character, which Freddy IS. However, this Freddy isn't anybody to be scared of Robert England is still KING!Everything that a horror film should be is missing from this movie.What could have made the movie better?Do Not remake the first film; use a completely different story. Skipp and Spector, two great horror writers helped pen the original part five, The Dream Child. It was also reported they'd wrote a story for the sixth film, ""Bastard Son Of A Thousand Maniacs"", which is one hell of a title and it went all the way back to Freddy's conception. This would have been an awesome place to start. Add in better characterisations and you're on your way.Then you would have to get a director that understood horror, terror, and suspense, as well as Wes Craven, did.Next, add imagination, which was rife in the original series... a bed cloth twisting and turning itself into a noose, a boy's veins pulled out of his body to make him a human puppet. Come on people nightmares are people's imagination dropped into the Darkside.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, save your money... or better yet spend it on buying the original film series box set and see how it should be done.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
85,IonicBreezeMachine,"Jackie Earle Haley kills it with his Freddy performance, but the movie is D.O.A.",5,26 May 2020,"First the good, Jackie Earle Haley is an absolute blast as Freddy Kruger. Not only does he have the sick sense of humor the character is known for, but also brings in sexual perversion and grime that makes the character scary but also different enough that he manages to escape Robert Englund's long shadow. Unfortunately the movie itself from its writing and directing to its other characters make the movie feel overproduced and underdeveloped. Samuel Bayer is better known as a director of music videos and commercials, and as Michael Bay has proven, just because you can get a good angel on Jennifer Lopez's butt doesn't mean you should try making movies. As a result the movie has a look that tries to be grungy, but comes off more like background imagery one would expect in a Marylin Manson video. The cast are a mixed bag, Rooney Mara as Nancy is easily the most charismatic and likable as our lead, but the rest of the casts credits include CW Teen Dramas, Twilight, and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles which should give you an idea of the level of investment we can expect from such a group. The story is also pretty half assed. It tries to fool the audience into thinking that Freddy might've been wrongly accused by the angry mob that killed him, but Haley's performance with the barely concealed lechery and predatory aspects undermines this development and leads me to believe this was most likely just squeezed in at the last possible moment to add SOMETHING to the mix that couldn't be traced back to the original. As it stands, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 is worth watching at least once for Haley's performance, but the rest of the movie is hollow and pointless.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
86,reddiemurf81,I jumped in my movie theater seat so many times when I saw this!!,7,2 May 2020,"This remake was awesome in so many ways,,, but,, it could've been better in many ways as well (how many movies, especially horror movies, can we not say that about?)JEH was the perfect actor to take on the character!! (Only other person I could've imagined in the role would've been Kevin Bacon) JEH was 100 different kinds of creepy in this (so much so it might've hurt him in getting further work).The rest of the cast was great as well. Especially Rooney Mara as Nancy.I also really liked how they played with the idea that maybe Freddy was innocent,, and he's killing the kids for revenge,,, but of course Freddy couldn't be further from innocent.I really wanted to see a sequel with JEH (like maybe take the dream warriors and dream master ideas and put them together, with Nancy as the psychiatrist) anyways,,,Go watch it!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
87,Fernando-Rodrigues,Zzzzzz......,6,30 August 2021,"It has many flaws, but it's not as bad as people say. It's just that the film's script misuses the references for the original, has empty characters and has some anticlimactic revelations -Ok, that's a lot-. The movie also excessively uses CGI, and it has frenetic pacing. Still, it entertains a lot and strives (does it really?) to soft reboot the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
88,ivo-cobra8,Michael Bay ruined the franchise! - A Nightmare on Rape Street - a peace of s**t reboot!!,9,25 October 2016,"*MAJOR SPOILERS* A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is a peace of s**t reboot!

It took me four times in the row to watch this movie so that I could remember what the f**k this movie was. This is a Nightmare on Rape Street and not A Nightmare on Elm Street! Why rebooting this movie? It was not need it! Jackie Earle Haley is not a real Freddy that would be Robert Englund! I don't think Jackie Earle Haley did a bad job been Freddy but the script was absolutely terrible! The story was horrible! This wasn't even a horror movie! It wasn't scary, creepy or dark enough. I hate this movie so much, this movie will not come near my Nightmare on Elm Street collection! I make exception for Freddy vs. Jason and A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child (1989) but this movie will not come near me at all I don't want it! Everyone is saying how Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) is the worst movie in the franchise and it is terrible - - that movie is MILES better than this Peace of s**t! Freddy Krueger is now a child molester! Really, seriously? He was raping young kids in the ass! Is this kind of a joke?! The original Freddy was a child murderer! He simply killed those kids, not molested or rape them, he killed them!!!!! Freddy was not creepy, funny he was dead tiring boring old sad man in here, this movie was boring sad ass to death! This movie stole the ideas from the first film and it stole lines from the sequels! With a s****y cast like Rooney Mara the worst actress ever! She even copied the character in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and that remake was so incredible horrible! This actress can not act! In the original movie you have Nancy Thomson bad-ass heroine who fights for survival played by Heather Langenkamp in this movie we have an actress who plays a weak ass pussy Nancy (Rooney Mara)! She is weak ass as hell, boring, stupid, lame and she is not strong and not caring enough! She is a pussy!!! In the original movie you have Nancy putting booby traps on Freddy and she was brave, she bring him in to our real world. In this movie Nancy has help by her boyfriend Kyle Gallner, seriously Kyle Gallner? from Veronica Mars! In this movie Nancy and her nerd boyfriend trap a serial killer who stalks them in their dreams? Disgrace! Freddy is killed so faster by a pussy Nancy who doesn't put any effort or a fight in to Freddy in this movie at all, she just sliced his throat with Kyle Gallner helping her by stabbing him in his leg!

CGI make up for Freddy and special effect were horrible absolutely forgettable!This movie raped the original movie in the ass! Rooney Mara can not act, we have a pussy heroine in this movie who is not even close likable or been a bad ass! She fall a sleep on a funeral is Michael Bay crazy? Why did she fall a sleep on funeral, you can't even sleep there.The director Samuel Bayer-Aspirin definitely gave everybody a headache. Thankfully the stench of his s****y job stopped him from doing more pieces of Garbage and giving more amounts of Fisting to other classics.The original movie is a classic it is my number 1 horror movie from Wes Craven this movie is peace of crap! Okay I am not the one who hates on remakes or reboots pretty all reboot's suck! The remakes I like: Fright Night (2011), Friday the 13th (2009), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), The Punisher (2004), Punisher: War Zone (2008), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) Batman Begins (2005), Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) I like those movies they are miles way better than this rape s**t! This remake was a waste of time and money and this movie sucks ass! Michael Bay ruined A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and he ruined Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies he ruined my childhood! He can not stop ruining people's childhoods! No wonder everyone hates him! Than we have a lackluster not logical lame ass ending, Freddy comes back in front of the mirror where Nancy is staring at her self and smashes the mirror grabs Nancy and that is the ending!!!!! What is the point of this? How did Freddy come back? When Nancy killed him??!! What is wrong with you all Jesus!This is the worst movie in the franchise and honestly it is not even Freddy Krueger movie it is not A Nightmare on Elm Street movie at all! Why should I care about this movie when I love the original to death! Everyone did a horrible job on making these movie and I did not take this movie serious! The rating is F 1/10 for me. I hate this movie the actors pretty much all are horrible. I like Katie Cassidy she was alright but the rest of the cast are s***! :P I will never in my life watch this movie again. If you are smart enough watch the original classic movie instead or watch the sequels or even watch Freddy vs Jason MILES way better movie than this forgettable peace of s*** and stay the f**k away from this rape movie!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
89,fernandoschiavi,"A regular remake, which explicitly shows the origin of Freddy Krueger and goes beyond the text by Wes Craven",6,26 September 2021,"A Nightmare on Elm Street was a production beyond the popularity of any other: there were six sequels, a crossover with Jason Voorhees in 2003, a multitude of derivative products and even a game for NES... In short: Freddy Krueger went from a hateful villain to a being cute (almost childish) whose look sold everything, costumes, sticker albums, lunch boxes, watches, dolls, rap albums... Anyway, sucked to the limit of where the strength of the character immortalized by Robert Englund could withstand.In current horror movies, we have a really incredible degree of realism. A perfectly cut throat, believable blood in heaps, a burned face deformed and grotesque. As we look back on these same effects in the past, it's impossible not to laugh, as they were so outdated that they ended up aging very badly. Despite all that, 1984's ""The Nightmare Hour"" is a good movie. Directed by Wes Craven, the film brought innovations to horror cinema, with pop elements leaping across the screen. It was a great success. It really took a new approach to the franchise, and it came... in 1994, with A New Nightmare at the hands of Wes Craven himself. So it was already a question of looking with suspicion for the realization of a ""more of the same"" by producer Platinum Dunes. Yes, the one that delivered Lost Soul and the remakes of Death asks for Carpooling, Horror in Amityville, Friday the 13th and The Chainsaw Massacre.Although Leatherface and Michael Myers also enjoy prestige in front of slasher moviegoers, Jason and Freddy are more mass creatures within the globalization of horror scheme. Icons from the 1980s, the characters are easily recognizable to people outside the circuit, given the hockey mask and the specific costumes of the killer who attacks people in their nightmares. That said, the task of reintroducing Freddy Krueger into 2000s culture was a challenging one, as the filmmakers had on hand a project that would hardly have the same magnetism to the dramatic performance of an actor other than Robert Englund, in costume since the first film. .Given the above, the producers took some directions that they believed to be the appropriate choices for the franchise. Here are some notes. Freddy is sadistic in the screenplay by Eric Heisserer and Wesley Strick, but he lacks impact, even though Jackie Earle Haley honors the costume and story of the nightmare antagonist. Samuel Bayer, known for directing Nirvana's Smell Like Teen Spirit, a ""classic"" of the music video, understands audiovisual language, but we don't exactly know if the bad conduct of A Nightmare on Elm Street is justified by its ineffectiveness or by the interference of the producers from Platinum Dunes, the company responsible for rescuing the slashers at the time, captained by the frantic and intense Michael Bay, the ""filmmaker of explosions"" in Hollywood cinema.The story begins by introducing us to a group of young people who are dreaming of a terrible character. He is disfigured and has knives for fingers. Strangely sharing the same dream, the boys realize that there is a connection between them, which involves an old reckoning between the strange Freddy and his parents.Bay is the master of lack of subtlety and it even amuses at times, but someone had to have told the animated producer and his management that the lack of some limits can put things to waste. The lack of suggestion that leads to an excess of explanations is another necessity of the text to turn Freddy Krueger into a creature presented to the public through didacticism, which lets any portion of the character's dubiousness escape, something that gets even worse when the film decides to humanize too much. His monster and even throw off the public with the possibility that Krueger was innocent. If we add all this to the fact that we have an apathetic final girl, without the charisma and grit of the predecessor version of A Hora do Nightmare, the remake becomes, in fact, a nightmare of almost 100 minutes, with a macabre figure that despite the excellent The actor's dramatic performance that gives it life, is too generic as a construction still in the script.Samuel Bayer's film intelligently uses many elements of the original work, which shows a certain attention and respect for its source. Another positive is the agony created through sleep deprivation. Very well crafted, these moments of exhaustion are really blunt. The scenes of violence and death are also satisfying, but they don't stand out as they should. This new version of the film tries to use this ""dream excuse"" to create its moments of tension, but fails. The exaggeration is so great when it comes to presenting the atmosphere of horror that it ends up being tiring. Even to turn on any light, the track plays its terrifying notes. The truth is that the film is unfortunately far from being adapted in an original way.A Nightmare on Elm Street, version 2010, dared to describe in its file that it is inspired by the characters of Wes Craven, when in fact its best scenes come from the 1984 film, in addition to some modifications in a ready-made structure. The final girl played by Rooney Mara has her last name changed, the Freddy story has the mythology shattered, the famous death similar to the end of Johhny Depp's character in the original is abandoned and Elm Street, location that gives the movie its name, badly is covered in the story. Other than that, the remake did more than add a little bit there and delete it here, which makes the fact sheet a shame, a plagiarism when it doesn't assume it has much more to do with your starting point than merely a recap of characters.What makes 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street interesting, besides the positive points already described, is the work of the script, which explicitly shows the origin of Freddy Krueger and goes beyond the text by Wes Craven, which is limited to saying that the parents of the kids killed by Krueger in nightmares killed him in the past. Here, the reasons go further and give a totally current face to the villain and end up justifying several connections within the film, such as the real reason why Krueger has gone right after the people he kills - or tries to kill - and what they had to do. Participation in his tragic and violent death years before. And, without giving more data to spoil the fun of those who want to see this film, the writers did a good job of bringing the previous film's reality closer to today, using a very current theme as the starting point for all the killing.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
90,Falconeer,Sign of the Times..,7,7 July 2010,"Apparently the 80's was a more innocent time, and it was enough to only hint at the true evil of a character like Fred Kruger. Now in 2010, with the help of the world wide web and like technology, we are more jaded, and we have a bigger appetite for twisted subject matter. Nowadays, we want to see it all, and the new ""Nightmare On elm Street"" gives a new generation just that, while shocking some of us fans of the original. Thankfully this is not a straight, by the numbers remake of the original, classic film. It is a reworking of the story, injected with a new perspective and adding some layers to the tale of the evil child killer, burnt alive by the neighborhood parents of his young victims. I'm surprised to say that i like every single new idea that they used to bring this story to a new level. I found it especially fascinating to actually see all that was only hinted at in the original. We get to see a very creepy Fred Kruger, before the burning, and we get to see where he took the children, and we are given more than an idea of what he actually did to them to cause such rage among the parents of this community. People have complained that ""they turned Kruger into a pedophile for this remake,"" but i remember, even as a 13 year old watching the original in the theater, I got the idea that Fred was doing more with the children than just killing them. They just could not get very much into that controversial theme in 1984. nowadays however, we are ready to handle the rougher stuff, and i personally think that the Fred Kruger character is so much more sinister and horrifying now that we truly see into his soul. And he is uglier in this, looking more like a true burn victim than a horror movie monster. After getting over the icky feeling of looking at this new creation, i realized that we are supposed to feel repulsed when we look at this sick monster; Freddy Kruger is not supposed to be cute and cuddly, and he became something like that in all those brainless sequels. He was funny, and people actually rooted for him, but not this time. All those silly one-liners are gone, and Fred wastes little time before ripping his victims apart. The makers of this film made the right move by playing this one straight, with no comic relief. The end result is a tense, claustrophobic experience. The most effective thing about this film is the frequent scenes of young kids, who appear to their older selves, to warn them about the horror to come. The kids provide lots of genuinely creepy moments, and the teens who are fighting to stay awake are not drinking coffee and taking Sta-Awake pills; now they are taking Ritalin pills by the handful and injecting liquid adrenaline! This harder form of constant medicating lends a more frantic and desperate air to the goings on. I like how the names of some characters have changed; it makes it an all-new experience, so that fans of the original won't be able to guess who is who and what will happen to each character. The identity of the main character is even kept a mystery until midway through; I loved that i could not guess what would happen just by being familiar with the original. And cleverly a familiar line from the original would pop up to make old fans smile to remember, things like ""I'm your boyfriend now,"" etc.. And a couple short scenes were direct tributes to the original, mainly the bathtub scene, which utilized the same exact camera angle. But quickly this new version would go right back to being it's own, very different film. i thought i would hate this, but the ideas were very clever, and i found that i enjoyed this as a new and separate film. The cinematography is effective and dark, the boiler room and the preschool are both very scary. Even the acting was above average, especially for a horror film. And while i normally hate CGI, the little CGI does not dominate this, underrated film enough to be at all off-putting. do people hate this because it is not a frame by frame remake of the original? C'mon, how lame and unexciting would that be? Give it a chance.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
91,Vivekmaru45,Where was Wes Craven when this garbage was being filmed ?,4,9 September 2010,"I finally saw this pathetic excuse of a remake. I couldn't believe my eyes. Horrendous casting. I think these guys were picked off the street like stray dogs. Absolutely characterless actors. The film relies heavily on its loud sound effects and laughable special effects.I have one thing to ask to the producers. Why couldn't they have hired Wes Craven himself to direct? If not maybe Stephen Hopkins or Renny Harlin. I would have hired Jack Sholder who directed A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985).The plot is the same (sigh), as the original by Wes Craven.Freddy is a pervert who preys on the kids at the preschool in which he works as a Gardner. He is caught and corned by the kids parents and burnt alive. He miraculously survives being barbecued (don't ask me how), and torments the dreams of the now surviving kids who have become teenagers. He kills the teens at his leisure in their dreams, and no one is able to suspect that it is his work, except our heroine Nancy.Its up to Nancy to stop this rubber masked menace. The idiot who plays Freddy is Jackie Earle Haley, wearing a ridiculously obvious rubber mask.I bet Wes Craven is furious with Samuel Bayer but there is nothing he can do about it. The garbage has been created and cannot be recycled. The sad demise of the Hollywood Horror Film Industry.4/10 just because of the sound effects, nothing else. Wake up Wes!!! Time to take matters into your own hands.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
92,FieCrier,Nightmarishly bad CGI on Elm Street,2,21 November 2010,"While I don't worship the original, I still wasn't keen on ever seeing this remake - but a friend had rented it and consequently I did sit through it. Thankfully I didn't pay to see it.According to IMDb, director Samuel Bayer directed ""Absolute Garbage"" before ANoES, and ""Fiasco Heights"" after; either title would be an adequate summation of this remake.The movie kicks off with opening credits that are both scrawled in chalk and printed clearly, as though they couldn't decide which look to go with and decided redundancy was a good compromise.Poorly-written, poorly developed, poorly acted characters have ""nightmares"" which entirely fail to capture the feel of a nightmare, in which they are threatened and sliced by Freddy. Freddy's dialogue is poor, the voice is poor, and the effects they added to his voice laughably bad. They decided to make him look more like a real burn victim, which is fine, but they also decided they didn't want to make him look *too much* like a burn victim, which is silly. They also decided to have part of his face filled in with CGI via a green screen mask, and indeed part of his face looks distractingly like CGI.The worst CGI is in the scene where Freddy presses himself against a wall from behind the wallpaper. I don't think there is any way to watch that scene in particular without being taken out of the movie and having to laugh or comment on how bad it looks. As a side note, Nancy's wallpaper is surprisingly dull and stodgy looking for a teenager.In quite a lot of shots in the movie, objects have a jittery or blurry or shimmering look to them similar to what one gets from poor quality video or the awkward look of bad pan & scan applied to a widescreen film. This is particularly evident in shots where the camera pans and dollies simultaneously. I'm not sure what caused this or where the fault lies.There are some moments taken from the original, like Nancy's bathtub scene. Why they bothered isn't clear. It's as if they said; let's redo that bathtub scene, but there shouldn't be anything sexual or scary about it; let's instead make it briefer and pointless.One of the silliest scenes is when Nancy's mother tries to get Nancy to give her a photo while simultaneously repeatedly denying that Nancy went to school with the people in the photo. Indeed, the memory problems of the kids are not really handled well. They never noticed they didn't remember their childhoods before, never noticed that the pictures of their childhoods were removed from photo albums before? If Nancy's never seen a photo of herself as a child before, how does she even recognize herself in one when she does?Another bad scene is when Kyle ""sad face"" Gallner seemingly arbitrarily decides that when they were children they lied to their parents about what Freddy did with them. He goes from supporting Rooney ""expressionless"" Mara to taking off with his father.Yet another ridiculous aspect has to do with the backstory, wherein they have Freddy being employed as a full-time gardener by a very small daycare center which probably has no need of even a part-time one. Equally ridiculous, the daycare center allows him to live and sleep in the unfinished, unrealistically cavernous basement of the daycare center. The owners must be rather dodgy, I guess.Somewhat inexplicably, director Bayer and writer Eric Heisserer are attached to the sequel, listed as being in pre-production for 2012 as of this moment. It must be because this remake did good business; it's certainly not because they made a good movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
93,Superunknovvn,"Not surprisingly, but sadly disappointing",4,27 September 2010,"The original ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is my favorite horror movie of all time. A remake to me seemed to be set up for a failure from the get go, but of course, I had to see it.The result doesn't make me - and most fans, I'd imagine - very happy: The pacing is all wrong, the imagery and the imagination of the original are gone and have been replaced by cheap CGI, soulless quick cuts and cheap jumps. The backstory has been changed for the worse, the teenage characters (and the actors who portray them) are shallow and annoying, and finally Jackie Earle Haley, hard as he may try, can't hold a candle to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger.ANOES 2010 is neither very thrilling, nor fun. Its washed colours and the downbeat feel of the whole child-molester-backstory make the movie more depressing than anything else. I do understand that they wanted to make Freddy scary again and get back to the nitty-gritty of the character, but firstly, I never had a problem with him being a wisecracking joker. And secondly, I believe it's pretty much impossible to take a character whose story and appearance have already been exposed so much, and make him creepy again. In this version of ANOES Freddy's really just boring. The one one-liner they did give him (about ""hanging out"" with a guy that's - how original - hanging from a hook or a rope or something like that), is pretty lame.Still, for some reason I would like to go back and re-watch the movie. The original premise is just so good that even Michael Bay couldn't screw it up entirely. The few things that they did ""re-imagine"" are not successful, but some of them are at least interesting.As a ""Nightmare""-fan, I'll always embrace every other entry in the franchise, but this here remake is never going to get high notes from me. What saddens me the most, is that this new beginning once and for all ends the Endlund-era and the original series. Well, all things must end. I just wish that what followed would have been half as a good as what we had before.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
94,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,5,2 May 2010,"A bland, dull and unnecessary remake of Wes Craven's 1984 classic of the same name. Like the original, this film captures the nightmarish qualities during dream sequences, however it lingers too long and frequently in the scares of Freddy approaching rather than getting to the point. All the actors do a wonderful job at reinventing characters, especially Haley as the new Freddy (Englund played Kruger in ten films!), however the remake doesn't do as good of a job reinventing a classic movie. The creativity is turned down a few notches, with Freddy choosing to just slice and stab his victims rather than pull anything not overdone and not expected.** (out of four)",A Nightmare on Elm Street
95,DarthVoorhees,A boring soulless butchering of a classic,2,9 October 2010,"Platinum Dunes needs to simply stop. They are nothing more than hacks. They deserve none of their ""success"". It's simply too easy to take a well crafted horror film and remake it. Platinum Dunes doesn't do this however. They take a well crafted horror film butcher it of whatever charm or originality it may have once had and expect the audiences to embrace it. This production is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' sure but it's as if it is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' to the lowest degree. It merely tells the story and that's it. It doesn't even feel like a remake of the original Craven classic but rather it feels as if it is the remake of a remake.What is wrong with this film? Well for starters I simply don't care about anyone or anything in it. The film doesn't have a single character in it. The film is inhabited by a complete cast of plot pieces including Freddy Krueger himself. The film is full of bores saying boring things. Rooney Mara is by far the most wooden horror heroine I've ever seen. She has no substance, no charisma, not even a pulse in the delivering of her dialogue. Heather Lagenkamp may not have been a master actress but she was excellent as Nancy because she embodied spunk and feminine strength. A character like Freddy Krueger doesn't work if there isn't a woman strong enough to fight him. Heather Lagenkamp and Lisa Wilcox were great heroines because they played off Englund's Krueger so well. Mara gives Jackie Earle Haley nothing to work with but then again he doesn't give her anything either.I really dislike Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy. Is it such a foreign concept that only one actor should portray a role? Recasting Freddy Krueger was a slap in the face to any horror fan. Not only did Platinum Dunes recast Krueger but they had the audacity to insult Englund's interpretation of the character. Every bit of promotional material I saw for this film had nothing tremendously positive to say about Englund. Haley said that his interpretation was scarier because he didn't ""joke"" around. Okay, why do you do this? Freddy Krueger is nothing without Robert Englund. You obviously aren't creative enough to create a horror character like Englund was so it might be smart to keep your mouth shut. I was willing to forgive this however on the basis that this interpretation of Krueger was the least bit original, it isn't. Haley is a decent actor, excellent even in 'Little Children'. His Krueger however is nothing more than recycled Rorschach. There is nothing the least bit original that Haley brings to the role. I was legitimately bored by Haley's Krueger. Englund was fun to watch even in a bad 'Elm Street' film because you could tell he so loved the role and had fun doing it. Haley is in many respects the anti-Englund in his Krueger. His portrayal is pretentious and simply dull.The lone thing that saves this mess from a complete bomb rating is how it plays with Krueger's back story. I sort of liked the way the flashbacks to the preschool were handled. It really didn't help or hurt the film. It merely offered a different approach to the origin of Freddy. Which isn't really all that important in my book. What Freddy became is far more interesting than what he was. I don't really want to sit through a movie that glorifies a pedophile child killer. That being said Haley's portrayal of the pre-burnt Freddy offers some interesting and tragic insight into the role. He seems like a giant child and not like what we might have pictured him as. It merely offers some food for thought, something to think about as you try to comprehend this mess.One thing you could always count on was that Freddy would come back for a sequel. I hope Haley's Krueger is dead and buried for good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
96,acidburn-10,I could have lived without this,3,29 December 2010,"All we seem to be getting is remakes of old slasher movies, some good some bad and in this case this is one of the bad ones. For a start nothing new has been added apart from tweaking the storyline, which made this movie really annoying and frustrating. Like some of the death scenes are just watered down from the original, and the newly added special effects are just lousy.It has really bad pacing issues in the second act, some seriously questionably acting from the young cast, and a lot of ideas that weren't fully realized mostly due to budgetary reasons (or so I heard). If any remake screamed potential it was this one, yet the opportunity was blown.The new guy playing Freddy isn't fit to play Robert England's shoes and the new freddy face is awful, looks more like a skinned cat than a burned face. And the rest of the cast are just 90210 lookalikes, the new Nancy was wimpy and had no spunk, unlike Heather Langenkamp and the others were just forgettable.All in all what a mess doesn't rank anywhere near the original Freddy movies even part 5 is better than this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
97,Christian_Dimartino,"Lacks scares, but a very mild recommendation do to Jackie Earle Haley.",6,23 May 2010,"Jackie Earle Haley stars as Freddy Kruger, that burned face S.O.B. in the re-imagining of A Nightmare on Elm Street. Yes, Hollywood has run out of ideas. Yes, they have to stop redoing every classic scary movie. I haven't seen all of the re-imaginings. But I did see the most recent one, and to some surprise, I won't bash it.I know that nearly anything Michael Bay touches dies. But what keeps A Nightmare on Elm street alive is the inspired casting choice of Jackie Earle Haley. The is one creepy guy,as we've seen in the past. And he is the main momentum that this film has.Everyone has seen the original. So I ain't going into the plot. I think i'll start with it's flaws. Well, the main flaw that A nightmare on Elm Street has is that this movie lacks scares. And we need them in a scary movie, obviously. The film lacks scares. But it is an OK hour and a half spent. There is worse. Like if I have to sit through Rob Zombie's Halloween again. That would be worse. Hollywood has got to stop with these remakes. They are getting too much for me. This one is rare. The others blow. Why keep remaking every damn movie? Why don't you let genius' like Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, or Quentin Tarantino or Spike Jonze do something? They are the best there is. Again, there is worse entertainment out there. So if you don't have anything else to see, then enjoy watching Freddy slice up retarded teenagers for an hour and a half. It's kind of fun. Otherwise, if you're a smart person, go see Iron man 2. You can't go wrong there. Depends on what you're into. Freddy is OK this time, thanks to Haley, and if they make a sequel, I wouldn't mind showing up.A Nightmare on Elm Street: B-",A Nightmare on Elm Street
98,Darkside-Reviewer,Produced by Michael Bay,5,31 August 2020,"I am a huge fan of Freddy Kreuger and the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise. The first time I saw A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) was on VHS in the late 90s and it seriously scared the living hell out of me so much so that I didn't sleep for two nights straight. That first experience was the reason I fell in love with horror and slasher movies growing up.I first saw A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010) in theatre's on the first day of it's release. I was looking forward to seeing Freddy Kreuger on the big screen again the only other time I got to see Freddy on the big screen was back in (2003) when (Freddy Vs Jason) was first released into theatre's. I sadly didn't enjoy this movie very much even on the big screen it was a huge let down I was at least hoping for some half decent kills but it even failed to provide that much entertainment.There are only two things about this movie I like the first being (Jackie Earl Haley) performance as Freddy Kreuger his performance is definitely the best thing about this movie he's no (Robert England) but he was definitely the best choice to play Freddy Kreuger in this remake. The other thing I liked about this remake is that it at least attempted to be scary and atmospheric instead of going the Friday the 13th (2009) route of being a crappy Slasher/Comedy movie.My main complaint with this movie is that it's basically just a copy and paste remake of the (1984) original. There are no original ideas and no creativity put into the movies storyline just an hour and a half of jump scares and fake screams. The characters are bland and forgettable with little to no character development or personality.I was seriously let down by the death scenes in this movie. The Nightmare on Elm Street series has some of the most memorable and creative death scenes in Horror movie history even back when Freddy Kreuger was cracking jokes about the Nintendo Power Glove he still exploded some heads ""Literally"" giving us some fun, unique and bloody kills that make even the later Nightmare movies so entertainingly fun to watch even to this day.I don't recommend owning this movie on Blu Ray or UHD/4K unless you want to complete your horror movie collection.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
99,DonFishies,"Watch for Jackie, stay for laughably bad acting and unintentional hilarity",6,30 April 2010,"One, two, Freddy's coming for you Just hearing the start of this tune is enough to send chills down anyone's spine. Without a doubt, one of, if not the most, revered killer in the pantheon of the horror genre is Freddy Krueger. When Wes Craven brought this menace to life (in no small part thanks to Robert Englund) back in 1984, he invigorated a stale genre and helped build New Line into a successful studio. And while the character and the franchise were eventually beaten to death, the legacy of the original Nightmare on Elm Street has continued to live on.And after the initial success of the remake of Friday the 13th last year, it was fairly obvious a remake of Nightmare would eventually show up. And while Friday was a rather lovingly made homage of ridiculous cheese based around the first handful of films in that series, Nightmare sticks entirely to being a remake/reimagining of the original film. Nancy (Rooney Mara) and her friends are all being plagued by nightmares involving a creepy burn victim named Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley) who has a habit of waving around a rather sadistic looking glove with blades on the fingers. The bodies begin to pile up, and they quickly realize they need to avoid falling asleep or they may die too.Right from the opening credits and initial prologue, I knew the film was going to take itself much too seriously. While Friday was played mainly for laughs and seemed rather keenly aware of its ridiculously goofy brethren, this film often seems to forget the fun packed into some of the original Nightmare films. Even at in its most ludicrous sequences, the film plays itself out straight-faced and dead serious. Sure, there are plenty of intentionally funny moments, but the cast (outside of Earle Haley) never seems able to waver into showcasing anything even remotely humorous. I doubt the filmmakers really hoped the audience would laugh at how unintentionally hilarious some of the more deliberately serious scenes become, but there is no possible way to not find yourself laughing at how laborious some scenes feel.These scenes are not helped by the fact that there is virtually zero charisma from any of the actors on screen. Sure audiences flock to movies like Nightmare because they want to see the silly teenagers get butchered up and killed in increasingly violent fashion. But for a film that seems to pride itself on how serious it is, I found almost every character was devoid of personality or any reason to even attempt caring about them. We felt for Heather Langenkamp and her struggle to stay alive in the original film. Here, I could care less for any of these characters. Even the parents played by Connie Britton and a sadly underused Clancy Brown seem to be stretching to their wits end to make their characters matter in the grand scheme of things. I was not expecting depth and development, but I was expecting some form of tangible reason for not wishing all of these kids were brutally murdered. Sadly, the filmmakers did not feel the same way.The films visuals fare a little better, but not by much. Many scenes from the original film pop up in the remake, and the majority of them work quite well. They do not necessarily look or feel original, but they do a decent job working as a credit to the work done previous. But some of the more inventive elements just look half-assed, and at least one of the moments taken right out of the original film looks better in the original film. I was not disappointed by them, but I think the filmmakers could have done a bit more to make them feel like their own. I did dig hearing a few of the same musical cues though, that was a great touch on first-time director Sam Bayer's part, as was the lack of a idiotic 3D element to the film.What I surprisingly did enjoy was the hint of backstory they gave Freddy. We are never really given a rather complete backgrounder on the character in any one of the franchise's eight films (merely pieces we had to connect ourselves), but here he is given a small but substantial backstory. And while other remakes like Friday, Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre humanized and made us feel for the monsters at the heart of each film, we never lose sight of how sick and deranged Freddy Krueger is. We only end up feeling more disgusted. Thankfully, the film does not dwell on the origins of the character, but I did enjoy what writers Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer did with the character and how he relates to the main cast of teenagers. It was a nice touch, and I was thankful did not alter the audience's perception of the character and his actions.But the real only reason anyone should watch the film is for Earle Haley's interpretation of Freddy. He does not quite surpass Englund's masterful performance as the vicious killer, but he puts his own creepy and terrifying mark on the character. He plays him as both horrifying and hilarious in one breath. The voice is a bit too close to Rorschach, but his threatening and eerie tone is more than enough to be scary. His awesome performance is only complimented by his repulsively vile makeup that makes the character actually look like a burn victim. He is the only consistently great element in the film, and makes it worth the price of admission alone.A Nightmare on Elm Street is not a good remake, but it is not quite bad either. It is decent, and is a worthwhile watch for Earle Haley on his own. I just wish the movie was as much fun as he seems to be having playing the part.6/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",A Nightmare on Elm Street
100,jp_91,A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) Awful remake!,4,1 September 2020,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (2010) is one of the worst remakes ever made, a crime for the original film. Jackie Earle Haley is a great actor but don't as Freddy Krueger, his performance was weak and simple. The young actors are bad playing their parts, even the future great actress Rooney Mara was a blast as Nancy, the next year she showed her good acting, but in ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" she was so bad. The script changes are pathetic and the Freddy's nightmares are bored, the original Freddy had awesome surreal nightmares. The cinematography is cheap, the film direction is weak, the special makeup effects are the worst of all, Freddy's looking is totally stupid and the digital effects are the worst I have seen in a remake. Some good points are the red-green colors in the nightmares like in the original franchise films and the tribute scenes to the whole franchise (including ""Freddy vs. Jason"") are nice. This movie is bad, one of the worst remakes ever made.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
101,nathanmanson,It's not as bad as everyone is making out,6,15 February 2021,I was expecting a really bad film after reading some reviews but it definitely wasn't that bad. There's a few jump scares in there. The story wasn't hard to follow. It was going to give the film a 7 but at literally the last 5 seconds of the film he jumps out the mirror and kills her mum. Why isn't he dead what's the point in that. There isn't even a sequel.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
102,LoneWolfAndCub,A lot of good ideas that unfortunately never pan out,6,9 August 2010,"Wes Craven's original A Nightmare on Elm is one of my favourite horror films, so I came into this remake with slightly raised expectations. The 1984 original was made on a low budget, with unknown actors and a fairly unknown director at the time (having directed The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes in the 70's). It performed spectacularly at the box-office, spawned one of the most well-known villains in cinema and seven sequels. Samuel Bayer, who has only had experience directing music videos, accepted quite the challenge when saying yes to direct this reboot produced by Platinum Dunes' Michael Bay. Overall the movie isn't terrible; however, it lacks substance and true scares.The story is fairly similar to the original story, with some slight tweaks here and there I will not go into for fear of spoiling them. I will mention the concept of micronaps that was introduced, but underused. It is brought up two or three times during the entire movie but other than that is kinda just left to the side after awhile. Bayer could have used these to his advantaged, and really created a fantastic dream-like atmosphere throughout the entire film, making us question what is reality and what is dream. Also, a character who could have played a key role was severely underused, and their demise is anticlimactic and it feels the character was just their to raise the very low body count. On the topic of characters, they are all bland and underwritten. There is no one that really sticks out as interesting, and it is hard to care for someone you know absolutely nothing about. Plus, most die fairly early on, leaving two to carry a fair chunk of the movie. The actors do a pretty good job with their roles; however, except Connie Britton as Nancy's mother, who is pretty bland and obviously does not want to be in the movie.I suppose everyone wants to know how the new Freddy holds up. Jackie Earle Hayley has big shoes to fill, as Robert Englund's Freddy is beyond famous. Personally I think Hayley holds his own, and creates an incredibly creepy and sinister Krueger who is only let down by the make-up (which is just not as creepy as the original) and the fact Bayer reveals his face way too early on, hence the 'scare factor' is significantly dropped. Also, Bayer relies WAY (I cannot emphasise this enough) too heavily on cheap scares which get old very fast. The concept of A Nightmare on Elm Street is frightening enough in itself, coupled with such a disturbing villain, that creating atmosphere and scaring the audience is easy without having to rely on loud noises.Conclusion? Well, overall it IS fairly entertaining and goes pretty fast. The dream sequences are well crafted and Hayley's Krueger is enough to keep one interested. Unfortunately there is a lot of wasted potential and if the film was in the hands of a more experienced director (and not such a shitty producer) it could have been fantastic.3/5",A Nightmare on Elm Street
103,apryla-58795,Actors performances were strong but JEH ruined it!,3,13 July 2019,"I didn't even know that this movie existed until I came across it on one of the movie apps I subscribe to. This had potential to be really good-actors are good and the atmosphere was foreboding but Jackie Earle Haley just didn't fit in this role. I really like him as an actor and the scenes where he just acted like the gardener were very good but taking on the FK role is kind of a tall order and he just didn't fit the bill. His height definitely worked against him. FK needs to be tall and imposing and the shortness factor didn't help. I had read that this got really bad reviews but I decided to try it out anyways and now I can see why. There just isn't anything scary here which is unfortunate because it did have potential to be pretty good. Connie Britton, Clancy Brown, Kellan Lutz, Thomas Dekker and Katie Cassidy were all wasted in this. Kyle Gallner is enjoyable to watch onscreen. Rooney Mara said that this movie almost made her quit acting...wish she would have. She's so full of herself and takes herself way too seriously. She's annoying in roles because you can just tell she thinks she's an amazing actress but she'd be a lot better if she didn't act like acting is akin to saving lives. It's entertainment not rocket science or brain surgery.There's nothing memorable here so watch something else.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

In this reboot, it seems they attempt to give us a reason why. Who cares? is the answer. There is just nothing fun about this movie. And no...it's not because of all the sequels that went campy, it's because you can tell EVERYONE involved was miserable. You would think people involved in a franchise would at least be fans. It didn't seem like anyone knew why they were making this movie.There's actually a moment in the movie where they attempt to justify Freddy's past by victim blaming.

105,t_atzmueller,"Nightmare on Elm Street fans: avoid, avoid, avoid!",3,27 September 2011,"Right, spoiler alert: this movie was miserable. Spoiler over.If you, like me, are a 30-something horror-fan, there's almost no way you could have avoided the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""-hype. Admit it: like me you bought the comic-book, the Freddy mask and plastic claw and you watched the ""Freddies Nightmares"" despite the show being awful. Yes, you were doodling Freddy figures in your math books! It didn't even matter that the franchise became more teenage-compatible with every film, that Freddy had become far too camp to be taken serious so that even your mom stopped telling you 'not to watch that gruesome stuff' at one point.Eventually you parted with corny ol' Freddy, venturing towards more realistic movies like ""Henry – Confessions of a Serial Killer"", which reminded the jaded fans that serial killers weren't funny fellows who'd sign autographs with fake razor-claws. It also reminded us that Freddy had 'interesting' story before becoming a dreamland boogieman, fathered by Alice Cooper; a particularly bloody, brutal story which the prior films only hinted at.I was rooting for this movie, the main reason being that Haley Osmond, who's presence was the highlight in both ""Little Children"" and ""Watchman"". After all, this is the age of the charismatic, sophisticated psychopath like ""The Dark Knight"" Joker or Anton Chirug in ""No Country for Old Men"". Yes, Osmond was the perfect candidate for the role of Freddy Krueger 2.0.The more ""realistic make-up"" seemed like a good idea, giving Freddy a harder, more realistic edge and at the same time allowing Osmond to articulate his features. Could we have imagined that they would put a rubber bag over his face? Did we believe that the script-writers would dare to give Osmond one-liners that would have made the 80's Freddy blush? That they would cast two-bit actors that belong in a ""Saw""- or ""Hostel""-sequel but have no business in a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film? The good news: by estimation Hollywood is almost through butchering our beloved screen serial killers, now that Jason Vorhees has become a degenerate survivalist, Michael Myers has been turned into a beard-wielding hobo and Freddy, well, he certainly owes more to the Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"" then the child-murdering monster we had all loved back in the day.If you ever liked the original movies, I'd recommend you keep this one out of your DVD player.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

107,ClaytonDavis,"Admire the change, hate the execution",5,21 May 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is an iconic series starring Robert Englund as the funny and scary Freddy Krueger. This remake (one of many which are being launched these days, next up is Chucky), is an admirable attempt at a reboot of the franchise. It isn't the best of the year, not by far, but I can appreciate the style and attempt of differences director Samuel Bayer went for, but with a horror film comes bad acting, bad story arch, and bad drama. The changes Bayer makes are quite interesting and should be noticed as the best changes at a horror series so far, which bar wasn't set too high. The film plays homage to many of the films in the Freddy series and is not a shot-for-shot remake like others we've seen. *cough Psycho cough*Jackie Earle Haley on paper was the perfect candidate for Freddy and infuses his own interpretation of the doomed monster. The film is decent, not near great.**1/2/****",A Nightmare on Elm Street
108,Ali_John_Catterall,Zzzzzzzzzz,1,26 July 2010,"The best horror movie remake of recent years is Alexandre Aja's take on Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. This is basically just a fact. By contrast, one of the foulest is the 2009 retooling of Craven's equally iconic Last House On The Left - a slicker, and thus even sicker prospect, in some respects, than the censor-baiting, Manson murders-inspired original. Lacking any meaningful context, this reactionary, conservative flick exists purely as a hard-nosed commercial venture, yet more grisly grist to the multiplex mill.This third re-imagining of a Craven classic isn't quite as queasy a prospect - but it's also nowhere near as effective as Aja's effort. The real problem with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 is: it's really unbelievably dull. Bloodless, we guess, being the apposite term. And that's problematic for a slasher film.In fairness, we're given plenty of warning. For many, the phrase ""A Michael Bay production"" denotes the exact opposite of a seal of quality; Bay being the accountant behind a rash of duff, deeply unwanted horror re-runs including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Amityville Horror, The Hitcher and Friday the 13th. Not to mention his own duff, self-directed efforts like Pearl Harbor, The Island, and the forthcoming Transformers III (deep joy). Films that shriek and gurn and woof, from a producer who must have a personal account at Homebase owing to all those kitchen sinks he keeps flinging away.For Bay, a film isn't quite right unless all character, subtlety and nuance has been hacked out, and an audience left with partial deafness. Essentially, he's the wrong guy to entrust with horror movies, in which insinuation, suggestion and sickeningly slow build-ups rule the hour. Bay is remaking Hitchcock's The Birds for 2013. They'll probably be the size of dragons, with H-Bombs for guano.Yet, oddly, Bay and Bayer's Nightmare isn't even powered with that kind of bombast - just shot-for-shot, scene-aping filmmaking, as if all concerned were rendered paralysed with reverence for the source. The remake tells the same story, more or less (we're not going to bother repeating it - remote Eskimos could reel off the basic set-up); although this time round our superannuated-looking teens wise-up to their predicament a hell of a lot faster. Access to things like cell phones and the Internet obviously helps, 25 years on, although the film would also have you believe that Googling will allow you to pinpoint anybody you like in seconds. Especially if their name is as unique and esoteric as 'Lisa Harper'. Still, there's a cute joke about computers' 'sleep modes'.Talking of jokes, one of Freddy's trademarks was an admirable ability to find humour in the most awful situations, albeit ones he'd usually caused in the first place. However, Krueger didn't start out in stand-up mode, and the producers have respected that here. Trouble is, we're so used to Mister Melty cracking gags every time he offs somebody, like some psycho James Bond, that you really miss his way with a terrible one-liner. ""I was just patting him"" he comments, after ripping a pet dog to bits. What? Is that it? No ""It's a dog's life""? Or ""My bite is worse than my bark""? Not even ""I bet that gave you 'paws' for thought""? (I'm here all week.) This film may carry an 18 certificate, but it's really just the usual exercise in PG-13 thrills and jump-scares, further replacing some rather creepy, organic effects (those celebrated bendy bedroom walls) with perfunctory CGI. There's the interesting addition of 'micro-naps'; tiny waking dreams affording Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley) even more opportunities to flex his fingernails. And there's a half-hearted stab at a deeper, more topical issue (certainly a 1980s issue, though glossed over in the first version) that of witch-hunting adults, who may be just as monstrous, if not more so, as their prey; a subtext that peters away again soon after it's raised. Moral ambiguity hurts Gumby's brain! For modern audiences, with instant access to horrors fictional and real, this cannot hope to carry the same impact Craven's genre classic had on that more innocent Pepsi-swilling, Atari-jabbing, Rubik's Cube-wrangling generation.In fact, it's all about as alarming as a woozy post-prandial Sunday afternoon spent leafing through the magazines with the telly on in the background and a moment of vague annoyance when one of those little leaflets wafts out and you pop it back in or more likely leave it on the sofa with all the other supplements and the noise from the TV has become so ambient that you barely even register it until your eyelids start drooping and the roast and red wine you've consumed an hour before is settling nicely and wouldn't it be lovely to have a little nap right here and - careful!!

109,baileycrawly,Wow.,2,26 October 2019,"It's not Jackie Earle Haley's fault that this is bad.
It's not the fault of the other actors either (although the performances were weak at best from most of them).
When you have a horror franchise as iconic and recognizable as Elm Street, it's practically untouchable; you can play with a remake all you want, but if it's not Robert under the makeup, it's simply not Freddy, and if it's not Heather Langencamp, it's just not Nancy.
This remake suffers from overdependence on CGI, poor writing, hit-or-miss acting, and the element of jumpscares. The original Elm Street that Wes Craven created and saw to fruition, wasn't reliant on that. It was simple horror, and that was it. It didn't have to have a gimmick.
This just felt like a cheap imitation wannabe of the original. It didn't sit well with me. I don't think I would even recommend a single viewing of it, even for regular Elm Street fans. It's just not good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

And instead of reaching redundancy with all the other chimer-ins, I'll cut my two cents to just a cent and a half.The new Nancy was completely unappealing and had zero charm. She wasn't cute, she wasn't spunky, and she wasn't a fighter, all three of which were nicely exhibited by Heather Langenkamp in the original. Mara's Nancy doesn't speak up until the last two minutes of the film! Until that point, she reminds one of those nerd girls who hide in the corner at parties, darting their eyes around while clutching a cup of beer, almost daring themselves to take a sip. The shot of her holed-up in her room, bug-eyeing her mother in a low-whisper, speaks volumes.The blonde looked WAY too old to be a high school student, but at least had a hint of conviction to her situation. Of course, she's the ""trick"" character for the audience.The guys were all Twilight/Jonas Brother facsimiles who seemed stoned half the time; acting was fair, but did not engage.Kills were decent, but most were re-creations with a computer, so there really wasn't anything to add on to them. That bendy, unnatural appearance of dreamscapes and the glove bursting through people is so overused by this point, that it has no punch. The music, at least, borrowed a few chords from the original score (SORELY needed for a flick this lackluster).Finally, Freddy. Instead of doing the usual praising of Englund and ripping of Haley, I'll stick to the basics. Haley is too short, and too slight, to be a threatening villain. During the full body shots, or of him at a distance, it looked like a teenager who hadn't filled out yet was goofing in a rental costume. And, in a sense, his make-up is almost too real. The fact that he looks like a burn victim sort of sends a feeling of unease because of the authentic ones we've seen on the news. Englund's original ""pizza"" or rubbery appearance made him menacing, but not awkward to look at. You could go on for six years about the voice of choice. Haley's approached a drunken Englishman, stumbling out of the pub, dragging his tone in a haze. Really did reek of a fan-film Freddy getting overmatched by the material.I didn't care about the characters, there was no sense of urgency, and basically, it just very ""remakey,"" like your typical modern-day slasher. Nothing significant or compelling in the slightest. Didn't CLANGING chords and overcranked dolly shots go out with the 'Scream' movies?

113,skybrick736,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 (5/10),5,10 May 2015,"Just like the majority of remakes to classic 70's and 80's horror films, A Nightmare on Elm Street proved to be the same old recycled adaptation to the superior original. The story is true to the first, which it should be, but didn't add anything different by the way of twists or kill scenes. Maybe I'm too used to Robert Englund too but I found Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy Krueger to have a rather stale personality and cheap CGI look to him. One of the few redeeming factors into the ANOES remake is Rooney Mara, who played a terrific Nancy and is ridiculously attractive. Rooney Mara couldn't save the film though, the ending was one big hypocritical plot hole, just a complete disaster of a rushed ending. I probably liked the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street more than the 5/10 rating, but that ending left too much of a sour taste in my mouth.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
114,bh_tafe3,"Caught in two minds about what it wants to be, and the second of them produces something that sucks",4,21 November 2012,"Part of me is intrigued by what my impressions of this film would have been had I not already seen 7 ""nightmare"" movies. If this had been my first exposure to the premise and the character, would I like this film instead of thoroughly disliking it? OK, I like Jackie Earle Hayes as Freddy. He's fine, the cast are tolerable, production values are fine. Now we've got that out of the way, I can get into this film's big problem: it's script.It is not hard to make a nightmare on Elm Street movie, it really isn't. You just need to explain to people who Freddy is and how he got here, use grisly murder scenes to show what he can do, and bring about a solution at film's end. Not hard, but here they make two decisions that are disastrous.First big mistake is that Hayes' Freddy is not a child murderer, he's a child rapist. Sounds like a subtle change, but it actually changes key things about the character. Englund's character, as a murderer of the innocent, is frightening, he's contemptible and he really is just going right on doing what he did in life. You should not be watching the movies feeling sorry for Freddy. In later films you see him completely oblivious to the quips of children about him being the bastard son of a hundred maniacs, far more interested in crushing the class mascot with a mallet, no provocation, no curiosity, just mindless joyless relish at destruction. Hayes' Freddy is a friendless loner, a child rapist, is simply a pathetic character. In life he was a sexually frustrated coward, totally different to what he becomes in the dream world. As such his character is hard to actually be scared of from an audience standpoint. You're watching a pathetic human being committing acts that are out of character. Anyway, that's one of the things that really bothered me at watching it, I felt I'd mention it here. It's not that being a child murderer is somehow better than being a child rapist, but pedophilia is just a nasty topic, better left out of a horror movie. Murdering children is incomprehensible, and therefore the thing of nightmares.The other change is equally destructive and that is turning it into a mystery, did he or didn't he actually rape children? In some ways the only way they could have redeemed the decision to make him a child rapist would have been to reveal he wasn't and the kids had lied at the behest of their parents. A big change to Freddy's mythology, but not necessarily a bad one if done correctly. But nope, he did do it and so there is no point to this rather tedious, pointless story. Maybe at the end of the mystery the kids could have found out that he was a murderer and not a rapist? I haven't really got much to say about the rest of this. You know the story, the straight remake parts work, the new additions don't. Having Freddy as a child rapist is too mean spirited, it grounds the character in reality, which is not the point of Freddy, and makes his later actions less understandable.This is a bad film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
115,jayjaycee,As effective as a sleeping pill,3,18 July 2020,"""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a 2010 horror film directed by Samuel Bayer starring Jackie Earle Haley and Rooney Mara. It only happens in rare cases that a remake of a beloved horror classic brings something positive in its wake the original didn't have in the first place. While not every readaptation of a timeless fan favourite is principally a deterioration of its source material, and some even take advantage of the advanced technologies of their time that the originals weren't able to make use of, a prime example being John Carpenter's snowed up, extra-terrestrial psychological terror fest ""The Thing"", and are films that are indeed an improvement to their predecessors, the majority of movies that readapt sacred gems of pop culture end up as blasphemous and insulting disasters that attack the dignity of its precursor with their sheer existence. Aside from Marcus Nispel's confused and heavily irritated remake of ""Friday The 13th"" that utterly mischaracterized its machete wielding menace, this uninspired rehash of Wes Craven's incubus inducing classic is another example that proves this theory. I still wonder whatever has gotten into Michael Bay that inspired him to gradually murder classic slashers by producing poor remakes of them. Honestly, I have tried so hard to go into this film with and open mind and ignore the overall horrible critical reception of it, but in the end, I just couldn't find anything in this flick that makes me tolerate its miserable existence. Where do I even begin? There are so many things terribly wrong with it that I cannot even decide what to point out first. Basically, the film is an unmitigated cinematic calamity that has no raison d'être, never should have seen the light of day nor been considered at all. I am an avowed admirer of the original flick from eighty-four and to have seen this abomination was a kick right to the teeth for me and everything the original stands for. First of all, we get a bunch of bland teenage characters I couldn't have cared less about and that were obviously played by much older actors. Is it such a difficulty of a task to cast artists that are in fact juvenile or at least look like they are? Generally, that wouldn't even have been much of a problem, but in this case, they furthermore act horribly in most scenes. Except for her ability to scream, ""Arrow"" star Katie Cassidy doesn't offer anything at all that I would consider noteworthy, the male stars Gallner, Dekker and Lutz don't present anything that goes beyond amateurish acting either, and even Rooney Mara, the future superstar and talented, lovely lady who I know is capable of so much more, doesn't manage to singlehandedly save the production for me. Heather Langenkamp made Nancy a charismatic and charming protagonist that was a worthy opponent to the glove wearing ghost, but in this film, she is a terribly underdeveloped character and doesn't match the importance of Langenkamp's portrayal back in the day. It is not even the fault of Mara, the stupid screenplay simply didn't give her the chance to make the role remarkable. Speaking of remarkable, it cannot be denied that the original film was mainly successful thanks to the iconic performance of Robert Englund who made the cord-hatted killer with the striped sweater the iconic and nightmarish entity that he is known and loved for. There have been several actors who played Jason Voorhees in the ""Friday The 13th"" movie franchise, but there has been only one Freddy, and Englund literally owned the role for almost two decades. For diehard fans and admirer of the original film(s) it is probably hard to see someone else put on the clawed glove and hat. Even if the casting of Rorschach actor Haley was officially approved by Englund and one of the more tolerable aspects of this production, I still had severe difficulties with his overall characterization and depiction. He looks a lot more realistic and his burns a lot more authentic, at times he even appears a lot lizard-like, but unlike the interpretation in the original film, he is anything but frightening. What? Freddy Krueger not scary? Sadly, yes, and that is one of the greatest sacrileges the film commits. Aside from the fact that he is somewhat underused, he always appears in the same repetitive manner and thus becomes immediately boring. Of course, he is an undeniable danger for the characters and nothing to underestimate, but in direct comparison to the original movie and what it made me feel, I was unfortunately missing any feeling of threat as the viewer. Ever since I have watched the Craven directed classic in the summer of twenty sixteen, I was utterly terrified and unable to sleep for days upon every rewatch. In this case? I almost dozed off on several occasions. There was no form of haunting possessing me, and the approach of making the notorious killing caretaker more serious by omitting the humorous aspect of his personality didn't work out as well (he in fact still made several naughty remarks, though). What am I to do about an antagonist of a horror film I don't dread in the slightest? Furthermore, I was both indescribably irritated and disappointed to witness that the production displays a total absence of atmosphere. Seriously, aside from a few eerie sounds that I as the viewer was mostly unable to perceive there was no musical score underlining the film. The original had an iconic soundtrack and a legendary melody that to this day keeps up people in their late forties/early fifties that were teenagers when the original has been released. This blatant copy here? It would have the same effect as a sleeping pill for those same people - me included. Afterwards I even looked up if the film had a composer. Yes, it had. He only did an abysmal job. Furthermore, I was confused to see how the movie even blatantly plagiarized some scenes of the original and made them ... less terrifying? Once again, yes. Aside from the fact that the deliberate copying of sequences (it was meant as an homage for the fans, they defended their actions) is one of the most fatal things you can do while making a readaptation of a beloved classic: They were even less shocking than their counterparts from the eighties, despite the fact that they had a good deal more possibilities. They just didn't use them. For example, do you remember the horrifying scene when Tina is thrown around the room and literally painting the whole room with her blood while screaming her lungs out? Well, except for a few seconds of terribly animated, violent levitation and a few incisions on her upper body, Kris (her name in this version) is spared from any further torture. No spouts of blood, no nightmarish imagery, just nothing. For a film that had the possibility to flood the whole room with more realistic looking blood, this is downright pathetic. It didn't take the trouble to be as original as possible in this context and contribute something innovative to it, and when it did, it happened in the same awful manner. Next to the admittedly interesting approach that Freddy was indeed just a chimera as the result of repressed memories of the protagonists they made after what they have experienced as children (which was dropped in the matter of seconds, though), I thought it was also interesting that the film tried to make us contemplate that Krueger indeed might have been not guilty and just an innocent victim of vigilantism. Thus, it could have criticised the unjust actions of the parents and arbitrary law in general, as well as remodelled the motives of the massacring maintenance man. It could have been this one aspect, this one interesting twist that distinguishes it from the original, but in the end, they followed the same old formula. A few plot holes later (How did they find the old school if it were literally eradicated from any map?) we get to see the final showdown that could not have been any more anticlimactic. After only a few minutes of ""I am gonna kill you for what you have done and you are in my world"" jabbering, the grotesque groundskeeper is relieved from his hand before Nancy ultimately cuts his throat and he dies. Just like that, after no exciting battle, as if it was no big deal. Aside from the final, ambiguous twist (the only notable kill!) that was already all. All in all, this poorly executed remake of a horror classic causes you to have a calm sleep, and for a title that has the unequivocally term ""nightmare"" in its title this is anything but a remarkable achievement. With awful acting, the total absence of any atmosphere or suspense and a plot that just blatantly plagiarizes the best scenes of its original film in a massively inferior way, the lack of gore to justify its existence as a slasher and a disappointingly realised villain, the movie is unquestionably boring and, most importantly, not scary in the slightest. What am I to appreciate about a horror film that isn't horrifying? That's right, nothing. It is a sleep inducing, generic, uninspired and terribly written remake of a cult classic that feels like was the low budget version of penniless high school sophomores who wanted to make a cheap copy of the new horror film they have just seen. It doesn't deserve to exist, let alone bear the same title as the classic horror film from the eighties, and it is yet another proof that some things are too holy to be touched. No wonder that none of the original stars made a cameo in this flick. Hopefully, Bay understood this lesson and won't touch any further projects like this, and if he does, I hope he chooses a director that isn't just known for making great music videos in the nineties and early two-thousands. They both should stick to what they do best, and I hope this was enough of a lesson. Nine, ten, I hope they never ruin a movie like this again. If any of them dare to touch ""Jaws"" ... they will learn that the glove is God.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
116,jhpstrydom,Starts off good but falls apart at the end.,6,16 October 2010,"The next film in line to get the revamp treatment was A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and to be honest it wasn't as bad as it could've been, the first half plays off beautifully setting up the atmosphere, introducing us to the lead characters and the villain himself, a one Mr. Freddy Kreuger played for the first time by a different actor and played pretty well mainly because he didn't try to play Freddy exactly like Robert Englund did, it also has some well staged scares that definitely made me jump and that says a little something because a horror film hasn't made jump in a long time.However, when this film reaches the third act it starts to fall apart, the reason why is because then it starts making a truck load of references to the original especially with Freddy's famous one liners, now when Robert Englund says them its one thing but when another actor says them its just not the same and right at the ending even though it is different its still too much of a reference, to be honest this film would've been a really good remake if it steered clear of as many references as possible.Fans of the original will most likely be disappointed with this film but personally I think Platinum Dunes can make a good horror film, the reason they're not making one right now is because all of them except two are remakes, not really a way to test your skill as a film maker when you're attempting to improve on work that doesn't need improving.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
117,Meven_Stoffat,"One, two, Michael Bay's coming for you...",4,30 April 2010,"Hollywood loves remaking things these days. In fact, that's an understatement. EVERYTHING is being remade nowadays. Coming later in the year, Alexandre Aja, the king of remakes, will be releasing his take on ""Pirhana"" in 3D, as well as Robert Rodriguez's take of ""Predator"". Is Hollywood running out of ideas? In some aspects, yes. A Nightmare remake was in the talks as far back as 2007. Obviously Robert Englund was too old for the role of Freddy, as his swan song was in ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". However, rumours that Jackie Earle Haley was going to be the new Freddy were spreading when Watchmen got released and those rumours are true.A Nightmare on Elm Street, directed by Sam Bayer is a remake of a movie by Wes Craven, to state the obvious. The original movie spawned an entire franchise of seven sequels. I took a liking to it when I saw Freddy Vs. Jason when it got released on DVD, and, well, at the time I liked it. I hadn't seen a single Jason movie before, nor did I ever see a single Freddy. I have since seen every Nightmare on Elm Street movie, and I was excited to go see this movie today.So, did I like it? Well, I'll be honest: Unfortunately, it was just average at best.The movie starts off well. Dean is in a diner, falling asleep, and he wants some coffee. He sees the waitress go back to the kitchen and ignore him, so he goes back and finds weird stuff. What he doesn't know is that Freddy's near. So like seen in the trailer, he turns the corner and BAM, Freddy's there, and he slices his hand. He wakes up, and is threatened by Nancy to be thrown out. He looks at his hand and BAM, there's a cut. After a conversation between Quentin, Jesse and another dude, in an ordeal over Dean and Kris, Dean falls asleep again, and bam, Freddy's there, and he forces Dean to slice his own throat open. Bam!!! Good way to start the movie.As with back in 1984, the movie focuses on Nancy, a teenage girl who goes to school and works at a diner. After the death of Dean, Freddy Krueger, once a gardener who abused children and was burned to death by the parents of those children, starts appearing in all of their dreams. However, not all of them survive their nightmares. Quentin and Nancy are brought together after both of Kris and Jesse are killed by Freddy Krueger in their dreams, and then start to notice that Freddy is in their dreams too. However, they are both the next target on Freddy's list. United by this fact, both of them go to solve the mystery surrounding the deaths. However, Freddy's especially headed for Nancy because she told her parents about her abuse. They then try to make one bold move: Stop Freddy for once and for all.Now first off, I didn't actually hate this movie at all. I mean, it was gorgeously shot, and had some good, eerie, creepy moments. Jackie Earle Haley is pure cash money with every performance he gives, and he continues to prove so here. He can do no wrong. If anything, I think his Freddy may be even creepier than Englund's. His creepy Rorschach-meets-Englund voice definitely sent shivers down my spine. I definitely think this guy deserves more credit. Also turning in a great performance was Kyle Gallner, and I usually don't like that kid. Here he breaks away from his usual role as a sexual neurotic and plays a teenage kid who, as soon as Freddy comes for him, pops pills and drinks Red Bull to keep him awake. Also, I gotta say I did enjoy the fight scene and the ""gotcha"" ending.However though, where my concerns is well pretty much everything else. My biggest gripes are the characterization, script, and pacing. The characters were just plain empty. Of the teenagers, I only liked Quentin. Nancy was a pretty BAD character here. It could also be due to Rooney's acting. She was so wooden that I kept expecting Freddy to come and make a wooden stake out of one of her arms. Kris and Jesse are both killed off before I get the chance to have any connection to them, but while that worked in the original 1984 classic because it was not only scary but also provided the ""anything can happen"" motto, here their characters were so empty and bland.Pacing is also another issue. The movie is really rushed and poorly edited- none of the scenes have any real ""flow"" to them. Some scenes end before they even begin. There's one creepy, tense moment where Kris is in a nightmare, and she enters her house, to walk by a room to find three girls playing Skiprope and singing the ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you"" song, then Freddy says ""Ready or not here I come"", then launches for her. That scene was a whole lot of buildup to an ending of a scene so quick that I went ""Whoa"". The movie's pacing is really odd- the first third is incredibly rushed, then the second third slows it down a bit, then it speeds up towards the end, then just ends. As well as the writing and dialogue range from ""mediocre"" to ""AWFUL"". Thankfully Freddy isn't stuck with lame and cheesy puns like in ""The Dream CHild"", but some of the dialogue is just BAD. And I don't mean Advent Children English Dub bad.It isn't totally awful, like I said. It had some good creepy moments, was gorgeously shot had good performances from Haley and Gallner, and a good fight scene at the end. But unfortunately, Platinum Dunes and Michael Bay has laid their curse again upon the horror Franchise, and in the end, I was left disappointed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
118,Donatien3,the new Nightmare works,9,9 June 2010,"Considering the poor quality of recent remakes, Freddy fans are justified for feeling pessimistic about the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot, especially with Robert Englund being replaced by Jackie Earle Haley. While Haley has shown he can play morally ambiguous characters in 'Little Children' and 'Watchmen', could he live up to the legacy Englund had built over eight films? While the new version keeps Wes Craven's basic premise (the horribly-scarred Krueger terrorizes Elm St teenagers in their sleep), there are a few changes. While not a shot-for-shot remake of the 1984 original, it does follow its origin story with a few updates. The"" new"" Freddy is a gardener at a preschool, seemingly devoted to the kids, who becomes a Pied Piper-style avenger after being ambushed and burnt alive by the town's parents. There's also more time devoted to explaining the effects of sleep deprivation, which gives the film a bit more realism. This extends to Freddy himself. While the iconic sweater, glove and fedora remain, the scarred face of Haley's Freddy is more realistic (similar to a burn victim)than the over-the-top grotesque makeup Englund wore. Haley's version is more organic, and his natural features come through more. Another important change is the characterisation of Freddy. Gone are the comedic pantomime villain antics which drove the final films, a role which Englund seemed to play with relish and made the poorer sequels watchable. Haley's Englund is more of a silent, menacing killer, a throwback to Craven's original concept (though a couple of puns still remain). Many of the film's scares come from Freddy's ability to pop out of nowhere when stalking an unsuspecting victim. While comparisons between Englund and Haley are inevitable (it's fair to say many fans will always prefer Englund, regardless of what Haley does), Haley's Freddy works because he distances himself from Englund.One of the advantages of updating the ""NOES"" series is the improved technology. For a concept that relies on imaginative dream sequences, this is important to get right. Most of the dream sequences are quite impressive, including a bedroom turned into a winter wonderland, a hallway transformed into a river of blood, teenage victims – controlled by Freddy – being thrown around their bedrooms like ragdolls, a bloodied corpse, still in a body bag, briefly coming back to life in a dream and, of course, Freddy's famous boiler room lair. Unfortunately, the film lacks the inventive kills which were a highlight of the original series, mainly because the teenagers are fairly one-dimensional; we learn little about them outside of school life, so Freddy can't fashion the deaths to each characters hobbies/fears etc. One strange element is the inclusion of the Everley Brothers song 'All I have to do is Dream', which appears in a dream sequence and over the end credits. Though it fits in thematically, it does feel a bit out of place, especially considering the last Freddy movie,'Freddy v Jason', was driven by a metal/hardcore/hard rock soundtrack.Overall, the 'Nightmare' remake is enjoyable and takes the series back to its original vision of Freddy as a menacing killer. Devoted Englund fans should be able to appreciate Haley's performance and the updated backstory, more emphasis on realism, better dream sequences and incorporation of the best elements of previous films make it more than just another cynical remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Constant telephoto lens and high saturation don't look good Mike, stop it.Unlike literally every other Nightmare film, this manages to not even be remotely intriguing.

120,raisleygordon,"Doesn't live up to the 1984 classic, but good in its own right.",7,7 May 2010,"I've been looking forward to seeing this remake, and of course, it was worth the wait. But mostly, this movie is just standard teenage stuff. As you might recall in the 1984 movie, if you've seen it at least a couple times, the story was more about Nancy than Freddy. The opposite is true in the new version. I'm recommending it, but it would have been nice to have a real story here. Typical of Hollywood, remakes these days seem to be about anything but quality. Another quibble: the look and sound of Freddy himself. I realize Robert Englund is getting older, but would it have killed him to just play Freddy one last time? Jackie Earle Haley is not a bad choice, but he's no Robert Englund. As for the makeup, Freddy looks more like a monster than a serial killer with a scarred and burnt face. No, actually, he looks nothing like a serial killer with a burnt face. Maybe it would have been best to keep this new Freddy in silhouette every time he appeared. But doing so would probably be missing the point. Compared to the original movie, this version suffers by comparison. Anyway, the remake is just as good as the original, but not necessarily as convincing or as compelling as one would hope.*** out of ****",A Nightmare on Elm Street
121,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Underrated and unappreciated good horror slasher bloody film,10,4 February 2019,"A Nightmare on Elm Street remake is not a bad horror slasher film in the horror genre. It is unappreciated and underrated with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. I would say this remake is a par with Freddy's Revenge the most hated film. I like this film and I like Part 2 Freddy's Revenge I love these films. I love Freddy Krueger he is my favorite horror icon and I understand this movie. It is not better than the original but it is different from the original and that good in his own way, that is why get's hate. Samuel Bayer did a good job directing this movie, I am glad is dark, creepy and I like Freddy been scary and a creepy he is not a comedian like he was in some sequels.This felt to me like a real horror film and not a comedy, I have I enjoy it, I felt scary. The first time I saw this film I hated, I even didn't like Freddy's Revenge but those two movies grow in me and I love them now. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc I re watch it last night again the second time around and now I like the film around. I am glad I have this film in my collection. It is an par with Part 2: Freddy's Revenge that everyone hates the film. I love, love Katie Cassidy in this film I really love her so much. Her performance as Kris Fowles was really excellent she was hot babe and when she was in attic that scene really creep me out. Rooney Mara was good as the main heroine Nancy Holbrook but she wasn't better actress the original heroine Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. Thomas Dekker as Jesse Braun was good I like his performance. Kyle Gallner from Veronica Mars was good as Nancy's boyfriend Quentin Smith but not better than legendary Johnny Depp. Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger is a stealer in my opinion he stole the show as Child molester more a child killer in my opinion. He was creepy and dark I love his performance.My favorite scenes in the movie are: Springwood Dinner scene in the opening sequence. In which you see a guy with a knife slashing his neck while his sexy gf Kriss is watching great gory death scene. This movie felt more like a dark horror slasher film to me. The death scenes are gory and really good, fx effects are not bad. I understand this film now. I am huge fan of Freddy Krueger. I know Robert Englund isn't in this movie but Jackie Earle Haley is good I enjoy his performance. I enjoy it more than Part 5 and Part 6: Freddy's Dead. Underrated and misunderstood. When Nancy is in a pharmacy drugstore and she dreams and sees Freddy coming to get her that scene was creepy and it is also my favorite scene. I like in which Nancy and Quentin go off the road with a car in a corn filed. I like the last stand and fight between Freddy and Nancy.This Nancy is not bad, the first time I saw a heroine crying when she saw a young boy been killed from Freddy and she couldn't do anything I like that. The remake is not a supernatural horror slasher film but is more a mystery horror film and I like that. I am huge Elm Street fan this is my favorite horror franchise of all time. I hope there will be another Elm Street movie I read Robert Englund is ready to make another Elm Street movie. A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is in my top five favorite ""Elm Street"" movies, it is my sixth favorite Elm Street movie better than Part 5: The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare I just can't stand those two movies anymore. I even like it more than Wes Craven's New Nightmare that is my opinion. Give this remake a chance doesn't deserve the hate because they did something different it is fine. :P",A Nightmare on Elm Street
122,Quebec_Dragon,Freddy got fingered,5,20 May 2010,"Everybody writes telling you it's a remake or re-imagining of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" from 1984 but what is it really about ? Besides making money that is ? ;-) It's about teenagers from a particular neighbourhood who dare not sleep because they have terrible nightmares and in those nightmares there is a recurring figure: a burned man wearing a hat, a red and black stripped sweater and a bladed glove... The problem is that those teens slowly realize that they can be hurt for real even though they're dreaming.What struck me was how much the film relies on jump scares to ""scare"" the audience: Freddy coming out of nowhere with scary sound effects. However, atmosphere wise it's rather lacking as the recurring industrial factory motif (with pipes) is not really sinister enough. Since a good part of the film takes part in dreams, you could expect some kind of creativity there. Unfortunately, there's very little of it on display. Part of that can be explained away by the fact that they intentionally make you wonder if the teens are awake or dreaming, therefore trying to create suspense. Still, it feels like a wasted opportunity to exploit the dream imagery better especially when it becomes obvious that they're in a dream. I understand Freddy likes to toy with his prey but I wasn't unnerved one bit when he walked towards the teens making noises with his blades by moving his fingers or on a wall. I didn't feel danger or apprehension, or sick sense of glee at the upcoming mayhem, which is wrong for a horror film. It's obviously targeted to a teen demographic as it's not particularly gory or gruesome. The deaths are usually rather quick and the camera doesn't linger on the bodies. Not any nudity on display here. I also wonder how come none of the teens ever try to wake themselves up when they realize they're in a dream. At least one pinch would have been appreciated.The voice of Freddy is appropriate but one cannot help but think of Rorschach from Watchmen (I know, same actor). The new look makes him more look a real burn victim and it's generally respectful of the old Freddy. The relatively short height of the new Freddy makes him less of a menacing imposing figure though. Other than that, the actor makes a fine intense Freddy that doesn't become laughable. The rest of the cast is OK and plays it seriously although the women seemed better actors than the men. Good point for not going the usual bubble-headed buxom blonde route. Story-wise, I found interesting the mystery behind what Freddy is and how he came to be but it could have been better told. The story seems to focus on each teenager in turn and it feels like a series of vignettes where one dramatic event provokes the focus on the next teen. I'm not one to think that remakes of horror films should never be made, although there are way too many of them these days. However, I'm still waiting for one to surpass the original.

At some points, this movie is funny how bad it is and when that happens to a horror movie, you know it can't be any worse. The acting was okay for my standards, the CGI was okay also, but man, did Freddy look bad. His face was so badly made, it didn't even look like him. And of course, the script was afwul, the way the movie progressed was toxic and that made everything look worse that it actually is.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

125,D_Burke,Big Time Scares Without A Plausible Story Line,5,14 May 2010,"This version of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is not so much a remake of the 1984 original as it is a franchise reboot. Although Freddy Krueger has been a household name for over 25 years, his character became more farcical with each passing sequel. So far, franchise reboot films have successfully revitalized James Bond, Batman, and Star Trek from their stale existence in pop culture and given them a 3rd dimension in addition to new found popularity.To this movie's credit, this rebirth of a horror classic manages to make Freddy scary again, as Jackie Earle Haley dons the black fedora and knife-fingered glove with a healthy dose of creepiness. This movie is the first time someone else besides Robert Englund has played Krueger, and Haley is without question the best thing about this movie. Unfortunately, the movie's story falls victim to so many horror movie clichés that Haley's creepiness actually suffers because of it. The story behind Krueger is so contrived, and the actions of the main characters are not plausible most of the time. Krueger becomes less scary because you can see him tripping and falling over the plot holes, and you can't help but laugh.It seemed as though in the first part of the movie, the movie makers got right what made Krueger so scary. It's not the way his face is scarred, or his lethal right hand. It's the fact that he kills people in their dreams, and the victims feel the fear of being killed by him in addition to the impossible pressure to stay awake to avoid him. For the first half of the movie, I couldn't help but flinch when these victims found themselves caught in these nightmares. When Haley came on screen, even if it was just his hand, I couldn't help but feel fear for these victims. Even if they were high school students who were clearly in their mid twenties, you still cared enough about them to want them to stay alive.The movie really lost me when two of the terrorized teens began to investigate into who Freddy Krueger was, how he became disfigured, and why he became a living dead terrorist. According to this film (I haven't seen the original, so I don't know if there was any explanation for the motivation of Englund's Krueger), Krueger was a groundskeeper at a preschool that the teens in this film previously attended. When the children accused the living Krueger of abusing them (most likely sexually, in a situation that reminded me of the McMartin trial in the '80's), the parents chase Krueger into an abandoned building. When Krueger locks himself in, one father burns the building, causing the burn marks on Freddy's face.One teen even asks his father why he didn't call the police, and the father says something to the effect of, ""Son, when you have kids, you'll understand"". It's funny, because I was wondering the same thing, and the explanation provided by the father was not good enough. I also hated it (and I mean hated it) when one teen outright thought he and the other classmates were lying about the allegations against Krueger. What would these kids gain from lying about a groundskeeper allegedly molesting them? Why would they lie about such a horrible fate?Plus, it's revealed that all the kids at the preschool were eventually split up, and the parents chose to pretend as though they never went to the preschool in their lives. I'd believe this scenario if it took place in the '50's and '60's, but in 2010? Come on! Any modern psychologist with a brain stem could tell you that pretending an incident never happened will mess a child up psychologically, no matter whether the molester comes back from the dead or not.Also, Freddy comes back to kill every person that was in that preschool class, and the parents who supposedly killed him remained untouched. Why? There's also no explanation for how or why Krueger haunts them in their dreams. Why not make Krueger a serial killer? The tying in him being a pedophile really just complicated the plot, and was no doubt inspired by Haley's Oscar-nominated comeback performance in ""Little Children"" (2006). Again, I'll admit that I haven't seen any of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. It's an advantage in my case, because I can judge this film as a stand alone story without comparisons to distract me. I was too busy being distracted by this back story that really ruined the film for me. If they had developed Krueger's character better, given him a less vague motivation for killing people, and more thoroughly developed the child abuse subplot, this movie would have been great. It would have been scary, and it would have been a great story. However, the filmmakers obviously put more thought into the scary parts and their shock value than the credibility of the story.If this movie were the building that Freddy Krueger found himself trapped in, it wouldn't need to be burned down. The foundation that is the story would already be crumbling, so the building would just collapse.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
126,revival05,(Insert your own sleep-related pun here),4,7 May 2010,"Oh my god, what a boring movie. What a lame, dull, routine blah blah blah of a horror film. It's not a remake of Wes Craven's 1984 film. It's a rerun of any given horror film. Even as franchise based, formula horror films go, this is a film that should have been called A Nightmare on Elm Street - Freddy's Hangover.But what did I expect, right? It's a Platinum Dunes cough-up with a cast full of TV-friendly young faces and a first feature for a director, wouldn't you know, who's previous work has included music videos. But, I'm a fair person. I hated the Texas Chainsaw Massacre one and I was only dulled-out by their Friday the 13th (part 11). And the director of this film, Samuel Bayer, did make the videos to Smells Like Teen Spirit for Nirvana and Disposable Teens for Marilyn Manson. The very titles are apt for a film like this, and their MTV-flashy colourfulness should be enough to make a watchable and stylish horror fair.But this Nightmare is really quite the opposite. Starting out in grey, solemn, Omen-like colours I quickly began to wonder where the gloom would take us. Yes, this is all supposed to be a slightly more serious ride down Elm street. Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy is pretty covered in shadows, doesn't say very much and is not in the movie as much as you might imagine (much like the Freddy of the very first film). There's quite a lot of mood music here, quite a lot of troubled teenagers (one of them wears a Joy Division T-shirt, ""Closer"" no less, so we understand he's extra troubled) and there's an investigative plot where we find out more about Freddy's disturbing past.But, here we go: SO WHAT? I'm not sure if the film realises it, but this Nightmare on Elm Street raises a lot of it's own stakes just by attempting to make it more serious. Seriousness is not a matter of style. Seriousness is not a matter of special effects, or crude violence or lack of humor. Or, as this film seems to think, the mere mentioning of child molestation. No, Mr. Scary Movie Sir, if you go down this path you better deliver. It is especially in that context that this reincarnation of Freddy is a big disappointment, if one were to have any expectations. They seem to believe that just by presenting an idea of an origin, they have automatically made a more serious film. They haven't. Given how much time is spent mooding the movie down all we get are bad actors giving out bad dialog during and after they end up in painfully standard scenarios (don't go out in the middle of the night to look for your dog... I mean, please, just this once, don't do it... oh, well, off you go). This 2010 take on Freddy is more or less equal to any given slasher film, only with zero memorable scares, less visual flair and excitement and a lot more mood music, ending up nowhere.There are details from Wes Craven's film operated into this film. You know, Johnny Depp's original sweater is worn by one of the actors, there's the bloody body bag, the hand up the bathtub, the coming-out-of- the-wall-shot, so on and so forth. Thus, they failed to listen to the oldest of film making rules: Don't make references to films way better than your own. If they think they can do it because of the vain assumption that this is a remake they are wrong. This is not a remake of a movie, it's a remake of a concept. And it's painfully boring and unexciting. ""Whatever you do"" the line goes, ""don't fall asleep"". Insert your own pun here.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
127,bababear,A Really Earnest Try,8,30 April 2010,"This has a lot going for it. Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner are tremendous young performers and have very bright futures. This has a big budget and it shows: the photography and special effects are great.There's just one problem: It wasn't scary.Yes, there are a few moments that will make people jump. But it's too close to the original for us to invest too much emotionally in these characters. We don't just figure out who's going to be killed. We can also figure the order in which they will die.There's a new subplot about Freddie having been a child molester, apparently amassing a collection of obscene photographs of small children (fortunately we don't see these, just two characters' reaction to them). There's also a brief but unfortunate subplot in which several characters believe (mistakenly, of course) that Freddie might have been an innocent man unjustly slaughtered by a lynch mob. Fortunately, this is soon dropped when we find for sure that Freddie was a monster in human form.Also, the parents here are vague ciphers. I really missed Nancy's relationship with her father in the original film. Nancy's mother is here referred to as Dr. Holbrook but that detail never becomes relevant to the story.The IMDb tells us that 15 different scripts were written, and the final version combines elements from 4 of them.

131,Toronto85,A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010),7,28 March 2011,"The A Nightmare on Elm Street remake is pretty good when you put it next to some of the stinkers that have been out over the few years. No need to go through plot, everyone knows that there is a man named Freddy Krueger who gets revenge on the people who killed him by murdering their children in their dreams/nightmares. This is a very creepy retelling of the film and the back story does a good job building it up to being less humorous then the 80's sequels. We learn new things about Krueger, and how truly nasty he was to the children of Elm Street before his death. We also get to see the parents kill Freddy, and all that he had to endure.A major theme of the remake is the fact that Freddy was not a child killer, but a sexual predator instead. Now, in the original films it was sort of suggested that he might have been a paedophile as well as a killer, but it was never clearly defined that he did anything like that to children. We get the full image of how sick and demented Freddy was in this re-imagining of the franchise. That helps to make this remake a lot darker than the original and it turns Freddy Krueger, who was once a hero and icon in the 80's, into a disgusting and totally unlikable figure.The acting was good for the most part. Katie Cassidy plays the ""Tina"" character from the original. For the first 20 minutes I had a real sense that she was going to be the central character in this remake. Cassidy is a great actress and her character was a classic strong willed ""final girl"" type from eighties slashers. Kyle Gallner, who plays Quentin, did very well and the tormented and sleep depraved character that Johnny Depp originated. Thomas Dekker and Kellan Lutz were also both very good. Love the cameo from Judith Hoag who I remember from those fun ""Halloweentown"" films. She even gets to wear Freddy's glove! A big problem of the film was Rooney Mara who played Nancy. I don't understand what it was, but she mumbled her lines all the way through the movie. I thought they were giving Nancy a speech impediment or something, it was all very strange. It's obvious the makers of this remake wanted a different kind of Nancy, someone a little different and darker, but she was very weak in this pivotal role of Nancy. It hurt the movie greatly. Katie Cassidy is a much stronger actress and actually should have had the main part.Jackie did an admirable job as Mr. Krueger, but lets face it - Robert Englund will always be the Fred Krueger. I will say that the make up for Freddy was very well done in this, very realistic looking for a burn victim. I didn't like the voice of Freddy, that was a major disappointment. The kills are creative enough, but there are some that are ripped off from the 1984 version. Kris being killed on the ceiling mirrors Tina's death in the original. CGI effects are CGI effects, take them for what they are. I personally don't like it but this remake uses it.There were some well done scenes like Kris in the body bag at the school. When she opened her mouth and the blood poured out, much more creepy then the 1984 version. I love the chase scenes in the pharmacy as well. Overall this is a darker and scarier version of the film. I still like the original better because of it's creativity and originality. A lot of what you see in this one is a rip off from the original. But hey, at least this remake is exciting enough to keep the viewer's interest for the most part.7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I simply cannot imagine that you can do such lousy job without special preparation for it. It is very hard to take great horror movie and make such lousy remake out of it.The original story was really imaginative, with many really creative scenes. Not much of that survived after the rape by the authors (no other words can possibly describe the ""de-creative process""). The ONLY good scare scenes left in the movie are those that have been left intact from the original movie. Not a single new imaginative scene is present here. In all other cases the creative deaths were simply replaced by simple slashing. Why to bother with the creativity in the dream world when you can simply use the blades all the time? The really freaky dream sequences (drowning in the bathtub, face ripped of the Freddy) are gone, the final combat is so so unimaginative as well.Everything is dull and unified in the movie. Various characters have been replaced by more uniform ""older than teenagers"" like in the Twilight. ""Beautiful flawless faces"" make the movie less believable than the original. And yes, the ""molestation of children"", another ""hit"" of Hollywood these days - you just cannot make a movie without it.There is no originality or surprise or fear or drama or any other positive quality in the movie. Anything special or even fun that was typical for the original series is gone, all you got is boring slasher with the already known ending. This movie is flat insult to the author of the original, creative, innovative and imaginative movie. It is waste of time even for free.

133,homecoming8,Certainly Not As Bad As The Reviews...,6,1 November 2010,"Like most reviewers I also am a huge fan of the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" series. I grew up with them and I love all of them. The ""Elm Street"" series does not have a bad sequel, all movies are great which cannot be said for the ""Hellraiser"" series. And of course The Remake was only a matter of time since they already remade The Hitcher (not that great), Amityville Horror (Could have been better), Friday the 13th (was OK), Halloween and Texas Chainsaw (were both more than OK). For me, this remake falls somewhere between the Amityville Horror and Friday the 13th Remake. It is an entertaining movie but certainly has it's flaws. One big advantage is that they made the story frightening again, I found the look of Freddy not bad at all, it was more realistic and the make-up was a combination of the original Freddy (Robert Englund) and one of the Crawlers from ""The Descent"". True, the actor is a little too small to be that menacing and his voice sounds like Batman or Darth Vader, that could have been better. But I loved the background story, that made him once again more realistic. The leading actress who played Nancy did not have enough charisma, she's not Heather Langenkamp in any way. The blonde one was way better (and more attractive) but she looked too old to be a high school student. There were some bloody and gory deaths, too bad they had to use CGI effects in a couple of shots (the end shot is rather ridiculous). I hate CGI effects in horror movies, the reason they will never compete with the 'real deal' of the '80 movies. Overall, the story was entertaining with a couple of good frights and the pace was good enough. It had some good scenes from the original as a homage which I loved without copying that classic from 1984. As a remake, I thought it was not bad at all. Maybe because of all the bad reviews and the fact that you're simply scared to see another actor play Robert Englund. Because let's face it; Englund is the only real Freddy Krueger.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
134,Mr_Censored,"One, Two, Freddy's Coming in a Re-do...",5,10 May 2010,"Every town has an Elm Street, and it appears as though every horror classic will have its remake. You knew it was coming sooner or later, and here it is, the remake of Wes Craven's iconic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" From Platinum Dunes, the production company that brought us the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remakes, this re-boot of the surreal horror franchise finds its anti-hero, Freddy Krueger, being re-casted for the first time after eight films from Robert Englund to Jackie Earle Haley (""Watchmen"") under the direction of Samuel Bayer (whose claim to fame is the classic ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" video by Nirvana).Those familiar with Platinum Dunes' track record will not be surprised to find this version of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" coming up short on change. Its biggest crime is that very rarely does it break with the original film, which in turn makes for a stale experience. There is little to no suspense, as many of the death scenes emulate those that were played out in the original, and on top of it, they are achieved with CGI so bad that it makes the effects from 1984 look much superior; case in point, Freddy coming through the wall above Nancy's bed, which is just embarrassing to look at. Bayer, who has a strong visual sense, gives the film a good look, but the film feels hollow, which could be chalked up to an underwhelming script by Wesley Strick.Aside from Haley, who is criminally under-utilized in the film, the cast appears to be asleep at the wheel, phoning in performances of characters that are wooden to begin with. Here, the heroine of the story, Nancy, is played by Rooney Mara, who perhaps could have been more effective in her role if she were given any personality. All we know about this character is that she doesn't fit in and isn't too happy. Nancy 2010 is, for lack of a better term, emo, and is a far cry from the girl-next-door that was portrayed by Heather Langenkamp. Freddy, on the other hand, is given a bit of a twist to his back-story, in an attempt to make the character more threatening and to set up a twist ending that doesn't quite pan out. To be fair, this little bit of back-story was well-done even if the purist fans won't want to admit it. Haley also brings a few new tricks to the role of Krueger that stand out. The way he grinds the blades on his glove together when stalking his prey is rather effective and his thick, southern drawl adds another layer of creepiness to the character. Robert Englund would be proud.In the end, though, this new take on the material is just another walk on Elm Street. Just like a hazy dream, you'll forget bits of it quickly upon its finale. What made Wes Craven's film so special is how he did so much with so little. What makes this film so frustrating, however, is that so little is accomplished with so much to work with. Here you have a very well-seasoned and gifted actor in Jackie Earle Haley and a director who excels at strong visuals, but not much is accomplished with these elements. Fans will find it bland, perhaps even surprisingly inoffensive, while newcomers and younger viewers will be left wondering what the big deal is with this Freddy guy anyway. This new ""Nightmare"" simply isn't strong enough to warrant the kind of franchise that dominated 80's pop-culture and built New Line Cinema from the ground up. Nice try, but the original still reigns supreme.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Jackie Earle Haley does an amazing job with the character but he's not as good as Englund.This movie has some interesting ides that is new to the franchise like the idea of Micro Naps during Sleep Deprivation it's an interesting idea for the movie and another for Freddy to get his victims.Freddy's back story is handled really well but I do the prefer the original but the back story we got works really well for the movie.
However the movie does the one I hate in horror movies and goes down the maybe he was innocent angle I don't like it when horror movies try and make us sympathy the villain of the film it just don't work in my opinion.All in all a decent remake that I do enjoy just falls short with some of its ideas and I really don't like Nancy in this one.

136,RichardSRussell-1,Yet Another Totally Unnecessary Remake,3,30 April 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (1:35, R) — Fantasy: Supernatural, 3rd string, remakeAccording to the Mayans, we were supposed to have to wait until 2012 for the current cosmic cycle to end and the next one to begin, but somebody obviously forgot to tell that to Michael Bay and New Line Cinema, because they've already defibrillated the old cycle a tad early.Yes, it's a totally unnecessary remake of 1984's A Nightmare on Elm Street. This time it stars Jackie Earle Haley (Rorschach from Watchmen) instead of Robert Englund as the insane killer who stalks the dreams of teenagers living on Elm Street in Springwood, Ohio. Wes Craven did both the writing and directing for the original, but here Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer were responsible for the screenplay, with Samuel Bayer directing. 3 times the talent, 3 times the quality? No.Kellan Lutz plays the 1st doomed teen we meet, and he lasts maybe 10 minutes. The other 4 actors are Katie Cassidy, Thomas Dekker (John Connor from the TV Terminator), Rooney Mara, and Kyle Gallner (who gets to add this credit to his growing string of cheap horror movies, earlier including The Haunting in Connecticut and Jennifer's Body).For anyone on the planet who's never heard the name Freddie Krueger before, he was burned alive by an angry mob of Elm Street vigilante parents many years ago, and now his spirit returns to haunt their children. He wears a characteristic porkpie hat, a nubby sweater with wide red and gray horizontal stripes, and a custom-made glove fitted with extensible razor blades. He shows up unbidden in the dreams of his victims, and if he kills them there (which he always tries to do, cackling madly all the while), they also die in real life, slashed up the same way they dreamed they were. Once the stalkees compare notes and realize what's going on, they decide that the only way to avoid the Fate of the Fredster is to never fall asleep. Of course, we know how well THAT'S going to work out, don't we? Can you say ""micronap""?It eventually turns out that the only hope of the last surviving dreamers is to track down the place where Freddie supposedly perpetrated the evil deeds that the vigilantes suspected him of. If he was in fact innocent of their charges, perhaps his restless spirit will be vindicated and go away. (This latter comment was just me trying to impose some sense of logic and motivation on the plot; it's nothing the writers bothered to articulate.)There are a few genuinely scary moments in the movie, but many more cheap, unimaginative jumpatchas. Bodies levitating and bouncing off ceilings and walls are just laffable. On the whole it's just painting by numbers. Even the largely interchangeable actors have trouble working up much believable dread. Adults might as well not exist in this world, since none of the teens (who look suspiciously like 20-somethings) ever thinks to appeal to them for explanations or assistance.As always, I have to ask why, with so many good stories available to be told, Hollywood spends money retelling the same ones over and over again, not noticeably better than the 1st time around, and this time a little duller and less surprising.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Jackie Earle Hailey isn't given much to work with, and that is a shame because he was my favorite character in ""The Watchmen."" The other actors weren't too horrible, but Thomas Dekker, who plays Jesse, seemed to over do it and made the character annoying. The two best teen aged characters were played by Kyle Gallner (Quentin) and Rooney Mara (Nancy). THis is a good thing because they are the two main characters outside of Freddy.Like I said, the special effects were better, as they should have been since it's 26 years after the original, but with the exception of a few twists on the killings, and giving Freddy more of a background, there wasn't really enough for me to recommend this movie.

138,colinrgeorge,"Hey Krueger, Why The Long Face?",4,7 May 2010,"'Charm' probably isn't the first word that springs to mind in appraisal of the slasher genre, but Wes Craven's original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" has charm. It might be its unexpected sense of humor, the inventiveness of its effects, or the pronounced kitschy eighties-ness of the entire production, but there's something almost wholesome about it now—I mean, once you get past the buckets of blood and sexual subtext.By comparison, the new ""Nightmare"" (Not Craven's interesting experiment ""New Nightmare,"" but the Platinum Dunes remake of the 1984 progenitor) is completely soulless. Knife-fingers or no, Freddy Krueger just ain't cutting it with a 21st century mentality.It's one thing to strip the plot and retool it for a new audience; that's a trick the remake of ""Death at a Funeral"" could have benefited from. But 2010's ""Nightmare"" takes a match to the 25-year history of its central villain, not only abandoning Robert Englund and his iconic performance, but more disappointingly, leaving his critical sense of humor a singed afterthought.I can honestly say I never found Freddy Krueger frightening, but having seen every ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" film, he was always the draw—Not because he was scary, but because he was entertaining. Jackie Earle Haley (""Little Children,"" ""The Watchmen"") dons the fedora and striped-sweatshirt this time around, and in essence, that's where the similarities end. He's got some of the same cheesy one-liners that the Freddy of old might have quipped, but Haley, in his practiced Rorschach growl, can't quite make those punch lines sing.The character is presented more one-dimensionally sinister and less talky than the earlier incarnation, which forces an odd dichotomy when he's trying to make us laugh. It's not that the idea of offing the humor that drove the older ""Elm Street"" films is inherently a bad one— A hard-edged ""Nightmare"" film could really work—But screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer have no idea how to make the character frightening.Director Samuel Bayer, who comes from a background in music video, doesn't seem to have a clue either. Nearly every one of his anti-atmospheric dream sequences culminates with one grisly slash and a loud sound effect—I'd label him a one-trick-pony if I even thought that qualified as a trick anymore. And to top it off, despite the modernist take on the narrative, the script still falls back on carbon copies of the original's most memorable sequences and imagery, lazily recreated with unconvincing CGI.On paper, the theory was clearly to reinvent ""Nightmare"" as a darker horror franchise—But with that tonal shift comes a responsibility for fearless storytelling that Bayer and co. don't have the guts to follow through on.In a way, the franchising of horror during the eighties' blockbuster boom (of which Wes Craven's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and its six sequels were a direct result) is partially to blame for the remake sucking 25 years later. They collectively comprised a bankable textbook on horror, which has time and again provided a financially secure film-making model, but one whose original purpose—To scare—Has been diluted to virtual transparency.And in that respect, 2010's ""Nightmare"" isn't awful so much as it is endlessly unsatisfying. It keeps Krueger's jokiness in check, but its scares don't go the extra mile to compensate. While the end result is a lot of things, charming sure ain't one of 'em.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I understand the actress doesn't like the experience of being in this movie and I be the same too. At least it's better than Freddy's Dead: Final Nightmare (1991). Freddy in this movie look like a fish if you ask me, the make-up for Freddy is bad! I do like Jakie Earl Haley in this movie, his character is well written but he'll never be good as Robert Egland like Thomas Jane will always be the Punisher. This movie is bad but at least they tried. So this is my review on A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), I don't recommend it at all.Score: 3.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
140,QueenoftheGoons,I haven't even cut you,9,27 May 2021,"I saw this in theatres with Mom. She saw the original in high school. Yeah Haley is not Englund but i love his voice. You don't have to be easy on the eyes with a voice like that. He did a good job, the air of the movie - the music, the dark atmosphere it was good. People didn't like it yeah well i usually like what no one else does. I think it was a goody but they could have earned another star if they had put in a school bus scene like in the 2nd one. That's the very best of all of them! Esp when you get on the bus the next day and there's a substitute driver.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
141,DustinRahksi,"It stinks, and I don't like it.",2,13 January 2013,"This film had potential, it could have created new ideas and actually could have been good. But no, we get the same recycled garbage, with boring characters, and lame scene after scene. The characters and acting go hand in hand down the crap manufacturing line. They are some of the most boring people in a horror movie I have ever seen. Remember when Freddy was a cool guy, well now he is a paedophile, how the hell can you root for someone like that. It's a shame, I actually liked Jackie Earle Haley in watchmen. This movie has the same plot as the original and it even recreates some of the same scenes. Why on earth would anyone want to see the same things all over again. Do they even know how to make a proper movie, or did they think the scenes were so cool, and everyone was just begging for them to be recreated. It's complete garbage. This is by far the worst horror/slasher remake I have ever seen. If you can't make it properly why even make it at all, oh yeah, thats right, MONEY. And unfortunately people were suckered into seeing this, myself included. I don't watch horror movies to be depressed, I want to enjoy the film. This film is a sick joke and slap in the face for some of us. I warn you, this film is atrocious, stay away at all costs. And note it has one of those generic endings that totally destroys all that the main characters have accomplished.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
142,mirwais-orbit,Wes Craven's stills being better!,2,10 May 2010,"When I heard for the first time that they were remaking A Nightmare On Elm Street I thought it would be great and I was excited for it because even if the remakes of Halloween (2007) and Friday The 13th (2009) were awful, the remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and The Amityville Horror (2005) were great and proved that they could really do great new versions of horror classics like those ones.Well... but I was wrong. First of all, this movie does have a lot of flaws that the original doesn't and I will begin by the production. You can't expect a great movie with Michael Bay as a producer because if he's naturally an awful director of course he would be worst as a producer. When I noticed that Jackie Earle Haley would play the role of Freddy, I couldn't imagine anyone better than him. At first I thought he would fit perfectly the character, but I was wrong again. As another one said, Jackie can be a terrific actor, but he is not for Freddy Krueger what Heath Ledger is for The Joker. And what I mean by that is... if you're trying to revive classic characters played in the past by actors that really gave them a structural personification in a point that you would never forget, make sure that the new one are apt to make it better. I was never frightened by Jackie's Freddy as I was and I always will be with Robert Englund's. The same I can say for the direction. Wes Craven created one of the most frightening characters of all times and also directed it magnificently for that time, so you expect a so great or better direction, but Samuel Bayer just did what any other amateur director would do. Bad again.Everything happens a lot fast in the movie and Krueger stops being the clever and perverse evil clown that play with his victims as playing with puppets to become just a common serial killer. As an article I've read these days ago says, when Freddy does his first appearance in the movie you know that everything will be a crap because we are talking about pure horror movie clichés here. And clichés were things that I was expecting not see so much in this version because the 1984's version was original for that time and kinda ""one of the fathers of horror clichés"", so they could do it a lot different and better at this time but they didn't. As the movie is PG Rated, I was expecting a grown up movie, a movie for the old fans and also a movie to terrify the new generation so much as we were terrified by the original in 1984, being dense, dark, playing with the scenes as a real nightmare to a point that you could be afraid to go to bed. I felt nothing, just shame.Another awful thing was their mistake trying to humanize Freddy or also give us reasons to explain why Freddy is what he is. That was a lot silly for the writers because one of the best things of the original is that we never knew the real reasons for Freddy being what he is and that was clever because, for us, Freddy Krueger was always just a thing that lives on its own, a thing with no nature, no past, no history, just evil itself. What we knew about Freddy in the original was the necessary to know because evil is evil and there's no explanation for it when it really exists.After 26 years, Wes Craven can laugh a lot because his version stills being a classic and one of the best slasher movies of all times and will take a long long time for someone to have the audacity trying to overshadow his masterpiece again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The only tension is from the continual annoying and obvious jump scares.

144,hausrathman,Completely Uninvolving,4,9 October 2010,"I saw the original film in the theaters and found it fresh, exciting and genuinely scary -- three attributes sorely missing from the tired, uninvolving reboot. I know the original film was low budget, but this film felt even cheaper. Is it my imagination or are there only about seven people in the whole freaking movie. Everything seemed like sets. Nothing was real. The special effects weren't bad, and the juxtaposing between the real world and the dream world was interesting at times, however, film lacked any and all humanity. I didn't care about any of the characters, who were little more than thumbnail sketches at best. This is particularly surprising since a high profile writer like Wesley Strick was involved. Most disappointing was Freddie himself. He was not Robert Englund.I wanted to like the film. I was in the mood for a horror movie. However, I soon found myself headed into the other room to check my email. Then Facebook.... Then the movie was over. Fortunately, when I returned to the TV room Vincent Price's ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" was playing on MGM HD. It might have been old and a bit corny, but it entertained.I'd watch any of the lame sequels with Robert Englund than this film again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
145,kevin_crighton,Another poor and unnecessary remake.,3,13 May 2010,"So Platinum Dunes, not content to give us dull remakes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Friday The 13th, give us another horror icon remake in A Nightmare On Elm Street. And guess what? They've failed again.The plot, as before has a bunch of teens being stalked in their dreams by a man with a burnt, scarred face and a glove of blades on his hand. It's revealed during the events of the movie that then man (Freddy Krueger) was burned to death by their parents.Now the basic plot is very similar to the original. But the start of the problems of this movie, relate to where they writers have made changes. In the original Freddy was a child-killer who got off on a legal technicality, and was burnt by the parents in revenge. What they've done here is make Freddy Krueger a pedophile. The reason he is burnt to death is the parents getting him after listening to their children describe what he did to them. So instead of a killer getting off then being killed for revenge, what we have here is a suggestion in the story that the parents killed him without involving the police, to 'protect' their kids. And at one point there is a possibility Freddy was innocent. Sounds good, but this doesn't work in the tale for several reasons, the main on to me being none of the kids even remember any of the events from the past You'd think one of them at the very least would remember some of it.There are a couple of moments where you do jump in your seat, but don't be fooled for one moment that this is a scary movie. If done right, any movie can make you jump in your seat if something unexpected happens (case in point, a death in The Departed). Overall though this movie is not scary.It doesn't help that the director, Samuel Bayer chooses to re-create moments from the original, but with none of the flair or imagination that Wes Craven did. But where the film is really let down is in the writing. In the original, Nancy was the main character. Here, to begin with her part downplayed, until a couple of deaths occur then she moves into the lead heroine role. As a result her character never really gets a story arc, and you simply don't care if she survives at the end or not. Mind you, the characters are so poorly written you don't care what happens to any of them.As for the acting, the performances are adequate, without being memorable. although getting a good actor like Clancy Brown as one of the parents and then giving him nothing to do in the movie is a waste. Jackie Earle Haley steps into Robert Englund's shoes as Freddy and to be fair isn't that bad, and s definitely the best thing about this remake.I hope after this movie Platinum Dunes as a company finally gives up on the remakes of the horror 'classics.' None of the ones they've done are as good as the originals, none have imagination, and none of them will stick in your head afterwards.Get the original Elm Street, and leave this one alone.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
146,HorrorFan1984,A Nightmare on Elm Street,7,12 April 2020,"Remakes get a bad wrap, but I'm always very interested in watchig them to see the slight positive changes made to an already successful original film. With A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010, there is some good and some bad.This remake tells the same story we have seen before. A group of parents burned Freddy Krueger alive after he killed their children and got away with the crimes due to a technicality in court. Years later, he has returned to kill the remaining children/teens on Elm Street. We meet Kris who is dealing with seeing her boyfriend being the first victim after he appears to slash his own throat. She tells her friends about some dreams she's had of a disfigured man which they can relate to having similar dreams of htheir own. Eventually after a few more murders, Nancy and her boyfriend Quentin start researching who the man is and discover it's Freddy Krueger. A man who not only killed some children but also sexually assaulted them as well. Nancy and Quentin find out that they too were victims of the assault. Can they beat Freddy in the dream world or will they be killed by the nightmare man?I didn't dislike this remake as much as many people I know did. This movie kept things very dark and grim much like the original 1984 which was a good idea. We don't need to see a comedic Freddy running around if Englund isn't in the role. Jackie Earle Haley is an eerie version of Freddy with some really good burn makeup as well. There are some decently done dream sequences and death scenes which make this more than watchable.I'm conflicted with what I see as a major flaw. The flaw is that we are missing Robert Englund as Freddy. The conflicted part is that Jackie Earle Haley didn't do a bad job as the psychotic killer. But when you have someone as good as Englund for over 20 years, it's hard to say that Haley was just as good because he wasn't. The writing also didn't allow for Krueger to be the somewhat likeable villain he was in the original films. Not only are the one liners removed, but the writers of this remake add that Krueger is a child molester and not just murderer. This makes his character even more cringe worthy and puts me off to be honest.Another flaw I had was with Rooney Mara as the lead Nancy and not Katie Cassidy who played secondary character Kris. Cassidy may not have fit the look of Langenkamp from the 1984 film, but she put in a much stronger performance in this film than Mara did. I found Mara's version of Nancy to be extremely distant and cold to the happenings around her. The level is disinterest never changed with her performance whereas Cassidy put in a raw and emotional part (albeit a very tiny part).This 2010 retelling of the classic A Nightmare on Elm Street isn't all that bad. It has some really good jump scares and a few pretty gory scenes. A major setback is that Robert Englund should have been Freddy and a few choices when it came to the story needed to be tweaked a little. Very competent horror movie though.7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
147,tequila101,New Stuff on Elm Street,6,8 December 2011,"The new nightmare on elm street is a film by Platnuim Dunes which was released last year. When I heard they were remaking this film, I thought, sure no problem, let's see what it can deliver not only to fans who love the original but to those new, younger generations who would like to see Freddy on the big screen. I had watched Wes Craven's version back two years ago and it is one of my favorite horror films, nearly one of the best. When I went into the cinema with my friend, this expectations for this film were very high. Too bad I had some low views on what this film could have been. I mean, on a very fine line, this remake was decent but needed so much more going on in all directions. I am going to talk about the remake's pros, cons and I will also relate to the original if I must (In most cases I will).The 2010 version follows the same story and like the original, it's told simply. Teenagers are having these nightmares and are getting killed off, one by one, until Freddy has revenge for what the kids' parents did to him. Burning him.I love Freddy and here he is tended with in good and poor aspects. Robert Englund has been Freddy Krueger for eight films and Jackie Earle Hayley who has only been casted as the iconic monster for the one film does an impressive job. After the first film, the sequels were good but they made Freddy more campier and funnier, and there was nothing to be afraid of. Hayley luckily gives this Freddy a new spin adding darkness, evilness and visceral elements to him. His voice isn't too bad. I liked it, sounded like a true villain because most film villains are terrible these days in terms of voice acting. A lot of people even had a problem with the look and make-up and I for one never had this problem. They made him more sinister and evil, giving a new fresh style. The one thing though that they never get right with a classic horror icon is that they humanize him. The roots of him being a child molester is OK because that's what Craven's first intention was. The back story was interesting. It's the fact that they made him innocent and then they switched back to him being a killer which really irritated me because he's supposed to be a vile child killer. What I will say is Freddy's origin is much better than Michael Myers' from the ""Halloween"" remake since they went through everything. Now I'm not saying that his Freddy would beat Robet's but Jakie Earle Hayley's performance as Freddy saved this film a ton. Now I want to move onto the re-imagining of scenes from the original. Kris' death imitating Tina's death, well not that effective at all I'm afraid. The bathtub sequence could have been much more effective and even though creepy, they should have made it more horrific. Same with the body bag scene, creepy but not scary and rushed too quickly. Even the wall scene was adapted but in this, it fails. In the original once again, it was something that wasn't seen before while as here they've rehashed it. Also adding in this part: the amount of jump scares throughout got boring, lame and really don't have the impact as the original film does in sense. Freddy spreading his arms against the walls was a very frightening scene. This remake has intense scenes but the outcome of trying to scare a new audience is lame because of the lack of scares. Another thing to add on though is that the CGI was average at best. I mean there wasn't a lot like most remakes but still practical is the winner.The acting is really one sided. The new Nancy played by Roony Mara does a sucky job at pulling off the famous role. The older Nancy was frightful, full of fight and ready to face Freddy. The other actors suck and they aren't offered much. The teens are killed off, one by one and really all I can say is that the Quentin character and Clancy Brown do the best of what they are given. They were decent. Also for one thing, who can not remember getting molested at the age of five?One concept I found interesting and new in this film was the fact that when they were awake for too long, they dream when they are awake and they don't realize it. I actually found that a new and very exciting concept in the film which was played out really well towards the end of the film. The kids even did research and that was of good use because they found out more.The kills were fairly OK. Kris' death, re-imagined in the worse way possible. Dean's and Jesse's deaths were good, Nancy's mum's was good (the ending was great, giving some terror like the original's). The soundtrack score by Steve Jablonsky was dark, evil, eerie and had some creepy things going for it. The dream sequences were also fifty-fifty to me. Some I liked and found effective, some I found really lame and stupid, when they added in another jump scare.On the whole, The 2010 film is a fairly OK remake. Platnuim Dunes I guess pay homage to the original in some ways but then again this was another simple ""let's take the money and run"" cash grab and the only really did it for money. It's another classic film which didn't have to be remade in the first place but then again, Hollywood's remaking or rebooting old things for a numerous amount of reasons. This new ""Nightmare"" isn't a fail and it certainly isn't a mess up. It should be given a chance. It's not that bad.I give this remake a fair-average 6.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I have been a fan of Freddy's forever, so, naturally, I was excited about this whole things, but... what a disappointment. They should have made a sequel, not a LAME, POINTLESS remake. The guy that plays Freddy is not very good to say the least. The new Freddy is not one bit scary, and not convincing, either. He COMPLETELY failed to capture the essence of Freddy. For God's sake, Freddy is supposed to be an evil spirit of a dead serial killer, not some cheesy pedophile! And that voice... it was bloody annoying. And the rest of the cast... no comments! Who selected these TALENTLESS no-names??? The characters aren't developed at all -- they're a bunch of unlikeable idiots that are trying too hard to come across as ""emo"". And did I mention that none of them can act? Well, they can't. The plot is totally incoherent. It has nothing to do with the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (of which this is supposed to be a remake), except for a few rehashed lines taken from the rest of the Freddy movies. The special effects are ridiculous. They're the same quality as in the original Nightmare -- and how many years ago was THAT? Cheap, unconvincing, lame.

150,cadillac20,A Mediocre Attempt To Resurrect A No Longer Frightening Monster,5,30 April 2010,"I've been excited for this remake for a while, probably for the simple fact that it's Freddy Kruger on screen again. Can you tell I'm a Nightmare fan? However, upon the release of the film, it became clear from early reviews and such that this film failed to achieve what it set out to do. My expectations were significantly lowered. Now that I've seen it, was I right to lower my expectations? Absolutely.While it's not the train wreck it's being made out to be by many, it's definitely not the revitalization of Freddy that we had hoped for. The main problem, I think, is that Freddy is no longer scary, and it shows with this ho-hum attempt. Here, Kruger is dead serious, and it's certainly a different kind of Freddy. Where as the monster always had a little too much cartoonish villainy in his blood (yes, even in the original), here he is a bit more brutal. He yells at his victims, coldly talks down to them, throws them around, and beats them up. While Freddy may laugh a bit at his victims, he rarely has a big, goofy grin on his face and he is rarely charming in the same way Englund portrayed him. While many will have fond memories of the original Freddy, and Jackie certainly doesn't quite get there, I appreciate what he brought to the character. He was definitely a great choice behind Englund.The problem is, as mentioned, he simply isn't frightening anymore. The remake itself seems almost impossible simply because, for over 20 years, Freddy has been an iconic monster. We're so used to who he is, what he does, and what his motivations are that it's not longer really that thrilling. That may not ring well with many, but it really has been a long time since he was scary.Which is sad, because if he HAD been more frightening, this film might have been a bit better. The acting in it is decent from everyone else. The new Nancy doesn't have the same energy that Heather brought to the original, but she also feels a bit less hammy, as I always found Heather's Nancy to come off a little goofy at times. This is certainly understandable, considering it was the 80's. The film also has an interesting take in making the victims themselves not only victims of the monster Freddy, but the human one too. I liked the added twist of motivation in Freddy's attempt to kill all of these children and thought it fleshed out the story a bit more. I also can see how that might be necessary, since most of the details of the series have worn out there welcome. I also found the directing quite adequate. I was half expecting another blurry, jumpy, horrible jumble of a film, but it was much more methodical and well paced than I expected.Of course, the script lacked. I felt that the kids figured things out a bit too conveniently and made a few poor choices. The micro naps bit was a welcome and fresh addition, but I've always taken issue with the sleep deprivation bits of the series. Here, I had issues with the use of drugs as a method of aid. I was expecting the kids to fall down dead simply from exhaustion. One pleasant addition is the climax, which was far better than the campy booby trapped house of the original. The supernatural elements are also played down more. No skeleton disappearing in beds here. Of course, that is a double edged sword. As many have said, there is a definite lack of imagination in a lot of the scenes, and while the nightmares are interestingly grounded and make sure to remind you that no place is safe, with so many imaginative scenes throughout the series, one would think they would at least get a bit more creative with the scenes.This brings me to my biggest gripe: the deaths. Over the course of a number of films, Freddy has found creative ways to dispatch his unfortunate victims. Not here. Here we get simple slices and dices. Sure, Freddy terrorizes his victims to no end, but there's no new Puppeteer death or Super Hearing Aid. One would think that the creators would at least think of some creative ways to off the kids as that was never an issue with the series. No. Sure enough, this is a very faithful remake of a superior film that didn't need one. Did I like the new film? Meh, it was a decent attempt, but it ultimately fails to thrill. I did enjoy Hayley's new Freddy, but only to a point, and that point didn't carry the film. Had this film brought about the idea of a dream killer, it might have worked better despite its short comings. But as it stands, Freddy simply isn't frightening enough anymore to make a film like this work.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
151,joshuadrake-91275,Excellent remake! Don't hate this movie! Compares to the 1984 original amazingly well,10,14 September 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street - the 2010 remake is the ninth Nightmare on Elm Street film in the overall franchise and it could have not been done any better.The story follows the plot of the original 1984 classic film, but with a few new twists. The reason why is say this is because the producer of this movie was Michael Bay (director of ""Transformers 1-4"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Bad Boys and Bad Boys II"" and producer of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)"", ""Friday the 13th (2009)"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)"" and ""The Amityville Horror (2005)""), I am not going to say that he also produced the 2007 remake of THE HITCHER because I hate it and it is one of my top 10 worst remakes and re-imaginings.Everyone hates this movie and this a movie that audiences and critics took the wrong way and I think they should have responded better for the film. I am think that is just wrong for critics to take this movie the wrong way. It may not compare to the original film, but it is really good. One complaint from fans is that Robert Englund did not return to play the role of Freddy Krueger as he did in other the Nightmare on Elm Street films. The story is not as bad as critics said it is. Also, another complaint was that there are way too many nightmares in the film and the nightmare scenes outweigh how much we see them in the real world.The make-up for Freddy Krueger's face and body was really cool and they made him look more like a burnt victim and really scary. Jackie Earle Haley, who played the role of Rorschach in the 2009 Zack Snyder film adaptation of the 1987 comic book, ""Watchmen"", was the right choice to play Freddy Krueger and I don't think he's as bad as critics and audiences say he is. He does a darn good job with his portrayal of Freddy Krueger. He may not be as good as Robert Englund but considering the shoes that he had to fill, he could have been 12 times worse.The rest of the acting is just amazingly done. Rooney Mara plays the role of Nancy Holbrook, which is a departure from the Heather Langenkamp version of Nancy Thompson, and she does a really damn good job, especially delivering emotion, drama and very good screaming. Kyle Gallner plays the role of Quentin and he performs his role really good. He is really great as that part and I could not have seen better actors.Katie Cassidy plays the role of Kris and she plays it wonderfully, even though she is killed in the first few minutes of the film. She just makes you believe in her character. Kellan Lutz, from Twilight, plays her boyfriend, Dean and the only scene we see him in is the beginning, until he is killed by Freddy Krueger. Thomas Dekker plays the ex-boyfriend of Kris and his name is Jesse and he played the part a little confusing and really good.The way he is killed is something I have not seen in a scary movie before, but he did a really good job. These actors could not have done better, but they also could have done a lot more worse. I don't think these performances are bad as the critics say they are.The other thing that was kind of awesome was the way the dreams are shown. It looks more realistic and more intense than in the original film and it's sequels. This film would have been better if it was just in 3D, but for whatever reason, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures scrapped that idea.The music is composed by Steve Jablonsky, who has composed the music for the Transformers films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, The Hitcher, Amityville Horror and Friday the 13th remakes and his musical score is just very dark and brooding, but the theme is in there composed by Charles Bernstein and this is one hell of a musical score.The cinematography is well-done and the director of photography is Jeff Cutter and he brings a grittiness and nightmarish feel to the film. Editing can get a little choppy in areas but editor Glen Scantlebury does the best that he can do and it really shows.The script is written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer and the dialog is not as crappy or bad as the critics said it is but it is a little bit crazy, but the main goal is for people to feel sympathy for the killer. That's cool and I also feel sorry the people who dies in this film.The only main criticism that I have is that there is not enough humor and Jackie Earle Haley tries his damn best to add humor and the stuff that is written for him is scary and funny at the same time.Overall, the 2010 remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is not as bad as critics said to be, but there are some major flaws. If you like this movie, that's okay, but if you hate this movie, you need to re-watch this movie and see what Michael Bay has done. I give it a 10 out of 10. It's not the best re imagining, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The reason why is say this is because the producer of this movie was Michael Bay (director of ""Transformers 1-4"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Bad Boys and Bad Boys II"" and producer of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)"", ""Friday the 13th (2009)"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)"" and ""The Amityville Horror (2005)""), I am not going to say that he also produced the 2007 remake of THE HITCHER because I hate it and it is one of my top 10 worst remakes and re-imaginings.Everyone hates this movie and this a movie that audiences and critics took the wrong way and I think they should have responded better for the film. I am think that is just wrong for critics to take this movie the wrong way. It may not compare to the original film, but it is really good. One complaint from fans is that Robert Englund did not return to play the role of Freddy Krueger as he did in other the Nightmare on Elm Street films. The story is not as bad as critics said it is. Also, another complaint was that there are way too many nightmares in the film and the nightmare scenes outweigh how much we see them in the real world.The make-up for Freddy Krueger's face and body was really cool and they made him look more like a burnt victim and really scary. Jackie Earle Haley, who played the role of Rorschach in the 2009 Zack Snyder film adaptation of the 1987 comic book, ""Watchmen"", was the right choice to play Freddy Krueger and I don't think he's as bad as critics and audiences say he is. He does a darn good job with his portrayal of Freddy Krueger. He may not be as good as Robert Englund but considering the shoes that he had to fill, he could have been 12 times worse.The rest of the acting is just amazingly done. Rooney Mara plays the role of Nancy Holbrook, which is a departure from the Heather Langenkamp version of Nancy Thompson, and she does a really damn good job, especially delivering emotion, drama and very good screaming. Kyle Gallner plays the role of Quentin and he performs his role really good. He is really great as that part and I could not have seen better actors.Katie Cassidy plays the role of Kris and she plays it wonderfully, even though she is killed in the first few minutes of the film. She just makes you believe in her character. Kellan Lutz, from Twilight, plays her boyfriend, Dean and the only scene we see him in is the beginning, until he is killed by Freddy Krueger. Thomas Dekker plays the ex-boyfriend of Kris and his name is Jesse and he played the part a little confusing and really good.The way he is killed is something I have not seen in a scary movie before, but he did a really good job. These actors could not have done better, but they also could have done a lot more worse. I don't think these performances are bad as the critics say they are.The other thing that was kind of awesome was the way the dreams are shown. It looks more realistic and more intense than in the original film and it's sequels. This film would have been better if it was just in 3D, but for whatever reason, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures scrapped that idea.The music is composed by Steve Jablonsky, who has composed the music for the Transformers films, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, The Hitcher, Amityville Horror and Friday the 13th remakes and his musical score is just very dark and brooding, but the theme is in there composed by Charles Bernstein and this is one hell of a musical score.The cinematography is well-done and the director of photography is Jeff Cutter and he brings a grittiness and nightmarish feel to the film. Editing can get a little choppy in areas but editor Glen Scantlebury does the best that he can do and it really shows.The script is written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer and the dialog is not as crappy or bad as the critics said it is but it is a little bit crazy, but the main goal is for people to feel sympathy for the killer. That's cool and I also feel sorry the people who dies in this film.The only main criticism that I have is that there is not enough humor and Jackie Earle Haley tries his damn best to add humor and the stuff that is written for him is scary and funny at the same time.Overall, the 2010 remake of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is not as bad as critics said to be, but there are some major flaws. If you like this movie, that's okay, but if you hate this movie, you need to re-watch this movie and see what Michael Bay has done. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best re imagining, but it could have been a hell of a lot worse.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
153,TheMovieDoctorful,"""It's real...I'm real.""",8,29 January 2019,"Ladies & gentlemen, Satan's having a snow day. Cats & dogs are getting along. Turkish Airlines are hiring swine pilots. The point I'm trying to make is that somehow, through some kind of glitch in reality, Platinum Dunes made a slasher remake that was actually really good. Make no mistake, I am certainly no fan of Michael Bay, nor any of the other Horror remakes produced by his production company Platinum Dunes. But congratulations, cause they pulled it off with this one, creating a film that works as a worthy companion piece to the original classic as well as a surprisingly thoughtful #MeToo slasher film years before David Gordon Green's noxious Halloween sequel pretended to be the same.Admittedly, not everything works. Rooney Mara's performance isn't good at all, largely coming off as wooden and completely uninvested in the horrific events around her. Normally, this wouldn't be too much of a problem, as the rest of the teenage cast more than picks up the slack, but when the worst actor in your movie is the main lead, you have a serious problem.The film's overuse of CGI is also a significant problem. It's used in ways that are unimaginative at best and distracting at worst. The practical effects of the original had a kind of unsettling, unnatural charm, but the CGI used in A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is both overly polished and pathetically fake looking.Many have taken issue with the fact that this film recreates several scenes and lines from the original. I would argue, however, that it's the re-contextualization of these moments within the framing of a narrative about sexual abuse that gives these recreated moments genuine value. Significant genuine value at that. Images like Freddy's glove appearing out of the bath tub near Nancy's lower body, lines like ""How's this for a wet dream?"" or ""You're mouth says no, but your body says yes"" (Played for dirty laughs in the original films and sequels) take on a perverted and twisted new meaning here. They're infuriatingly sadistic and cruel, touching the characters on a real personal level that they've never had in this franchise before. Freddy is no longer a killer clown with a foul sense of humor; he's a pure embodiment of absolute, unflinching evil, an evil that comes from a place far more tragic, far more socially relevant and far more real than ever before.While the original is obviously the superior film, that's not to say that the remake doesn't do several things better. By making the teens former victims of Freddy's sexual abuse, the cast is not only made all the more sympathetic (These kids have already suffered enough horrors, the least they can be afforded is mercy from a painful death at the hands of a dream demon) but their encounters with Freddy make all the more sense. In the original, the kids didn't even know who Freddy was. In the remake, he's a repressed memory that they can never truly push out of their minds, so it makes sense that he would haunt their dreams.The remake also scores some points in making its male characters infinitely more likable than their counterparts of the original. Rod, the hostile, abusive and toxically masculine bully of the 1984 classic, is now Jesse, a popular kid with a hot headed streak, but one with a genuine sense of remorse who clearly wants to protect his girlfriend. Glen, formerly an irresponsible and selfish narcissist, is now Quentin, a shy, proactive, honorable dork with a very strong sense of justice. Which brings me to another point; many have criticized Quentin's emotional outburst at his father and his rush to defense of Freddy, who he presumes as innocent. These people seem to be forgetting that Quentin is a victim of horrific sexual violence. To admit that he was a victim of unspeakable atrocities is unthinkable for him, it's easier to create a version of events in his head where Freddy was innocent.Where his parents were wrong. Denial and misplaced, misdirected anger is very much a part of the trauma that many victims of sexual violence endure and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) captures that wonderfully.Mara notwithstanding, the cast here is excellent. Jackie Earl Haley steals the show, his creepy, childlike drawl and his awkward body movements fit the frequent profile of many real life pedophiles, (That creepy scissoring he does with his fingers, twitching in pre-pleasure at the anticipation of his next kill, is just sickening) putting Freddy in a disturbing place of reality without ""Nolan-izing"" him. Kyle Gallner's soulful, emotive eyes and anguished, passionate vocal delivery mark one of the best performances I've seen in a recent slasher, Katie Cassidy does surprisingly powerful work in a more emotionally and physically vulnerable role than usual (Her screams of terror are absolutely chilling) and Thomas Dekker brings a real humanity and softness to a role that a lesser actor would likely have roughened up too much.Props should be given to the makeup FX team. Yes, I absolutely loved the more realistic burn makeup they used for Freddy Krueger. It wonderfully fits the character's shift from clown to monster and, with the help of Haley's performance, helps to ground the character in a place more real and personal than the old, more fantastical design would have allowed.I'm not trying to argue that this is one of the best Horror remakes of all time, but it's not a piece of crap either. It's a (mostly) well acted, well written and thematically rich slasher that's very socially relevant in the age of the #MeToo movement. It's probably more socially relevant now than ever, so if you hated it on initial watch, I'd recommend giving it another chance.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
154,el7,Relentlessly Depressing,6,14 May 2010,"And yet, still effectively creepy. This is more a re-imagining of the classic horror flick A Nightmare on Elm Street than it is a remake. The screenwriters made some changes to both the characters and the back-story that altered this film significantly. Some of those changes worked for this update. I still prefer the original, though.The movie jumps into the story in media res, with a character who is played by a recognizable name actor being shockingly cut down in the opening act. This is one way in which the filmmakers used the audience's familiarity with the original movie to create a surprise: I was not expecting this film to reference Scream in this way. If this were an original horror movie, I'd have been braced for it, but they got me this time. Later in the film, they reference Halloween, and boy howdy, they scared the crap out of me then, too. A lot of the set pieces in this flick are genuinely scary, even the familiar ones like the body bag leaving a bloody trail down a school hallway, and that scariness keeps this flick from being a complete dog.Another way they use the audience's familiarity with the previous films did not work for me, however: this movie starts throwing some serious angst at you, right from the opening sequence, and it was not earned by this screenplay, but by all the previous Freddie films. The new back-story explains some of the sturm and drang these characters are exhibiting, but not all of it, especially considering they supposedly don't remember the previous events in the story. It's tradition for horror movies to cast comely twenty-somethings as teenagers, but what happened to the fun part of being a kid? These ""kids"" don't remember that, either. This is the kind of high melodrama you expect out of a guilty pleasure nighttime soap, not a horror movie. I kind of can't wait until the Rifftrax guys get a hold of this one, though.One heroine is still a sassy blonde and the other a smart-mouthed brunette, but other than that, Kris (based on Tina) and Nancy have switched places. Now Kris is the middle class popular girl, and Nancy appears to be from the wrong side of the tracks. Katie Cassidy steals the show as Kris, and justifiably dominates the first half of the movie, but Rooney Mara's Nancy grew on me. She reminded me in some ways of Dream Master's Alice. I was rooting for her by the end, but I wished I'd seen some more of her in the beginning besides scowling and some furtive artistic efforts. Without the context that existed in the original movie, Nancy's iconic 'claws in the bathtub' scene is rendered unintentionally hilarious.Jackie Earle Haley's Freddie Krueger is supremely scary throughout, though. Rather than ape Robert Englund's punning menace, Haley strikes a note of sardonic resentment that makes him menacing in his own right. The burn makeup is well-done, if you'll pardon the pun, but what really spooked me out about this Freddie is the flashback scenes. Haley makes this guy seem like maybe - just maybe - he wasn't a monster. It's key to selling how much of a monster this Freddie really is, and Haley owns it.And oh, how monstrous he is. This screenplay goes to the place that all of the previous films danced around. I can sympathize with the screenwriters who were working with this material, I really can. There is just no way to write this story without it becoming dark as pitch. But it still needed some comic relief somewhere, in fact it was desperate for it. The makers of the original movie skillfully wove the comic relief into the dark story, and that is a major reason I still prefer the first film.That and Johnny Depp. I mean, come on. Thomas Decker is real easy on the eyes, but he doesn't leap in a window with quite the same goofy panache as Mr. Depp.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

It was like they remade the old movie with a big insert new actor here sign. Then there was the atrocious acting, when you have a movie where teenagers are supposed to be the primary targets at least TRY to get people that look like they could in some universe be in their teens, not a bunch of late 20's actors that couldn't make it on sitcoms. Finally the worst blow of all, Freddy.. oh where to begin, not scary, bad vocals, no depth, and at one point I swear I saw him look at a cue card.

157,jonnyfendi,You Could Probably Fall Asleep Even Before Thiz Nightmare Starts Yet.,4,11 May 2010,"Four legendary slash icons were born in 1980s, they are Jason Voorhees (Friday The 13th), Michael Myers (Halloween), Chucky (Child's Play) and the deathly claws Freddy Krueger. At a glimpse on the trailer, I expect thiz new reboot will reveal the origin of mysterious Freddy's figure. Far from the expectation, thiz flick straightly becomes the nightmare itself. If you have ever seen previous Freddy's movies then you really can skip thiz one. Thiz is the ninth movie that brings Freddy back to his series killing acts (1984-2003), including Johnny Depp's first appearance in the first movie. The movie is a directorial debut by Samuel Bayer who is best known as Music Video Director. Robert Englund who played Freddy back to back in previous movies, now is replaced by Jackie Earle Haley. At a glance, Haley seems to be a suitable choice to play thiz character. Although for the physical appearance, Englund is obviously taller than him. The Cast members are Rooney Mara, Thomas Dekker, Katie Cassidy and many more. Unfortunately, they cannot provide a decent storyline. There is no creativity to bring something fresh. Everything is rip-off from previous movies. It's always about a group of teens is slashed one by one until the last one. The origin of Freddy doesn't reveal something new here (Spoiler Alert!), as we knew he was a child molester who was burned alive as his punishment. There is famous scene from thiz franchise, the victims know they cannot fall asleep, but in the end they always don't realize that they are already in Freddy's nightmare. Thiz scene which I talk about it is told repeatedly over and over again although with various conditions. It's very exhausting to spend your time for these monotone events. You could probably fall asleep even before thiz nightmare starts yet.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",A Nightmare on Elm Street
158,smooth_op_85,Good take on the original but doesn't stack up,4,1 May 2010,"Okay let's start with the casting of Freddy: I think it was a nice choice because he had the sinister quality of Freddy that was missing as the sequels wore on--he was more comical, and nothing to really be afraid of, even comedians used him as fodder in their routines. The casting of the teens was OK and only Nancy and Quinten actually looked like teens (maybe due to the specific laws about child actors and the length of shooting they may have declined to use actual teens which I can understand why) So the casting seemed okay, the story was good. I liked how they investigated the allegations and the Freddy story which I found was freely given in the original and how they thought Freddy was an innocent man taking revenge on the children who lied about his connection with the children. When it was found out that they were telling the truth it confirms his evilness.The connection the kids shared was great and this part they expanded on was great about how all the children but them were dead and always in their sleep.Now, getting to the point: I wanted my $10 back. It seemed to turn into a shot for shot of original with the exceptions listed above. The whole Tina on the ceiling happened and the line: How's this for a wet dream (when Nancy was swimming in what appeared to be blood which seemed to borrow from the third installment of the series but it was sticky tar instead of liquid though it started out as sticky kind of tar at first) was originally used when Johnny Depp's character was killed in the original movie.And of course in the original Nancy's mother is pulled into the door but in this version she's killed and pulled through a mirror.Did I like it? It kept me riveted. Did I want to recommend it? No The acting was cool but I think while it strayed a little away from the original it should have departed completely away from it as far as the murders (Christina) and the ending. I do applaud the writers for making the new material and expanding on it which isn't easy in an established series when it's being overhauled but I have to say that it was okay",A Nightmare on Elm Street

160,MovieProductions,"1,2,3,4- Nothing interesting anymore",5,31 May 2010,"** out of (****)We all knew the iconic 80's slasher ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" was going to have a remake, it was just inevitable. However, it's not as abysmal as everyone was expecting. For once, the characters are not stereotypical and horny. And surprisingly, the teens' dialogue didn't consist of constant sexual references. Albeit, this remake is still short of impressive and actually, it really doesn't go anywhere. It's neither a disgrace to the original, nor a better fit. A nightmare on Elm Street revolves around a group of teenagers that have the same dream: a burned man with sharp knives, wearing a brown glove, trying to attack them. After the teenagers witness the death of one of their best friends, they begin to try to put the pieces in the puzzle. And most important of all: try to stay awake. Although, can their past be their own worst enemy?First let's go to the positives. The acting, while stale, is not too shabby. Rooney Mara gives a decent performance. We don't want the character Nancy to die and we, for the most part, are anticipating what happens next. While in some scenes, she can under-act, for the majority of the film, she does her job. Kyle Gallner is probably the best actor of the teenagers, although that's not saying much. He's a very likable character and very interesting. Thomas Dekker isn't too bad, he's just alright. He's neither annoying, nor really exciting. And last but not least, Jackie Earle Haley. This man can act. His performance is a strong one and while he's no Englund, he's certainly the next best choice. He's menacing and definitely has passion for our iconic villain. Now let's discuss the script. I actually like Bayer's additions to the story. The concept of pedophilia was executed well and makes Freddy that much more disturbing and sinister. I also loved the ending. It plays a respectable homage to the original. That's another positive about the remake. It explores new ground and yet pays off some homages to the beloved classic. This movie is also visually stunning. The transition scenes from reality to dream are portrayed well and the scenery is definitely eye-popping.Now onto the negatives. Katie Cassidy's performance was just awful. She over-acted the whole time and she seemed so one dimensional. I personally didn't care if her character lived or not. Furthermore, I thought the special effects were awful in some scenes. The wall scene and the bedroom scene are most notable in cringe-worthy special effects. Moreover, I thought the pacing was way too abrupt. The director rushed the dialogue scenes and went straight into the nightmare sequences and deaths. Maybe with a more smoother pace, this movie would have been above average.Also, I hated that the director used jump scares. It's fine if the filmmaker uses them once, but Bayer used the jump scare tactic about twenty times. After the third time, it got very old and tired. To add to that, I thought the death scenes were lacking. The original is known for some brutal deaths and in the remake, the deaths are pretty tame. I understand the director was trying to go the route of- story over kills, but for a film like this, mediocre deaths are a red flag. I honestly believe that the R rating was such a waste. There were very few f-bombs, no nudity or sex, and some blood. That's pretty much it. With some slight cuts, this could have been a PG-13 and brought in more cash.Overall, I thought this rendition of Nightmare wasn't awful, but it wasn't enthralling either. What the main issue is is that this remake was pointless. The acting, while not atrocious, has declined in quality. The direction has also declined in quality. And even the special effects have declined in quality. There's not much redemption here. A nightmare on elm street is cliché and very predictable. While not awful as one would expect, I think a rental is most sufficient.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
161,glenmatisse,Stale,5,29 July 2020,"This reboot has a few interesting ideas, namely the way it toys with Freddy Krueger's possible innocence. Had they gone down this route and made a commentary about unjust mob violence, it might have been able to stand on its own two feet without buckling so often. It might not have made some of the other issues go away, but at least it would have been able to justify its existence by trying to say something new and spin the story in a different way. Instead, it's pretty much a stale rehash of some moments from better movies in the franchise but shot in a music video style.

163,ksj870,Nightmarish Indeed,3,15 May 2010,"Flashback to 1984. Director Wes Craven unleashes a new bogeyman upon moviegoers, a sadistic murderer named Freddy Krueger who strikes at his victims literally within their own dreams. A killer of children who was burned alive by the parents of his innocent victims, Freddy returned as a horribly scarred stalker of nightmares to murder again the young and unwary from beyond the grave. Despite its cast of then-unknown performers (which included Heather Lagencamp, Johnny Depp, and Robert Englund as Freddy), Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street was a huge hit, and Freddy Krueger went on to become one of the most popular horror villains of all time, returning to haunt the nation's movie theaters over and over in a string of highly variable sequels--the best of which, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, is actually the finest of the whole series by far. Now Freddy is back, but this time his vehicle is not a sequel to the original Nightmare, but a remake. Remakes are all the rage right now, though sadly many of them fail to live up to their predecessors. And unfortunately, A Nightmare on Elm Street is NOT an exception to the rule.The plot follows the original fairly closely, though director Samuel Bayer and scriptwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer do attempt to tweak the story a bit here and there. For instance, the new film spends a lot of time delving into Freddy's back story, and even raises the question of whether or not Krueger was killed for crimes he didn't commit. Freddy's victims are handled rather differently this time around, and the our heroine is totally unlike Heather Lagencamp's famous character from 1984. On the other hand, the filmmakers are very much aware they are remaking a very seminal film (at least as far as slasher movies go), and they are careful to pay homage to the original in a number of carefully re-created scenes. Freddy himself, this time played by Jackie Earle Haley, is reincarnated more faithfully to Craven's original vision of the character. Though in many of the sequels that followed in the original's wake Krueger became a joker as famous for his sardonic one-liners as for his trademark razor-fingered glove, Haley's version of the character is once more a cold-blooded predator whose hunger for vengeance is merely tinged with an icy sarcasm. As for Haley's performance itself, he does a yeoman's job of stepping into an iconic role and nearly making it his own. While no one who ever saw Robert Englund's original interpretation of the character will ever deny that his is the immortal one, Haley is likewise a brilliant and multi-faceted actor whose outstanding work is perhaps the new movie's most estimable quality.All that's fair enough, but overall what we have is nonetheless a very disappointing film. Despite the filmmakers' attempts to modify the existing tale somewhat, none of the changes result in any fresh surprises, and if anything the departures from the original make the new film less suspenseful, not more. The various young people who serve as our protagonists are, with the exception of Katie Cassidy's character of Kris, not very likable, and fail to ever manifest the on screen charisma that Heather Lagencamp and Johnny Depp brought to their earlier roles. In fact, the story spends too much time with characters who are not only not especially sympathetic, but who aren't acted very well, either. And while Haley's Freddy is well-played and suitably menacing, it doesn't matter as much as it should because Krueger is on screen so little. The dialog is often pretty bad and rarely believable, even allowing for the fantastical plot, and there are just too many moments that defy good sense, even by the lax standards of horror films. Worst of all, the climax is a cheat--as it always is with modern horror films--and would have ruined even a movie that had been pretty good to that point. Which this film is certainly not.Whether or not the original A Nightmare on Elm Street warrants the near-classic status it is generally accorded, it at least deserves a lot of credit for breaking new ground in its genre and telling a genuinely eerie story highlighted by several quality performances from its no-star cast, even as it likewise suffers from many of the usual excessive vices of its slasher movie roots. But the 2010 version falls far short of its inspiration, possessing all of the original's faults while boasting virtually none of its saving graces. A Nightmare on Elm Street is indeed a nightmarish experience for any unlucky viewer.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

167,Derek237,Freddy for a new generation.,2,4 July 2010,"Like it or not, A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010 speaks to a new generation. This is a sad generation of repression and apparent Attention Deficit Disorder, with sad, stupid parents, who would rather pump their kids full of pills than confront any issues head-on, and would rather burn an alleged pedophile to death than, you know, even think about calling the police or anything like that. It's a stupid movie about stupid people, and I couldn't have possibly cared any less what happened to any of them.We learn that this Freddy Krueger fellow was a gardener who lived in the basement at a preschool (as most gardeners do), and he may or may not have molested the kids. Spoiler alert: he did. Surprised? The parents tracked him down and burned him to death without any evidence or police involvement whatsoever, they somehow got away with it scott-free, and as the years went by, the kids not only forgot all about Krueger, but also forgot they even knew each other. As we all know, repressed memories can come back to haunt you in terrible ways, and this case is about as bad as it gets because Freddy Krueger comes back as a ghost or something with the ability to kill them in their dreams for some reason. I suppose he wants revenge. His plan is to pick off all the kids that he molested in the past. Does he enjoy it, does he get some kind of satisfaction out of it? What does he do in his off-time? What will he do once his mission is complete? I haven't the foggiest idea.There's a lot of problems with this movie. Mainly with the script, which is desperately adapted from Wes Craven's original (ahem) HORROR MASTERPIECE of the same name. Strange, arbitrary changes are made to the Freddy character which immediately strip him of any mystique (an impressive misstep when you think about it, it usually takes about 3 or 4 sequels to do that), key moments from the original are reassembled out of context and make little sense and feel forced (God forbid they'd try to come up with their own iconic imagery), and the dialogue is so full of exposition, it would have Bond villains shaking their heads in disbelief.There's very little I liked about A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010, though I did like Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy, and when you get right down to it, the only reason you're seeing a 'Nightmare' film is for Freddy anyway, and an interesting plot with likable characters would probably only serve as a bonus, so, in that respect, they got the job done with the casting of Haley alone. I'm not the kind of person who would whine that Robert Englund is the only person who should play Freddy, though I know he planted the flag and he will always be the best, but he and Wes Craven helped create a character that became much bigger than the actors who portray him, so I couldn't think of a better choice than Haley to temporarily fill the shoes. He does a great job as Freddy. He very obviously put a lot of effort and respect into the role; it's apparent every second that he's on the screen. It's just too bad the movie was lousy.There's always the temptation to get a little nostalgic when it comes to all these remakes, but I'm not a purist, I was actually very excited about this movie but was ultimately let down. I can remember sitting there in that dark theater, trying to convince myself that what I was viewing was really good. I lost that battle. It wasn't good. Remake or not, sometimes a bad movie is just a bad movie. The original 1984 film was limited by its budget, so maybe the special effects don't hold up spectacularly well by today's standards, but you could tell the movie had heart. Wes Craven made a film that delved much deeper than the average slasher flick. Surely the concept of dreams wasn't just an interesting gimmick for new ways to kill teenagers: they were used as an arena where the dreamer is left completely alone, forced to explore and confront their deepest fears. Here we have the polished 2010 update, with all the money in the world a film with such imagination could hope for, and it's really just content to pop up and yell, ""boo!"" How disappointing.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
168,jimlacy2003,"Nightmare of a movie, lacking the essence that made the original so good.",2,2 October 2010,"I could honestly not sit through this movie very long, and gave up on it at about the 15min mark.Problem: This remake totally looses the essence of the original. I really don't know what they were shooting for this time (maybe they had no target?). The original had a lot more going to it. It was kind of fun, whimsical, very humorous with a dash of mystery and suspense. Plus the actors were kind of sexy in that they were carefree, etc.Even from a totally new viewpoint, this one is just boring! Lacks character, tries to take it self to seriously. Tries to be some kind of pure scary horror or something. And with extra over the top gore/violence judging from Freddy's first kill.Finally this Freddy is plain boring and uninspiring as hell (no pun intended). In the original series (played by Robert Englund) you were just waiting for the next funny-scary thing that Freddy would say! It was catchy! I even tried to reproduce the guttural voice my self ""Welcome to prime time $%^&@!""If nothing else, this version makes you appreciate the original more and see it as a masterpiece. For you viewers that are new to title spare your eyes some agony, skip this 2010 one, and go watch the original(s)!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
169,mdnobles19,A Nightmare On Failure Street,2,2 May 2010,"Did these fools ever seen A Nightmare On Elm Street movie before? I mean they got everything in this tepid remake wrong to the casting sorry but Jackie Earle Haley just sounded like batman on steroids to me and was way too serious with no spunk and wise cracking personality like in the original with Robert Englund and the victims were too distant and boring other than Katie Cassidy who did a decent job. All of the set ups looked the same to me and were uninspired and not creative at all and all of the jump scares were cheap and forced leaving no suspense at all and the gore scenes weren't that great other than the final act which step it up a bit from the dull and disappointing first act. I appreciated that they gave a pretty intriguing backstory to Freddy Krueger depicting why he was haunting everyones dreams and later turning violent towards them but they went too far into it and wasted opportunities on greater potential and I liked it more when you didn't know that much visually because this movie killed the mystery and spookiness of Freddy. The CGI effects in this movie were lousy and lazy and failed miserably at recapturing the 1984 classic and that's what is wrong with Hollywood because they rely too much on star power and special effects than focusing on the more important things and that's why they fu!ck up a lot of movies because they lose the heart and soul of the film if it had it at all. I'm also getting sick of directors of music videos all of a sudden doing a high budget remake that is usually always a bad sign, stick to what you know better and don't mess up classics, do more research next time! I'm very disappointed in this remake because it could have been soo much better if it was in the right hands and with a much better cast and it's funny that a movie dealing with nightmares makes you want to fall asleep than hide under your covers, they butchered a classic! Overall it was lame, different in a bad way, no connection and wasn't truly scary, darkly humorous or entertaining and wasn't fun or memorable, it was too freaking serious also in a bad way and they failed in every way possible and if it wasn't for the pretty good last act I would have given it a lower rating. They should have not bothered this classic and don't bother making a sequel because it will probably suck anyway even in 3D! Not recommended! More of a 1.5 out of 5 stars.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

171,The-Last-Prydonian,If he was dead Craven would be turning in his grave,3,18 May 2010,"It was over a quarter of a century ago that a certain Wes Craven, the Horror auteur behind such cult chillers as ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and like what was to become arguably his most celebrated of iconic shockers (with the potential exception of the Scream franchise). ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" hit cinema screens and chilled and thrilled an eighties generation of teenagers and most probably adults as well to the very core. And still to this very day although some what dated it has held up reasonably well. So why in all that's holy would anyone make the grievous error of wishing to remake it? That no doubt would have been the reaction of a horde of Elm Street devotees who could not dare envision anyone but the legendary Robert Englund as the twisted and sadistic Dream stalker, Freddy Kruger. One of the most iconic and dreaded personifications of pure evil to have been put to celluloid. Gladly may I note that Jackie Earle Haley, an actor probably now best known up to now for his portrayal as the morally dubious socio-path and anti-hero Rorschach in last years epic ""Watchmen"" makes a decent stab(no pun intended)at the role. He however is lamentably unable to save what is ultimately a crude and unnecessary remake. Remakes do at times carry something of a stigma and while it is easy to try and compare this re-imagining to it's predecessor, even taken on it's own it is a flick that pretty much leaves you wanting. The buck for the films short coming has to stop predominantly with screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer who try but fail miserably to impose any of the genuine build up of tension and the sense of foreboding that made the original so memorable. And rather than let the events in the movie gradually build to the first cinematic-ally sublime moment where the psychotic phantom strikes. We're presented with a shoddily crafted prologue in a diner which fronts as a lacklustre opening which compared to the originals boiler based opening which preceded the classic first shot where Kruger facially unseen crafts the deadly claw like glove. A moment which ensnared the iconic image instantly within our very consciousness. And a tool in this version that seems some what superficial within the context of this Fred Kruger's back story. A paedophile rather than the brutal child murderer who tortured and mutilated his innocent victims in the boiler room where he worked. A seemingly amiable gardener who doted on the pupils who attended the nursery where he was partially employed. This supposedly revelatory moment of the film's leaky plot only further undermines any credibility as we're supposed to swallow that not maybe one or two of Kruger's victims suppressed the memories of the sordid acts he performed upon them. Oh, no. All of his unwitting playthings have forgotten the sordid mistreatment they were subjected to. All this while one of the parents is moronic enough to leave clues to what befell the teenage protagonists hidden so the heroine can proceed to piece the missing parts of their past together. A blatant, inane plot device utilised to further the uninspired narrative. State of the art special effects and exemplary, polished set design attempt to add a sheen to set pieces. Some of which are shoddy attempts to reinvent legendary moments from the original which include the notorious bedroom sequence. A scenario where the malevolent fiend claimed his first victim in the franchise. A haphazardly orchestrated imitation it fails to strike the right note of shock and awe while it is preceded by a lead up sequence which equally fails on most counts. Sam Bayer, a director whose filmography consists vastly of music videos he has helm-ed for bands such as Iron Maiden and Green Day for instance lacks the requisite experience and clout to carry the burden of directing an entire picture. Notably one which is a remake of such cult status. Evident given the predominantly uneven performances from the largely youthful cast of wannabe stars. Rooney Mara, an actress who up till now I have been unfamiliar with sleepwalks her through the majority of the picture as it's titular heroine Nancy (who's surname has been changed from Thompson to Holbrook)exhibiting little in the way of charisma or the spunk that made the 1984 Elm Street's resilient predecessor one that you could root for. Co-stars Kate Cassidy and Thomas Dekker (John Connor in TV's short lived ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"") don't fare any better with the slack being mainly taken up by Kyle Gallner who plays Nancy's friend and soon to be love interest Quentin. Old veteran, Clancy Brown thankfully is on hand to offer much needed solid support as Quentin's father who expertly parallels the role filled by John Saxon's Donald Thompson(Nancy's father in the original). But the most prized and honorary of roles falls to Jackie Earle Haley who makes the role of Freddy his own. Putting his own stamp to the depraved monster he wisely doesn't try for a complete impersonation of Robert Englund's Kruger. Suitably brutal and lending the villain the same chilling bravado that he made his own with ""Watchmen's"" Rorschach. He doesn't better Englund but is excellent none the less.A miss step on practically all counts and although it contains the odd smattering of visual and imaginative ingenuity. Bayers's take on the story is not completely awful but Isn't exactly good either and merely serves as a sad reminder of why it Isn't always necessarily a good idea to plunder the vaults of cinematic history. Particularly when the result is forgettable fodder as was the case with Last years ""Friday the 13th"" and the less than satisfactory ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Another Wes Craven creation which no doubt if he was dead and like this piece would have him turning in his grave.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
172,Lando_Hass,Solid take on Freddy Krueger.,8,29 April 2010,"I grew up as a kid watching all the Freddy movies. I thought Freddy was a whole lot cooler than Santa Claus, and I thought he was a lot more interesting. They all have a special place in my heart. As the series went along, Freddy became less scary. He wasn't scary like he was in the first two movies. He went from being a very scary, very mean guy to just being a scary clown, with more emphasis on the clown aspect. Then he was scary again in New Nightmare. And then he was somewhere in between in Freddy vs. Jason. Either way, Englund was in top form in every single incarnation. So of course, the first thing on everyone's mind is how in the hell will Jackie Earle Haley top what Englund has created. I asked myself that. I had hoped in the back of my mind that Jackie would do for Freddy what Heath Ledger did for The Joker. After watching this, and liking Jackie, I came to the conclusion that nobody, no matter how good of an actor, will ever top Robert Englund. Ever. Heath Ledger didn't top Jack Nicholson as the Joker because Heath Ledger simply was THE Joker. In a sense, the role of Freddy is like the Joker; it goes from simply trying to top an actor to just giving up and realizing that the original actor can't be topped, in which case, you simply have to make it different and make it your own. Which is probably what Haley did. It's like if someone were to try and top Ledger's Joker: It wouldn't be possible, so they just do the next best thing: Make the character their own and give their own awesome take on it; it might not live up to the original, but it can still be a good performance. Simply put, Robert Englund IS Freddy, and the only thing another actor can do is simply give a different interpretation and make it a good alternative.I really liked Haley's take on Freddy Krueger, and in all, I really liked this take on Elm Street in general. In comparison to the other movies, this one seems to have more weight, it seems much meatier. It makes you think about things a lot more than the old movies did. They do this by giving Freddy a human side, a back story. I'm sure people are all angry reading this, thinking, ""Humanizing Freddy, what the hell, what a disgrace, blah blah blah LOL!"" He's not humanized in a cheap crappy way. Nothing about the character is really changed, he's just explored more than he was in other movies. It's not like Rob Zombie's crappy Halloween movies where they show Michael as a child and therefore kill off whatever mystique Myers had and shed light on what he was like. The difference is that knowing Michael was human didn't change anything, it was unnecessary. He was a different villain. Freddy, on the other hand, is a person, he's human. His motivations, his thought process, everything about him that is pure evil is taken up another notch and is made a little more disturbing because you know that he is a man, a very, very evil man.This remake was really interesting to me because they made Freddy a really ambiguous character. Throughout the movie, you're left wondering whether or not he's actually guilty of harming the children. During the first half, it seems very likely that he was wrongly accused, and during that same half, you're left thinking that all of his killing might just be because he's legitimately angry and getting revenge on the kids that got him killed. Even though he's an awful person already, you're still left thinking that maybe he was a good guy. He certainly seemed like a really good guy in the flashbacks. This ambiguity added an extra dynamic to the movie that the original didn't have.Now when you finally realize that Freddy WAS a really bad man, that he really is sick enough to hurt children and then wanna kill them because they simply told the truth about him, it makes the movie, and Freddy himself, much more interesting and a little creepier. When you're watching the flashbacks, you're left thinking that he might've been a good guy, but when you realize that he never was, you're forced to realize that this seemingly good hearted guy was a very mean, very awful and evil psychopath underneath it all. When you realize that he's relishing and enjoying killing all these kids (now grownup) just because they told on him, it makes him a lot creepier and just completely different in comparison to the old movies. All the actors weren't really that terrible. Kyle Gallner is pretty cool and he's pretty awesome in most of the movies he's in. Thomas Dekker was pretty good, I liked Rooney Mara as Nancy and Clancy Brown is always awesome in anything he's in. I liked all the actors. Of course people will complain that they're too ""pretty"" and ""modern looking,"" but really, all the people in the original were considered pretty and modern looking back then too. And also, people seem to forget that the original movie didn't have the best acting either (Englund was awesome though). Overall, I really liked the movie. It could have EASILY turned out terrible. It's much better than the crappy sequels, and it's a new take on Freddy, and I really liked it. It doesn't tarnish the original, it doesn't try to imply that the original was crap, it's just a new take. I love how people condemn the idea of this but wouldn't object to a bad sequel. But that's just me. Go to the theater and judge for yourself. This is just my take, my opinion. Score: 8 ½ out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
173,trnjamesbond,Another Remake Disaster,2,8 October 2010,"I must say that it took me a while to get around to watching this film, as does a lot of remakes. I laughed at the idea of this film when I heard they were talking about remaking it.(Yes another Platinum Dunes production money grabber.) Then I finally watched the trailer for this film. Freddy to me looked like a melted wax version from the scarecrow in the masterpiece The Wizard of Oz. And his voice sounded even more horrible. It's to bad they have to get talented actors/actresses and throw them into a movie with bad writing and terrible producing.The opening scene starts out with some unknown character delving into Freddy's world of unreality's. Well if you want to remake a horror movie and make it good you don't start out by showing us all the scares in the first five minutes. The original as we all know shows somebody self manufacturing a killing tool. So I must say that a least there is some suspense. But then after the rhetoric of watching the main character get cut on the palm. And then he seems to get cut in real life, as we see him pull out of the dream. Then after all this there is a title sequence just like in the Friday the 13th remake. Total garbage.And then I waddle through this film watching the kill scenes just like in the original, except all jumbled up. Wow that's all the suspense that there is in this film. I must say that the actors/actresses did a fine job at acting but it is all diluted with the terrible writing and cheesy tag lines from the real series.What I mean by this is the whole ending was stolen from Freddy vs Jason. When Rooney Mara's character Nancy says to Freddy ""welcome to my world bitch!"" Then she cuts his throat. But the only difference between the two scenes is in Freddy vs Jason she chops Freddy's head off instead.In turn this movie is a terrible version of the original, with no original thinking at all just a lot of stolen one liners and stolen scenes. Freddy was not scary at all, it was like watching a bubblegum version of the original. Robert Englund is the only true Freddy, We have been watching his face and listening too his voice for almost a quarter century, and now some greedy company coming down from the Hollywood hills thinks they can top that, well I say NEY NEY to this version. This movie should be flushed down the toilet and into the sewer. It is a waste of time and money. I give it 2 out of 10 stars and those 2 stars belong to the actors/actresses of this film, for at least they attempted to be good and seemed to try their best, too bad the writers didn't, by stealing one liners and so forth. Platinum Dunes corporation should be renamed to WE HAVE NO CLUE PRODUCTIONS. Hopefully these talented actors will pretend that the remake of this film was the real nightmare. And I wish them a very fruitful career. Especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance, I think he did what he had to do to make a bit of cash. But too bad this remake was a failure. But seeing him without his makeup on I think that he should maybe stick to drama or something other than remakes. Typecasting is a very hard thing to deal with. Just ask Robert Englund, and the many others in Hollywood that have been type-casted.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
174,dudedazzreviews,An entertaining remake but it's not scary like the original,7,6 October 2010,"Freddy's back and updated for the modern times for today's teenagers but is this a dream come true for Fred Heads or is it their worst nightmare? The story isn't bad but it's almost the same as the first movie except for Freddy and his past, which they have changed. The characters aren't really very well written, as half of them didn't seem to have much personality whatsoever and you didn't care about them at all. The acting wasn't very good at the start but it soon picked up and from the middle to the end, it was mediocre but the teenagers looked like they should have left school a good few years ago. The character development started picking up towards the end and didn't pace itself, which was another problem with the movie. The pacing was too fast at the start and felt very rushed as within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, the teenagers found out who Freddy is and what he does, there was no shock or nobody denying the fact he can kill you in your dreams. Even though the start was rushed, the middle and end started to pace itself and it became a little slower. The special effects were okay and the nightmares were cool to watch but the one thing that didn't look good was a couple of scenes which didn't look believable as the CGI looked cheap, however the rest of the CGI was okay. The direction and the script were average. I didn't like Freddy's new look so much, I prefer Englund's look.The question most Fred Heads would have on their mind is can Jackie Earle Haley match up to Robert Englund? After watching the entire collection, I can give you an honest answer. While Jackie Earle Haley makes quite a creepy Freddy Krueger, I don't think he could ever match up to Robert Englund, he is Freddy Krueger. It's better and more fun than 'remakes' such as Friday the 13th and Halloween, but just like those remakes (or re-imaginings) it's just as pointless too. There wasn't really any need to reboot A Nightmare on Elm Street as nothing needed to be fixed. Why fix something that isn't broken? Luckily, it wasn't disastrous and it did a good job. I didn't find this scary in the slightest because it was like any other slasher remake/re-imagining. People who are new to the Nightmare experience will probably like this but for people who loved the original like I did, I'm not so sure. What those fans must remember is that this isn't really a remake, it's more of a re-imagining. While it's the same as the original, it's different too and I think that if the fans can enter the cinema with a clear head and not compare it to the original, they could actually find it to be an okay movie.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I feel its underrated, yes its a typical non scary horror movie thats taken too many ideas and formulas of old too seriously however its tense, has a decent story and impeccable pacing. I felt it was well acted and the effects where simply superb. The idea is a great one and its menacing, the trips are tasters of some decent action.

180,andell,The Odd Scare can't save this lemon!,4,6 May 2010,"Having never been a fan of Freddy, I often found myself less than impressed with the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise, though even I couldn't help but admire the originality and craftsmanship of the original, first part of the series.That is perhaps why, after having seen this remake, I can't help but marvel at how big a flop, even for a remake, this film really was. Perhaps the best way to review this is to compare the original, SOLID horror film against it's MEDIOCRE remake! In the original, Freddy is a child molesting serial killer who escapes justice on a technicality, and is friend in a bonfire put on by the parents who are outraged that he escaped justice! In the remake, he's a paedophile who is fried apparently to avoid putting his child victims though the trauma of a court of law.In the original, Freddy's sole interest appears to be stalking, terrorizing, and eventually killing four friends. In the remake, he apparently wants to guide his victims back to a preschool where they were among 15-20 kids.In the original Nancy was the main character, and she was a sweet girl who defied the odds by maintaining a high moral character in spite of her alcoholic mother and distant father. In the remake, Nancy isn't the least bit likable, and all the kids come from one parent households. I don't know...apparently in the reboot of the original, the divorce rate is also a nightmarish 100%! I could go on, but there really isn't a point. This reboot does swipe some scenes from the original, but it mostly flubs them- case in point, when Freddy stretches the wall over Nancy's head...the CGI is so evident in this remake that it's impossible to take it seriously.There is but one recharge that succeeds very, VERY effectively...and that is the concluding scene to this film. For those who have seen the original, you have a hankering of what the final scene may consist of...however this is the sole scene in the remake that actually qualifies as an improvement, and I will not ruin it for you.If you want my honest opinion, at best this one scene is only worth a DVD rental...and so I'd suggest passing up on this one!

183,Dandy_Desmond,Badly remade - a missed opportunity,3,13 December 2010,"I was never the biggest fan of the original Elm Street series - I do love a good horror but I felt the original movie was one film that could be remade and in the right way to be very scary indeed.It has a wonderful idea - serial killer with a home made glove with knives for fingers is burned to death by the parents of Elm Street after justice is not served - comes back years later in the dreams of the parents kids to stalk and take revenge on them. Add to this the design of Freddy is just brilliance. What could go wrong? The original was very strong but I felt in this modern age it could be remade even better.However from the off, this new version manages to mess it up. I'll start ...well at the start of the film. A group of teens in a diner, a bit of chit chat then one who looks 'troubled' falls asleep and is killed by Fred Kruger.No build up, no tension and no class. We all know what Freddy looks like, but for gods sake please keep the 'new' version under wraps for a while, keep Freddy in the shadows, get to know the characters and build some tension. However as this is a Michael Bay produced vehicle for another one of his music video directors and boy does it show. The director has obviously just watched other michael bay produced horrors and has been told just follow that. There is no craft, no sense of dread, no atmosphere and NO scares. but there doesn't have to be does there Michael? you know mugs like me will still check it out.So we have a death inside the first 5 minutes, so the characters are crying and a mess by 10 minutes, know that they are being stalked in their sleep by 12 minutes... so i ask myself - who are these people getting stalked by Freddy? I don't know - I never got a chance to know them before it all kicked off. Rubbish.Then there is the BIG change. Freddys new back story shows he was a nonce and not a serial killer. He didn't even use the glove or kill when he was alive. So where did it come from and why kill now? A pointless change that didn't make it any more scary but maybe just gross.So Michael Bay does it again. The guy has made his money - heck he has made plenty out of me, I fell for this and the horrible Texas Chainsaw films and the new Friday the 13th - he is a business man in the end and will sit in his ivory tower not really caring what movie fans think but I'll say it anyway - Michael Bay you're horror movies are totally and utterly garbage mate.Please avoid at all costs.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
184,A_Llama_Drama,"A terrible ""re-imagining"" but not a bad action/horror",4,18 May 2010,"Fred Kreuger is back and he is meaner, nastier and much more twisted (and burnt) than before. Samuel Bayer has taken on a monumental task in trying to not botch the remaining slasher God of the 80s. First, a reply to all the bad reviews. A lot of negativity has been directed at both the direction and Jackie Earle Haley who plays this new Fred Kreuger. Jackie plays Freddie as Englund played Freddie in the original - like a mean, sick SOB. Englund's original Freddie (and in New Nightmare) was not an anti-hero - he was a creep who was taking massive amounts of pleasure in murdering young teenagers (yes, in the much later sequels the children became pains and it was a pleasure to watch them die but in the first one it was a different case). Jackie's Freddie may have a bit too much make-up and he doesn't look that frightening but he delivers his lines with a very cruel sense of humour that is just SO Freddie.Now, the movie. It's not that bad. it's 50/50. On it's side, it has good pacing, style, OK acting for a horror film, OK deaths for a horror film and a rather scary bad guy. The addition of the micro-naps allowing Freddie to pop up wherever he wanted was a brilliant ploy to keep tension running. Freddie plays some sick games with his victims in this one (taunting one traumatised kid in the boiler room by asking him why he's screaming before he's even started cutting him up was one fabulously nasty scene). The extra cash thrown at it has allowed for some great set pieces (the flooded nursery rooms, the boiler room, the transitions from dream to reality) and it has an even bigger gore quotient that the original. The score is (thankfully) not crammed with heavy metal, alt/rock or classical but it is a combination of the original score by Bernstein and a creepy array of violins and horns (with one too many moments of discord).Being a remake however has it's disadvantages. We've already seen this before!!! Even though they have switched the order in which the cast die, we know exactly when it will happen leaving no room for severe terror during the first set of dream sequences. It's also hard to make a new movie out of a remake, resulting in extreme versions of moments or motives (Freddie is no longer a child killer but a paedophile, and they've tried so very hard to make him vicious that at times he is a bigger parody than in the sequels - a line where he tells a murdered victim that he still has 6 minutes to play before his brain shuts down is just absolutely terrible). The ""twist"" at the end incriminates the potential victims and sends out the completely wrong message as to why Freddie was stalking them in their dreams in the first place - see I thought that by murdering the children in their dreams, he was punishing the adults who took action against him for molesting their children. A cruel raspberry blow. But here we have a paedophile killing children for telling on him! Not cool. The screenplay is this films downfall, really. Leaving Nancy out of the spotlight for the 1st half hour means that we don't know her. We also don't care seeing as she's not (like original Nancy) fighting the ignorance and denial of the adults or at all interesting. Not the actor's fault but the writers'. Introducing Freddie in the very beginning and killing means that when the first important kill happens, we're not at all frightened by Kreuger or fussed. Samuel Bayer also doesn't seem to know anything about horror. One of the creepiest scenes in the original is seeing Kreuger enter Rod's cell in Nancy's dream - indicating that Rod is next. In this one, there is not 5 minutes between ""Tina"" dying before ""Rod"" being incarcerated and killed. No terror. no suspense. The salutes to the original's iconic scenes are dreadful (except from ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy."") All in all, it doesn't manage to capture Craven's ideas or themes. The blending of reality and dreams is never fully imagined as it was in the original. The film replaces growing fear for our victims and heroes with large shocks of discord and jump-frights. But it manages to remain entertaining to the end, it is filled with fun action and what it lacks in substance it makes up for in style. Still, I imagine Craven is feeling pretty good about himself right now.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

186,d_art,'Nightmare on Elm Street' remake,3,19 May 2010,"A remake of the original, this film follows the same plot. Teenagers who live on Elm Street are being killed off one by one in their dreams by a supernatural killer named Freddy Krueger. Either they wake up screaming or wind up dead in their sleep. They, then, decide to try to stay alive, and/or stop him.I generally am not a big fan of ""slasher"" films. They can be cold, depressing, and more annoying than actually scary. Plus, I don't like watching poor, defenseless pretty women get brutally murdered. At the same time, I do like some films that happen to fit into that category—the creative, well-plotted ones, that actually have characters you care about. That's probably why the first A Nightmare on Elm Street freaked me out back in the day. About three people got killed in the original, although it felt like more. The film was a mix of scary sound effects, music, atmosphere, concept and really freaky images. Whatever anyone may feel about that film, one can't deny how effective it was.They too like sound effects in the new movie, but they're often from the constant jump moments accented by loud musical tones. You know, the usual stuff. After the third scene like that, I think my brain started to shut down. They might as well use stock footages by now. The CG in this film is also poor. There's a horrible shot where Freddy is emerging out of the wall (one of the best scenes in the original), but he is like a cartoon wobbling in a liquid-like wall. Some of the killings here are also more artificial and noticeably CG, which sometimes worked in a campy way (I understand you don't want to make it too realistic, either). While the story is pretty obvious by now, in much of the running time, we're waiting for that ""great reveal"" on why these kids are having dreams and getting killed.The characters here aren't engaging. Rooney Mara plays Nancy Holbrook, the main heroine from the first film. She is presented here kind of like an artsy goth-girl, who feels like a secondary character who should be in a different movie—maybe Twilight. The Nancy from the original, on the other hand, was determined, smart, and really pushed the story along. Much of the writing doesn't make the new Nancy shine nor do anything too significant—she's like a victim most of the time. Her boyfriend, Quentin (Kyle Gallner), unfortunately, doesn't bring much to the table, either. The parents in this film play almost no real active role. Maybe that's an indictment on modern parenthood. Who knows? The main villain, Freddy, is now played by Jackie Earle Haley. His performance was unsettling, but not the way I like it. In this film, it is revealed that he was a child molester, an aspect which took out much of the fun out of the movie. Letting oneself to be scared by a movie villain is part of the fun, but why would anyone want to let themselves be scared by a child molester? It made him more dislikable than scary. The Joker, for example, may've been scary, but he was likable. Perhaps the subject is too much of a serious one to be in a supernatural horror film.I, like many, have problems with remakesit's often all about capitalizing on the name of a well-known movie. Some say that such a film should be judged on its own merits—I say, then change the name! You really can't have it both ways, riding on the coattails of another yet trying to be its own individual. The film's ending appears to be lifted from yet another Freddy-related movie with the same line used, but I won't reveal which, except that that film's ending was much more effectively done and certainly more entertaining overall despite its silly conceit of--oops, I almost said too much. * out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art",A Nightmare on Elm Street
187,Corpus_Vile,"Man, this film sucks",1,22 June 2010,"I don't even really have the heart to review this with any enthusiasm except to say that it's awful. I mean, I went in with low expectations after seeing the godawful clip, but it still managed to take me aback with its crapness, which is bizarrely impressive.The characters are cardboard cut out One Tree Hill types that will have you completely uncaring as to whether they live or die. The acting is pedestrian, and Haley is really dire as Krueger, and don't even get me started on his weird ass voice.And Samuel Bayer please take note-having your film peppered with entirely predictable cheap ass jump scares every 15 minutes or so, doesn't make your film scary, it makes it predictable and annoying. The film is also sanitized in tone, (particularly in regard to Krueger's crimes) and completely forgettable. The only half way positive things I can say about it is that it has the always reliable Clancy Brown, and the dream sequences achieve some sort of atmosphere, which is then promptly ruined by Haley's cartoon voiced Krueger appearing for any fan of the original to facepalm, as they're sure to be doing much of throughout the film.A dreadful and boring little film, it's a depressing reminder that for any occasionally decent remake, there's a whole lot more depressingly bland piles of crap like this.Anyway, it really really sucked, and hopefully a sequel will never ever ever even be considered to be mooted in jest.Fans of the original should avoid this like the plague.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
188,montera_iulian,"Good For People Who Don't Know Much About The Original Freddy, Pretty Bad For Those Who Do",6,29 May 2010,"Like the title of my review says... I got mixed feelings about it so first I will judge this movie as a fan of the series.First thing is the story which I kind of hate. I saw a lot of reviews in the past two weeks where people hate the idea that Freddy turns out to be a pedophile in this remake while in the original he was more of a serial ""kids"" killer... which is absolutely WRONG!!! There was even a doc*mentary based on A Nightmare On Elm Street series where both, Wes Craven and Robert Englund, stated that in fact Freddy was a pedophile at his nature. The problem is that those movies was based more on the Freddy the bad-ass killer than on the Freddy the pedophile revenge seeker. Which is true but in the essence there's nothing wrong with the present story just that... it feels like it doesn't fit Freddy as it used to... and that his story was managed in some unappropriate way. Besides that another thing I hated was the ""boring-acting"" of Rooney Mara, the girl who plays Nancy. She gave no life to that character whatsoever. I was more impressed by Julianna Damm who plays Kris, the blonde girl in the beginning which dies kind of fast, because she managed her character pretty well annnndd... of course I'll admit she is fine as hell. Coming back to the characters, Jackie Earle Haley, pulled a good performance for Freddy making him more darker but I hated that the jokes were too serious and that in his few appearances, Freddy isn't that scary when you see him. I still prefer the original just because he knew how Freddy should be played.Besides that the scary moments were not that scary... the kills were not that great, there were some great shots and it was involved some great cinematography but that's it... it was at most of the times predictable and people really started laughing at points. But the really most disturbing thing I found about this movie it's Freddy's face. It was done terribly he looks like a sad person trying' to get some candy instead of being an actual ""nightmare"" to watch. What I liked as a fan of these series was the soundtrack which of course was remade but it did actually well and kind of set the mood in the theater and the visual effects which were pretty good and the editing of the movie, more the video than the sound.As far as a person who knows not too much about this character the movie might be good because it is entertaining, it's not boring and there are some nice visual effects which the majority of the audience loves. Besides that there is nothing else that's good or bad... It's just not the remake I wanted to see as a fan of the series but a good entertaining fantasy-horror movie for someone who's a stranger to what Krueger means. The main point is that I won't hate on the movie that much but I seriously am disappointed.PS: Still, this remake much better than that sh*t Friday the 13th which was plain awful.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

190,seveleniumus,Inferior to the original in every way possible,3,26 September 2010,"While being OK as stand alone picture ""Nightmare on Elm street"" comes like a very poor low budget remake, inferior to the original. Freddy isn't nearly as creepy or scary as he was in the original and while they tried to make him more serious he came up just as being pathetic, almost laughable, lacking the chaotic and diabolical nature of the original Freddy. Acting is pretty bad, even if one would judge by 80's standards. Directing sucks too, failing to create any kind of moody atmosphere. Soundtrack is just a washed off rip-off, putting you to sleep rather than making you sit on the edge of your seat. The biggest complaint I have however is about the special effects. It's 2010, guys, why movie which was made almost 30 years ago looks better than so called ""remake"" ? They had perfect material to work with - anything can happen in a dream and those were the parts where remake could have outclassed the original picture, but it didn't, not even close, all we get is some CG blood and lame moving wall, which I could do in 30 minutes on my laptop, using blender.To sum up - very disappointing movie. Don't watch it. See the original one more time instead. Thumbs down.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
191,cheighlee,Mostly lame,5,21 June 2016,"While the movie itself is kinda OK, cast is also OK, acting is also OK and probably the ""best"" acting this franchise had seen, it's still a bummer of a movie.The premise and the reboot of the Freddy Krueger was probably way better on paper than in reality. While this movie tried to make it more to the point and coherent experience than any previous movie did, they managed to screw up the main villain in process. How? Well, lemme telya.First of all, Jackie Earle Haley is most of the time good choice for most roles. Well, not this one. His voice is weird and boring, he doesn't have ""the stance"" of Freddy Krueger (you know, the one with head slightly on the side) and the mask is just fugly. He looks too much like a real burn victim and less like a functional dream apparition. His nose looks just wrong, eyes too.But looks aside and except the face, other parts of the costume are good. What's not good is Krueger's character. He's not charming, he's not devilish, no flair, he's just some random killer that has a burnt face.I also didn't like Freddy in flashbacks while he was a man, only thing they showed us how he's a coward and not the bad man he actually was. There's a strong dichotomy between pre-burned Fred and after-burned Fred here. Englund's Krueger was a bastard in both cases and it made sense in a way. Here he's just random.Then we come to the supernatural part of the whole thing, it's the least imaginative Nightmare movie from the franchise. No interesting kills, no weird stuff in nightmare world, just grim-dark stuff. Maybe even worse - dream-time is so short here. No long elaborate dream scenes, just quick cuts, few jump scares and that's all.Lot of the lines from Freddy and others are just copied from other Nightmare movies (wet dream joke, your lips says no, etc). It's just halfhearted excuse of a movie.Lack of charismatic villain, dream imagination, no comedy and apparently - no understanding of the main character, makes this sub par entry in the franchise.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
192,Legendary_Badass,A Remake on Elm Street,5,30 April 2010,"With remakes being inevitable, I'd prefer that they be based on flawed originals. The new Clash of the Titans, in concept tried to do this. This is my stance on remakes. The trouble is that Hollywood green lights remakes of popular, good, movies because of their justifiable built-in fan bases. The 1984 A Nightmare on Elm Street was a refreshing, novel, approach to the slasher subgenre film. I can understand why Platinum Dunes would have was well-known music video director Samuel Bayer helm its remake.A Nightmare on Elm Street focuses on a group of teens that share haunting nightmares. When they go to sleep, they have demented dreams of a maniacal burn victim named Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley). Freddy chases the kids through his world and if he can get his knife-tipped glove on them, they die in the real world. The remaining teenagers are then tasked with insomnia as they search for the reason why Freddy wants them dead.I'll start with the positives. From an acting and casting standpoint Jackie Earle Haley is the guy you want in this role. He has a haunting voice that he modulates with perfection, coming up with his own unique take on the notorious Mr. Krueger. When combining his talents with the usual high production values (for horror films) provided by Platinum Dunes, you get a workable formula. Unlike the other films, but like Platinum Dune's other remakes, there is an attempt at a Freddy Krueger origin story. It just so happens I like the way this part of the movie is told and having the cursed teens see it in their dreams is interesting.With these elements working in the film's favor, there are many conflicts elsewhere. Notable among these are redundant dream sequences. The settings sometimes change but they almost all play the same way: teenagers walk through eerie environments followed by a Freddy attack. For a screenwriter to be so lacking in imagination is mind-boggling. Freddy's costume is easily recognizable, but the new burn victim look of his face is unappealing. Chances are a real life Freddy would look more like this than he did in the '80s, but The English Patient is not a frightening countenance.What mars the first half of the film is an insistence on not developing characters. We assume these are high school kids, who mysteriously are devoid of personalities, and then they die. I understand the concept of an ensemble cast, but when main players take such a backseat that when they finally move to the front of the minivan we don't know them.Despite a rocky start things do turn around, but our unfortunately thickheaded protagonists are slow to put things together. They should be going on about a week of sleep deprivation, but the new Nancy (Rooney Mara) seems only mildly annoyed. When Heather Langenkamp played Nancy, she was just as active but with more lines we had a better understanding of her frustration.The biggest problem of all is that the 2010 A Nightmare on Elm Street is not scary. Scare tactics all center on sound effects and it gets old fast. Every time Freddy appears there is a scream of some kind that pierces the ears of the audience. No one is jumping at fright; maybe some will jump at the surprise. This is silly, outdated, and uncreative.After Remake on Elm Street, Platinum Dunes is seemingly out of horror franchise fodder. Almost all of their remakes have been critically lambasted, but most of them managed to be profitable. I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that they plan to shell out as many sequels as the original franchises generated, but I'd prefer that action since it would keep them busy and off of more esteemed films.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
193,e-m-hobo,Left me unsatisfied...,7,7 February 2020,"With lines suggesting that one character that was dying couldn't bring the others back to life, to me it felt like I was left hanging. I had hoped for things to return to normal, if it had played out that way, with those that were murdered restored to life as if nothing had ever happened, maybe even reversing the events of their childhoods.I sort of feel burning his body once again instead of burying it was a mistake, but in terms of storytelling, I don't really feel the story digs into this fact. It might have led to him coming back once again, it might not have.In terms of the directing, I was set up for beautiful atmospheric shots as seen in the title sequence. I expected the movie not just to introduce an alternate perception of reality, but also a visually distorted view of reality, like a psych-out music video high on propane, blood, and horror.I watched it without preconceptions, but it felt like it left me hanging.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
194,blackmambamark,"Michael Bay keeps proving that he only directs, and produces big budget turd bombs",4,30 April 2010,"Let me begin by listing my laundry list of complaints in Hollywood. First off, is it that hard to find a decent horror script these days? Your only means to creating new horror is riping off of someone elses idea? I mean sure, some movies can be re-booted, but why totally remake something that doesn't need to be touched? Second, Michael Bay is seriously the anti-Christ of Hollywood. It isn't bad enough that this man makes big budget blockbusters designed for the kids in the special ed room. But he is the man who always finances these horror remakes. So not only is he destroying what summer blockbusters could be, but he is destroying the foundation of horror classics. However, the only reason i chose to see this is because of its original creator Wes Craven. Who actually read the script, and said ""Yes, you should make this"". With his nod of approval, i hope to god this movie is not the atomic train wreck im thinking its going to be.Well, in short, its movies like this that make me hate modern day horror films. Now i know why Michael Bay liked this script, because its all shock horror pieced together with a pathetic plot and horrible dialogue.......his kind of film. And now i know why Wes Craven gave his nod of approval. It's because his last 5 horror/thriller movies are all crap, he isn't making a dime these days......so mega millionaire Michael Bay offers him all this money to buy the rights, so guess what, Wes Craven sold his sold to the devil so he could finance ""Scream 4"".......wow, is it even worth it? Anyways, onto the review.Where on earth do i begin with this pile of garbage. First, lets start with the story.......we all know it right? In the original, Freddy attacks you in your dreams and gains more and more power by feeding off of your fear. Well, not with this one. Instead its some half cooked idea, filled with plot holes that you could fit a volkswagen in. I mean come on, just one simple line of dialogue explaining how he's gaining power, isn't going to make up for how retarded it sounds. Also, rather than focus on the story, they decided to try and cover it up by having you jump out of your seat at every turn. Well, they tried, but they even failed at that. It was jam packed with the most cliché' sequences. Oh no, a girl runs into a closet and she's looking through the small hole......oh wait, he disappeared, i wonder whats going to happen next. I mean its just one after the next.Now im guessing that everyone is wondering how Jackie Earl Haley did playing the ""new"" Freddy. He did decent.......but thats it. Robert Englund created a classic horror character, and it is very hard to top. And in my opinion, Mr. Haley didn't really come close. But i will say this, his acting was better than anyone else in this. Because the only thing that is comparable to the original, is the cheesy acting. Watching the original, i sometimes laugh at the main character and how she tends to overact some of her scenes. But this movie topped the hell out of that. I mean seriously, how many times in one movie can someone scream either ""WAKE UP!"" or ""DON'T FALL ASLEEP!"".......Those lines must have been delivered over a hundred times. It was almost like a transition between scenes. Yeah, i get it, you don't want to fall asleep because Freddy will get you......i don't need to be reminded every 30 seconds with someone screaming ""SOMEONE WAKE ME UP!""Bottom Line, this movie is one of the fine examples of why i sometimes hate Hollywood. Not only do i hate the cliché' films you put on the market, but i hate how you butcher all the classics. This film happens to fall into BOTH categories. Not one aspect of this film is worth watching. Not even the death scenes. So is this the worst horror film remake? No.......i still give that award to ""Friday the 13th""........but wait, guess who produced that film as well.......the anti Christ Michael Bay. Please people....PLEASE....... do not fund this trash, it is your curiosity that is funding this massacre. You already know that it wont top the original, so just wait for it to come on HBO or something. Because if this mess keeps up, the next remake will be ""The Exorcist""......and if that day ever comes, im moving to France.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

This is the first PD (Platinum Dunes) film that I could actually watch all the way through. In other words - not bad. Now that may not sound like much of a compliment, but considering that I have loathed their other remakes, that is really something.I liked the metaphor of the pied piper.I really liked Quentin and Kristi. Those kids really did their best and I thought they were the most 'real' of all the kids, and I felt sorry that they had to suffer. I also felt Kristi was strong enough to be Nancy character.. (more on that later).The plot was actually intriguing, and I actually felt interested on how this was going to turn out (and I have seen every entry in the franchise).I REALLY liked the back story, and WISHED they kept with the 'innocent' story.. That was very effective to me.Now what I didn't like.The lead actors were just wrong , in my opinion. Jack Early was totally miscast. He had the wrong body (and facial) structures for being a scary villain. The actress playing Nancy? ugh. Both of these actors seemed to be speaking with cotton in their mouth.Which brings me to the makeup for Freddy. That was just horrible - and not in a scary way. It looked like he was wearing a stocking over his head, with some black spots. He mumbled all his lines... Just didn't work for me.The actress playing Nancy was like a robot. She almost made me want to fall asleep! If only they switched the actress playing Kristi with her, it would have worked better.Once I got invested in the 'freddy is innocent' plot line, I felt cheated by hearing ""ha ha.. no he's not!"" Also, once his guilt was confirmed, his whole ""revenge based on what you did to me!"" motivation no longer worked. He was guilty - and I am supposed to feel sorry for them killing a pedophile? uh huh.Which leads me to my last point. Freddy was a pedophile in the original version, but it was so danced around, it really never felt 'sick to watch.' Here? I really felt like I was watching a pedophile trying to molest children and I actually felt dirty watching those scenes. ugh.The music was disappointing. wasn't annoying, but didn't add.And will somebody PLEASE just provide a reasonable ending to this film?6/10 not bad, but could have been MUCH better.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

And just like Halloween and the Friday the 13th remakes A Nightmare on Elm Street is far from the standards of the original. I think it is pretty unfair to the movies if you compare them to the originals cause they can actually be better than most of the sequels that were made. Don't get me wrong it is definitely no A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) but it is better than Part 2, 5, and 6.What you should expect from this film is elements we've all seen in the first film. Expect just about the same movie except with different actors, not very good character development (which I'm guessing the film-makers were relying on the first film to give that to us), and something that was irritating me and probably the entire audience through the movie, making Freddy look like the victim. Now was the film-makers view of Freddy in the remake that he was a victim of false conviction, I'll let you find that out on your own.Even though I just listed some of the things that I didn't like about the film it doesn't mean there are a lot of bad things about it. The special effects were very good (but then again when it comes down to special effects in a Nightmare film there really isn't a question about it). It was about thirty or forty minutes into the film that I felt little bored because we've all seen a lot of this stuff in the original it wasn't until it got around the last half-hour or so that it started picking things up a bit and then it got exciting. The new Freddy did surprisingly well considering Robert Englund was the ORIGINAL Freddy and no one could really see anyone else playing the part. While it did fill strange that Robert Englund wasn't Freddy in this film I have to give Jackie Earl Haley the praise for doing this considering this could be a defining moment in his career taking over the role of one of the biggest horror movie icons in history. While he did good he still has some work to do if he's going to match up with Robert Englund in this new role for him.While the film doesn't add many new scares or anything new period to the Nightmare franchise, it does a good job at holding its own until the end. While there is still a lot of work to be done for this new franchise (which is obviously being planned as I write this) the new Nightmare film shows a lot of potential for the franchise and I wouldn't mind going to see a sequel as long as it does feel like an original Nightmare film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
201,DJ_Shilo,Freddy Reimagined,8,5 July 2020,"I was severely ambivalent about seeing this remake for ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" I have been against it for a long time because Robert Englund's face is Freddy Krueger and has been for 26 years. Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers both have masks, and you can hide them, Freddy, you can't. After the ""Friday the 13th"" remake turned out to be a gory and stupid mess, as expected, I had low expectations for this and no real desire to see it because of Platnum Dunes and Robert not returning. As it got closer to the release date, I dropped some of my guards when I saw Jackie Earle Haley was playing Freddy Krueger. Once I saw the trailer, I needed to see what they had done.It's about a teenager who is seemingly murdered in a local diner by a wickedly burnt man wearing a red and green sweater who has a glove with razor fingers attached to it. Nancy (Rooney Mara) begins having nightmares about the same man and wonders who he is and why he is taken affection to her. Looking for answers, she discovers a long-buried secret among Springwood's parents and that the man is Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley), who is haunting the dreams of her friends. When they begin to die in reality, she discovers she may have a connection to Freddy from her childhood. Along with her friend, Quentin Smith (Kyle Gaallner), they attempt to stop Freddy while trying to figure out who he is and where he came from before its too late.""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one horror film that pulled me right into the movie and introduced me to the world of horror. Freddy scared the hell out of anyone who dared fall asleep. The concept of the film was fun and straightforward. He haunted the dreams of the teenage kids in Springwood; If they died in the dream, they were dead in reality. After ""Friday the 13th"" came out last year, I hoped this would be better and, to my surprise, it is because when you become jaded by horror films and everything starts to feel the same, you don't care anymore. I strongly agree that the failure of ""Friday the 13th"" last year is why this film pulled me in. That and Jackie Earl Haley, who takes over the role of the infamous Freddy Krueger and If you ever saw ""Watchmen,"" you can see why they chose him to play the part.I watched ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" back in 2003 for the first time, and It was haunting and creepy with some interesting ideas: the razor fingers, the way the film worked with the killer in the dreams was interesting, and the character of Freddy himself was scary and entertaining. In the end, I liked what I saw, but I was slightly disappointed because I did learn much about Freddy. As I sat in a packed theatre for this reimagining, I kept asking myself, ""Am I finally going to learn about something more about Freddy, or are they going to screw up his legacy as they did to Jason?"" I got the answer, and I wasn't disappointed, but you can almost bet there won't be a sequel to this, which is a bummer.Robert Englund was great in the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and Jackie Earl Haley does a fantastic job. His voice is deep and ominous, and he looks incredible since he looks like a real burn victim through the use of CGI. You wouldn't know this because the film is spaced out well, and Freddy has about seven minutes of screen time. Like before, he pops up in random dreams to toy with the kids and scares the hell out of them. Most of the picture is the same structure, but they have re-tooled some scenes for the older fans to remember the original scenes such as Johnny Depp's bed scene and Lisa's death are changed a bit.Since this is more of a reimagining than a remake, they return Freddy to his dark and evil roots rather than make him comical, which Is a good thing. Let's face it; the sequels to the series were not great, blood, gore and money. I am one of the very few that like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge."" That's right, yes. Why? Because it did do something different and was not the direction, everyone was expecting back in 1985. It's a twisted film for sure, but it is highly entertaining, and I liked it for being different. I like this film for trying to do things differently as well.The sequels got more and more comical, with Freddy slowly lost his evil edge as they came out. Now, he seems more intent on torturing kids. In one sequence, he scares the hell out a teenage boy, hangs him upside and tells him, ""we have six minutes to play"" before torturing him. One of the things I liked is that they try to make you think differently about Freddy. He is not portrayed as a filthy child murdered in this reimagining, and it leaves you wondering what happened to him as more gets revealed. Did the parents take justice into their own hands and burn alive an innocent man? Did he do something to the kids? Why is he so affectionate with Nancy? You do get the answers in the end. Jackie Earle Haley's performance will probably get a lot of flack because Robert is Freddy, but at least this film gave us something of an update with a character instead of ""let's make Jason set traps in the woods."" Yawn!

202,Spooky2001,Nowhere As Good As The Original,6,11 May 2010,You should not go into this movie thinking this movie will blow you away or thinking it will be an exceptional movie because you won't be blown away and this is not an exceptional movie and is no where near as good as the original but this movie wasn't that bad. Of course nobody can really replace Robert as Freddy since he was and will always be the best and original. Jackie Earle Haley was not too bad at making the character his own but he is better in Human Target. Though some of the acting may have needed more work. They didn't really need to remake a movie that the original was really good. The problems with this movie was that why remake a movie that doesn't need to be remade and why dis they have to change him being a child murderer to a child molester (They didn't) but I do admire that they tried to change it up a little but they didn't need to. Al in all this wasn't that bad of a movie.,A Nightmare on Elm Street

205,fatfil-414-451797,Souless and Pointless,3,6 November 2021,"It's taken me over ten years to get round to watching this remake, and I kind of wished I hadn't bothered. While the original was creepy, and its dream sequences fantastical, this had none of the magic and the suspension of believe the original allowed us. Many scenes were recreated from the first movie, the classic bath scene, the body bag in the school hall to name just two. But they just didn't have the same impact. Also I'm not sure what it was about it, but Freddy's voice sounded like a kooky voice over on a you tube video. Didn't help that some of the acting was lacklustre, particularly from the parents. I would say, if you are a lover of the original, this will be a disappointment. It adds nothing to the story, just dilutes until it loses coherence.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
206,georgia_cushion,Not a nightmare.,9,10 July 2011,"I was expecting this to be another crappy remake of a crappy slasher film. But I was proved wrong. We were looking for scary films to watch and we came across this one. I will admit there was one bit that made me jump out of my skin but overall it wasn't scary. I gave this 9/10, but I have not seen the original so I think that most people give it bad ratings because they compare it to that. It had a good story-line and there was a reason for him giving those poor people lack of sleep, not just mindless killing like I thought it would be. I thought that Kyle Gallner delivered a superb performance (yet again!) and there were some other good actors too. I am still a little confused of the 18 rating though, personally, I would have only rated it a 15. Overall I would say that A Nightmare On Elmstreet is a good film with some great actors and a decent story-line. I would rate it 9/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone mature 14+.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
207,mcw6957,Oh No They Got It Right....Wait Thats A Good Thing Right?!?!,7,2 May 2010,"Im old enough to remember the original & smart enough to know that watching it now that it is very problematic. Things is I've always felt the downside to most of Cravens movies is that he trys to jam too many concepts into one single idea & then cant figure out which one will make the best point in the end. There is no better example among his body of work than NOES 84. However if there is a personal favorite of mine that isn't too problematic it would have to be The Hills Have Eyes 1977. Other than that I've really grown to loathe his movies. So what makes Freddy & NOES 84 special? Freddy was the first of the group (Myers,Jason) to have a voice. He wasn't just going to stalk & kill you no he was going to make fun of you too. However despite the dare to be different NOES 2 what followed was a dumbing down of one the coolest horror icons of my generation.About 3 years ago before word of a remake ever got out I actually got to talk to Robert Englund actually there were a few of us in that room & people were firing various questions at him which he was answering with delight like a champ. I was sitting directly in front of him & after a half hour just looked right at him & asked him how he would feel about being replaced in a remake of a NOES. I must of spoiled everyone elses fun because for the next two hours thats all he talked about.Sorry people.He said that it was OK & that he had done all he could with the character. I tryed & tryed to poke holes in his logic but damn that man has his wits about him. Long story short Robert Englund is one of the coolest people I've ever met.So there I was reluctantly watching NOES 2010 with Robert Englunds wisdom echoing in my head & everything he had said that day years ago was unfolding right in front of me & it made sense. I must of said to myself ""oh thats what he meant"" about 20 times in my head!First of all if you didn't see Jackie Earle Haley in Little Children & automatically think oh sh@#! that guy IS Freddy Kruger then you just don't get it. Second if you think perfect casting just happens when its supposed to your nuts! I was stunned when Jackie got the part but also not really. Notice I've said little of the remake so far? OK so enter Platinum Dunes (oh no)who to date have only gotten the two Chainsaw remakes right & nothing else. Then screenwriter Wesley Strick (game over man)who has done nothing but collect a paycheck on the backs of other peoples art as a career. Talk about a missed opportunity. Wait Samuel Bayers the director wtf is going on here?! This going to be an epic disaster now I have to see it but for all the wrong reasons. Well see it I did & by no means is it a masterpiece but it is far far from the pos I had expected to it to be. I don't know how they did it & don't want to know but all the elements good & bad come together to make a Noes 2010 a smart (what!) lean mean horror machine. The difference between the two Freddys are that Englunds was very physical & deliberate & Jackies is all mental & reigning chaotic rage. Freddy is back albeit slightly modified for a whole new generation but back where he belongs in the collective nightmares of our young. All you need to know about this remake is that Freddy Krueger is creepy again & not the vaudeville clown the studios turned him into back in the 80's. Oh & thankfully Craven kept his hands off of this. Now go see it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

It was vary pleasing to see both a normal (if one could describe FK, ever being normal) before being turned into the monster that kills teenagers in their sleep. References to the original series abound, the atmosphere, the symbolism of innocence, being corrupted.

They didn't even begin telling the story until 1/3rd of the way in. Just Freddie this and Freddie that. To be honest I was never given a chance to get to know or care about these kids. And listen, they weren't even kids. They were obviously in their mid to late twenties, except for Jesse.I hated the pace, the lack of story, the lousy direction, Freddie was like 3 feet tall. He had no presence. (Sorry, Jackie).I can see why Robert E. refused to be part of this. Without Wes and his need for real storytelling what's the point?

210,NpMoviez,"Not a great one, but is not so bad to get all that hate.",5,20 August 2021,"This movie ain't as bad as many people say it is. I don't hate it. But I don't like it, either.Jackie Earl Hayley has given his best to the role of Freddy Krueger, I give him that. But neither I feel his presence in this movie, nor do I find him menacing at all. I don't blame him. It's impossible to find a substitute for Robert Englund. This movie, back when I watched it, made me realize why Robert Englund was great as Freddy Krueger. One good thing is that we do get a backstory of Krueger in a dream sequence, at least not by mere exposition. It also succeeds in generating a brief amount of compassion for Krueger, which lasts until the obvious twist that he was indeed a pedophile. There are just a few things that it does, which isn't done in the original film. It gives some scenes to to explain the back story of Freddy rather than just giving a narration in the middle of the film. The biggest positive is that it respected the original one and did not pretend as if it any better or superior to the original. In fact, it has some scenes which are directly taken from the original, but I don't see them as cheap tropes to succeed. Rather, they were good homages to the original.But it was a remake which wasn't necessary. A remake of a beloved film is necessary, in my opinion, if things can be done equally good in different ways or if it has some ideas being explored which weren't or less explored in the original film. Except for the backstory of Freddy not being an exposition dump, this film had absolutely none of them. Right from the beginning, till the end, it was obvious that this movie was an inferior remake of a beloved (then) 26 year old classic. To make it less interesting, they even use the stale tropes of modern horror films - cheap jumpscares. It's not that it was jumpscare heavy, but it wasn't good enough to not to rely on jumpscares. Honestly, the first film shouldn't have ever been remade. But if a remake was mandatory, then I don't think a something better than this is possible, giving me stronger reasons to believe that it should've never been remade. They even included that stupid altered ending from the first film, which prevented me to like that film more than I do.There's a plotline which shows Nancy and her boyfriend investigating whether Freddy was innocent or a pedophile, which involves a montage of scenes of Nancy searching through the internet about the kids who accused Freddy of trying to rape them. It feels like as if they included the plotline just to make it look different than the first one. It doesn't make the film any better. Internet has made our lives easy. But I am not going to believe that we can get information about absolutely everything in the exact form we desire. Sounds nitpicky, but it's something I cannot get over with. The internet search generates the EXACT information Nancy needed for the plot to move further. And, there's some plot convenient video site which isn't YouTube or any other popular site or anything like that. She gets the very much required video evidence of Freddy's kill! That's totally unbelievably convenient. Doesn't make even a tiny bit of sense at all.The major thing that holds the movie back is that the movie doesn't have that psychological horror element which made the first film so good. The presence of Freddy cannot be felt even when he is on screen. Again, I don't blame the actor. It's the writer and director's fault. When you know that a particular scene from the original is gonna appear, you stop caring about it. And that's really disappointing because in the original, they are the scenes which make the movie terrifying. Paying homage is great, but it could've been better. The kills are apparently gruesome. But they are totally flat and feel pointless and forceful. They don't give you shivers. They just remind that you're watching a slasher movie.Obviously, this movie is basically the original movie going mediocre. The entire plot and the story structure is nothing different than that of the original. Basically, if you have seen the first film, you've already seen this. If you don't want to see it, you can completely skip it. It was a remake I never wanted. As a fan of the series, I totally understand why many fans didn't like it. I didn't hate it as much as they did. But I won't ever defend this movie against the ones who hate it.Score : 5.8/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
211,Austin_Powers-1,Darker Freddy delivers a good scare,7,18 November 2012,"Freddy Krueger was one of my favourite movie monsters when I was a kid. I still get great joyment watching (some of) the old movies, but when I saw that a remake was in process I was thinking ""well, it must have come sooner or later."" But I am an open minded guy and through to give it a try on blu ray.First of all the remake matches the dark tone of the original film. The story is practically the same only you get a little more background story about Freddy, which is actually quite nice.Now how about the new Freddy ... My movie monster hero has always been Robert Englund, and no doubt that he has a huge space in my heart. But let it be said: Jackie Earle Haley makes an excellent and damn scary Freddy. He does not try to copy Englund's Freddy but instead ends up creating his own dark voiced and demonic movie monster. We all knew that he wouldn't be Robert Englund, so if you can leave this thought and keep an open mind, you are in for an awesome and scary new Freddy Krueger.As Freddy's nemesis Rooney Mara makes a terrific Nancy!! When she is worried and when she cries, she makes you believe in her fear. JOB WELL DONE!! The rest of the actors are more or less forgettable.One of the few things that bothers me a bit is the nightmare scenes. Though they are very beautiful shot and have great nasty and dark atmosphere, they never got under my skin for good, as each one of them is very short.All in all I recommend this remake. Jackie Earle Haley makes a horrifying dark Freddy Krueger, Rooney Mara makes a true believable Nancy, the nightmare scenes are nasty and the story about Freddy is quite disturbing. BUT if you are a devoted Robert Englund fan, you need to keep your mind open. The new Freddy is different, but will give you some good scares and a decent amount of delightfully dark humour.Let's hope that Jackie Earle Haley accepts a sequel :-)",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I would have preferred a film with Mara as the center focus from the beginning.Freddy Krueger is menacing but not as he should be. His backstory is passable but takes away the mystery and supernatural elements of who he is as a villain. It also created so many more questions like how the hell does he remain on Earth and how does he now have powers to haunt you in dreams when he was a dude like ten years ago?

215,milescorn,Wes Cravens New Nightmare was way better than this......,1,3 May 2010,"When the lights went down and the movie started I kept thinking to myself, why didn't they just re-release the original 1984 film. I know, they thought they could improve the movie. Did they really do that? I do not think that they did. I also kept thinking to myself, wow, all of these teenagers that have never seen the original because it is 26 years old, and heaven forbid that they watch something older than 5 years ago, and yes I know that there are some that do, and yes, I work in a video store and I when they ask for horror movies they would much rather watch Jennifer's Body over the Exorcist because ""That is way too old."" Anyway, they were really loving the movie. This ""Wanna Be Freddy"" was not the same as in the films from the late 80's or early 90's, and he was not as scary as the original Robert England Freddy, it was like when Roger Moore tried to be James Bond, after all he was no Sean Connery. This new ""Freddy"" could hardly open his mouth, he looked like he was wearing a rubber mask, and he was just not that scary. He seemed to have no idea how to use his gloves, since when is making them sound like a pair of scissors more frighting than the consistent scrapping on metal? It just became more lame as the film went on. Then we are made to believe that the children made up the stories about him. What is more frighting, a monster that just likes to kill children, or a child molester who wants them to remember that he really liked them? Kind of twisted, but not scary. In the original we don't even find out who Freddy is until way late in the movie, and only then we know that he was a murderer who was seeking revenge.

The tone is too dark and dreary with a little too much emphasis on the pedo aspect which the original cleverly steered away from while still letting you know it existed. Throwing more money and special effects at this did nothing to enhance that surreal feel of the original movie. In fact it subtracted from it. I don't mind trying to restore the scary side of Freddy ala the first two films but that isn't my issue with this, everything else is. When Hollywood does one of these remakes of a classic its as if no one involved ever watched the original and is in it only to make a few more bucks off of the same story.

The new film also follows the fate of a group of suburban teens who are stalked and killed in their nightmares by the horribly burned Freddy Kruger. However, although there are many large and small homages to Wes Craven's masterpiece, the plot is neatly reinvented and the audience is never allowed to predict what will happen next. Jackie Earle Haley is amazing as Freddy, he successfully brings a unique spin to the character despite the fact that he is new to the role after eight previous franchise entries.

I love that in this version they go to the internet to figure things out.

Even better than the original, and here's MY reasons why. Jackie Earl Haley plays Freddy Krueger in this reimagining to the 1984 classic. People are outraged with the film mainly due to the fact that people think no one else can play Freddy like Englund did. Well I personally thought Jackie' s version of Freddy is much more dark and terrifying than what Englund's version is. Robert Englund played the stand up comic Freddy in the original films. Making him less of a dream killing boogeyman you're supposed to be afraid of and making him a huge laughing target. I find the original 8 films to be highly hysterically funny and not scary what so ever. So why label them horror films? As for this 2010 reboot I think Jackie plays Freddy the way Freddy should be played. An evil, cold hearted, sinister and seriously dark demonic slasher villian. Someone that is actually intimidating and absolutely horrifying. Jackie's Freddy voice is total nightmare fuel and is a voice you'll hear in your head even after the film is long over with. The plot of this film is also 10 times more darker than anything the original 8 films gave us. Face it people, this film is better than the others. The old school films are fun but are they really scary? This generation needs this 2010 reboot because now they can be terrified of Freddy instead of taking him as a joke.My rating for A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010) a solid 10 out of 10.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",A Nightmare on Elm Street
222,michaelant555,Very Irritating!! Even For A Slasher Movie,3,19 August 2016,"What the hell???The writers and director have come together and done a complete bodge-job on a remake of a great movie.

I really don't know what these people thought they were doing. It's like someone said, ""Hey! Let's do a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street"", then just threw it together that week and released it. Why wasn't the remake of such a great movie put in the hands of a reliable team who could get the job done properly? The cast's acting and interactions; how the the scenes are played out; the little actions of the characters, even the look of Freddie; absolute crap, and very irritating, with the exception of Katie Cassidy, who is a great actress, I think.I know it's supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat and in a state of anxiety, but it produced the wrong kind of anxiety in me. It made me angry and tense because of the ridiculousness of everything about it, and that it was nowhere near as good as the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
223,halcyonbear,Don't be quick to judge.,7,4 May 2020,"Remakes. There are probably way too many of them. By the same token many people react a bit too negatively to them. If you have fond memories of an original, no one is forcing you to watch a remake.
Sometimes though, nostalgia for a film can make us shut our minds to different possibilities. Let's not be so quick to judge. Horror is one genre that can date very quickly. Don't get me wrong; I still enjoy the original A Nightmare On Elm Street, but a lot of that is to do with the feelings it reawakens on a bigger scale. I'm not so much merely watching a film, but reliving part of my late childhood. Watching the 1984 ANOES now, it is dated and a lot of the acting questionable (granted, it's not meant to be Shakespeare). A lot of horror purists baulked at the idea of this remake when it was first announced, indeed it took me a while before I got around to watching this. I have just watched it again. It's not a remake to be tossed aside so lightly. It's darker in tone than a lot of the slightly campy, darkly comic installments of the original franchise. Jackie Earl Healy is more of a serious threat than Robert England's iconic interpretation of Freddie Krueger.
My only complaint is that this film threw away an opportunity to make Freddie's backstory more interesting. At one point we are lead to believe at one point that he may have been innocent of the terrible crimes he was accused of, the vigilante action against him unjustified. It turns out he was indeed guilty. I personally would have let him be an innocent man, unjustly killed. Villains are often more interesting when they have a good reason for their actions.
Other than that, it's a darker reimagining that should maybe be judged on its own merits, rather than those of a dated, yet still enjoyable original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
224,hakobyanhakob81,The worst of the worst!,1,18 October 2010,"I truly wouldn't be able to believe anything could be this bad, until I saw this one. The movie was disjointed, and let me say that the unconvincing Freddy Krueger is only half the problem. The script is very negligently written, perhaps I should say copied, although the 'creators' claim they did everything from scratch, this co-called remake more resembles an unfinished rip-off. Everything it tries to do on it's own, sucks. Any scenes resembling to the original, are very poorly executed. Where was the atmosphere? Where was the nursery rhyme? What was the point of showing the girls with jump rope? They have just literally taken some of the original scenes (the death on the ceiling, the corpse in a body bag being dragged along the school corridor, which actually leads nowhere, therefore is pointless) without even understanding what to do with them. This movie really scared the hell out of me with its' lack of creativity.How could a script like this ever be approved to start shooting? There was no need in remaking this movie, the original Nightmare is still very actual and scary nowadays. All in all, this movie sucked and hardly deserves 1 out of 10! They should have given this money to some independent young filmmaker full of creativity and eager to do something new. This one is not even worthy to be compared with the original, so I'll say that Freddy vs. Jason was 100 times better than this piece of crap.Long time ago Michael Bay did a nice job remaking 'Texas chainsaw massacre', but it doesn't mean they can go on remaking everything they encounter without even bothering to do some decent writing at first. P.S. Freddy's voice was unfeasible, so was his stupid make-up.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
225,solidgameboy12-1,"It's not just a fan's review, this Elm Street's not that good.",4,30 October 2010,"Before this review starts, I must state that I am an Elm Street fan. I happen to own the first movie twice on two different editions, the fifth movie in Rated and Unrated (DVD and VHS, respectively) and spent an entire evening trying to finish the ""Never Sleep Again"" documentary about the particular series of movies. It should also be mentioned that not just by a fan's standpoint, but also by a legitimate reviewer's standpoint that this movie is not very good.The movie's story is familiar, but for the uninitiated, the story is about the killer Freddy Krueger (We are already out of the gate with ""Freddy"", not ""Fred"", as he was called in the original) who kills his first victim in, I'm not kidding, the first five minutes, not withstanding credits.The children of Elm Street start dreaming of a man with horrible burned skin, red and green sweater, and a pair of razor fingers who follows them in their dreams. They seem to figure it out rather quickly that if you fall asleep and die in your dream, you die in real life. Knowing this, they begin many sleepless nights, hoping that the next minute isn't the one where they slumber- eternally, that is.It can be said nearly from the beginning that the movie tries to incorporate enough of the first movie without trying to be a complete shot-for-shot remake that surprisingly enough, the movie suffers because it doesn't do just that.The reason why the original worked so much better was that the special effects were truly special, most of them handcrafted. This version resorts to CGI in just about every aspect: The Deaths, Any tricks Freddy pulls off, and I get the feeling a lot of the sets. The original was scary because it didn't really have stages, or a lot of money, so even creating nightmares was, pardon the pun, a nightmare. Here, you can almost feel Michael Bay (Who is producer) having no issue coughing up a cool million to put a new special effect in, even if it's purpose is to brag that it has money to do it.The Characters also suffer because every one of them is as one-dimensional as cardboard. We have a Nancy, but guess what? Except for drawing, we don't know anything about her. We have newcomers Dean, Jesse and Kris, but we have nothing to make us like them, nothing to dislike them, nothing. In fact, even Freddy suffers from this too, because he's too developed.This movie brings in a concept that the original movie's director, Wes Craven, chose to drop when he filmed his version, Which was that Freddy was a possible child molester. While this idea has divided fans of the original movie to even vow not to see this remake, I praise the writers and the director for even considering it, but it is just about where my praise wraps up.Another weak link in this movie is Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy Krueger, who plays the performance scary, but it comes off being lackluster. The special effects are as plain as the nose on your face (or For Freddy's case, the lack thereof) as Freddy's bottom lip almost never moves, his voice carries this aggravating rasp, and his dialog becomes too long.The original Freddy did talk, of this much we know, but Freddy wasn't given 100 lines in a movie, either. The original Freddy would either yell or tell a one liner, this one carries complete sentences, and it gets old very fast. Jackie Haley's performance, as you listen, sounds more like his performance as Rorschach in 2009's Watchmen, which better used Haley's acting ability instead of this movie using Haley for his familiar voice and not much else.Another conflict is that the movie is rather lacking in Nightmares, or dreams, which is odd considering that with all the money they had working on this movie, dreams should have been the most explored idea within the picture.This movie is not good, with the exception of the new Freddy storyline and better actors (They act well, they just haven't got any character traits to make me care for them), this movie could have been called ""Freddy's On Elm Street"" and at least it would have been more honest than the whole ""Nightmare"" word in the title.Because of the poor writing and conception, you could gather this movie was made more to make a buck than to pay respects to the long running series, and because of this, we aren't given a movie that could have been praised with the original, but feels like a parody of the entire series. Let me put it this way: This movie isn't scary, it isn't nightmarish, and it isn't enjoyable. Pretty much the only way to connect to my fellow Elm Street fans is, it's one movie on par with almost three of the original Elm Street movies (The three worst ones, that is).4/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

228,mike_brunton,Had its moments - but sooooo little new.,5,20 May 2010,"I think other reviews summed up this movie very well. For a big budget remake of an old movie you would think it could have been a lot better. My impression watching it in the movie theater was - what's new? As others said -the death scenes look the same as the old movie, in fact this movie suffers from so many other remakes. A lesson for all directors out there - it's better to make a completely new movie than remake an old classic. Any director out there wanna remake Alien or Aliens? I didn't think the acting was terrible, nor did I feel the direction was awful either. Perhaps the biggest problem was the screenplay and story itself. This could probably have been done better taking in a lot more slack from the original. Aw god -but it's a remake, they can't just come up with a new storyline -can they? Yes they should have. As always, as a horror genre fan I can give this a 5/6 out of 10, for those not really into the genre (and who have seen one of the original 8? movies) you might well score this a 3 or 4.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
229,VenturousArtist,"""A Nightmare That Lasted Short.""",5,4 May 2014,"The ninth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise takes another twisted turn that this time doesn't involve the comical tones that turned a once darkly humorous beginner into a stale cartoon imitation. The series has come a long way but still unfortunately comes short of many things. With this being the second version of the first tale retold with a different perspective, it shows that it learned from previous mistakes but still hasn't overcome the previous missteps.The story many viewers remember was it revolving around a group of high school students being haunted by a phantom named Freddy. They don't know whether he's real or just simply a fictional character in their mind until he begins a spree of murder and terrorism. This edition stays faithful to follow the same story, but even with that, the comparisons with the 1984 version shows a vast difference with subjective appeal for fans and the newest viewers.With many things that were done wrong in the original, were sometimes done right in this edition. What this edition sometimes did right, the original sometimes did better. Despite the differences, some performances and effort comes mildly stronger in this version that can still alienate and engage a particular audience. As one of the viewers of both, including the original sequels, I'm not one of those that was terrified or found either editions vastly superior without something missing.If you extract the performances, generated effects, eerie soundtrack, and look deeper into the tale of Elm Street - you'll realize beyond it all that this is still a nightmare that lasted short.

Like the Kris death scene wasn't as good as the original version but it was similar to the death in the original version. In the film Freddy was considered a child molester instead of a child murderer(if anyone has ever seen all the ""nightmare"" films then go to Wes Craven website and he said that he considered Freddy a child molester instead of a child murderer but never got around to change the script in time)but throughout the film Freddy tried to keep Nancy awake to finish her off last(she was his favorite) but her boyfriend Quentin woke her up and killed him in reality. But if anyone has seen the first film and compared it to the remake the scenes are very alike but some things disappointed me in the remake(Glen death scene not in the remake, Tina/Kris death scene- no blood on the walls, Freddy stalking Nancy scenes, etc.)but the new Freddy face was really impressive in the remake.

233,fewald139,Interesting new spin on Freddy can't save this boring mess,4,9 April 2020,"After recently checking out the 2009 remake of Friday the 13th (which actually had a few decent kills), I decided to give this a go on Netflix. I'm not a long-term fan of slashers, though I'm an avid fan of the YouTube channel Dead Meat, whose Kill Count videos on this series were my favorites aside from the Final Destination series. A Nightmare on Elm Street has some creative kills and an interesting backstory for its joke-spewing villain--at least, it used to.I won't get into specifics for the plot. It loosely follows the original, but I'm here for the kills. Freddy Krueger's look here is far more accurate to burn victims than the original look, which I give them kudos for. They've changed the character here--he now touches children in addition to killing them. A lot of fans hated this change, but I quite liked it. In a remake that never scared or even remotely intrigued me, this added a creep factor that was sorely needed. However, the repercussions for this trauma on his victims is never explored psychologically, which would have been interesting.Let's talk about the kills. Blah. Some heavy references to classic kills of the franchise are redone poorly with excessive CGI (Freddy coming through the wall is the most egregious example, before the laughable CGI for the final moments of the film). Other kills, while at first shocking, run low on creativity. Freddy doesn't toy with his victims much here, nor does he use the dream world in new and interesting ways. This is a horror film about a villain who kills his victims while they dream...it should be full of creative kills.I found this film to be more of a waste of time than offensive. Many times I switched tabs from Netflix to check my email or do other things because the movie didn't hold my attention. The reasons I didn't rate it lower were twofold: one, you can tell there was some semblance of caring in the making of the film, given its level of detail to Freddy's physical appearance, its homages to previous films, and its cast of mostly competent actors. Two, there were a surprising number of characters I learned to care about here. In a genre that loves to try to make you care about loathsome characters, this was appreciated.

After a whole bunch of movies (including this latest attempt) we hope Freddy Krueger goes to sleep and stops making any more movies! To me the biggest problem with this movie is the lack of any rules that govern the game. At first you can only see Freddy while dreaming, but then the lines of reality get blurred, and finally he can just appear at anytime whether you're sleepy or not. Why, he can even jump out of a mirror and kill somebody if he wants to... no sleep required. And if you really are sleeping, why in the world would your body go flying about the room - no matter what's happening in your dream. It just makes no sense at all.All the jump scares are accompanied with loud music accents, but you'll be expecting them anyway so they aren't scary. The acting is passable, but the real culprit is boring dialogue and predictable plot. Hey I know... let's have the parents conveniently go out of town even though our kids just experienced major trauma. Uh, duh! While I'm not a fan of horror movies in general, a good scary film can be recognized and sometimes appreciated even if it's not ""your thing."" This is not that film.

235,rockinkettles-1,A Scary Elm Street,7,5 May 2010,"Let me just say that I honestly didn't expect much from this movie. I still like the original better but it is very good for a remake. I thought Haley was good as Freddy. He did his own take on the character as anyone else would. Just like Ledger did with the Joker, he made it his own. There are some genuinely scary scenes in the new Elm street. I was startled a few times. The cast of teenage victims are nothing special. That is all they are there for, to be victims. The story of course if you don't know by now is when these group of teens dream about the burnt killer Freddy Krueger, if they die in their dream, then they die in real life. Freddy was a molester at a pre school The parents got revenge by burning him to death. Freddy comes back for revenge years later when all the kids are teenagers. He haunts them in their dreams, and one by one, kills them in their dreams. I honestly thought the original Elm St.was one of the most original horror films I ever saw. It is still a creepy classic. My favorite death scene in that one was with Johnny Depp (his debut). He gets swallowed by his bed and buckets of blood come shooting out of the bed and all over the ceiling and bedroom. That is one scene that could not be topped in the remake. There is plenty of blood and gore though in the new Elm st. that will satisfy horror fans. Well, that is my opinion on Elm st. If you see it, try not to compare it with the original and with Englund's Freddy. If you don't then I think you will like it. And I still think the very first Elm was the best with Englund.

The people who made this should be ashamed. If I were Wes Craven, I would be furious. They butchered his masterpiece. Now I've heard that a few critics liked it. I think they fell asleep and dreamed it was good. My friends and I spent the entire movie laughing and making comments about it. My friend said it best; "" Congratulations, you have me rooting for a child molester."" The characters are so awful and stupid, you can't wait for them to die. The dialogue is so bad it's hilarious. And the acting, oh don't get me started on the acting. Now I know the acting in horror movies is almost never great,but come on! Katie Cassidy who plays Kris is downright awful. I could not wait for her character to get killed off and what a relief when that happened. Kellan Lutz, while only on screen for about 5 minutes, annoyed the hell out of me(and no not because he was in Twilight) He just did terrible in this. But the person was Rooney Mara who plays Nancy. Now she is the true meaning of a terrible actress. She pretty much has a blank expression on her face for the entire movie. Not to be rude but she reminded me a lot of a cardboard cut out. As the same friend said; ""She should play a Terminator."" But feel kinda bad about saying that so maybe she was just having trouble with the character. I really want to see how she does in The Social Network. Now the only thing that is even remotely close to being OK is Jakie Earle Haley. I loved him in Little Children and Watchmen. He tries really hard to be Robert Englund,but falls short. I mean he was decent. And I did like how it showed a little more of Freddy's past.

238,ryshpr,Can I have my money back please?,4,21 May 2010,"""Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet.""I will be blunt. A Nightmare on Elm Street is not a remake of the original. It is a re-imagining. I went into the movie expecting a good horror and I was sorely disappointed.The film first introduces us to Dean, who escapes the dream in which the film opens with. Naturally, when he escaped I assumed him to be the hero of the movie, what with this nor being a direct remake. But then he died. So Kris, the girl he was talking to before he died, must be the heroine. The film follows her for a while, she escapes Freddy a few times and you really start to root for her. Then she dies. It's not until around 30-40 minutes in that we really start to focus on the actual main two characters.But that's just it. The makers have clearly attempted to trick you into thinking some of the minor characters are actually major characters only to have them die and the focus to shift onto another character. The only problem is that this failed completely. If you've seen the original then you already know where the plot is going, thus the surprise of the faux main character's deaths just isn't there.The redesign of Freddy's appearance didn't sit too well with me either. I had heard that the crew were going to make Freddy scary again. This really didn't materialise. I'd actually prefer Robert Englund in the role of Freddy using the original make-up that has made the character a classic.The 'witty' one-liners that Krueger comes out with are just terrible and had me cringing at multiple points during the movie, ""how's this for a wet dream?"" springs to mind. Freddy says this when Nancy is running down a hall and the floor turns to some kind of tar-like substance. Other cringe-worthy one-liners include ""I'm your boyfriend now"", ""your mouth says no but your body says yeeeeessssssss"" and ""I'm your nightmare"". These might not seem too cheesy when you read them, but believe me, they are on screen.On a more positive note, the re-tooling of Freddy's background was an effective alteration. In the original, Freddy is a child murderer, but in this remake he is a child molester. This helps significantly in making him more evil and really pushes you more towards hating the man. Rooney Mara is also specifically notable as her fantastic portrayal of Nancy brings the rating of the film up a little.Nevertheless, this isn't enough to save this abysmal remake. Awful CGI (the blood Nancy falls out of in a dream), poor story progression and ineffective plot twists, not to mention the various obvious plot-holes and mistakes altogether with the fact that it's just not scary make this very so-so indeed.Can I have my money back please?http://ukmore.tk/",A Nightmare on Elm Street
239,Pozdnyshev,Agonizingly Boring,5,5 April 2015,"I don't like recent (from 2000 and onwards) remakes of classic horror movies because they're always shallow, dumbed-down shadows of the original. For example, the new Evil Dead reboot had unlikable and one-dimensional characters along with a stupid and needless sub-plot about heroin addiction that some idiot threw in for God knows what reason. But some guy I was talking to couldn't say enough glowing things about the 2010 remake of the Wes Craven classic. So I decided to give its poor reviews the benefit of a doubt, and I rented it from Netflix.It turns out I was totally right about it being a pallid, depressingly dim-witted echo of the brilliant 1984 original. However it wasn't quite as bad as I was afraid it would be: it was just boring, but not offensive. And it touched on a few twists to the Freddy mythology that were interesting before the movie just threw them away.What I mean that it wasn't offensive is that at least it doesn't put teenage promiscuity on a pedestal like it's the coolest thing in the world and has no consequences. Cabin in the Woods did this and it was annoying even though it was a really good horror movie. The kids in Nightmare 2010 may be beautiful but unrelatable cardboard cut-outs, but at least it's not a part of the Leftist propaganda that we evolve backwards into rutting, diseased, unplanned-baby-having chimpanzees.In fact, the movie is aggressively chaste. Which brings me to the most interesting thing about it: at about the 40 minute mark, I realized that the writers had transformed the Freddy mythology into something slightly different from the original: The first Freddy was a truly scary personality, a smart and nasty guy you wouldn't want to mess with. He, like Jason, represented the fear of sexuality -- his victims were nubile and sexually active teens. And like many other slasher movies, the teen to vanquish him was the relatively androgynous and chaste female.The 2010 reboot's Freddy, in contrast, is just pathetic. Almost everything he says sounds laughably phony, like a wimp trying to sound tough. The scenes with him playing with children were the only scenes that looked right to me -- he looked like he just LIKED kids, but wasn't a child killer. The movie entertained the idea that Freddy was just an unfortunate misfit who fell victim to a mob of misguided assh*le parents.This suddenly felt RIGHT to me. It fell into place when I saw Nancy burning herself to stay awake, then had big cut-marks on her arm after waking up from a dream -- self-mutilation is rampant in kids who can't deal with the problems in their lives -- it's like, her parent's violent and unjust bigotry in the past, ironically in an attempt to protect their children, has turned around to bite them in the ass by making their teen-aged children want to burn and cut themselves. And they want to burn and cut themselves out of guilt for their parent's lack of remorse over murdering an innocent man for what amounted to him being ""weird.""Almost as if to say that a hysterical crusade against imaginary pedophiles and child-killers really only hurts children in the end. I was temporarily roused from my stupor induced by the phony characters and contrived plot.Then it turns out Freddy really is just a sadistic psychopath played by a wimp pretending to be tough, and they kill him.

Throughout the film I was pretty annoyed about the child molester story line. This was never introduced in the 1984 film and again put me down again. - I sticked to that feeling.

Jackie Earle Haley is about as best as you can get at playing Freddy Krueger. No one will ever beat Robert Englund. He's just Freddy Krueger! I don't really need to explain the plot, you all know the plot, BUT, let me explain the changes. In the old Nightmare On Elm Street, Freddy Krueger would always mess with people before he killed them. In this one he just kills them and doesn't mess around. Nothing humorous to say, nothing, just kills them. In the original he was a psychopathic killer who hurts children. In this one he's just a pedophile. Loves to screw all the women and girls. To me, that put me off. All this put me off. So Freddy's character changed a lot, but did it work? Not for me. Didn't work for me.All the acting was decent and there's some gory scenes, all in all, not the remake I was expecting and had hoped for. Everything about it is decent, but nothing great. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
245,kxok630,Inept film making right here on Elm St.,2,18 May 2010,"This snoozer's only ""nightmare"" is how it rips you off.A puppet stooge ""director"" (who only does low-rent music videos) was hired as a front, but the ""dumbing down"" formula of this film's bank roller (Michael Bay) is still obvious. Bay and his director, Mario Nette, give us an artificial Freddy that is about as scary as a kewpie doll.This pretender film tweaks Freddy's character slightly in a shallow and vain pretense of ""artistic re-imagining"" (lol) of the original. Apparently, the fact he's a serial killer with the mystical power to enter victims' dreams to murder them is not vicious enough for these talentless copy-cats. So unnecessary plot elements that add nothing, such as pedophilia, are randomly tossed in. This may be either an attempt to give the movie relevancy, or noise to keep the audience from nodding off; in either case, it fails. The story is convoluted with meandering nonsense, and the ending brazenly leaves unresolved plot lines (that nobody cares about), as woefully futile teasers to promote sequels. The incompetently stylized camera angles and editing look more like a Brittney Spears demo than a horror flick. Loud ""jump"" noises, ineffective CGI usage. The guy who plays Freddy looks like somebody dropped a piano on his head, but his mediocre acting skill is the least-awful you'll see in this thing. Where they found the rest of this cast of drama 101 flunk-outs is uncertain; I suspect they were hired sight-unseen from an internet spam ad. These ""terrified victims"" look ridiculous. They moan and groan with plastic emotion, and blandly recite lines without interest. It would all give you a headache, except for the fact that you'll either be laughing hysterically or sleeping by this point. A poor production all around. Skip this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

But, Heather Langenkamp has always been the face of Nancy Thompson for over 30 years and she's still an iconic figure to this day. The effects of the movie are okay, but I don't think they were strong enough to save this movie remake from being so dull, story-wise.Overall, I would say that you should just stick with the original version of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" because it's a lot more suspenseful than the remake.6 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

249,Ben_Horror,Michael Bay takes his Platinum Dunes gilded sledgehammer to the Nightmare franchise...,4,19 May 2010,"What a great concept: a dagger fingered entity hunts kids down in their dreams; if you die in your dream, you die in real life. There's never been a better concept for a horror movie than this. Wes Craven did it right the first time in 1984, which would make you wonder why it needs to be done all over again. As Michael Bay and his company Platinum Dunes continue their pointless remaking trend, they've now turned their attentions to the beloved Nightmare franchise. Quick everybody, run for cover.Let's be frank: the original series started off good, but went rapidly downhill with the third and fourth sequels being the only ones to stand out before it all turned into one big shaggy dog joke. However the first movie was great and it was great for several reasons. For one thing it gave us a bona fide horror icon in Freddy Krueger: his striped jersey, fedora hat and clawed glove is right up there with Darth Vader, James Bond and Indiana Jones in terms of iconic status. When we first saw Freddy, he was a character so real and vivid, it was almost like he always existed and it took Wes Craven to coax him out of whatever realm he was living in.The movie also cemented the whole body surreal horror movement after David Cronenberg had kick-started it: there could never have been a Hellraiser without there first being Freddy Krueger. The movie also had interesting characters, a good story that made sense and was bursting with imagination that was clearly limited by a tiny budget. In the remake the problem is strangely the exact opposite: tons of money, but clearly not enough imagination.It's not that the remake is terrible or a terribly made film - it's not. It's watchable enough, and more or less entertaining on some level. It's just that its so... pointless. What the makers have done here is essentially taken moments from the original film – a kind of 'greatest hits' compilation - moved one bit here, another bit there and crafted an entirely new story out of it. The original moved along really fast and was pacey as director Wes Craven's foot seemed to be floored the entire time. Despite coming up with some nice visuals, Samuel Bayer doesn't quite achieve the same thing. He clearly isn't the storyteller Wes Craven is. The new film feels labored as if it's constantly running out of gas. While the cast is okay, there's no Johnny Depp or Heather Langenkamp here and they are sorely missed.Surrealism was a staple of the first movie, but it's nowhere to be seen in this. You won't see any licking tongue coming out of a phone and there is nothing like Freddy chasing nubile teens down dark alleys with elongated arms. Even the dream sequences themselves are for the most part boiler room-bound and each one is usually preempted by a visible change in lighting. There are no surprises here. It's tired and tested film-making: component A fits into component B. It's bad when even the actual kills are uninspired. Now let's get onto Jackie Earle Haley...You may think that playing Freddy is easy: surely anyone can do it? After all, what more is required than to throw on all the make up and talk scary? Surely any actor could do that? Wrong. And it becomes all too apparent here. In Robert Englund we had an actor who was able to somehow project himself through all the prosthetics. Englund gave Freddy something: a personality. Even when he wasn't being the joker he eventually would become in the later movies, there was something there we couldn't quite put our finger on. Englund's acting actually managed to show through the make up and Freddy became a real individual. For some reason Jackie Earle Haley – good as he is – doesn't quote accomplish the same feat. His Freddy has no personality. There's no real character in there. It's as if anyone could have played the role the way he does it. Even when he was a joker, Robert Englund's Freddy still had a living aura you could visibly identify. Jackie Earle Haley's incarnation is just dull.There are a few positive aspects. In the original 80s version, moviegoers were essentially cheering for a serial killer. It's not so the case here. It's clear the filmmakers are trying for a rougher, more realistic approach. While in the 1984 incarnation Freddy was only ever referred to as a 'child killer', here they come straight out and tell you he's a child molester. Also, unlike Englund's version, Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy is not the type of killer you would root for and think is somehow cool. He's actually much more repulsive. There's also that questionable perverted background... How can you admire someone like that? There's no question fans will find it more difficult to cheer for him the way they did for Englund in the original. Also the make up in this movie is more realistic and hideous and less rubber looking.Apparently Earle Haley is signed up for at least two more of these. It would make you wonder why. One strange legacy of all this continuous pillaging of old horror movies that were made in the sequel mad 80s is that we're now living in the era where sequel remakes to actual sequels is a reality. Next up: A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 - the remake. Please Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes stop this pointless exercise of redoing good movies and instead focus your efforts on making some ORIGINAL movies. Or at least remake movies that were bad to begin with.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
250,darkraven_109,A generic slave of the original,5,21 May 2010,"After waiting for so long here (the Philippine release of ""Nightmare"" was a few weeks late), I finally got to watch one of my (personally) most awaited movies of this year; the remake/ reboot of the classic ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. So after watching everything from the 1984 original to the pathetic ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" was this new one any good? Does it do justice to one of the most memorable horror films of the 80's? Well, sort of but it still falls to mediocrity. This movie is not as horrible as many critics put it; it's just mediocre.If you watched the 1984 original, it wouldn't be hard to guess what would happen to this character and the next. The movie seems more like a word-for-word copy of the original rather than a reboot. For the first half of the film, majority of Freddy's first appearances are highly similar to how he makes his presence felt in the original. I know it's a remake but at least try doing something new like how the 2009 ""Friday the 13th"" executed its kills. Simply copying the kills instead of creating new ones removes the sense of dread you get when trying to guess what happens next.Another complaint is about the dreamworlds; they all look the same. The NoES series may be known for bad sequels but it's also known for the creative dream sequences where Freddy screws with his victims before killing them. Now, everyone ends up in the boiler room or something that looks like it. What the hell... where were their worst fears? Where was Freddy screwing what could have been their own piece of paradise? As for the good stuff, the film succeeds in bringing forth the dark atmosphere of Freddy's world. Maybe it was just due to the brand new CGI effects but it still worked. Now, Freddy's world looks a hell lot scarier than it once was. This was helped by the fact that the new Freddy wasn't as fun-loving as the Englund version. Now, he stalks his victims while saying a one-liner or two but instead of laughing, you feel a bit disturbed. Haley's delivery on the character makes Freddy feel like he's more of a threat rather than a maniac clown with knives for fingers. Personally, I prefer Haley's Freddy over Englund's. As for the rest of the cast, everyone pretty much delivered but a little more screen time would've been nice.Another good thing is that they actually bothered to change was the climax. If you haven't watched this film yet, well, let's just say this version's climatic face-off is actually more realistic than the 80's original that involved a booby trapped house and the power of believing. While these helped keep the film alive, they aren't enough to redeem the movie's story.So in the end, the new ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" does shed some new light on the old franchise, but this is no ""New Nightmare."" This reboot/ remake is not good enough to redeem a franchise plagued by crappy sequels but it will do well to pass the time. If you haven't watched any of the old ""Nightmares,"" then this could serve as a starting point for watching this franchise. If you did watch the the old ""nightmares,"" especially the original, then this won't disappoint but it won't impress. Lower your expectations before watching.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
251,j_walking1516,The reviews are really obnoxious,5,10 February 2020,"People clearly just hated this out the gate solely cause it's a reboot.

252,Clockwork-Avacado,"The ""Batman Begins"" of the franchise",9,28 October 2013,"Taking a fairly decent 80s-90s franchise, which started off with one average film, and a load of terrible sequels, in which things get campier and campier, until the only thing sustaining it is its' cannibalistic regurgitation of the same clichés. A franchise that didn't take itself nearly seriously enough, and ruined its' chances for survival by being so over-the-top, and not respecting the material enough in the first place, material which could have been incredible if done correctly. Instead, a franchise of very dated, 80s-feeling movies where you worship immoral characters, and just laugh at violence and camp jokes. Remaking this franchise into a serious, dramatic, well-visualised thriller, with a strong cast, rationalising its' mythology, and amping up nearly every aspect of its' production.The Batman movies? No. Actually, it's 2010's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", a beautifully designed, scary piece of work, which remakes something that - for a change - actually needed to be remade. Wes Craven's original intention was to take the entire thing seriously, but allegedly, Robert Englund added all the gags. Instead, with Jackie Earl Haley, we've finally got a chance to see what the original vision for Freddy Kruger could have been like... except much better, because, quite frankly, Wes Craven, like Tim Burton, is a pretty immature director, who enjoys sending up everything he does.The plot is a mixture of nightmarish cat-and-mouse, dream-like visuals, and a mystery in the real world, with very dark roots. Teenagers are dying in their sleep, every one of them seeing the same figure, a man with a burned face, and knives for fingers. Only, these aren't just dreams: What happens in your dreams, happens in real life. Freddy Kruger, the dream killer, is one of the most fascinating characters in horror movies, and, robbed of the self-parodying humour, is genuinely menacing. We're gradually given flashes of him, until he finally appears in full, and his impact, every time, is considerable. The steaming, industrial basements are well designed locations, really nightmarish, as he stalks his victims through a landscape like something from Hell, with flickering flames, and steaming pipes, and Kruger himself has never looked so dramatic, or so scary. There are a few one-liners here, but they too work with, rather than against, the overall tone.It is violent, but the violence is not especially over-the-top, and at the same time, is actually pretty effective. It isn't just, as some critics said, a succession of meaningless teenagers getting hacked up. Each death scene gets more and more disturbing, and the concept of a killer lurking in your dreams is powerful, and something we can all identify with. Haley gives a great performance, much better than his slightly underwhelming portrayal as Rorschach in ""Watchmen"".Rooney Mara is absolutely stunning as Nancy, the heroine, a student artist trying to uncover the secret that is buried in the pasts of her and her friends. In the finale, against Haley's Kruger, she is brilliant, one of the few people you could imagine being able to stand up against this incarnation of Kruger. ""Arrow's"" Katie Cassidy gives a nice performance too. The rest of the human cast are fine enough, although few get the chance to be anywhere near as annoying as any of the bunch you used to get back in the old films. The plot is strong enough, that we rarely get the chance to notice deficiencies in acting.One of the real stars of the movie though, in terms of adding sheer impact to the film as a whole, is composer Steve Jablonsky. Charles Bernstein, the original composer is credited in the end titles as having came up with the themes, but I can honestly hear no relation between his synthesiser - heavy, largely discordant ambiance, and this absolute work of art. It's chilling, dramatic, mournful, and immediately sucks you in. This is easily the best horror movie soundtrack since the original John Carpenter ""Hallowe'en"" score. If watching the credits doesn't give you chills, then maybe you're in the wrong genre - this music lifts a 7/10 good film, to a 9/10 near-masterpiece. Amazing use of vocals, great orchestration. Easily Jablonsky's best work.The story is unpleasant in places, but the mythology of the Kruger character has been rationalised. The hat, the claws, the jumper...the reason he haunts your nightmares. (deep rooted childhood psychological fears manifesting themselves in adolescence)The Mystery side to the plot keeps everything moving nicely, and the dark flashes of the secret we do get along the way prove to be scary in a totally new way, adding a totally different malevolence to the character. Everything is fleshed-out perfectly, and the whole story stands-up excellently. The only slight complaint I have with this version of the back-story, is that it's so neat, it seems unlikely that there's room for a sequel. A sequel would be amazing, but, like Carpenter's ""Halloween"", not at all necessary. This film stands alone, and has successfully re-invented a lame character from the 80s, and polished him up to an iridescent sheen. The ending is perfect, and reminds us all, that reality and dreams are harder to distinguish than we think. Is this end a dream? Or was the entire previous scene a dream? Definitely one of the major works in horror in recent years, amidst a sea of sick films about torturing people, a beautifully-crafted, imaginative fantasy. It's got a lot of impact, and manages to be disturbing, without being exploitative. Perhaps the best horror re-make of all time, this will hopefully become essential viewing amongst the people who can tell the difference between an intellectually-scary piece of cinema, and sick garbage. Not just built around it's gory special effects, this movie is a powerhouse, and whilst it may have a few deficiencies (some slightly lame acting in places), it's solidly made, with the courage of its' convictions. Without really annoying characters, or fidgety-direction, this is a really timeless movie",A Nightmare on Elm Street
253,carolinephillips-47427,Lousy CGI and miscasting hurt an admirable attempt at remaking a classic,5,12 March 2017,"This remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street might not reach the terrifying and imaginative heights of the 1984 original, but it has enough charms of its own to keep it from being a complete disaster.While in the original, we know that Freddy's a bad guy from the start, this film plays around with the notion that Freddy was possibly innocent and used as a scapegoat. It's a fascinating story line that could have really been something special, but it's thrown out by the end completely.The idea of micro-naps - tiny little moments where you think you're awake, but your mind is asleep - supply a few of the films scarier moments since these are the only dream sequences in the film that use the rubber reality that made the original franchise so suspenseful and scary. In those films, you never knew what was real and what was a dream until things slowly started to feel off. In this film, the entire color palette changes when characters into their dreams and it starts snowing in bedrooms and things like that. It's obvious and kills the suspense.Katie Cassidy is wonderful and charming as the ""Tina"" character in this film. Unfortunately, she's so appealing and the film gives her the first 30 minutes almost all to herself that when the film starts to turn its attention to Rooney Mara's Nancy, the film falls apart.Mara seems to be channeling a sullen Kristen Stewart with her performance, which makes her Nancy incredibly dull and unlikable. She's given great support by Kyle Gallner and Thomas Dekker, but they only make her performance appear flatter than it already is.The outrageous use of CGI makes everything look like a bad video game from the early 90's. They definitely haven't gotten the memo that less is more.All in all, this isn't the disaster you might be lead to believe. In fact, the first half hour or so is rather interesting, but it can't sustain a 90 minute movie. This is a rental or late night cable viewing at most.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

This is abso-freaking-lutely terrible. There was one unique thing: for a while it made it appear as if perhaps Freddy was falsely accused of child molestation and that was the reason that he was back and in dreams, but they only carried that part of the storyline about six minutes. And at least in the remake they made the girls prettier. If you think about it, the only pretty girl in the original was Johnny Depp. Heather Langenkamp, especially with make-up to look sleep deprived? In the early age of scream queens, if Freddy had killed her, it's largely agreed that would have been a mercy killing. I had hoped with Jackie Earl Haley and all of his moon-bat weirdness there could be something new with Freddy, but no. The trivia about how it long took several hours originally to get him into his Freddy makeup and then how the process got faster is because it looks like they stopped trying to make it consistent at all. A full quarter of the scenes make it look like they simply pulled canvas over his head and scribbled on it. This was a remake of a horror film that lacked any remakes or re-imaginations of horror scenes. Perhaps this is for the ADD crowd or something, but when there were sequences that could have been suspenseful or frightening, they only lasted seconds.

256,TonyHurtado,It was OK,6,23 May 2010,"The thing is with remakes of movies they are never the greatest movie in the world but they do sometimes deserve an A for effort. Now some remake films are the absolute worst, like for example Halloween and Halloween 2 directed by Rob Zombie. Now the new Nightmare on Elm street was not terrible but it wasn't the best. All these professional critics are all idiots they only don't like these types of movies because these films aren't like classic films like Titanic or all other movie that are just stupid love movies. The original Nightmare on Elm Street also go the worst reviews but look at the success that the series has made. Now The new movie did have some opportunities that they should have taken but decided not to. There were some parts of the film that really expressed Freddy. Now the new Freddy I thought should have not been so animated, I mean sure it gives it more effect and all, but it still doesn't excuse the over-animation of Freddy. Jack Earlie Hayley does give a decent performance but again he is no Robert Englund. Robert Englund is Freddy nobody can top him at being Freddy. P.S. if you can't deal with and obnoxious crowd wait till the movie publicity dies down. The crowd was full of soon to be college students looking to poke fun at the film, one moment some one is screaming at a part that is not scary at the slightest or one person is yelling ""Taking it off"" so i suggest waiting till the publicity dies down to see this film. I was also surprised to see that the movie wasn't a total nude fest. In the remake of Friday the 13th there were some pretty hardcore sex scenes, but NEW LINE CINEMA decided that there shouldn't be any nudity in the movie, not one piece of this film involved sex, which I thought made this movie more better than the other horror remakes because the other remakes constantly use way to much nudity to the point where you just become bored watching the film. The movie also had more of a story to it then then the original, in the original Freddy killed people for no reason in this film there is a good reason why he is killing off all the teenagers.2 and 1/2 stars is what i would give this movie because of their descent attempt to make a new version of Nightmare on Elm Street.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I think the biggest problem a lot of people had with the new movie was it wasn't the old franchise. People get certain expectations in their heads when Hollywood comes out with a new movie based on a old franchise and when it doesn't meet those expectations, you better watch out, because no matter what you do, people won't agree with it.As soon as they announced the original actor for Kruger wasn't going to taking up his old role, people should have known this movie was going to take a hit. People were just not going to forgive the fact that Robert Englund was not going to be starring in the film. The original Nightmare on Elm Street movies never took themselves very seriously, they were campy, B-Horror quality films that people learned to love and enjoy. While Kruger was still a murdering horror icon, he was more of a joker, a prankster and a wise cracker then some sort of super villain.I think people also disliked the fact how much more villainous they actually made Kruger. A lot of people disliked the fact they made him a child molester. The reality of it is, even from the old franchise they were planning on making Kruger a child molester, but when a major court case involving an actual child molester began to take trial they didn't want people thinking their movie had anything to do with the actual person on trial and changed Kruger from a child molester to simply a murderer. The reality of it is, as on it's own, this is a good movie. It's unfortunate that there are such die hard fans that they can't even keep an open mind, I thought it was a fantastic movie and I am glad it was produced.

Watching them, I always hoped somebody would finally make them right. You know, with a budget, with great gore, with a screenplay that actually manages to add some suspense to the plot, not just depending on the sound effects. But then Friday and Nightmare turned out to be nothing more then the originals: the same killings, the same lines, the same showdown all over again. There's nothing new to it, so it's not quite a re-imagination, it's a recreating. So what's the point (beside making money)? I would have loved a decent remake. But watching this has no surplus in entertainment compared to the seven movies before. Sad to say: Freddy vs. Jason was the climax. At least it was very funny. Now it's getting boring again.

The most I got was uncomfortable. I think this had more to do with the sub par script writing and Mr. Haley's lack of physical menace than any lack of acting talent, and I'm not easily scared to begin with. I felt like the film moved a little too fast and while the graphics were messy, the gore could have used a little more of an organic feel.The ugly: Freddy's laugh felt practiced, the end (while somewhat an homage to the original) felt Goosebump-bookish, and the movie on a whole won't change anyone's mind about remakes being the Hollywood Antichrist.The verdict; 5/5.

A Nightmare on Elm St almost strikes the offensive chord,and the only thing that saves it from being a complete disaster is an impressive performance from Jackie Earle Haley.I will start off by saying that the original is my all time favorite horror film and it is very near and dear to my heart. This remake kills everything that I loved about the original and I think that might be why I hate it so much.The film is similar to the original in many ways and that is not where the problem lies.In fact the problem is that they change so much of the good things and replace them with every trope that we have seen a million times over.The performances are pretty weak and nothing really stands out as good,just OK. So all in all if you like a lot of the newer remakes you will probably like this one. If you are like me then stick with the original. 2/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
264,liveaholic,STOP making movies with the exact same name as the original,1,15 October 2020,"This ""trend"" has gone way, way too far. If you want to make a bad remake (or even worse, a reboot), please for the love of all that's holy, name it something else. Also, why exactly are we remaking classic horror films? If anything, the case can be made to remake BAD horror movies and turn them into something better...not the other way around.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
265,magic-tone,"Yet, another VERY disappointing attempt at a remake",3,29 April 2010,"When I began to watch this movie I unhappily knew that Robert Englund would not be taking the role of Freddy Krueger and that was the main disappointment for me. Freddy isn't Freddy. He's just a creepier guy (not in a good way), with no humour like the old Freddy, and looks like a zombie. This movie doesn't really suit the cast... The original movie had a young cast who would look pretty terrified by the stalkings of Krueger. In the remake it's spoilt brats who just get picked off one by one in their nightmares.Another issue is the beginning of the movie when we see Freddy die. You are not suppose to feel sympathy for him in that scene as I did with his innocent and afraid face. It's like Halloween (2007), we feel sorry for Michael Myers, we feel sorry for Jason (Friday the 13th(2009)) because he watched his mother get decapitated.Where did Freddy's jokes come in (Like in the original he said ""How's this for a wet-dream?"")? Where did his humour go? And how did he get that zombie-like face he has now? I know producers need to come up with scarier ideas but Freddy's humour in the original scared the hell out of me. But with his threatening comments in this movie I was just- ""Meh""And yet this just ANOTHER VERY disappointing attempt at a remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
266,Egg_MacGuffin,Hollywood strives for failure and succeeds.,1,30 April 2010,"I'll cut right to the chase and explain what is wrong with this movie instead of wasting your time setting anything up. I know how awful that feeling is, because it's exactly what this movie did for nearly 2 hours of my day - waste my time.SPOILERS Focused too much on the secondary characters at the beginning, which was a problem because it was excruciatingly obvious that they were all just Freddy Fodder. I actually wanted to see them die quicker instead of spending a half hour with the plastic Barbie chick that couldn't act to save her own life and the annoying kid that went to jail because someone did in the first movie.In the original, the group of four was together a lot of the time. They all shared the same plight together. The whole purpose of the sleepover was so that they could be there for each other if something bad happened. Here, we still have the same four roles, but two of them do their own thing and the other two are only communicating by phone, if they communicate at all. The inability for this new film to create a connection between the kids causes a disjointed feel and makes it impossible for us to care about anyone.In this one, that kid going to jail means nothing and his demise means nothing. Not to me or the actual heroes of the story: the curly haired dude with the dirty sanchez and the winner of the Emily Blunt look-alike contest. They never saw it happen, never grieved over it, never even seemed to give a hell. It almost seemed like something from a different movie. In the original, the kids went to the jail, watched it happen, and Nancy's father was a cop. They were much more involved and therefore, the death meant something. It wasn't just killing time like it is here.When we do get the actual heroes, it's so far into the movie, I couldn't help but wonder why not start the movie at that point? The other two dying did not have any effect on what the heroes were doing. The only constant was Freddy, who seemed much less threatening in this movie than in the original. Emily and Sanchez just kept doing what they would have if Barbie and the criminal didn't die at all.The micro-naps part was not necessary and added nothing to the movie. It was just an excuse to get Freddy into the film more. But when you show him for no reason other than to sit around and taunt the kids, perhaps slash at them once or twice, the fear goes away. The more I see, the less I'm afraid. Bringing Freddy into the picture when the kids are still awake completely defies the concept of the movie! There were several inexcusable moments of what can only be described as ""****ing ****ty writing"". The dude falling asleep in the pool and then witnessing what happened to Freddy years ago for absolutely no good reason was the worst. It was insulting and nothing more than a plot convenience. The girl sets the alarm on her phone to wake herself up in the bath, but never thinks of using it later on when she asks the dude to wake her when trying to bring Freddy into the real world. Why? This is life and death and you didn't think of a contingency plan when there was one that you already used sitting in your pocket? Another plot convenience. Then there's the kid with the adrenaline, which does absolutely nothing to him - an obvious plant for a later pay-off.This is a movie for idiots. Plain and simple. There's actually a scene in this movie where the girl pulls a piece of Freddy's sweater out of the dream world and into the real world, and the first thing she says is ""Freddy's sweater"". Really? Are you kidding me? What kind of sped wouldn't understand that scene if the dialogue was omitted? It's sad, because the original Nightmare is not a very great film. The concept is absolutely brilliant, but it could use an update. Even sadder than that is the fact that Hollywood's mission is not to make money by providing the public with a quality product. It's just to make money.There were some things about this film which I liked, but were mostly too brief or underdeveloped. The other kids in the school picture, the hospital sedation, etc. Just not enough to bring this turd out of the sewer where it belongs.It's better than the new Halloweens and Friday the 13th, but that is about as close to praise as a racial slur. It's kind of hard to screw up with such a brilliant concept. However, that didn't stop Hollywood from trying.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
267,depicco,Totally missed the point,4,28 August 2021,"Kinda like Dragon Ball, made as a cash grab because if it has Nightmare on Elm Street in the title people will go watch it, even if they are not aware why people liked the franchise in the first place. If this movie did not follow the franchise probably people would not think as bad of it, but probably would not be remembered either; kind of an average movie on its own.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
268,mcotto8,There can be only one FREDDY .........and this isn't it!!!!!!!,4,11 January 2011,"I was upset that i had to wait till this was available on DVD before i could watch it as i have seen every other nightmare movie at theaters. After i watched it, i was happy i didn't waste 9.50 to go see it. While this Freddy appeared more bloodthirsty at times, he just didn't scare me as Robert englunds version in the first nightmare. That Freddy's appearance gave me horrible nightmares for weeks. If this version was done back then he would not be so scary.All in all, I can only give this movie 4 out of 10. You just cant compare to the original!Also.......I can only hope that a sequel won't be made. It would be a total waste of money and time!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

270,KillerRomance,One of our Monsters of the modern Generation gets a new twist. Watch this and release the inner child,10,21 February 2017,"Being a child of the eighties, it was Jason, Chucky and Freddy being our Mummy, Frankenstein and Dracula, they were the ultimate entertainment culture icons. The Mummy and Chucky got a reinvention and returned to being fearful and the same treatment happened with this production with Freddy Krueger. I know the older generation want to dismiss this movie because now Jackie Earle Haley is picking up the razored glove, and Robert Englund was happy to pass on the role because it is good to experiment with a character to be taken to another light. If it was such a big deal that the role should be played by Robert then more contracts would be made that no Actors are allowed to play Freddy. The big difference is what the Actor would feel behind the latex mask. Robert Englund brought comedy to the role and has this Loki personality as a dangerous Child Killer, but along came the Series the New Nightmares and the horror is missing. Don't get me wrong, Robert is good, but Jackie Earle Haley was shocking like an animated corpse and countenance from Burned casualty Ward with vacant eyes, and has the concept that Wes Craven would want to portray Krueger was a Child Molester. Jackie was vile and perverted with his Victims and pulled it off well. The cast of the Teenagers were excellent, unlike the original who were fun loving and carefree with a habit of debauchery a bit annoyingly immature, the cast in this movie has expanded, the high school kids of Springwood that came across Freddy looked aged and troubled, you can tell they been through a lot with a secret past. The Script is well written, the special effects are a crescendo of cinematic dream-fest, welcome to trance world. This movie is so underrated and should be watched to be enjoyed otherwise it is a waste of time to judge a movie with expectations before seeing it. Forget the original for while and DO NOT expect anything that you normally want from this movie. Watch it without counterattack, you will see a master piece all over again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
271,gigadragon12,Nightmarishly Adequate,6,2 May 2010,"I went into this movie with the fuddled memory of watching the original Nightmare on Elm street when I was about 12, and so most of this review is based on what I barely remember and this movie on its own merits (of which there are little) Well we're back to the start, following the trend of recent years another horror staple has been remade and its about as successful (or not) as the other several that have been remade.Everyone knows the plot, if you grew up sometime before the year 2000 you've seen a Nightmare on Elm Street. Kids fall asleep, Freddy pops up, kills them in gory fashions with the unique knife glove, and someone pops him into real life so they can kill him.I honestly don't blame anyone if they walked out of this movie for the first 25 minutes of it, because they are terrible. These scenes are hilariously bad, and they're the only part of this movie that feels like they're really TRYING to remake the movie with a straight face. After the first unimportant bimbo is killed and we've nailed down the two main characters, the movie actually gets MUCH better.That's not to say it ever gets great, if you're here looking for scary well then you'll be treated to some good jumps, its not vintage horror, but it lets you live in nostalgia a little bit, and so long as they aren't trying to tack a story onto this pile of scare scenes then its actually alright.One thing, this movie is riddled with BAD plot twists and terrible inconsistencies and stupid lines such as, ""He was saying, 'You're not real' 'You're not real'. What do you think that means?"" Yeah... I was not happy at this point of the movie, but it was so bad it was actually funny.Despite adding an interesting mechanic to the already random dream sequences, this movie manages to make a staple seem like a flop. If you have to see it, wait until DVD hits the market, there's nothing you'll miss (except that money in your wallet) for waiting.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
272,bluedog-06340,Seriously disappointed,1,27 December 2015,"I switched the lights off and sat alone wanting to be scared but knowing deep down that I wouldn't be. The only truly terrifying thing about this film is that it was made at all. Reading some of the reviews on this movie confirmed what I thought of it but was horrified to learn that most went to see the movie at the theatre. I watched it on Sky 2015 but was so upset I registered with IDBM to write my first review. If you expect original, inventive death sequences with humour avoid this movie as it uses most f the sequences from the original and less successfully. I like Jackie Earl Haley but his make-up was probably to look more like a burns victim. It lacked the definition of the Robert Englund creation enabling Englund to talk with feeling to Haley's mumble. The dream sequences do not mix with reality as the film tells you when you are dreaming, taking away any suspense that might have been created. As usual in this type of of movie teen acting was awful. In the end I can only blame myself as I bothered to watch it and as with most remakes wanted my time. Sorry if anyone enjoyed this movie but this is a bad (not good) movie that shouldn't have been made.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
273,burbs82,"""Do you know the terror of he who falls asleep?"" - Well, you won't by watching this awful remake....",2,15 September 2010,"I'll make this short and sweet. One positive of this flick is Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Feddy Krueger. Although I never hoped nor expected that he would live up to Robert Englund's iconic dream-demon, he does a good job in both the current and flashback sequences.Another positive is the choice of song for the end credits.And that about sums up any redeeming qualities this ""re-imagining"" has. Topping the ""negatives"" list would be the rest of the cast, who are so bland and unlikeable that I felt a strong compulsion to get up and leave by the early funeral sequence, where our protagonists (such as they are) are speaking such unbelievably bad dialogue as to make Ed Wood look like William Shakespeare. Just another gang of Dawson's Creek clones(i.e., characters without character) that were so prominent in the post-'Scream' era, but seemed (thankfully) to have begun to disappear with some of Platinum Dunes other remakes of popular franchises like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Friday the 13th', and some of Rob Zombie's flicks. Please, please, please Dawson's Creek victims, GO AWAY.Also boding negative, as others have mentioned, an overuse of CGI. There's a famous scene lifted from the original with the form of Freddy emerging from a wall just as a character is drifting off to sleep. In the original, done with latex and clever lighting, it looks fantastic. In this ""updated"" and ""technically superior"" variation, it looks like a goddamn cartoon... Flashback to 'The Frighteners'. Of course, one could make the case that the scene in the original in which Nancy's mom is pulled through a small window looks ridiculous, but the CGI updating here, which COULD have looked pretty damn cool with some prosthetics and and a little CGI thrown in, still looks pretty lame because producers just can't seem to see the value in prosthetics and MODERATE use of CGI.Also, there's none of the exposition surrounding the mystery of dreams and the unconscious mind that the original utilized to such great advantage.In short, this movie is awful and should not be seen by anyone. None of the teens cast in this movie should ever act again, and/or whoever wrote their dialogue and character development should never write again. But, in Platinum Dunes' favor, two out of three ain't bad... it's just that you wrecked the best of the three series you've remade so far.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I have been waiting around the time by watching all of the old ones time after time after time. I have to say,even for a Micheal Bay film,it was pretty dark and not all the way sexual,except when they mentioned Freddy Kruger as a child molester,even though in the old ones,he's a child killer.That's the only thing I hated about this movie. Of course in the movie there was nothing to show that he was a molester;he was doing his normal Freddy stuff. So I have to say this wasn't a bad movie. But as far as favorites go, I have to say the 1984 is and always will be the number 1 best. With best to worse,number 1 is the best. 7,3,Freddy vs Jason,the remake,5,6,4,and 2 are from greatest to worst.

277,harry-austin,Immensely Disappointing.,3,25 June 2011,"The last time that the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' franchise was looked at was in the awful film 'Freddy vs Jason' that was released nearly ten years ago. Now, unfortunately for the world's cinema goers, they are about to be tormented by would could potentially be 4 or even 5 successive abysmal films.This re make cannot be compared in any way shape or form to the original 1984 Wes Craven classic. The main reason for this first and foremost is that this film lacks the devilishly good talents of Robert Englund, who acted the original Freddy Kruger. The actor who acted Kruger in the 2010 version was mockable. Not only did he not bring the character to life, but personally I don't think he was really up to the acting the role at all. Despite this, the make-up and cosmetics did not help Jackie Earle Haley (the actor of Kruger in the 2010). Rather than looking like a severely burnt man, he resembled some sort of bizarre cross between a man and an amphibian. Aside from Kruger, the actors and actresses of Nancy and her friends were biting off more than they could chew. The acting was mediocre at best. Some scenes lacked so much effort from the cast, I felt like falling asleep myself, and killing Kruger myself, thus ending the one and a half hours of boredom.And finally. What really lets this film down as a whole is how it has attempted to fit in with the other horrors of today's modern cinema. While Craven's original was darkly witty, and made the viewer laugh out in places, you could only help but cringe at this re-make. Not only did it follow the original plot, but it mirrored so many other awful films of today, one including the equally terrible re-make of 'Friday the 13th.'Come on Hollywood, leave our classics alone and come up with something new!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

There is no reason this movie should have ever been made. The original movies were half comedy half horror that drew you in because you liked Freddy and liked the teen victims. We don't care about anyone in this mess. This reboot is a bad attempt at trying to be a psychological thriller and teen scream and fails. Nothing new. Nothing exciting. Nothing scary. Just boring mumbling and dull characters.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
279,NeverAgain85,"Poorly Executed Remake, Flaws, and Characters you just don't seem to care about",2,28 May 2010,"I kinda knew that it was going to be garbage. The only thing I was curious about seeing was the new Freddy, and its safe to say he sucked. Maybe Im comparing this one to the original too much, but Robert Englund seemed more creepier. Jackie Earle was more of an imitator of Freddy, it just didn't work for me as a remake. I suppose he did his best I guess, but he did'nt seem to be ""Freddy"" and he was too mellow to be him.The main complaint Im going to make here though are the choice of characters, and oh man, but they be any more cliché? first off in the movie, the first 30 minutes or so are stuck on the blonde chick Chris who's having nightmares of Freddy, and dies in the same way as Tina in the original (the bedroom ceiling slaughter scene), I have to say this scene has got to be the worst remade scene in the whole movie, overacted and over-dramatic screaming and s**t-fits from this girl made everyone in the whole theater roar with laughter, I am not joking. It was garbage. The movie was focused on Chris so much I started to believe she was the lead character, then it seemed like they just threw Nancy in. Things didn't get much better when the writers had to think up of a clever concept for one of the emo characters Quentin to stay awake (Kyle Gallner, who wears the same beanie hat in all his movies,and has that weird look on his mouth), to start taking drugs from a pharmacy,and adrenaline syringes from hospitals, it got completely ridiculous. The unknown actress who plays Nancy is absolutely horrendous. We now see an Emo-Nancy, who works as a waitress, a very weak character who does nothing but make creepy drawings of Freddy...Why??? and cries and sobs, eventually leading her to becoming an adrenaline junkie like her emo friend which leads her in-between the real and dream world where Freddy can get to her. We hear the emo kid get all scientific why its happening from the adrenaline. Did you ever hear of coffee?!Its completely ridiculous.Shes nothing like the original Nancy, who was very strong, smart and cunning who we all knew and liked. After watching this, it really made me want to go watch the original, and I did. Made around 26 years ago, and it kicked this ones ass way off.People need to know that it takes intelligence to write a movie, not over the top cg for the nightmare scenes,in the original it was standard prop special effects. For a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street, this was weak as Hell, however I didn't expect much. Stop the remakes for Gods sake!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
280,rocky_lifter69,It is better to be original. This remake proves it.,3,26 April 2011,"I will start off by saying I am a huge fan of the original NOES franchise. The first film is a classic in the genre and holds up well despite being decades old. While the sequels diminished Freddy into a cackling jokester, he is still an iconic boogeyman. All of that is why this movie is so very disappointing.The story is fairly simple. A number of high school kids start dying under suspicious circumstances and the remaining ones begin to suspect something sinister at work. They realize that they have a shared nightmare of a burnt man with knives on his hand and struggle to uncover the truth while trying not to fall asleep. As more of them die, they discover that the burnt man is Fred Krueger, a gardener at their preschool who molested them all as children. When the parents found out that this was happening, they chased him into an abandoned building and set fire to it, vowing to never speak of him again. Now, he has returned for 'his' children.My absolute biggest complaint, beyond the one dimensional characters, overuse of jump scares and clunky dialogue, is that they completely changed Krueger. In the original movies, he was a child murderer, plain and simple. But they decided to turn him into a child molester for this remake. It not only completely changes the dynamic of the character but it adds a layer of sexual grime to the entire film that is unnecessary. In the original, he was a killer, so it made sense that he would want to kill the kids in their dreams. Changing that poses the question of WHY he suddenly wants to kill them, not to mention giving him way too many terrible innuendos.The cast of teens/fodder are all poorly drawn reheats of the usual clichés. Popular athlete, artistic female outsider, pretty blond, brooding guy with a dark side. They all say the lines and scream when they are supposed to but that is about it. As for poor Jackie Earle Haley, he does the best he can in playing a character beloved by millions of horror fans. The script hampers the character, who cannot decide if he is a terrifying boogeyman or perverted jokester. It is as though the writers could not decide if they should base this new Freddy on just the original movie or the sequels, so we get a little of both. And it just does not work. Also, the Freddy makeup is awful. He looks too much like a cat in my opinion, especially the early flashes of him.I will give the writers some credit, as the whole 'micro-naps' idea had a ton of potential. The problem is they use it more for jump scares than anything else. Plus it seems inconsistent with regular sleep. For example, when Nancy is pulled out of the car by Freddy during one of these micro-naps, she wakes up back inside of it, completely unscathed. She should have either been on the ground outside the car or scraped up from that. But I digress...Horror movie remakes are constantly churned out, usually for a quick buck. But some others actually attempt to re-imagine the material. I feel that this one falls somewhere in the middle. It falls victim to many modern day horror trappings, which adds a feeling of lazy cash in. While I respect them doing something as risky as altering an iconic horror figure, they simply did it the wrong way. Overall, the movie is nothing impressive, although it is better than some remakes I have seen. A few interesting visuals involving the dream world scattered among an otherwise boring and almost dirty feeling film. I would say stick to the original if you really want a movie that will disrupt your sleep patterns.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
281,tacmovies,"Very Good, Possibly Better Than Craven's.",8,30 April 2010,"Plot: The plot is nearly identical to the classic Nightmare, with a few slight differences on Krueger's origin. That having been said, one of my major gripes with the first one was the ending. Nancy's plan was to simply stop giving Freddy power by not continuing to think about him. This might have worked in a book, but not on the big screen, especially when the last second scare at the end of the that movie completely contradicted it. The ending of this movie worked much better, probably because they now have a better idea of where they want to go with the series.That said, the plot is far from perfect. As I see it, the plot moved too fast. The original Nightmare gave us an unexpected, unexplainable scare and then waited a good long time to really try and scare us again. In that time we got to latch onto the characters and get to know them. This movie seems to think the audience will get bored if they don't keep having scares every five minutes or so. B Characters: As expressed in the plot department, this is a major weakness in this movie. We don't spend very long with any of the major characters before they are dispatched. As a result, I can't tell you anything about most of the people in this movie. We don't even get to spend long with Nancy, the survivor girl from the original, as we spend most of the movie over the shoulder of two other characters until they are dispatched.That said, Jackie Earl Haley's Freddy is terrifying. I don't know if I'm ready to say that he's better than Robert Englund, but he's definitely the best part of this movie and is worth the price of admission on his own, both as dream demon Freddy and the living Freddy.Lastly, special mention goes out to Clancy Brown. Good to see you in a movie again, Kurgan. Does anyone else remember the fact that he used the pseudonym of ""Krueger"" when he checked into the hotel in the original Highlander movie? It's hard to assign a letter grade to this category, as I want to give an A to Jackie Earl Haley and an F to the rest of the characters, so we'll compromise at a C.Visuals: People who don't like CG are going to disagree with me, but I thought this movie looked amazing. One of my big complaints with the Nightmare franchise is that I never felt that it reached a boiling point, in that Freddy, being a dream demon, never really created a dream world that was all that more terrifying than the real world. The best dream world in the old continuity can probably be found in Freddy vs. Jason or Wes Craven's New Nightmare. This movie's dream world is a bit more dreamlike. The ground turns to liquid, mazes grow out of the ground from nowhere, the laws of physics be damned, and Krueger seems able to do anything his imagination can think of. Granted, it's almost all CG, and practical purists will no doubt cry that it looks fake. To me, this is a choice. You either decide to ride with this movie or you decide to reject it, but the choice is yours. A Audio: There were enough points where I found myself fighting the urge to cover my ears when I expected to next scare to appear on screen, so I can't think of a better compliment than that. The score is creepy, the original Nightmare theme is reworked effectively, and the Everly Brothers' song ""All I Have to do is Dream"" makes a very appropriate feeling appearance. B Overall: This is a very good movie. Is it better than the original? I really can't say right now, as I need to re-watch the original first, but from what I remember I think it gives the first one a run for its money. It does some things worse, but it also fixes some problems that I had with the original. Overall, I give it a B.Tacmovies: We're not failed film students who bitterly criticize successful movies... really... sniffle... so, um... yeah, ahem: Follow our reviews on blogspot, flixter, IMDb, yahoo movies, and youtube.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
282,bora_mustafa,Tries to do something different but ultimately disappointing!!,3,8 October 2015,"With all the recent remakes (Halloween, Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) making their presence it was only a matter of time before we got the remake for A Nightmare on Elm Street. So does this new Nightmare deliver anything new or some awesome dream sequences, sadly, no.Before I get into the review, I must state that I was deeply gutted when I heard Robert Englund was not returning as Freddy Krueger and that the film was not Wes Craven's work. On a positive note though I was happy that Jackie Earle Haley would be the new Freddy Krueger as Haley was brilliant as Rorschach in the otherwise abysmal Watchmen movie.A selected group of teens are each having the same dreams about a horribly burnt disfigured man in a fedora hat with a red and green sweater and a glove with knives for fingers on his right hand. The man in question is of course Freddy Krueger and slowly each teen is getting killed off in their dreams and it's up to the remaining survivors Nancy (Rooney Mara) and Quintin (Kyle Gallner) to try and find a way to destroy him before it's too late.OK, that's not exactly anything new, as this is a remake and if you've seen the 1984 original, then you should know what the plot involves. However on its own merits this is a very shoddy remake with poor CGI (the wall scene in particular is very bad) and non-stop jump scares, seriously one in like every five minutes. Not helping any of this is the extremely bland Rooney Mara as Nancy, whereas Heather Langenkamp's Nancy was such a strong willed character in the original, this Nancy spends most of the film with the same cold expression and in all honesty you really don't care if her character lives or dies. Kyle Gallner fares better as Quintin and does his best. Katie Cassidy as Kris is actually a stronger character and I do wish she portrayed Nancy rather than Mara but oh well.Now for the main character himself, Freddy Krueger, Jackie Earle Haley really brings the creep factor and does his best to be as sadistic as possible which is exactly how Krueger is supposed to be portrayed. Watching him reminded me of Englund's Krueger from the first two films of the original series however what really lets Haley's Krueger down is the poor CGI and makeup, it takes away the creepy factor and while this is meant to portray a more realistic burned face it ends up looking weird and robs Haley of any expression whatsoever. Robert Englund's original ""pizza face"" makeup is far superior and creepier.What this remake also tries to do but fails miserably is the short back story of Freddy Krueger, in this version he was a caretaker at a preschool who molested children and the parents track him down and burn him to death. Sounds similar enough but they forget to mention about the glove and the boiler room where he lived. In short there's a lot of things wrong with the remake, the kills are uninspired, the dream sequences are boring, some directly copied from the original but with less effect, the same one liners but very contrived, it's basically a bad remake altogether.Before I wrap this review up, there's one thing I want to clarify, some reviewers have stated that they were not happy with Freddy Krueger portrayed as a paedophile (understandably so) instead of a child murderer. Let's go back to the 1984 original, Nancy's mother specifically says that ""Fred Krueger was a filthy child murderer, the key word there: ""Filthy"" another word for dirty which means that apart from killing children he was also molesting them, so there is nothing different between the two versions, Freddy Krueger has always been a child murderer and molester.Of course the idea of that is that you're supposed to absolutely hate the character and want him killed, yet this remake almost brings the conclusion that he might have been innocent!!! A big NO. The last thing you want to do with a horror icon is to make them sympathetic, much like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake.At the end of the day if you're a fan of the franchise, chances are you've already seen this but for those who haven't, I recommend the 1984 original and Parts 2 and 7 if you want the scary Freddy, but if you prefer the campier one liner Freddy, watch Parts 3-6 and if you must, watch this last!.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
283,jacqulinesnider,This was painful for me....,4,21 April 2019,"I'm a HUGE Nightmare on Elm Street fan. I do have the 8 movie boxset. I saw a lot of the 1st few in the theater. One we had 3D glasses for the movie at the theater. Anyways so my son and I rented this one because I'm a fan. He mentioned it. I said let's rent it and watch it. Because although the new IT is amazing, it doesn't compare to the original but was still in it's own way really good. And I'm a huge Rob Zombie ""movie"" fan so yes I liked his Halloween versions. But this version of Nightmare on Elm Street was too hard because not a single person could ever be Freddy Krueger except Robert Englund. That I think was the reason I struggled honestly with this one. It's not horrible. The horror was good it's just not comical scary. Idk I think really it is the Freddy Krueger. But not a terrible version if one can except the new Freddy Krueger.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
284,kobrakommand,Not even worth watching,2,1 September 2010,"This movie fails First off, Why is Nancy a played by a deaf girl? I'm not the only one who noticed that right? Second the movie just sucked Moving on THIRDLY, what you can hope for a remake is for it to be more realistic, and you say realistic what are you talking about? Well I'm talking about, the original was realistic back when it was made, but over the years it became corny, but the original is still a great movie, great ideas and characters, and i mean how she gets rid of him at the end, just awesome. Another thing you want to see in a remake is characters that are redefined, and more deep. You won't find that here. They were headed in the right direction with Freddy, but they came up short. There was so much they could have put into that character, but they just didn't, and it totally ruins the movie.Among that, there is one good little mystery in the movie, that is quite entertaining... that's it.Some scenes were redone from the original, but they left out my favorite one, Where Nancy's mother takes her down to the basement, opens up the wood stove and pulls out Freddy's glove and says ""He can't hurt you baby, because mommy killed him."" That was a great scene, and they just totally left it out. Disappointing In fact the whole movie is disappointing Just as disappointing as the Friday the 13th remake, and don't get me started on that",A Nightmare on Elm Street
285,ryanb-38348,Better than original,6,16 June 2019,I found this film better than the original because its newer its more up to date with horrors of our time and you dont see stupid scenes with blood splurtting out of a bed which quite frankly looked stupid in the original film when it happened. This film does give the same feeling as the first film just in my eyes looks graphically better plus on blu ray is better than an 1980 version. You actually get to understand what happened in the film and shows u a side of freddy you didnt see in the 1st movie. I would suggest watching this one b4 the original so u can see how similar they are but how much better the detail is in this film.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
286,Michael-d-duncan,Worth about a Dollar,6,29 June 2010,"I'll put the bottom line at the top, If you're a fan of the franchise, don't miss it, but don't pay more than a dollar at Redbox for it.I went to see it at the dollar theatre, (which cost 2 bucks now), and I really felt I would have enjoyed it more at home. Just to clear the air, this movie isn't all that true to the original. The characters are shallow and since it sticks to the blonde for so long, you feel more for her than you do for Nancy who is now an artsy, emo, recluse. They've done away with the boiler room in favor of a school. They ditched the boyfriend for a love struck drug addict loser.The real problem, however, is that the old one didn't need to be remade. Instead the franchise needed to be reclaimed. Freddy has consistently become more of a lovable goof-ball in every film. It was good to see Jackie play not a fun loving killer but a demented child rapist with a vengeful hatred. This is probably the best thing the film offers, a menace and villain not a prankster with knives and a mask.Bottom line. It's not terrible, you'll get a little bored. Freddy is a menace again, don't spend more than a buck or two.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
287,EricVierthaler92,Thumbs down,3,6 December 2010,"When I saw that one of the writers from Cape Fear (1990) was going to write this I actually had high hopes for this remake/reboot. I saw this opening day and had high expectations but sadly I was very disappointed. This movie comes no where even close to being as great and as frightening as the 1984 original movie. One major problem with this movie is the boring characters. The characters in this movie really had no personalities and honestly you could care less about them. Nancy in this movie is just boring and hollow. Kyle Gallner in this movie looked like he was about to just ball his eyes out in every single scene he was in throughout the hole movie. Jackie Earle Haley was a good choice for Freddy but the makeup for Freddy Kruger in this remake/reboot was just flat out awful. Not even scary. Freddy looked more like a zombie crossed with a Avatar. So as you have guessed from my words Jackie Earle Haley doesn't even come a single inch close to the great iconic Robert Englund's performance as Freddy. Robert was just a much more terrifying Freddy mainly due to the facial expressions he made and his voice. A mistake they made was in the original movie Freddy was a child murderer and didn't really show you the back-story of him, but in the remake/reboot they turned him into a child molester and they show you the back-story. Freddy being a child murderer is far more terrifying then him being a child molester though child molester's are scary but just plain weird. Him being a child murder just works much better and plus guessing how Freddy got burnt to death is much more affective and you guessed it much scarier. Another mistake about this movie was that they got a music video director who never directed a real movie before. No offense to Samuel Bayer but he didn't know what he was doing with this movie. Though I give Samuel Bayer credit for not making the movie seem just like a music video like how Rob Zombie did with House of 1,000 Corpses (2003) and Halloween II (2009). But although he didn't execute the story well. He doesn't know how to scare the audience. The only scares throughout the hole movie was just jump scares and nothing else. The original movie relied on the character Freddy and situations to scare you but this one only relies on jump scares which is very lazy film making. The ending was predictable and the special effects are not that impressive and neither is this movie. In the words of Siskel and Ebert I give the A Nightmare On Elm Street remake/reboot a thumbs down.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
288,nrbarton,About as bad as you'd expect from a Platinum Dunes remake,3,4 May 2010,"In the original A Nightmare on Elm Street Freddy was his most dark, most filthy, most sickening. He staggered around with an insane glint in his eyes, cackling like a mad man. Yet there was humour there and a strong character which struck a chord with audiences. Unfortunately the sequels gradually changed Wes Craven's monster into more of a campy joker and by the time the aptly titled 'Freddy's Dead' came along Freddy wasn't scary in the slightest. So a remake of the original bringing the darker Freddy back might have been a good thing if it was in different hands. Michael Bay's production company Platinum Dunes seem to be on a mission to remake every classic horror film, which might not be so bad if the results didn't range from average to terrible; the recent Friday 13th remake landing firmly in the latter.So Elm Street fans were worried and had every reason to be judging on Platinum Dunes track record. Furthermore, the movie is directed by Samuel Bayer who has never directed a movie before only music videos for bands like Nirvana. I don't place all the blame on Bayer. Everything about Platinum Dunes remakes are the same. The bigger problem is Michael Bay. So we get high school kids who look like 30 year old fashion models with no real individuality as they all dress the same like a Gap advert. So these remakes are badly cast, and, even though he isn't responsible for writing them, lack character development. The two scriptwriters chosen don't have a particularly impressive track record either.One problem a lot of fans have is that Freddy Krueger isn't played by Robert Englund but by Jackie Earle Haley (who did a brilliant Rorschach in Watchmen). At first I wasn't going to Blame Platinum Dunes as they claimed Robert Englund wasn't interested. The truth is he wasn't asked. Even though Freddy Krueger became a parody of himself eventually that wasn't really Robert's fault and in New Nightmare he did prove he could still do a dark Freddy. To put it mildly replacing Robert Englund was not going to be an easy task but I was open minded to the idea of choosing another actor.Unfortunately, in practise Jackie Earle Haley just doesn't make a good Freddy at all. He's too short and too skinny but more important than that is that the character is very different and the make up just doesn't look iconic. They went for the realistic look of a burns victim but unfortunately that robs him of expression. They went for a really creepy pervy Freddy and that is the biggest problem because when he's teasing Nancy towards the end it isn't scary but you just think, 'Urrgh shut up you creepy perv!' The scriptwriters fail almost entirely at bringing a comical aspect to the Krueger character. He doesn't do anything funny but does say one genuinely funny line in the movie. They have robbed Freddy Krueger of his iconic status because nobody would want a t-shirt or a poster of the new Freddy Krueger as he's just really unappealing, mostly because they've upped the perv factor to 11. I appreciate that they tried to bring back a darker Freddy but the scares are never genuinely scary just those annoying jump scares that you get in a lot of modern horror. You know they make you jump with a loud noise to try and trick you into thinking what you've seen was scary when it wasn't. It gets old and this movie is full of them.Remember Charles Bernstein's classic score for the original? I certainly do. It's one of the greatest movie scores of all time. Did the remake have such a memorable score? No the only thing I remember about the score is about four seconds of the Charles Bernstein score when the title screen appeared.Wes Craven wasn't consulted about this remake and isn't happy and that was another off-putting thing for fans. Wes Craven's track record with the Elm Street movies is good.Whilst watching it I felt like I was watching a remake rather than an actual movie, and by that I mean you can just see in the actors' faces that they're doing it for the paycheck and a couple of parts of dialogue similar to the original are cringe worthy.The strongest part of the original is Tina's whole dream sequence which results in her death with her shirt being ripped open, torso slashed and her being dragged around the bedroom walls and ceiling screaming leaving a bloody gory mess. The same thing happens to another character in the remake in a much shorter and less impressive dream sequence which just pales in comparison, the girl being bounced around with no blood and then being slashed afterwards. Most of the best parts of the movie where I actually started to feel excited are scenes from the original executed a lot less well. The only scene which is perhaps done better in the remake is the final end scare which I thought was effective but too little and too late.The original was a classic and the remake is typical MTV style Platinum Dunes fodder. If you're not a big fan of the original and you don't hate Platinum Dunes then it's a reasonable way to waste an hour and a half. It is better than the Friday 13th remake. If you care about the original and the old Freddy Krueger then you may consider it something of a travesty. The idea of sequels to this movie really bothers me so I urge people not to pay to see it. It has just left me wanting Wes Craven to come along and re-re-make A Nightmare On Elm Street properly.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
289,jhunt709,Does fictional America have any teenagers left for slaying?,6,20 May 2010,"As a newcomer to the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' series, my mind was open as to what I could expect from a remake of the 1984 original; I wouldn't be in a position to make comparisons between the movies or the past and present incarnations of Freddy, although I did enjoy this realisation of the dream killer, which I attribute to disturbing make-up and equally disturbing dialogue. Some viewers were displeased that some of his lines were borrowed from past portrayals of the character, something I can accept when a new instalment of a long-running franchise has the opportunity to condense the great, memorable elements of its predecessors into one feature. The 2010 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' owes so much to its own past that any homages aren't unwelcome, particularly to new viewers such as myself. While its success at emulating the original is not for me to discuss, its success as a horror film is, and in that aspect the remake fails.The concept of the characters dying in their sleep and therefore dying in reality is utilised well, with many of the dream sequences featuring abstract imagery that compliments events in a creative, eerie manner. It is, however, a shame that these scenes become something of a crutch too much too soon, and the terrified teenagers are shown falling to sleep, again and again, letting us know when the characters are safe and negating the atmosphere in doing so. Towards the climax the boundary between reality and the nightmares becomes much less distinct, encouraging the audience to remain engaged with the film and adding a welcome element of the surreal to proceedings. Fans of jump scares will be satisfied, although there are so many of them that they quickly lose their impact; had they been used sparingly they would have deserved a degree of appreciation as a small number were effective. Another issue is how the characters are so isolated in their predicament. While I appreciate that it may have been Freddy's intention to craft his kills to appear as suicide or murder, it seemed more like an act of convenience on the part of the writers to spare them tackling a scene in which minor players (such as the police or even the parents) truly explored the incidents surrounding these youngsters, which would have provided as much interesting conflict as it would sense. When the sleep deprived Nancy decides to takes a routine bath, I almost gave up hope on seeing anybody express their despair with the situation, or the frustration that they seemingly had nobody to confide in besides each other.Despite hints of creativity, for example the use of a false protagonist (another device I am hesitant to praise for fear it was included in the original), 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is simply for casual horror fans who want nothing more from the genre than an occasional loud noise and some gruesome special effects while chomping on their popcorn. Anyone else may be sorely disappointed.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

This movie is the remake of the original made by Wes Craven. Many bragged about how good and scary it would be. But, don't let that make you think it is. I saw this movie twice. One time in the theater, and the next time in DVD. I thought this movie was pretty scary and good once in theater, but I just wanted to see it again before reviewing it. I have to say that this is one of those films you don't want to rent if you saw it before. The deaths, well they are more graphic that the original ones, but they are not as fun to watch. Also you really don't care for the characters as much as before. Next, Freddy. He is the main antagonist of the film, yet in this remake, he loses so much of his character. Freddy is supposed to be the jerk, funny, mean killer. Unfortunately, he is just mean and not a total jerk. I would also say that this film did not deserve the R-rating. The movie did show tons of blood, but there was minimal cursing, no drugs nor sex, and there are worse PG13 movies than this one. Overall, the movie was just fine, but it is far from the original.

291,LightDarkness14,"A good remake, but it's lacking something",8,16 November 2011,"Remakes have become commonplace in the last few years and unsurprisingly the genre that gets the remake treatment the most is horror.

295,MikeRydal,"Brave attempt, but why re-invent the wheel",6,7 November 2010,"BACKGROUND Being a life long ""Freddy"" fan, hearing of the release of a new line of Nightmare movies, i was overjoyed. The one thing that really stood out would be the loss of Robert Englund, could we, the fans, accept a new Freddy Krueger? Upon hearing Jackie Earle Haley was to don the glove, i was kinda curious. After seeing his performance as Rorchach in Watchmen, he nearly stole the movie. Casting him as Freddy, in my opinion was a good call, even though he had some hard work to do to compare to Englunds' Freddy.THE CHARACTERS The film wastes no time in getting going, a great introduction scene. It introduces the all the main characters well. Upon Seeing Freddy for the first time (as his face has been covered by a hat or silhouette for most of the promotional run) i was both pleased and disappointed to find the makeup was fantastic and did look authentic, but it wasn't quite the Freddy you were hoping for. Overall the script made Freddy too dark, and cut out his humour. I also found it inappropriate that the film focuses far too much on Freddy being a paedophile, it spoiled the enjoyment factor and all in all gave an uncomfortable feel.This cannot be blamed on Earle Haley, his job is to follow the script, and his portrayal of this new Freddy was very good. A dark, loathsome character. Being a hardcore Freddy fan, i missed the dropped shoulder and James Cagney swagger that Robert Englund had brought to the character.The rest of the cast were very typical of this genre, no-one really stood out, even Rooney Mara as Nancy. This was effectively the main role in the film and she could of quite easily blended into the background with the co-stars.THE MOVIE Overall this is a dark movie, lacking the dark humour we have come to expect from this genre. Its a shame really that they concentrated too much on the story and Freddys' paedohpillic past. As a fan, i wanted big scares, bizarre deaths, dark humour, sexy girls, blood guts and gore. Instead there are mediocre scares and a couple of semi-hot girls.WARNING : HERE BE SPOILERS It would be wrong of me to slate this movie completely, it did have some nice touches to it. The subplot about ""Micro-Naps"" had a great effect to flow of the film. I also enjoyed seeing some of the famous scenes re-created (like the bathtub scene.) SUMMARY Its quite clear that the movie set out to entice a new generation of Freddy fans, but its kind of a swing and a miss. If they had cut out the paedophillic back story and replaced it with a few more gore scenes and dark humour, it would of scored a solid 7.5.Rydal",A Nightmare on Elm Street
296,jjf662001,A retelling of the original nightmare,1,5 February 2011,"New Night mare on Elm Street (DVD)I have to admit when I first hear d they were making a remake of horror classic a night mare on elm street I was interested, a new Freddy Kruger I was scratching my chin HM. I never got around seeing it in the theaters. I'm glad I never went. It doesn't really match up with the original at all.It started out very slow the kids spent most of the movie trying to figure out who this creepy guy was haunting them in their dreams and knocking them off one at a time.Their parents discovered Freddy Kruger (Jackie Earle Haley) was molesting their kids at their preschool and took matters into their own hands. They chased him down to an abandon building and torched it with him in it, and here we have Freddy. It took the kids half the movie to figure out what was going on. Their parents were trying to hide what they did to avoid the kids having to deal with what happen to them if they went to court.There was no really outstanding scenes to speak of it was like they just copied most of the scenes from the original night mare movies. The cgi they put into it didn't make a difference at all to the movie and it plot. I personally enjoyed my soul to take a lot more. I Have to give them credit for at least trying to explain how Freddy became Freddy. I guess I'm spoiled with Robert England as ever ones favorite nightmare.

297,haxleyandrew,"Who would make this film, It's beyond horrible",1,5 February 2012,"I don't know why someone would take something good and ruin it. But i know that when this movie came out it was just beyond horrible. Nobody enjoyed it and walked out.Now again the directors manage to take the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise once again and ruin it with a new remake just when it could not get any worse then that. Still being that. The film is worse and because it has a new actor Jackie Earle Haley. I mean c'mon we could have got Robert England instead. But no he plays as the new Freddy Krueger in this film who kills people talk about being horrible.Jessie and his other friends are being stalked by the man who kills them in their sleep and in reality it turns out to be real. When each of them are killed. They must do something to prevent this new menace from killing them as well. So they set up a plan that whoever stays awake the most will not be killed in their dreams. But whoever does not stay awake will be killed by the madman. Now it's up to Jessie's other friends to stop him.Not only is this movie horrible. It just fails to scare anybody in any way possible. It's pathetic how Robert England is replaced with Jackie Earle Haley which makes him the worst actor ever. And even though that he slashes his victims with his razor claws and speaking of dreams. I don't know how this Freddy Krueger even was in this movie. His voice was just sounding so childish and lame that nobody would even like it. Now he acts as if nothing happened. And even though Jackie Earle Haley is in this film. He failed so bad that his talent and performance may be long gone and that he may never act again.Although this film is intended for adults. It is definitely not aimed towards kids because of the strong language and violent content. That means that Freddy Krueger kills his victims without warning and he also kills them in violent ways. And talk about that he just kills his victims and does not react in the situation at all.The script is poorly written as if it was written by someone else. It does not mean anything nor does it even do anything at all. Samuel Bayer could have made the script stand out and be understandable for everyone to read. But while that's not surprising he is not the best director and is the worst i have ever heard of. He also could have brought the original Freddy we all know and love back from the original films and put him into this. Otherwise the script and this film takes time out of the film all together with it being so lame that you won't be able to watch it.Although speaking of which. Samuel Bayer ruined the series of a Nightmare On Elm Street films by taking such a good film and giving it an actor that is not important nor does he act good. He is plain horrible and it does not make the film by any means better.I'm sorry to say why he took such a good film and ruined the franchise. But he should have never done it, I mean every character's performance and talent as you could say was worse then ever. And because of the fact that some scenes were too cheesy to be even scary. Besides this film should not have been made and as a remake it can only get worse.So i advise you, Please do not see this movie and save your money, This movie just points out that it's not a great film after all. Also please do not see this in the theater you will be disappointed.Plus the dreams in this film were not scary and just pointless to watch. This is nothing like the original Nightmare On Elm Street franchise with Robert England as Freddy Krueger and besides this film totally ruins the franchise. Sure it's dark and really violent but if you are gonna watch a better film. Then totally see the original Nightmare On Elm Street franchise, This film just proves that it's both lame and dumb. And that Jackie Earle Haley's makeup here was applied by some makeup artists who don't know how scary he was for sure. This new Freddy Kruger also talks like in a raspy voice like Batman from The Dark Knight. I guarantee that even the slightest Freddy fans will be disappointed with this lame remake that has got nothing to do with Robert England. I don't even know what they were thinking when they cast a new actor to play the role of Freddy Krueger. Either way this movie does not set a good tone and neither does this film manage to please.Plus the scene where both girls sing the song 1. 2. Freddy's coming for you with the jumprope is terrible and completely ruined by this new Freddy. Of course why would someone have to admit how bad Jackie Earle Haley did in this film. It's not like they can take a good movie and add the worst part that is Freddy of course.But mostly it's something that has to do with Freddy's voice here and his lame jokes. Of course Nightmare On Elm Street fans will be disappointed that this Freddy Krueger does not make any jokes nor is he trying to impress or be funny to people. But also completely because his voice sounds like he has a sore throat and also sounds raspy just like Batman's voice does. But that's mostly having to do with because it's annoying to listen to and will annoy you forever. Robert England's Freddy Kruger's voice did not sound like this at all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
298,arlum_meow,good movie if you haven't seen the original,5,29 July 2012,nightmare on elm street 2010 isn't as bad as people make it out to be i mean it really wasn't the best horror movie far from it. but it delivers a lot of scars. nightmare on elm street was a good movie to watch up to 42 mins i mean when Katie cassidy character was killed of (WAY TO EARLY ON IN THE FILM) the movie just starts to go slowly but down hill. we didn't see Nancy have her own scene till there was only her and a unknown actor left and for a person who hast seen the original really annoyed me. but i promise you will enjoy the first 50 mins of the film because it has so many jump scares that my heart was actually hoping that the characters got away in time.also nightmare on elm street 2010 was not predictable at all i couldn't see what was coming it was full of suspense and big surprises.but i could under stand for people who are a big fan of the original wouldn't like the new one because of the new Freddy and to be having to get used to all the new changes.nightmare on elm street 2010 was a fun and decent movie for horror fans it depends on your SALT of taste to be honest u either like it or you don't.overall nightmare on el street 2010 deserves a 5/10 because in my opinion Katie cassidy was the best actor in the movie out of the teens Freddy was killing so she shouldn't of been killed in the first 30 mins.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
299,crazyburn87,To the point,1,9 May 2015,"The movie is a waste of time.I have to write ten lines to get my voice out, so let's try that. First off, I'm a big fan of the old series, Robert Englund gave Freddy Kruger a personality containing black humor, which together with the practical effects where a brilliant mix, that still to this day are fascinating, and creepy.This new one... where bland. I didn't care for the protagonists OR Freddy. I loved Jackie Earle Haley in Watchmen and Dark Shadows, but he does not make a good Freddy Kruger, He feels too aggressive like he's angry about being dead, where in the old one he, hated it, but loves the fact that he became even more powerful.If you read all this instead of stopping after the first line, and haven't seen the movie yet, then let me give you a tip. See the one from 1984 first (It has Johnny Depp in it), it might not be scary for you, but enjoy the practical effects, enjoy Englunds version of Freddy Kruger and be mind blown with the creativity of the murders. When you have all that cleared, and are curious about the 2010 remake. Then, watch it, but you have been warned.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
300,scottiejarrett7,Additional flaws,2,25 November 2014,"If I'd never seen Wes Craven's wonderfully original and scary film, this offering would have been barely passable. Compared to the first (and best!) Nightmare, the remake is an utter failure. Other reviewers have nailed many of its flaws. Nobody has mentioned the lack of the creepy musical theme that so effectively built tension in the original. The remake seemed determined not to use it. It sounded just once in the opening sequence. That's the music that says ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" It was missing with nothing to replace it. Likewise, the children's jump rope chant (so innocent at first, until its implications become clear) was clumsily used in this reboot. It was never even said in its entirety. This remake lacked the classic elements that defined the Nightmare. Very disappointing!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
301,philipbyrner,Not as good as the original,3,29 May 2010,"Not as good as the original but what films are. As a matter of fact i don't think any remakes have ever been better than the original, am i wrong? If i never saw the original i would have given this a better score. It loses points on A. not being as scary as the 1st. B. Acting is even less believable than the 1st. C. Robert Englund was so much better as Freddie. D. The special effects haven't even got much better than the 1st in all those years. I'd say i could think of more if i tried. Anyway it wasn't a bad film I'm just comparing it to a very good horror flick which i saw at a young age which made me have nightmares for about 6 weeks after. It is definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen the originals. Then go and see the originals after.

302,willnye-74430,"This is easily the worst movie to have the name ""Nightmare on Elm Street""",1,19 July 2018,"I hate this movie, this is a good idea that wound up being horribly executed. Having Jackie Earle Haley play Freddy Krueger was a great idea but in this movie he wasn't trying in the slightest literally if you look at his face while Freddy is on camera he's just kind of staring off into space without even showing emotion at all. They changed Freddy's backstory so that he was a pedophile who worked and slept in the basement of a kindergarten, Only one of the characters had the same name as Nancy but she had a different last name. They recycled a couple of jokes but none of them were as good as when Robert Englund did them, the CGI in this movie made the special effects in the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" look state of the art by comparison, but the absolute worst thing about this movie is that the only horror in this movie is a bunch of jumpscares and it's so obvious when they're about to happen that they won't even startle you",A Nightmare on Elm Street
303,stevesutton-74951,Cashing in on a Tired brand,3,18 April 2021,"This was one of those additions to the Netflix, which was 'one to watch before it gets deleted.' I mistakenly thought that this was the 1984 version, but regrettably it was the 2010 remake.One wonders why on earth this movie was made. Cynically, one can view it as an attempt by the studios to wrench even more dollars from a brand that has gone way past its sell by date.The original 1984 movie was a classic, and although the effects may seem dated by today's standards it was at the time quite an horrific movie. This 2010 version offers nothing in the way of horror, nothing in the way of developing the storyline, and nothing in the way of showcasing it's actors.Like much of the Netflix stock, it is a so-so movie. You would be forgiven for falling asleep for much of this movie: it's attention grabbing span is minimal as we end up with 90 minutes of tedium. It is not a movie that you're likely to boast to friends about watching. Thank heaven the cinemas are opening up again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
304,LaserPoint,My version on this 2010 remake,7,30 May 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street directed by Samuel Bayer is a remake of the 1984 horror classic of the same name. Instead of Tina, Rod and Glen we have Quentin, Kris, Jesse and Dean. The only ""same"" the remake shares with the original is of course Nancy, who once again is the lead character in the story. Freddy played by Jackie Earle Haley, had big shoes to fell considering Robert Englund had help established Freddy Kruger as one of the most iconic horror monster villains in all of movie history with a staggering 8 films under his belt, a couple of TV shows and multiple commercials over almost a 20 year period span. So how does this remake live up to Wes Craven's masterpiece? read on and you'll hopefully find out..Let's start with the acting. I through most of the cast were reassembly impressive with the acceptation of a couple of moments when some of the dialog just felt forced and Cliché. Excluding JEH; Rooney Mara & Kyle Gallner were properly the best of the teenagers, mainly due to the fact that it felt really natural whenever they would approach a certain task or situation for good or for worse. Perhaps it helped given that they both received the same amount of screen time, but above all, neither character overreacted or didn't react enough which is pleasing from a audiences prospective since the blend worked just right.The dream sequences were beautifully shot which could be seen as a problem to some given that the dark, gritty and grainy atmosphere of the original was almost non-existent through these lenses. Personally I didn't have a massive issue with it, although having said that, they seemed to heavily rely on ""jump scares"" to get to the audience which I found to be cheap and quite annoying after a while. I mean it's OK to have a few jump scenes every now and then (the original NOES had a couple); but when a horror picture constantly features them at every turn that builds up even the slightest bit of tension, it just becomes predicable and above all, boring. Sometimes these scare tactics even kills the scene all together which is a shame since there were many scenarios in A Nightmare on Elm Street which could've been executed a lot better.Freddy was back to his dark, more evil roots of NOES 1, 2 and New Nightmare only this version was a lot more serious and angry. I hated the make-up; in fact, the first time we get a perfect look of him on-screen I laughed a little which obviously wasn't the director's intention. Sure its realistic to what a burnt victim would look like, but this is the dream world we're talking about, Freddy can take on any persona he wishes. Anyway JEH was definitely the highlight of the film. I loved the voice and his aggressive temper, and I liked the fact that they junked in a bit of dark humor, the only negative I can think of was the laugh which I felt was extremely disappointed.Bottom Line: Don't listen to all the negative feedback around here, just sit back and enjoy it as I did, and if you can, try not to compare to the original film because its simply not as creative or intelligent but it is dark and to a certain extent scary.. a solid modern day take on the re-imagery of Freddy Kruger..",A Nightmare on Elm Street
305,Rayniack,A very good psychological thriller,9,24 July 2013,"I thought this would basically be the original film with better special effects and therefore did not go and see the movie. This is not a remake, but taking the old premise of the original and taking a completely different approach to this.While we got in the first film a very brief explanation that parents burned Freddy to death after they discovered he was a pedophile and it was a bunch of kids hatching plans on how to stop him. This film main premise is almost until the very end, Freddy revealing his life to the kids. Firstly it seems that Freddy was burned to death, because children made false accusations of him and he has a legitimate beef to pick with these parents. It is not just a hacker and slasher, it is a great psychological thriller and a detective story.The question until the very end was if Freddy was innocent and not and it was an interesting and sick twist of the story in the very end.I think it was a really cool movie. Not much horror and gore, but a very fascinating and interesting story until the very end.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
306,dancer-91,"Not bad, but not good",7,29 October 2010,"I think I have way too low expectations for movies these days, since my first thought was that this wasn't half bad.Everyone knows the basic story of the Nightmare on Elm street -movies. Freddy Krueger. That's about it really.Freddy is an iconic character. He's one of those characters that you really can't beat because you don't live in the same world. He is a truly terrifying character, because you can't survive without sleep but if you sleep, you're dragged into Freddy's world where you really can't win. I like the fact that they didn't change this. It's still really obvious that Freddy is the king of dreamworld and that the kids don't have any chance against him.What I didn't like... I didn't like the fact that they killed Kris and Jesse so fast. Dean's death and the whole opening sequence was really good but after that it didn't work so well.You could have kept Kris alive longer, making the audience believe that she was the hero and then kill her. Now it just felt like we didn't get to now her enough to believe that she would be the hero before she died. And we didn't get to know Jesse enough either. It felt like the director wanted these two character's out of the way so they could focus on Quentin and Nancy.I did like the cast. I loved Kyle Gallner before this film and now I fell in love with Rooney Mara. I even liked Katie Cassidy. Thomas Dekker is always good. Jackie Earle Haley was good as Freddy. But there was something missing, he didn't quite achieve the same intensity that he did with Rorschach in Watchmen. But I think he did a fine job anyway.So... The movie could have been way worse, but it had a lot of flaws. It did leave the bitter aftertaste of teen horror. But the cast saved the movie from being that bad",A Nightmare on Elm Street
307,tristandetwiler,"1, 2, Freddy's Coming for you... 3, 4, this remake isn't bad...",8,21 December 2013,"This is one of the best remakes I've ever seen. If someone asked me to give an example of a good one, I'd immediately think of this.Plot:I'm sure you've all heard the story of Freddy Krueger. If you want the full back-story, go see my Original Nightmare on Elm Street Overlook. Surprisingly, this film isn't just able to retell the story again in a unique way, but is actually able to ADD to the story and characters... successfully! The movie goes into more detail about the science of dreams and how it's possible to see Freddy or unknown entities in your dreams. After 72 hours of being awake, you will begin to experience micro-naps, which means you're dreaming and you don't know it, even if you are awake. This new TRUE fact led to some great sequences in the movie. The Grocery Store sequence where Nancy is crawling away from Freddy is one of the best scenes in any horror movie. I won't give it away, but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.Characters:Unfortunately, not MUCH is added to the characters, but they are still likable. I really appreciate that they didn't kill off the character Glenn this time. He does have his moments of being a bad-ass in this movie, which is why you grow to like him. He's funny, smart, a little awkward, and nice. Just to note, he is very different from the Glenn in the original movie. Nancy is too. She's just a curious, cautious, friendly, practical, and exuberant teenage girl. Apparently she likes to paint around this time, and this leads to her discovery of Freddy. After having a dream that introduces Freddy to her, she paints of picture of him, which reveals that all the teenagers are having the same dream. It's basically the same story, but told very differently.Visuals:I mentioned that the effects in the classic movie are now cheesy; well, as you can guess, the effects are far better in the new movie. They're are damn good; there is too many list: The fire effects on Freddy after running out the building, the new make-up effects for Burnt Freddy, the supernatural effects, and blood. A lot of people complain that the new make-up for Freddy Krueger looks... bad. Some say it looks like a melted alien and others say he looks like they got pizza ironed onto their face. I disagree with both of these claims. This new look really does resemble a burn victim; sure, it's a LITTLE exaggerated, but so is the idea that people can be killed in their dreams.Sound:There wasn't really anything memorable about the music. The only thing that stood out, was the main theme of course.Rewatchability:It's a very entertaining movie. I would recommend it for a showing. Interestingly enough, there's apparently different and deleted sequences that were supposed to be in the movie; like over twenty minutes worth. And they were all filmed! Why were they cut?",A Nightmare on Elm Street
308,GoreWhoreAust,Reoccurring Nightmare,6,26 May 2010,"'A Nightmare On Elm Street' circa 2010 suffers from a split personality. It's a remake of a modern horror classic, remade one presumes to utilize a known brand that not only attracts those familiar with it but also those who are not (Who are you by the way?). If this is true then our most dire fears are realized. Yes this remake, re-imagining, homage whatever you may call it, exists solely to make money. There in lays the irony. How do you make money on a film that fans hold the very idea of in contempt and new comers are ever harder to impress? Poor Elm St. 2010 was off to a bad start long before it even hit the screens. While the casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy garnered some approval it never seemed enough to give fans a good night's sleep. Nightmare creator Wes Craven was not only nowhere to be seen in relation to the production, it seemed that he was actually being majorly screwed over in regard to intellectual property. This definitely didn't sit well with his loyal fans, the same fans this new film would need the support of to be successful. Another flag was raised when Platinum Dunes, the makers of this new Nightmare released their take on Freddy's horror brethren Jason Voorhees. Friday The 13th 2009 was beyond terrible and the fate of Freddy in Platinum's hands looked less than hopeful. Jump ahead to evasive glimpses of the new Freddy online, so-so trailers, and the film finally hits screens. Despite opening at No.1 in the US and making twice its budget back in one weekend, the horror community, ready for a fight, pretty much unanimously wrote it off. Why? Well, here's where the film's continues it's somewhat fatal duality. The story is pretty much the same yet vastly different to its forbearer. There's still a girl called Nancy, she still has nightmares about a burnt man, she still takes a bath, her mother is again played by a bad actress and all her friends keep dying in their sleep. What's different? Pretty much everything else. It's no wonder Craven is not given a story credit. Names and motivations have changed. Characters are deleted (Nancy's father is nowhere to be seen but played a pivotal role in Craven's original). We are also introduced to the notion of micro-naps but most importantly it is made very clear what kind of monster this Freddy actually is where the original only claimed him as a killer. It seems this shaking up of elements from the original is what has upset fans so much, although, had this new film been a complete 'faithful' replica of the original it would have likely been derided for that too. Which brings us back to the question of why. For money remember. Is this film unnecessary? Yes. Is it bad? No, not in my opinion. Though we pretty much know where the story is headed, I felt there were still surprises to be had. The story structure takes on more of a mystery solving rhythm as Nancy and her friends not only try to figure out what is happening to them but why they are all connected to each other. The acting is all quite good from the young cast though they are little over preened in appearance. The film is also quite threatening, which is a significant achievement considering we have lived with this character and concept for over 25 years. While the evil clowning of Robert Englund's Freddy is ever so slightly missed, Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy is much more of a monster, especially as this film at first makes you feel he is the victim and his dream stalking is in some way a justifiable revenge. Maybe the film does suffer a little from over rationalizing. In an attempt to make the proceedings more real and less camp, some of the surreal creativity the series was known for has been sapped out. Pretty much every character has the same dream environment, though this is important to the 'mystery' of the story. In all this rationalizing of the story it isn't made clear why this Freddy would have his trademark glove. In the original he was a child killer and the glove was a self fashioned weapon of choice, which we see him construct in the opening sequence. Here, there is no real reason why Freddy would need the glove. We are not told he kills children, we never see him make the glove and we don't seem him use it for any specific reason during the flashbacks of the 'living' Freddy Krueger. As this film is left open for a sequel in much the same way as the original was (I quite like how they did this) we may yet be given reason for the glove and some indulging in good old fashioned nightmare fantasy. Perhaps by finding more of a middle ground with the Elm St of the past, the Elm St of the future will be a road more fans care to visit.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
309,housecountrywife,Actually pretty good!,8,7 July 2011,"The only reason I bothered seeing this on opening day is because it was around the time of my birthday, and a friend took to the movies as a gift. I for sure thought up until the first kill scene that this movie was going to be typical re-make for the $$$ garbage. After said scene (no spoilers), the whole theatre gasped, before bursting out into laughter. Talk about reaction! I ended up enjoy this movie very much, and the storyline of Freddy's background adds for interest plot line. Of course, no Freddy K. will ever look as ghoulish as mr. Robert Englund, but the Freddy portrayed in this movie is far more sadistic than the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
310,wolfcub7,"If you must watch this, see this first and then the original.",2,27 October 2010,"This lacks in so many things that I think makes the original so affective. This lacks intensity and mystery on some essential level and this makes it all too complicated. Also there are too many ""boo"" moments in this. Freddy's literally in it way too much.I dislike the idea that they stripped Freddy off of the essential of being a child murderer all along and having pedophile tendencies only hinted in his behavior. Because 1.) I don't think pedophilia should be focused on in entertainment purposes like the NOES universe. Though they never ever actually say the word or in any way directly say what Freddy was but there are clear hints. 2.) Freddy's original point was that he was a child murderer more than a pedophile. ""The Springwood Slasher"".Not that idea of child murders would entertain me either but I can stand its use in fiction better than pedophilia. As the NOES universe isn't made for educational purposes. I think in NOES type of films they should stick to the more common horror stuff (as in murder/death) instead of trying to make entertainment out of (in my opinion) a more sensitive issue. What fascinates me in NOES is the idea of a mortal man becoming a dreamworld monster able to do what Freddy does and how he can be defeated. But the characterization and the background story is important too on the psychological affect, of course.Perhaps it was the fact that I'd read the earlier script and knew what could be expected in some familiar looking scenes is the reason why many scenes didn't impress me much. But I'd say it was also that they were just averagely done with not intense enough atmosphere. Especially when subconsciously I was probably constantly comparing it to the atmosphere of the original film, which is more mysterious and more intense.IE. ""the ceiling scene"" as in Tina's death. I first saw that scene from the original film when I was thirteen and have seen it numerous times since but I still remember clear as yesterday that very first time. I think the same effect might be on people who see this remake first because as stand-alone scene and without any comparison, it might be kinda impressive.But to me Kris's death was a pathetic version of Tina's. I'm not fan of gore so I'm glad there wasn't as much of that in this version as there was in the original but something else important is missing. Tina was chased first, then we see there's clearly someone invisible under the covers with her, we see that invisible someone *drag* her up to and on the ceiling while she makes dying sounds, then is dropped dead on to the bed. And the gore happened bit by bit all the way.But Kris? She isn't chased, she literally floats up into the air - (WTF is up with that?!) - is hit against the ceiling, does a few acrobatic stunts on the ceiling for like 10 seconds, dropped on the bed and then is graphically slashed once and she's dead. Plus Jesse VS. Rod, Rod's intense reactions beats Jesse's slightly panicked reaction any day. But then again, as said the guys saw a very different toned death. The remake scene left me a bit ""Ummm OK? That was weird and quick"" instead of scared/impressed. It's the psychological effect of the scenario and length and atmosphere that the remake scene lacks big time.But the film has its moments and Freddy his cool lines. ""Oh God."" ""No. Just me."" That scene's perhaps my favorite in the remake because it's intense and has an interesting discussion, ending into another cool line ""Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet."" and then he does something more or less unexpected. Even Freddy's stupid voice and stupid Voldemort-looks didn't bother at all.There were some impressive scenes like the first death which I totally didn't expect to happen the way it did. And I think the actor of Freddy did well for having to work on so much less complex character.I think these are completely different stories with completely different psychological themes. I like the original's better. I fail to grasp what's the remake's psychological theme since it doesn't seem to be same as the originals: ""the boogie-men and how to defeat them"" combined to a supernatural reality.Whatever it is, I think the original's theme is better because it's more easily relateable to anyone and it has a more haunting atmosphere and it doesn't make the background storyline too complicated.The haunting, mysterious, dream-like, boogiemen theme/aspect this remake lacks in many ways. Yeah there's a lot of dreaming and a lot of talk about insomnia and all that but they just lack in the atmosphere. I think it's partly because they put in the whole ""micro naps"" thing when one falls asleep without knowing it and thus they could not change the atmosphere between the dream moments and the waking moments.I think this remake's makers were focusing too much on the background story and leading the characters and story into the source instead of putting effort in making the current situation's horror more effective/atmospheric.So in the end I guess the remake can entertain but likely the best those who don't know the original story/movie and/or haven't seen it. I would recommend to watch the remake first if you're going to watch it at all. But in my opinion, you're not missing out on anything special if you choose to ignore it and just see the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
311,lbabe29,Good performances help make this a decent watch.,6,8 May 2010,"The film begins strong with an eerie, intense diner sequence that sets the bleak tone whilst giving us a good introduction to our main characters. We have Nancy (Rooney Mara) the timid yet mysterious girl who's troubled blue eyes hide torture and sadness but also an undeniable strength. Quentin (Kyle Gallner) who longs for Nancy is sensitive, compassionate and receptive. His sweet charm and genuine care mixed with his tendency to be high stung and suffer anger issues makes him a perfect, complex character with instant likability. Jesse (Thomas dekker) the brooding and jealous ex boyfriend of Kris, whilst on the surface he appears angry and bitter there is obvious vulnerability and sweetness deep down. Finally Kris (Katie Cassidy), the typical good girl but with an added dose of cleverness and curiosity.After witnessing the brutal death of a friend these characters are flung into a living nightmare,if they fall asleep they will be attacked and killed by the horribly burned Freddy Kruger (Jackie earl Haley) resulting in their death in reality. In a race against time these characters must find the link they all share before they are systematically murdered. The acting within this film is very good and way above the normal horror standards. The young actors playing our teenagers take fairly under developed characters and turn them into a character that feels real, all add such depth to their roles that you feel you know each character within minutes. These young actors are stars in the making. Cassidy (kris) although a little shaky on her delivery at the start gives an emotive performance and adds depth to a character that so easily could have come off as cliché. Dekker (jesse) shines during his scenes of terror, this is an intense performance and his face aptly shows the horror they all face. However the real stars of this young cast are Gallner and Mara who play our main leads and protagonists Nancy and Quentin.Kyle Gallner again proves himself to be one of the best young actors working today. Kyle outshines everyone in nearly all his scenes bringing not only an intense likability but a wonderful complex warmth. His desperation as the film goes on is truly phenomenal, in scenes of intense anger, pain, terror, and even softer moments of tenderness Kyle is incredible. Next to Jackie he steals the show. Rooney Mara plays our heroine Nancy with wonderful subtly, she hits all the right emotions and provides us with a interesting and deep lead girl. Mara's strength is her eyes which burn with emotion, her tears and screams of horror will break even the hardest heart. Towards the end she is dragged through unimaginable hell and her performance makes these moments even more horrific. Lastly Jackie is unbelievably terrifying and creepy as Freddy, his anger burns through his words, his every action is a mix of sick enjoyment and furious hatred. His performance radiates terror and anger, Jackie breaths new life into this killer and makes him scarier then ever . The story is different from the original and much darker, whilst in essence keeping the same basic outline this remake does add a different and terrifying spin. The score is as eerie and creepy as the film, with a soft tragic theme through-out this is one of the best horror scores I've heard in a while. However well it works in context of the film it fails to be as memorable as the original score but works in its own way. Samual Bayer making his directional debut sure knows how to create dark and beautiful imagery , this film is visually stunning and even breathtaking. There are also plenty of well timed jump scares that for some reason work so well within this film, they make you feel like your there living this nightmare with these characters.There exists two real flaws for me concerning this film. The first is the pacing and over-all editing of the movie. Everything feels a little rushed and the editing whilst decent and in some places brilliant (pharmacy scene and the final nightmare) it all feels too brief, there were many scenes which i felt should have lingered. The second is the dialogue and script. whilst Strick and Heisserer do add some fantastic ideas ...much of the dialogue seems too bland, particularly with the teens its only thanks to good actors that these lines worked because in all honesty it felt as if the writers gave up somewhat. This film lacks the slow-burning nature that made the original so wonderful, this film is a fast paced ride and sometimes i did miss the slower nature of the first.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

313,pcongleton-1,You might be surprised about this remake!,9,10 May 2010,"The ""Remake""! This is the second film of this spring, after Clash of the Titans, to be a remake. Which way would this one go? What made the original film so good was the fact that it could horrify and make fun of itself at the same time. It had the right dose of schlock and shock. In this film the creators decide to go the serious route. Remove the schlock and go with smarts and shock. No Freddy with elongated arms or goofy SPFX. We are handed what we should see if they tried to polish the film for perfection. What happens is our antagonist, and more directly Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Freddy Krueger, loses the charm that Freddy had in the original film. It didn't have that silly edge that made the character interesting. What boosted Robert Englund's performance in the original was the fact that he could go through a whole range of emotions, mannerisms, and the like, but Haley, who is an excellent actor and choice for Freddy, is limited in his range, because of the serious line the film takes. Don't get me wrong! I like the fact that they went with the serious angle. It really did help with the believability of the film and gave it a certain ""smart"" and respectability. It was nice to see a more methodical approach to the Freddy Krueger mythos. The serious approach, I felt, helped to boost the performances of the surrounding cast. The story followed the same general lines that the original did and what I liked about both of these films is the fact that, if you never saw the film, or in my case, couldn't remember the film, because you haven't seen it in 15 years, each character/actor conveys a powerful emotion or feeling to the audience, that they have main character status. They each have a story, and with each of their demises, you have this shock, ala' Hitchcock's Psycho, of another main character getting knocked-off early in the film. The emotions are enhanced, because you think the main character just got killed and everything needs to re-set.

314,sidekicknick43,Another Remake of a Classic Slasher Film is Upon Us.,7,17 October 2010,"Alright, first, we have Halloween- Bulls***. Next, we have Friday the 13th- In my opinion, a good film. Now, we have A Nightmare on Elm Street.People keep saying that the film is very dull. I disagree. Every time something happened, Freddy would pop up. However, that's where my biggest problem comes up. I get really annoyed with jump scares and I don't remember why Hollywood still does that. You get one, Hollywood. After that, I don't want to see another one until the film is over. Maybe an extra one right at the end, if you want. A positive point is the performance by Jackie Earl Hailey, which I feel was a worthy followup to Robert Englund's performance. I like the darker, more sinister Freddy more and I didn't think that any of his puns were to silly or out of place. They even borrow a few toward the end from the previous Nightmare films. I also forgot to mention that I like the way they turned his backstory into a mystery. One last point is the acting. I know I'm going to take a lot of heat when I say it wasn't that bad. Although, Rooney Mara didn't do it for me. She was just kind of boring. And even the parents were kind of bad.All in all, if you're a Nightmare fan, I would definitely recommend giving this a shot. And don't make any comments like ""I didn't like this. Robert wasn't in it."" Because you should have known that before you bought your ticket! If it had a few less jump scares, and maybe a few more clever killings, I could have given it a higher rating, but that stuff really bugs me so...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
315,jmayer2009,Fun Freddy experience!,6,30 April 2010,"People are saying that this is the worst Freddy movie ever. Some people are saying this is the worst horror movie ever made. My response to this is what f***ing movie did you guys see. This is far from the worst in the series and unbelievably far from being the worst horror film ever made. I really enjoyed it. The film had good death scenes, good direction, some good scares, good acting, a great look and feel to it, and last but not leasta fantastic new take on Freddy Krueger. Now that I've said the good about the film, let me address the bad: -The jump scares were predictable for the most part. The original did have jump scares but they were done way better. The original would build up to the scares with suspense. This film however did not. For example: Nancy's looking at her cell phone. Then we hear a knock on her passenger window. BAM. FREDDY'S THERE with a loud noise in the background. That's not scary. It might get a reaction out of you, but you get over it.-The EDITING. Wow. Whoever edited this needs to be fired immediately and should never be able to edit again. I've never seen a film with such horrible editing. For example: Kris runs into building. Before the door is shut we quickly see a shot of the interior of the building, then we see Kris standing still with the door closed behind her. I know it might sound stupid, but I wanted to actually SEE her close the door. The only good editing was the pharmacy scene and about the last 15 minutes.All in all, I did enjoy the film very much.As a Freddy fan, i am extremely impressed. All the negative reviews are wrong. This is a very entertaining movie. Jackie did a great job at reinventing Freddy. He made it his own. Other than the predictable jump scares and horrible editing, I actually wasn't bored. This is about the 2nd or 3rd best Freddy movie in the series. I've seen it at least 3 times all the way through and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time. This film definitely deserves a 9/10 for me. It wasn't perfect and it wasn't atrocious. I really hope there is a sequel. I really want to know if the makers learn from their mistakes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
316,andrewbarry6336,Get Mad But I Find this one slightly better than the original,7,25 November 2013,"But to be fair I only gave the original a 6 out of 10 so this one actually surprised me when I watched it. First I will talk about what bothers me in this movie.First off the acting wasn't that good(except for one exception which will be in my next paragraph). The teenagers all look like their in the late 20's which usually doesn't bother me but ALL OF THEM look way to old. The two leads do an OK job but it wasn't spectacular. The parents also didn't do a good job so overall the acting was mehh throughout. The pacing also was off and sometimes the movie would get a little boring which shouldn't happen in a slasher. Also the ending seemed to be a little over the top and the Welcome To.....line has already been used before so why do it again?The one thing I loved about this movie and why I rate it slightly higher than the original(only one point higher to be exact) is Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Freddy. Everything from his voice to his movements just work great. He actually manages to creep me out which is something the original series could never do. I hate they took a few kills from the original and pretty much redid them here but I found he did a great job. I honestly didn't know what to think and unlike Robert Englund who put some humor into Freddy, Jackie makes him seem very chilling and thrilling. Overall I understand why the original is so highly rated and why this was a big flop budget wise. But to me I did enjoy this film and it has a lot of weak points but Freddy alone in this movie is worth the price of admission. Keep an open mind and you might think the same. I give it a 7 outta 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I feel as though the difference in story and events gave this remake a whole new feel that no other horror remake has ever had. It's great to retell a story but let's change it up. This movie did just that.One of the finer points was the ""school"" story. This obviously differs from the first film in that instead of being a serial child murderer, Fred Krueger is a serial child molester. I felt as if the writers were trying to portray the events using a common theme we see on the news each day, such a teacher being inappropriate with students of all ages. Damn geniuses if that's the case. Overall, it's a fantastic film by itself.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
318,nabeel1127,They almost had it...,8,4 May 2010,"They almost made this movie the way I wanted it. - They changed the story up a bit, but I expected that. A majority of the viewers of this movie are people who had seen it before, so they wanted to keep us on our toes. The actors were pretty good, though I think the main girl would have been better off as the blonde (Ruby from Supernatural) but that's okay.They kept a lot of the same things, same kills, the boiler room, the body bag, all that stuff was still there. I appreciated the loyalty to the original.There was a decent amount of jumps for a movie that really isn't meant to ""scare you out your seat"" but rather ""scare you out your bed."" The necessary explosion scene could not have been done better, thank you Mr. Bay.BUT!!!I was a little unhappy about the new Freddy back story, more so out of a loyal fans perspective. They made it one of those ""vengeful killer"" movies as opposed to the original ""deranged, kill you cuz I want to"" movie. but it did it's job. -My biggest disappointment in this movie was the fact that Freddy wasn't that scary.. The make-up wasn't like the original where he looked like this scary mother-f, in this he just looked like a burned man with down syndrome. Also, the original Freddy was witty and crude, this one wasn't really. He wasn't funny in his demented way, they had a few lines but not as many as I would've liked. The last thing about Freddy was how often they showed his face in this!! They never kept his face in the dark, it was always there in the open... WHY?! From the first time they show him, you see his face.. OH... and I wanted to here my song more often!! ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you..."" Why was it not played more often?!But in the end, Freddy wasn't that big of a problem. He was acted out well, and the movie was very well done. Go see it!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

They have to make it even better right? Pffft WRONG! They took the scare, the creepiness of the first one and turned it in to a cheap scare tactics movie.In the first one, the movie was just scary. The scenes that were supposed to be scary were without having to resort to the sudden LOUD NOISE make anyone jump scenes that this remake used over and over and over again. I absolutely HATE that. If I wanted to watch something like that, I'd watch stupid little screamer videos on Youtube.And also, unlike the original, you really don't get a sense of who the characters are. You just don't give a crap when they die.

However I know the storyline and main facts about Kruger.The differences are few but still occur for one Freddy the killer in this movie actually looks like he was burnt which special graphics help, while the 1980's Freddy looks scary but he doesn't look like he was burnt. This Freddy also is given a better description of what happened before he got burnt than the 80's version.The story starts in a café/restaurant as Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz) has a dream and gets killed in his dream by a man named Freddy Kruger (Jackie Earle Haley) and dies in real life. Four others are then terrorized by Freddy in their sleep : Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker) & Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner).These teens are tortured because they all went to the same pre-school and the gardener was Freddy Kruger who was suspect of being a paedofile their parents hunted Freddy down burnt him alive and now he attempts to get his revenge. Can any of the teens defeat Freddy, or will he successfully get his revenge.This movie is a classic and there are some seriously gory scenes as being one of the most famous movies of all time.

322,drforeman,Hollywood means having one good idea and making DARN sure not to use it.,2,30 April 2010,"This movie came so near to brilliance that it's painful. Its clever visuals, interesting plot, and suspenseful atmosphere should appeal to classic ""Nightmare"" fans and newcomers alike; it was serious without abandoning the series's villain's unique willingness to talk to his victims, the teenage protagonists were actually likable, it made exceptional use of the idea of watching someone's nightmares, it featured a frankly brilliant performance by its villainous lead, it had references galore without being a pointless remake... it should have been a work of art. So why have I just left the theater wishing this film had never happened? The recent trend towards remaking classic horror films is essentially a contrivance to continue those much-loved series in such a way that audiences will take them seriously again. Personally, I don't think that's a bad thing as long as there's creative merit and the films are fun to experience. This particular one, though, offered a chance for more... it was an opportunity not just to carry on a franchise, but to put a genuinely original spin on the material, creating an entirely new ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series with a real *reason* to exist. It had the opportunity to be a deeper story, its own story, while staying true to the spirit and concept of the original. There's not much room for that with, say, ""Friday the 13th."" Jason's a big, possibly dead guy who kills people - there's very little chance for interpretation. Freddy, however, has a story and a history, and that presents opportunities.The makers of this film saw that, and brilliantly seized upon it. They created a central mystery regarding *why* Freddy does what he does. NOTE: after this point, there be spoilers. I don't wish to ruin it for anyone... Spoilers begin now. So, in short, the film proposes that Mr. Krueger might actually have been *innocent* of any crime in life. Brilliant! It puts an enormously clever spin on the story. He would still be a monster later, being an undead murderer and thus an effective villain, but he might also have been a sympathetic victim himself, creating an engaging dichotomy for the viewers. It would make perfect sense, too, after all, Freddy was practically the protagonist in the original series already. So here's a chance to create a horror film series wherein the villain is something more than just a killer, giving rise to a creatively interesting and infinitely more compelling new take on the Freddy mythos: a brand new series actually worthy of the term ""re-imagining."" And you know what they did? They decided against it.In a stomach-plummeting moment halfway through the film, the teenage heroes reach the conclusion that Freddy must have been innocent! (Bear in mind that in this new film, evidently inspired by twenty-odd years of made-for-TV movies about abuse, Freddy is not accused of being a purely evil child murderer, but a child *molester*, a very different concept.) And as we all know, if the heroes have that theory halfway through then there's only one way it can end... with them being wrong. Sure enough, they discover, in what I imagine was meant to be a surprising moment, that he really was guilty as accused. Rather than leave anything to doubt, the film goes so far as to present the audience with a look at Freddy's box of souvenir polaroids. And with that, any possibility of an interesting film, much less *futher* interesting films, goes out the window. Is he a tortured soul, hurt by those he loved and in search of vengeance? No, he is not... he's a slightly mincing pedophile (an oddly Southern pedophile when he was alive, no less, because let us not forget that in Hollywood, everyone from the South must be messed up in one way or another).I kept waiting at the end of the film for some hint, some genuinely surprising moment wherein we discover that the school's principal was really responsible, not Freddy at all. But it was not to be... Honestly, I find it difficult to believe that any writer or director could conceive of such a clever idea and then *deliberately* discard it. It hurts to imagine, much less to watch. It's just... sad. It's as though Casablanca ended with her getting back OFF the plane and running back into Rick's arms: a chance at brilliance utterly discarded.More, making him guilty renders the rest of the movie a lot less effective, almost nonsensical. The darker tone of Freddy's world, leaving out more fantastic dream imagery in favor of harsher, more straightforward nightmares, makes perfect sense if Freddy is innocent of the crimes for which he was murdered. It works as a representation of his anger, just like his demeanor. Haley played it with a savage, genuine anger, as someone falsely accused. That performance only works if his anger was actually justified. The same is true of Freddy before his death - Haley played him as an genuinely caring man. I sincerely wonder if the decision to make him guilty was conceived at the last minute. That would explain a great deal, as the whole tone of the film and the character's demeanor change radically right at the end. All the dialogue that comes after the revelation, particularly that which explains his guilt and his motivation, seems hasty and forced when compared to rest of the film. In the end, if Freddy was guilty all along, when one looks back over the film everything that had come before just doesn't work anymore. Not only does that destroy any rewatchability, but it renders the whole film not just disappointing, but actually bad.And with that, the template is set for the new series of ""Nightmare"" films - sex, pedophilia, and predictability, with any chance of creativity cast dismally aside. Well... here's hoping they reboot the series again in fifteen years' time. Until then, remember: creativity and Hollywood just don't mix.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
323,whitewingedove17,Weak Freddy,5,2 May 2010,"I was really excited to see this movie at midnight on opening night. The movie theater was completely packed and the thought of being able to watch this on the big screen was really exciting to my best friend and me. Unfortunately, by the end of the movie we did not feel the same excitement as we shared when the movie started. I thought the acting was decent, but what lacked was the fear that Freddy inflicted in us in the original classic. The Freddy in this remake appears deformed and less frightening as Robert Englund's character. He lacks the typical one-liners that Robert used as well...although he did have a few of them here and there. There were certain elements from the original that were used in this, but all in all I found it to be disappointing compared to the original. I also didn't like that they went beyond Freddy's child-murdering past and made him a child molester instead. That really was unnecessary as the child murderer character was much scarier. I also didn't really think it was necessary that they showed his past and how he led up to the monster that he became after he died...we all know him as a killer, there really isn't a psychological need to know why he's killing these teens. I kinda liked the ending scene, although it's still not as classic as the ending in the original.

He remembers when he was a young boy, his family lived in a 2 story building, when one night he was peering out the window from the second floor down at a homeless man. Wes speaks about how the man at one point notices Wes looking at him and proceeds to toy with him, making eerie pose like depictions in the shadows of the night. Wes Craven speaks about the mans eyes and the penetrating fear evoked by his gaze( that Freddy gaze). This interaction affected him in a great way( mostly with fear), promoting him to run into his brothers room to share his trepidation of this man in the street; who now is pounding at their front door. Wes' brother now wielding a baseball bat opens the front door to find.....no one!34 years later the incarnation of this experience is brought to life on the big screen with the iconic film ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""(1984).

He has a head that looks like ""Spud Mackensie"" or a small horse, this symmetry makes him look clearly unrecognizable as the iconic bogeyman. He is also too short to play the part. How can Robert Englund be typecast as Freddy and not be brought back to play the role people only know him as? I'm convinced the boys at Platinum Dunes made this movie knowing that the buzz would create enough of a box office hit to cover their budget. The film made its money simply because Robert Englund helped create a franchise like no other. Nothing new is introduced in this latest incarnation and the studios will green-light another remake for them to defile.OK...so what, the guys name is Freddy, he has the sweater and glove and the girls name is Nancy...big whoopee!!

Its apparent from the start, that this remake of the 1984 classic, has a pretty good sized budget to work with. In fact the budget for this incarnation was $35 Million according to Wikipedia. The budget for the Wes Craven original, $1.8 Million. You don't always get a better movie if your budget is huge, look at Avatar. You just get a really pretty movie that looks polished and has flawless special effects. Again, see Avatar. That movie was nothing but flash. The story is unoriginal and weak... and don't try coming at me with this whole ""Shut up man! Avatar proved itself!"" shut up! The larger budget in this case makes the movie look too polished to be takes seriously. Why the hell are we caring about watching clones of the Twilight teens being chased by Freddy Kruger? Were not. This movie didn't need a budget of $35 Million. It feels wasted. Some of the appeal of the original came from watching the director be a director and figure scenes out. This movie didn't do that. It felt trite and forced.Freddy Kruger is less of a movie villain in the horror industry and more of an icon. Everyone I knew growing up all had Freddy Kruger nightmares when they were a kid. Perhaps this new version of Freddy will serve to scare the poop out of kids these days. I would hope so. Maybe when they remake this movie again in twenty years they will bitch about it then as well.

327,cchires,Without Freddy Elm Street Would be a Pretty Boring Place,5,15 May 2010,"One of the consequences of living in the internet age is the apparent destruction of our imagination. The most obvious example of this is the flood of movie remakes that have hit us in the past decade. I am not opposed to remakes in principle, sometimes they really improve on the qualities of the original and a good director can offer a unique interpretation of the material (e.g. Peter Jackson's King Kong). Most of the time though remakes fail by comparison with the original: i.e. this movie.Since we know pretty much all the elements of a Nightmare on Elm Street movie beforehand, the best way to evaluate the remake is to see how it holds up against the others in the series. The most obvious contrast in this film is that this is the first Nightmare without Robert Englund as Freddy Kruger. So how is the New Freddy? While I cannot complain about Jackie Earl Haley as an actor, I found his Freddy to be a disappointment for a couple of reasons. One is the makeup; because he is obviously meant to look like a true burn victim, his facial movements are limited and ends up looking like a mask of melted cheese. Another complaint is his voice which is over-synthesized to the point he sounds like a relative of Peter Frampton. Ultimately, this Freddy is just not scary or funny enough to add any weight to this installment of the series.Of the teenagers let it be said that it seems like their lives would be pretty boring if Freddy didn't start haunting their dreams. Every young person in this movie talks in a monotone voice and has a flat affect. I know they're supposed to be sleep deprived, but they could be at least be a little interesting rather than just lambs waiting for the slaughter. I also felt that showing Freddy's past crimes as a child molester hurt the tone of the movie.There are some good things in the movie. The lighting and set designs were creepy, especially during the nightmare sequences. I also should be fair and say that there were at least 4 good moments where I jumped (no suspense was held for any significant period of time however).

This movie had to fight all this and the negative camp that the series churned out. I am big on sound and this movie had some great uses of sound. Freddie's voice was very cool, contrary to what I've been reading on here, and there were plenty of jumps/startles. I can accept that Freddie looks more like a real burn victim, and his ambiguity of good vs evil real life character was a nice twist.

331,KidDrehmann,Freddy Returns With A Vengeance,10,19 May 2010,"I saw this film the weekend it arrived in theaters and I have to say it certainly did not disappoint. I went into the movie with extraordinary expectations due to two factors: I have seen all previous Nightmare movies so i knew what to expect, and all other horror movie remakes (excluding the Prom Night remake) have been extremely awesome and far better than the originals. After leaving I was happy to say that the new A Nightmare On Elm Street met my expectations and then some. It is by far the best one in the series and the best horror movie made so far, despite the fact it is a remake. This new film opened up an entire new perspective of Freddy Krueger's sick and demented world, with some creative similarities to its predecessors.First off lets start with the actors. Jackie Earl Haley did an absolutely fantastic job playing the role of the Springwood Slasher. He did so well in fact that I believe that Robert Englund would say so. Haley returned Freddy to his dark and demented roots, back to a more evil and serious toned Nightmare movie much like the original and Part 2. And I think we all wanted to see that. Especially after the franchise turned more to the comedic side of horror rather than the mass murderer side. There were jokes in this movie too they were just more of the small semi-comedic one liners like in the original. Also Haley's voice in the movie (which was like a slurred southern accent) provided aid to the tone of the remake in the sense that it was a voice that would echo in the deepest aspects of your mind and terrify that living crap out of you. This voice was even more effective with some of the lines that Haley ad-libbed while filming the movie (so as to relieve some of the other actors) like during Jesse's death with the remark of the brain remaining active for seven minutes after the heart stops beating. Kyle Gallner and Rooney Mara, who played Quentin and Nancy respectively, also displayed what great acting skills they possessed. In my opinion they showed just as much success, depth, creativity, and originality in performing their parts as Jamie Lee Curtis in John Carpenter's Halloween. And even though the characters of Jesse, Kris, and Dean were only in the movie for about 30 minutes they too displayed acting prowess.Next I have heard many people complaining about the new Freddy makeup. Said people have been upset that he looks like a burn victim, which correct me if I'm wrong, that is what he is a burn victim. The new makeup is very well done actually resembling a real burn victim with very charred and burnt skin on his face and an opening on the left cheek of his mouth showing muscle. This actually looks a great deal better than the original's makeup, which as good as it was, looked mostly like pieces of cheese pizza on Englund's face. The CGI also deserves praise for providing the movie with the dream sequences and the kill scenes. The dreams were especially artistic. Nancy walking in her room, finding it covered in snow, and then having the camera pan around her to reveal her old preschool, the start of Freddy's involvement in her life, proved very effective in showing the audience the director's unique sense of atmosphere.As for the plot, it is a very different take on the original. In the first A Nightmare On Elm Street Freddy was depicted as the Springwood Slasher, a serial killer that went around murdering the children of the parents of Elm Street thus resulting in their taking of his life which is the reason for him killing the now teenage children. In the remake there are some differences. The basic synopsis remains Freddy being a former janitor at the school haunting the dreams of a group of teenagers and murdering them as payback to the parents that burned him alive, but instead of being a child murderer he was portrayed as a gardener at the local preschool that sexually abused the parents children and cut with a new gardening tool, which later became his clawed glove. I believe this take on the Krueger back story was actually a pretty good idea and also provides much more freedom for Samuel Bayer and Platinum Dunes in the sequel they plan on making.The kill scenes were also a bit different. Mainly Kris and Jesse's deaths compared to the original. Jesse's was better to watch in the remake mostly because in the original he just fell asleep and was immediately strangled by Freddy using the cloth from his prison sheets, whereas in the remake the audience witnessed him enter the dream world and actually come into contact with Freddy. As for Kris her death was less disturbing than the original. In the remake Freddy levitated her body above the bed and flipped and tossed her about the ceiling before dropping her and cutting several gashes down her torso. In Wes Craven's Freddy also levitated her body, but instead dragged her across the ceiling while cutting her leaving blood stains all over the walls of the bedroom. And to me that is the only part in the first film that beats the remake. Besides that there is nothing better in any other Freddy film that could top this remake.In conclusion, if you are truly a die hard horror and Krueger fan you will appreciate what this remake brings to the franchise and while detecting the similarities with some of its predecessors recognize it as its own film and, in my opinion, the best in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
332,klemp0,"Why, oh why did they make this movie?",2,6 October 2010,"What is the freaking point of making this movie? I honestly don't understand. The only reason I gave it two stars out of 10 is because it reminded me that I have the whole Nightmare On Elm Street collection on DVD and that I should watch it again. I really wanted this to be a good movie for the sake of the original, so that new generations can see what it's all about, but no one should see this version, I really mean no one. What did they do? They took a few of the scariest scenes from the original and almost three decades and numerous generations of special effects later managed to make them look worse than they looked in 1984. Oh, and they added a few ""F"" words throughout the movie, I guess to make it tougher than the original. If anyone out there who is a real horror fan and wants to know what Nightmare On Elm Street saga is all about, skip this and get the 1984 version, as well as all the sequels. Even though they're not all of the same quality, every single one, even the worst one, beats this one by a mile.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
333,galaxychoco,Stick to the original,3,2 January 2014,OK so about the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie are OK but then it just gets unwatchable. This was not what I was expecting from this movie one of the main reasons it gets so unwatchable is because of Freddy's voice it gets very irritating the plot was OK but not great. My advice would be stick to the original Nightmare on elm streets because you will be disappointed by this one especially if you have seen the original ones already. Some of the actors or OK but others are either annoying or cant act at all. I personally kept watching thinking it would get better towards the end... It didn't it just gets quite worse very unlike the original ones. I would give this movie a 3 out of 10,A Nightmare on Elm Street

335,alliance109,CGI needs to be banned from horror movies,7,7 May 2010,"I love the Freddy franchise more than anyone i know and have all the box sets even the two seasons of Freddy's nightmares, but as an unbiased viewer i gave it 7 on 10 because i have mixed feelings about the movie. The new Freddy is good, not Robert Englund good but that would be impossible. You could remake Jason and Mickeal Myers with any actor because they wear masks, Freddy Krueger is Robert Englund, period! even though that is how i feel i still think this new guy did an excellent job. The make-up was absolutely incredible, better than all the other Freddies. Also the way the story unfolds is great, the acting is also very good and there are several scares very well executed. My only gripes are: a few scenes like the wall scene that would look better in an X-Men movie. And to name another of a few the bed scene at the end. In the original, with Johnny Depp, the bed scene was one of the most horrific scenes i had ever seen in my life, even by todays standards. They really screwed it up here with the awful CGI. Those are the key words here. Awful CGI. Didn't Micheal Bay make this? didn't he do Transformers? that was a landmark on perfecting CGI. What happened after? Transformers 2 lacked the polish of the original and now this movie makes it seem comical. It down right sucked!! Horror movies do not need CGI. Take a lesson from young George Romero. They need real materials that cannot be recreated with a computer. Blood should be liquid, not polygons!!! Horror movies are not superhero flicks or video games, they are horror movies. In order to be horrified blood and guts need to look real and gross, not clean and cartooned!! The horror factor here needs to be raised to the highest level because we're talking about the most notorious horror movie of all time with the greatest monster of all time. That damn CGI took a lot away from this. The bedroom scene in the beginning was better than the original though, i must say and if there was any CGI, very well executed. The other part of the movie that killed it for me was who Freddy Krueger was. We know him as a killer, but an anti-hero. Here he is nothing more than a disgusting paedophile. Even though Freddy was a bad man in all the other movies you couldn't help but love him in some sick way... but now, a paedophile? there is no room to like the character at all!! you just can't root for the bad guy anymore and that's what made him so special in the first place, not knowing why you liked him. Who could like a paedophile?!Anyways to sum up this is a good movie but please see the original first if you haven't because seeing this first will kill the legacy that was made in the 80's and 90's. Good chills, great make-up, horrible CGI, and no desire for a sequel. I give it a 7 because it is a solid stand alone movie and is worth dishing out the theatre money for, but I hope that they won't continue this with sequels like they did with the original. It was fun to see Freddy again and interesting to see a bigger budget in one of these movies but if they do continue it would be only to make money because the soul of this franchise has been damaged and it would be a shame to give Robert Englund a back seat to what was unquestionably the best horror series of all time. If anything bring back Mr.Englund, it's much more fun with him and I'm not alone in saying this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
336,rascal67,A Nightmare Of Abysmal Proportions,1,20 May 2010,"Comparisons to Wes Craven's 1984 original classic are going to be prevalent. Some may say that this is unfair and biased. I for one went in to this remake telling myself not to be prejudiced and too accept the film on it's own merits, but when a film is this egregious; one can't help such rueful contrasts.Excellent production values do not compensate for boring tripe and weak acting. The veneer of this film is all gloss. A superficial attempt at creating a nightmarish atmosphere only augments how routine and soulless this contemptuous film is. Every sequence appeared to be just going through the motions of what the screenplay had set down with no affection, passion or even interest behind the direction. It is an insult to horror film fans; Wes Craven and even the sequels that the original spawned; it even makes the boring Part 5 'Dream Child' seem like a masterpiece.The main flaw is in the characterization. You have to have likable characters and actors to root for in a film like this otherwise why care about these kids and their nightmares. Who cast this thing? Who wrote this thing? Im sure it was great for these actors to get cast: but come on! None of these actors were really endearing and their acting skills were forced and fake like the style of this turgid mess. They were obviously too old looking for the teenage characters they were playing and displayed none of the naiveté, natural charm or teenage persona that the Elm St. films from the 80's were blessed with. What is the point of introducing the first victim; who we really knew nothing about and acted and sounded like a jerk and then kill him off in the first 5 minutes. Maybe young teenagers might find this distressing, but it displays nothing but scorn for the rest of the audience especially the older fans. 'Aliens Vs Predator Requiem' is another case point example. When are these contemporary horror filmmakers going to awaken to this??? The one star I give this film is only awarded for Jackie Earle Haley, who imbued his Freddy Kruger with a menacing and cruel edge without going over the top. It's a nightmarish shame the rest of the film let his talent down.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
337,tangoorange_298,Not too bad for a remake.,6,13 May 2010,"Not so bad for a remake though nothing can beat the original. Surprisingly better than I thought it was going to be, and a fair few jumpy bits in it to. Whilst no one can ever really fill Englunds boots, Haley gave it his best shot. This Freddy wasn't as scary as the original, his face wasn't as bad and his voice was pretty weird; kinda like having a voice over from God. Nonetheless a worth while film to watch- whether it be in the Cinema or when it's out on DVD. A true horror fanatic would agree that original Freddy is far better. I would recommend this film to others, even those who aren't all that into the horror genre. Brilliant atmosphere within the audience- although I have no idea who has seen the original and who hasn't. 6/10 for best efforts but no one can replace original Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

339,Ocrisia,Freddy isn't Freddy without Robert and Wes,2,4 July 2013,"I want to start by saying (like so many did before me) I am a HUGE fan on the Nightmare on Elm Street Series. I saw the first one when I was 7, it was actually one of my first horror movies, if not THE first. I used to go to the video store and send my allowance on Freddy movies every weekend.I was actually looking forward to this sequel. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original, but I thought they could do some really cool things with it. I was extremely disappointed when I found out Wes Crave wouldn't have anything to do with it, but I was still going to give it a chance.I was SO disappointed. I loved Freddy, even as a little kid. He was a child murderer in the original films. The molestation thing was not spoken. I read somewhere that Wes originally had it in mind for him to be a child molester, but at the same time the movie was being done, there was a story in the news about molestation, and he thought better of it. (Anyway, who could like a child molester? Not that we like murderers either, but I bet I would never have gotten a Freddy Doll for Christmas if he'd been a molester. Nor would I have wanted one. I wouldn't even have been allowed to watch the movies at 7 years old!) He made a good decision obviously, because Freddy became quite popular-they even sold Freddy pj's, and no one would have wanted THOSE for their kid if he'd been a molester. So anyway, that was disappointing, because I always liked Freddy-I wanted the good guys to win, but I still enjoyed Freddy. You can't like a child molester. So there was that. Although Jackie Earle Haley did do a good job portraying Freddy as evil, the idea of him being a child molester just threw me off.The story wasn't great. The original had a good story, characters you liked..unlike other horror movies where there are just a bunch of generic kids getting sliced, you actually felt for the kids of Elm Street, especially Nancy. In this one they're just like the kids from every other slasher. I didn't really care if they made it to the end of the movie or not. The one thing I thought was going to be awesome was the special effects. They could have done SO MUCH with the dreams! But they didn't. Most of the movie isn't in the dreams, and what is isn't very creative. There's one scene (it was in the trailer-this is what got me excited thinking they made some awesome dream sequences) where it snows inside. That was cool. I don't know why they didn't do more things like that.I know they said they wanted to make a scary Freddy, because in the originals he started becoming kind of a trickster, and he joked around a lot. But there was no reason to reinvent Freddy from the first film, because in the original movie, Freddy was pretty scary. He made a few cracks (""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy"") but it was creepy. What they did in this film though was take parts of a few of the series and put them into one, so I guess I understand why they did it. I just think this movie would have been better if they'd gotten Robert Englund to play Freddy. To me, Robert IS Freddy, and I'd bet there are a whole lot of fans who would say the same.I'll wrap it up now. If you want a good Nightmare on Elm Street, watch the original. I don't even consider this one part of the series. Any Freddy movie without the read FREDDY isn't worth watching.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

342,Darrellbjones,"Tries so hard, but the horrible pacing and bad acting ruined it",4,9 May 2010,"First off, this is not a horrible movie. But, it is not good. First off, 3 of the 5 main characters die in the first 30 to 45 minutes. The rest of the movie focuses on the two remaining characters, Nancy and Quentin. I must say, Nancy and Quentin are some of the most uninteresting characters I have ever seen in my entire life. All of the characters are underdeveloped. The character of Kris starts to develop, but she is murdered before you can start to care about her. Freddy is a creepy child molester with no humor, unlike the original Freddy Kruger. The special effects were good. Kris's death scene far exceeds the original. Dean's death was also very well done. Jesse's death was okay. The acting was bad. The characters were so wooden with there acting half the time, and the other half the time they're over acting. This movie wasn't extremely scary, but far more scary than the remakes of Halloween and Friday the 13th. The ending was a corny rip-off of the original. Over all, A nightmare on elm street 2010 is a mixed bag for me. The acting was bad. The pacing was horrible. Freddy Kruger was creepy, and not in a good way. The special effects were good, and it was scarier than an average horror movie remake. I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
343,staff-577-378882,The night terror continues in the new Nightmare on Elm St.,8,30 April 2010,"The night terror continues in the new Nightmare on Elm St.Freddy is back with more rage than ever. This time is not just about the killings... This time it's about Revenge.Jackie Earle Haley takes on the character of Freddy Krueger , a man who the town has condemned as a child molester. With more disfigurement than the original Freddy, Jackie really does a very good job as the Killer of the film. So good in fact that I had to continue to remind myself that this is not Robert Englund. Keeping with the same mannerism as the original, gives the film a very creditable feel. Not to take anything away from Jackie who added his own twist to the character to make Freddy a new Villain for the new generation. So we ponder the question, Is there anything Jackie Earl Haley cannot do? Answer: I'm afraid not, the guys is as good as they come...The movie seems to have a new direction, a different point of view if you will, perhaps to give the movie a more modern feel. Even thou they changed it enough to make it seem like a new film, I was very impressed with director Samuel Bayer, who decided to keep the killings very similar as the original Nightmare on Elm St. More to his credit, The Studio had said that the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street was going to be converted to 3D during post production in which Bayer Refused to let Nightmare on Elm Street be 3D saying: ""This was shot in 2-D and was meant to be shown in 2-D. Just like I don't want to see a lot of great movies remade - I don't want to see a lot of them in 3-D"" Bravo!!! A very good decision in my opinion.The story of the film is more sinister and disturbing this time around. Giving you a glimpse of what the real backstory was and why they didn't tell us back in 1984 when the film was first released. Far too more complicated to visualize back in those days.With way crazier dreams and mind games, including collaboration of the characters within the same dream, Freddy still taunt his kids just as good, if not better than before. I found this movie to be far more superior than the sequels that followed the first installment of the franchise and I hope you do too.

344,John-Jacobson,The old Nancy would have slapped the new Nancy.,3,22 May 2010,"I want it known that I am not the guy who goes around saying the original is always better, even if its not. I welcome reinterpretation. However the remakers of Nightmare On Elm Street completely fumbled the ball on this one. There are only two things you need to make a Freddy Krueger film: black humour and a cult-film finesse. Both were ignored by rock-video maker Samuel Bayer as he stumbled through the remake. Sammy boy had this lovely notion of exploring Krueger as a child abuser rather than a fun-loving boogeyman. Unfortunately for him, the horrors of child abuse have been mined to death by much more talented filmmakers - and there are many of them.Poor Sam Bayer. Check out the pictures of him on this site. He's been hanging out with rock stars so much he thinks he is one. Maybe he should have spent a few months talking with the guy who created Freddy 26 years ago. Wes Craven is a quietly spoken gentleman who studied literature and psychology. He lives and breathes the horror genre. He built Freddy from the ground up with nothing but empty pockets and steel cojones. Wes would have counselled Sam to avoid taking himself so seriously.Right from the opening titles you know this remake takes itself way too seriously. The new opening is a hauntingly beautiful montage of childhood mementos. However, ""hauntingly beautiful"" is not why we have sat down with our popcorn in this dark theatre. We have come to see our man, Freddy Krueger. The ORIGINAL opening shows us Freddy in his shadowed workshop, forging his clawed glove. We witness the beginning of an icon, the making of a myth. We are going to have a delightfully uneasy relationship with Mr Krueger over the course of six sequels. This is how you make a cult-film, people.The remake's biggest stumbling block was the casting of Krueger. Robert Englund put so much of his unique dark self into this role that putting someone else in the role is like casting a loaded dice. No matter who else you choose, its going to come up snake eyes.On the other hand, the role of Nancy should have been a no-brainer, But Sammy even got this wrong. Heather Langenkamp's Nancy was one of the many kick-ass women of 1980s pop films. She stood up to her idiot jock boyfriend, told off her drunk mom, rigged the house with booby traps, and ran headlong into Freddy during the climax. The old Nancy would have slapped the new Nancy. 2010 Nancy is just another miserable young female tripping over her own feet, waiting for a handsome vampire to save her.Who the hell knows? Bayer's Elm Street might be a hit with the kids. It's full of morose shoe-gazing pill-popping youngsters that seem to be so popular with this generation. They might take a break from reading Twilight 50 and shuffle into the cinema to see more pasty-faced thin-lipped protagonists whine.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
345,wsills8,Best Horror Remake Possible Turns Into Good Movie,9,5 May 2012,"I will start off by saying that I very much enjoyed this film. To all the people that dislike the film, I do understand, but the movie just simply isn't the same film that the original was, hence it is a REmake. First off, I felt that Jackie Earl Haley Played Freddy's role to almost perfection. I grew up loving the Elm Street films (YES even all the sequels) mainly because of my love for Freddy Krueger. Freddy has a different aspect to him than any other horror icon simply because of his weapon choice (bladed fingers) and the way he killed his victims (in their dreams). In the first half of the film, my thought was that Freddy was innocent and this was why he is, but the second half lightened me. I realized the Freddy just is truly a terrible person who kills kids because they told on his unacceptable behavior with the children. I think this film, along with the crew, wanted the audience to hate and fear Freddy. This film doesn't want Freddy as an icon, they want him as a hated demon that deserves to go to hell. Freddy in this film is also entirely different than he is in the other ones. Your not gonna hear all the one liners that Robert used to lay down so flawlessly, but you will hear an occational one that is more dry to still make you dislike Freddy. Now onto the actual movie. The back story was great and I felt that the acting, for the most part, was also very good. Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner did a very good job as the two main teenage victims. This is one of the few horror remakes and horror films of the 21st century that don't rely on girls, boobs, sex, drugs, gore, and popouts.This film relys on an overall spooky background and music to scare you, not to mention Freddy. There is very little gore in the film except in the scene Nancy is running down the bloody hall (which isn't from people it's just in the dream to scare Nancy) and the ending when Gwen is killed by Freddy. There is no sex in this film and no drugs unless you want to count the ADD medication and medical drugs. Now I will put in the few gripes I had about the film. I didn't like how they changed names (Glen to Quentin,Tina to Cris, etc.) and thought that at times Rooney Mara seemed to be boring. That was towards the beginning of the film.All in all, this film is very worthy of watching at least once. If you have never seen a Nightmare film before, you most likely would give it a 6/10. If you have seen one, a few, or all of them, it depends. Don't go into the theater thinking this will be better or try to be better than the original because it is totally different in it's own way except for the fact of Freddy and the dreams. Also, don't go in thinking Jackie will try to be as good as Robert Englund was, because he plays the role entirely different. Going in with this mindset and that it's just a fun film meant to play out for your amusement, it's a 6 to 7/10 and maybe an 8. I absolutely loved it and easily could say it's a 10/10, but honestly, no film is, so it's a 9/10 in my book.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I can't even believe Craven signed off on this lurid atrocity but then again, given the recent interview in which Stephen King clearly condemned the ending of the pedestrian reboot of Pet Sematary, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. At the end of the day, money talks.This is in no way placing blame on the subpar actors or the ridiculous CGI, or the particularly cringeworthy performance of the wannabe Freddy Krueger who quite frankly would be much better off working at a Shake Shack because that seems to be his speed... it is the fault of the one, Producer Zero, who thought this would be a good idea.

348,Theshapeo31,Sure it has VERY noticeable problems but I was still entertained.,6,14 August 2012,"*** Stars Out of *****Well every movie has its flaws (like all movies) but the flaws in this movie are VERY noticeable such as: where's Nancy's father and he was a key character in the original, her mother was a bit of a drunk, her boyfriend died and Freddy was a child killer instead of child molester. Freddy's boiler room has no purpose, but I'm getting to far ahead of myself now I'll just go onto the story.In a remake it's basically the same as the original but with a few things changed. The movie has Nancy (Rooney Mara), Quentin (Kyle Gallner), & Freddy (Jackie Earle Hayley). ...... I don't know how to explain this film but a group of kids that were raped by Freddy are now teenagers and they're being killed one by one by Freddy & Nancy has to stop him.Now I know this film is hated by MANY but despite all the notable flaws this still entertains me. Noticeable flaws would include: that Freddy is killing because the kids basically tattled on him and the parents burned him to death, rather in the original where he killed kids; the parents caught him had him arrested and he got off on a technicality and the parents took justice into their own hands and burned him to death. Also Nancy has no father in this movie where in the original he was a key character. Freddy's boiler room really has no purpose as in the original that's where he took his kids to be murdered but he raped them in a pre-school basement. Nancy's boyfriend like character doesn't die yet in the original he's the last to be killed. But those are the most noticeable changes and I don't hate this movie like everyone else it entertains, I can still watch it, we get a good performance as Freddy from Jackie Earle Hayley, & we get some of Freddy's cool one-liners (however I still liked Robert Englund better) also the song ""All I Have To Do Is Dream"" I did think that was a VERY nice touch for the movie.

350,sean-sumner,*POSS SPOILERS* Good remake unworthy of the negative critic and aged fanbase response!,7,7 July 2016,"Good remake unworthy of the negative critic and aged fanbase response!First off the acting in this movie is very believable, you can see these 'teens' are actually tired and weary. I heard some of the actors stayed awake for long periods before shooting certain scenes to obtain he desired effect. This interwhined with the dream sequences were in my opinion done to perfection, especially the pharmacy scene where Nancy is flirting between real life and the nightmarish boiler room. That scene was standout. Other notable scenes including some death scenes where done to compliment the original rather than outright copy it and carried this off greatly.. Kris's death scene and the body bag scene in particular pleased me as showing respect without copy and pasting from the original. The story moved along at a reasonable pace and the back sorry elements of 'Fred' before he became 'Freddy' were not too convoluted or shoved down my throat, the Quentin dream sequence revealing 'Freds' fate was great to see, i particular liked the scene in which 'Fred' was grooming his young victims as it added an air of unease and creepiness to the story setting up the final third. Granted some scenes did have mistakes and there were a few continuity issues but these are minor at best, not too many questions asked by the police/nurses when Nancy is taken to hospital the first time or after the final act when Nancy and Quentin are taken again, but again, minor. The film is grounded in realism but sometimes seems to forget this but then again the film is about a supernatural dream killer! The killer himself, Jackie Earl Haley AKA Freddy Kruger, for me nailed it. He was NEVER going to be Robert Englund, NEVER, but Jackie still did a great job. The way he almost danced with his victims, the way he stalked and spoke/whispered and creeped, brilliant, that voice! At times you almost rooted for him in his revenge before remembering he was how he was for a reason, for being a dirty kiddy fiddler! The hat, sweater, glove all done to pay homage but with an air of something new and they all looked great on Jackie/Freddy. The ending could of played out a tad better but all in all i think this remake was great and a solid 7 much deserving of some more sequels with Jackie as Freddy! Critics are critics and more often than not are paid to hate movies, the old crowd hate because Freddy was not Robert but the new crowd mostly want more! There is a reason is did well at the box office and that is because people wanted to see this beyond opening weekend. If it was THAT bad then it would of surely bombed after a few days?!

351,mikejpg,Not the Freddy we know and love!,4,23 May 2020,"I'd never actually seen this movie as a full length feature film as I'd only ever seen it in bits, so I decided to sit down, dim the lights and actually give it a watch and honestly... I may as well of kept the lights on.I would just like to say this isn't the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life as there were some moments where I was fully engaged and maybe if this wasn't a Freddy movie and it was a completely new demon with just a similar plot it might've worked.. but it didn't.So first of all I want to mention the ""final girl"", I don't know about anyone else but I found myself rooting for Kris way more than I did for Nancy. And the reason for that is that is felt like Kris cared more and that she had more to her, where as Nancy just doesn't come in to her own. I don't think it's her acting I think maybe she was told to act like that but who the hell wants an unenthusiastic final girl? The other characters weren't the worst I'd ever seen but I just never really cared when any of them died.
Now lastly let's move on to Freddy...Of course I hate this new Freddy but not just because he looks likes a burned up Voldemort in a butchers hat.. but because of how on the nose they were with the way Freddy hurt the children. In the original film we know that Freddy of course wants to kills them and there might even be subtle hints to Freddy being that way inclined but there's nothing that stamps it in there. Where as in this remake he is proven to be that way inclined.
Freddy Krueger is a horror icon but when you label him with those words it becomes a little bit harder to love him... I mean if they would of ran fully with that idea in 1984 I wonder if we still be dressing up as him for Halloween every year.So all in all the movie is worth at least one watch, I admire them for trying to revamp the franchise but if it's Freddy Krueger you're looking for then watch the original 1984 movie cause this 2010 version in't the movie for you.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
352,DVDZombie,"Should have been ""re-booted"" into the trash can.",3,4 May 2010,"I'm not a purist. I don't always believe that the original is necessarily better or that one person is the definition of any given character. That said, in this case both of the above statements are true. The original Nightmare On Elm Street had a certain quality to it. Like many movies of it's era, the original was a perfect storm of casting, special effects, make-up and story. It was destined to become a legend and it did. In fact, no installment of the series was ever ""bad"" in the sense that it was unwatchable and I've seen them all more times then I can count.My older brother introduced me to the series (much to the chagrin of our parents) and since then I've been hooked. When this remake was announced I was excited. I really thought they were going to pull this one off. I fall into that trap every dam time. Platinum Dunes started putting the nails in the coffin right off the bat. First they recast Freddy. then they changed Freddy's make-up, they reworked the story and finally they stopped calling it a remake and started calling it a reboot. God knows, if you hear or read the word reboot you know the movies screwed. It's a term used when the people making the movie know it's gone off track and it's sinking fast.Why should Freddy's make-up not have been changed? Because there was much more to his look then just some random burn victim. Freddy was portrayed as a guy so evil, so demonic and so cruel that his face was warped and twisted. Not just scarred from being burned in a fire but permanently altered because of his evil. Freddy was part human and part devil. He looked as if hell had just spit out a soul so far gone that even Satan himself wouldn't want him around. Freddy wasn't just some random man burned in a fire. He was a child molester, a child rapist and a butcher. He cut little kids up into pieces because he enjoyed it. He hunted teenagers in their dreams because that's when they were at their weakest. Trapped and alone he could victimize them for his pleasure and steal away their souls to keep for himself. He felt no guilt in seeking revenge against the vigilante mob who killed him because he felt no guilt for anything he had done. He had no conscience and no humanity at all. None of that is conveyed in Freddy's face when you watch this remake. None of it. He looks like a burn victim. So what? No offense to burn victims but I mean in a horror movie sense, big deal.Why should Robert England have played Freddy again? Who the hell else looks and sounds like England? Who? Robert England is beyond a shadow of a doubt the reason A Nightmare On Elm Street became an iconic horror series and why the character of Freddy became a legend. If anyone else had played Freddy in the original film it would have been just another horror movie and undoubtedly would have been forgotten. Take away his facial structure, his stature, his walk, voice, laugh and attitude and what's left? A guy in some make-up. Unless you put England in that make-up, you loose Freddy and by default you loose the feel of the movie.Why is the rest of the cast so bad? Bland, forgettable faces and downright terrible performances. The main cast consists of emo looking actors and plain Jane looking actresses who come across as though they couldn't care less about their performances. The cast here is the epitome of what's wrong with the current crop of actors and Hollywood in general. I could go on about the so called ""talented"" young cast but hey, who has that much time to waste? Overall this movie is boring, badly paced and quite simply a very lame attempt at remaking a classic. It's a reboot alright but unfortunately no one was smart enough boot it right into the trash. People will call me a purist, overly critical, a movie snob, a fan boy and so on. You know what? Those people can knock themselves out because I for one am sick of watching Hollywood ruin classic films so they can turn a quick buck and hide the fact that they haven't had an original script since the late nineties.If this kind of crap is the best Hollywood can come up with and the masses want to flock in to have their brains thoroughly washed out that's fine. Just don't expect me to bend over and say ""thank you sir may I have another"" because it's not going to happen.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
353,lindsaytomcat,Not nearly as bad as a lot of reviews...,7,3 March 2012,"I watch a lot of horror flicks & have since I was a little kid. Admittedly I was never a big fan of the Nightmare series (I always preferred the other classics like Friday the 13th & Halloween) and that may have influenced my opinion of this remake some. I didn't appreciate any of the other remakes which is why it took me so long to see this one. Personally I thought it was decent - in a way it almost felt like it could have been a different movie altogether and not a part of the nightmare saga. Perhaps the loss of Robert Englund helped with that feeling, although this Freddy was good.I think the biggest reason it felt like an altogether different movie though was because it actually made sense and was in chronological order. One reason why I didn't like the Nightmare franchise as much as others is because I always felt like they used the ""dream state"" thing to fill plot holes and bend reality and I hated when you couldn't tell if someone was dreaming or not. The whole ""good, I'm awake - oops, just kidding!"" scenario was used and abused in the originals, as were the sudden flashback sequences and nonsensical dream world. What I liked about this movie, however, is that its always clear when they have slipped into a dream and it moves in consequential order while they figure out what is going on. Another element I liked is that they did slip in a lot of famous scenes and rhetoric from the original, which at least pleased me as a fan. That's not to say there aren't bad points or plot holes (like did they ever explain why Freddy came back when he did, unless I just missed it) but altogether I thought they did a great job with this film and its well worth watching for someone that who wasn't a huge fan of the original movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
354,jbbeverley,"A Few Nice Shots Here And There, But An Epic Failure",3,18 October 2011,"As someone in his mid-thirties, I grew up with the original NOES films. I can remember seeing the first two films sometime in 1986 while at a friend's house. Back then, renting VHS videos wasn't that old a concept, and the idea of renting a couple scary flicks with my buddy and his older brother was quite the adventure to me. I know that a lot of people set out to hate this film. They wanted to hate it. To be candid, I didn't want to hate it at all. I sat down to watch it with as open a mind as once could have. However, much like all the other ""re-imaginings"" that have come out in the last decade or better, I found this attempt at NOES to be nothing more than a quickly thrown together attempt to make money. For starters, there is virtually no character development at all. We are introduced to a kill scene immediately, and the follow-up kills are not only half-ass thrown together, but poorly executed. I have seen better special effects in no budget indie horror than the FX used for Dean's death scene. It's an utter insult to my intelligence. A four inch steak knife goes plunging into his neck and rips across from side to side, and all we see is a trickle of blood? Come one! Likewise, Kris' death pales in comparison to Tina's death scene in the original, and yet the industry has had 25+ years to compete with it, if not top it. I won't dissect the other kills, but all I can say is that they were a disappointment. For a film cast with some great talent, I was let down by the delivery. Rooney Mara is a great actress, but comes off as a powerless mute in this film. She doesn't seem to have any sense of herself until the final scene, and by then it is too little, too late for the viewer. Likewise, Jackie Earle Haley and Clancy Brown are both seasoned veteran actors.. both amazing in their own right. Yet, Clancy has a virtual non-existent role in this film, and Jackie Earle Haley's take on Freddy has him coming off like a mongoloid with a speech impediment rather than a vicious killer. I know, I know.. ""You're just biased because Robert Englund was Freddy for so long!"" - YES I AM. No one on Earth could play Krueger besides Robert, and to be candid.. had the producers wanted to make this film at least watchable, they SHOULD have cast Englund in his most notable role. At least then it might have been on-par with some of the worse original sequels. I was impressed with a few of the shots that they used, and I enjoyed some of the holes they filled in this time around that were too risky to emphasize in the original. The molester aspect was cleverly inserted, and Freddy's human death scene weren't horrible, but by and large this film was the rushed out product of a studio trying to capitalize on a name. Much like the re-imaginings of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, Last House On The Left, Friday The 13th, and others, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake falls way short of what it could have been. Not only as a fan of the original series, but as a fan of horror films in general, I couldn't dare to give this film more than 3 out of 10 stars.. and I think that is being very generous. So long as the studios keep butchering classics (what next? JAWS? The Exorcist?)there will be plenty of room for disappointment. If you want to see modern-looking kids with laptops, cell phones, and Emo haircuts being stalked by a mongoloid who isn't scary at all, then surely check this film out. However, if you want to be scared and moved, I suggest you either stick to the original, or you let Freddy sleep.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

No, I'm not against movie remakes; I actually look forward to them and enjoyed many of them. And even though I love horror films, I'm not a purist (yes, I loved Halloween III- there, I said it!).But come on! It doesn't take a horror fan boy to realize this NOES remake is simply a horrible, horrible experiment gone bad, and NOT in a good way! I can only imagine the brainstorm they must have had when deciding to remake NOES. ""People, what can we do to butcher ---- hrrrr ---- redo NOES""? *********** SPOILERS ************* JOE: Oh I know!

Let's use a shorter guy instead, and... oh, while we're at it: make him look like a melted weazle, and feed him cheesy dialogue lines.MARC: Dan, you can't stop there! You know what we should do to make sure the fans really dislike him? Make him a pedophile.DAN: Are you sure Marc? I mean, this is a drastic change...

I think I wasn't scared because I grew up on the old versions and the fact that the story is too absurd to take seriously.The guy who played Freddy Kruger was very good I think. He was a little creepy and not over the top like the old version. All in all, a decent reboot. One thing which was a bit silly was the attempt to make sure that there was going to be a sequel.

359,katherine_stears,"Movies Suck: Come on, guys it wasn't THAT bad...well...alright, maybe it was.",3,23 June 2010,"Before we begin, I just thought I should share that when I saw the previews for this movie I was NOT particularly excited about it. Remakes don't usually bedazzle me, and I've become so jaded about my beloved horror genre that I really found myself with nothing to look forward to. So maybe my judgment of this movie was a bit harsh because of all the predetermined hate I had for it when I got in the theater. It was especially upsetting when I heard that Robert Englund wasn't going to be playing Freddy for the first time since these movies started coming out. But when I found out that Jackie Earle Haley - also known as Rorschach for all you Watchmen fans - was going to be playing instead, I was stoked. I personally loved Haley's work in Watchmen so I got pretty excited. But now here it is; my actual review.First of all, I have my suspicions as to why Englund opted not to play Krueger again. My guess is he probably read the script. The writing was horrible, but then again maybe it was just the acting. Apparently their idea of ""remaking"" this movie meant, ""take everything that was wrong with the original and put serious emphasis on that. Start with the cheesy acting."" I hated hated HATED the cast. Now Freddy specifically didn't bother me too much. Like I said, I'm kind of a new fan of Haley, and one of the things I loved most about him in Watchmen was his voice. His voice is so throaty and raspy and deep that every time he speaks you can't help but worry a little for your personal safety. And in this movie, everything he said seemed to have an other- worldly echo (might have been special effects, might have just been the settings he was in, or my own wild imagination), and it definitely added to the Freddy-creepy factor. But it was a double-edged sword; Freddy's personality in the remake is so different than what the original was. It was a difference I liked, and understood, and it really made me look at the character in a new light, but I'm not sure I was overall comfortable with such a dramatic change. Haley was definitely a great horror villain. I'm just not sure if he was a good Freddy Kreuger.As far as the scariness of the movie goes, let's just say Regal Theater really blew it out of proportion. They were checking IDs at the door but I honestly think my 8-year-old sister would have watched that movie and gone, ""What is this?"" The movie relied much too heavily on cheap, sudden shock tactics for my taste. I like suspense. But the movie just wouldn't allow for the kind of time to build up all that; They were too busy building up little resolves of almost suspense and then BOOM! Heeeeere's Freddy!Overall the movie was definitely not worth the nine dollars and fifty cents I spent to go watch it. But I was really glad to see Haley in a horror movie, and I hope he sticks the genre for a little while longer. I also hope he avoids remakes in the future, particularly ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" remakes.This review was edited for length and content.

I seriously don't know why, but I had my hopes up for this movie, yet I was immediately disappointed. Everything bugged me about this movie. One thing was it's boring, over-used formula for kill scenes:Idiot hears noise, idiot unnecessarily investigates noise by going out of safe house with no shoes and only a torch for protection, idiot walks to destination, ""Oh, it was nothing!"" Idiot thinks everything is safe and BOO! Freddy jumps out and kills idiot.Another thing that truly enraged me was the certain shot-for-shot scenes from original movies. The bathtub scene: From the first movie. Shot in the exact same place as before with the exact same outcome. Freddy's shape coming out of the wall in the bedroom: From the first movie. Better graphics ""That'll make it scarier!"" than the original movie. Same outcome. Running up the stairs scene: From the first movie. Person runs up stairs and steps in goo on the way, and also the final scene where Freddy comes out into the real world: This is from the idea of 6th Freddy movie: Freddy's dead. So since not many people remembered that, they copied it too.I hope your learning something about this, or about Michael Bay.

363,TheGame111073,"Not as good as the original but better than some of the sequels,",4,23 November 2010,"The new version of A Nightmare on Elm St offers some deeper insight into the character of Freddie Kruger. This new version actually builds on the origins of Freddie as none of the previous ""Nightmare"" movies never did. The old ""Nightmare"" films simply covered Freddie origins through word of mouth from other characters on screen. Although, the word of mouth story telling of Freddie's origins added to his the boogeyman's mystic, it clearly was something that needed to be shown. The 2010 Nightmare on Elm St deep into his origin. The movie connects many of the little details that were associated with Freddie. From his clothes, to his choice of weapons, to the classic child's song linked with Freddie. Within a series of flashbacks, we are able to bear witness to the tragic death of the former child molester. This movie actually illustrates the details of his demise. It also addresses in greater detail the connection between the victims in the original movie and Freddie, especially between Freddie and Nancy.The 2010 version of A Nightmare on Elm St reverts Freddie to more of his sinister ways of the original movie. The new movie reverts him to the ""monster"" that he was intended to be. It eliminates the campy aspect that Freddie had attained in many of the sequels. The movie tries to incorporate the ""blood and guts"" of today's horror movies with the scare factor of the movies of old. It does bring a level of realism to the story that the old movies never had. In addition, it incorporates some of the classic scenes from the original.The problem is that by increasing the level of realism it eliminates some of the creative ways that Freddie would kill his victims. That was a trademark of the original Nightmare movies. This film falls to connect the fact that Freddie stalks for one. He takes pleasure in the stalking of his victims. This movie doesn't do that. Most of the stalking isn't there and the kills are too quick and uncreative. The stalking and terrifying his victims was the real pleasure for Freddie not the killing. This movie falls to understand that important fact. Increasing his victims fear and was the source of Freddie's pleasure and power. This was never more clear than in the first movie as at the end of it, Freddie is powerless because Nancy doesn't fear him anymore.Jackie Earl Haley does an admirable job in donning the mantle of Freddie Kruger. He doesn't have Robert England's ""swag"" but he makes this version of Freddie more vicious than Englund ever was. Robert Englund made Freddie one of the truly great horror characters of all time. He was the perfect combination of terror with a little comedy mixed in. No one could ever surpass his portrayal of this character. He single handily carried almost all of the ""Nightmare"" movies as after Nancy there was never a co star that could measure up. Jackie Earl Haley does come close. He doesn't have Englund's pungent for sarcasm as Englund always had the right lines for his timely killings. Haley on the other hand makes Freddie more brutal but he eliminates his personality. Through Haley's portrayal of Freddie we feel the rage and anger that Freddie carries within from being murdered but we never get the sense of enjoyment that Englund's Freddie got from killing his victims. Haley does try to add his own trademarks to the character such as the constant twitching of the knives as he stalks his victim. Haley's approach to Freddie adds a brutality that Englund never matched. Rooney Mara's depiction of the character of Nancy was no where near Heather Langenkamp's prior depiction. She didn't exhibit the strength or toughness that Langenkamp's performance of Nancy had. It was clearly a detractor in this iteration.This new retelling of one of our beloved childhood horror stars isn't as bad as it was the first time I watched this. My expectations prior to seeing this movie are the main contributors for my disappointment of it. I had such lofty expectations when I heard that there was another Nightmare on Elm St coming out, only to be presented with another damn re-imagining instead of a prequel or a sequel. For those of us who grew up with the Nightmare on Elm St movies this was simply an outrage. However, If we can separate ourselves from our emotional connection to the character of the 80's, then this movie wasn't that bad. It gives us a really good look at the origin of Freddie and it granted us a great deal of clarity into the relationship between Freddie and Nancy. It clearly wasn't what I expected but it was no where near as bad as it initially was the first time I watched it. This movie is a worthy addition to the previous ""Nightmare"" films. Compared to some to the sequels, it's actually better than a many of them in a lot of ways. Fans of Freddie should watch this without prejudging and give it a chance.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

YES, I have seen the original 1984 version and I love it (not the sequels) considering it's old and some special effects are laughable.Now that, THAT is out of the way. I must admit I was a little upset a remake was being made. With all the remakes of movies being made left and right and most of them being made poorly, I refused to see this movie. After 9 years I found it on my prime subscription and with nothing to do I took a deep breath and pressed play.I missed nothing avoiding it for 9 years and could've easily done without ever watching it. I'll give it to them trying to explain more about Freddy's origins but I don't know, I guess the way the whole movie was executed, it turned out to be a complete dud, for me. Considering this version is modern and Hollywood has better special effects, It still didnt do the job of creeping me out the way the original did. I found myself rolling my eyes and shaking my head throughout the whole film.Some may say I'm biased because I viewed and enjoyed the original.

365,doucet_derrick,Completely Unmatched Potential,2,1 May 2010,"This movie shows how Hollywood Producers don't care for originality. The movie was predictable, and stayed the same throughout. If you like cheap, quick, and startling thrills non stop that don't scare and become incredibly predictable than this movie is for you. The beginnings shows promise as the guy kills himself thanks to Freddy's nightmare, but the other nightmares were all the same going back to the school. The movie lacked punch, and the creative genius of Wes Craven's Freddy Krueger. This movie had potential as Jackie Earle Hayley looked to add a real creepiness with his voice but as the movie dragged on and I mean dragged, he spoke too much that his voice became too much of an annoyance. If they would have dramatically reduce how much Freddy talked, he would have been creepier and more calculating. Also the dreaming awhile awake was a good addition but there was too much jump scares with that, it should have been subtle dreams which would have been scarier and not so predictable. This movie is another proof that remakes with all the potential are nearly always unmatched with Producers taking full control. Please allow for creative originality, and then the movies will undoubtedbly be better.

366,shaw-simon,Botched.,4,15 May 2010,"The original 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', very much like 'Jaws', was one of those films that really scarred the living hell out of me as a child and left a permanent movie imprint on my memory. Cast your minds back to the first 20 minutes of Wes Craven's 84' classic; the terrifying premise, the grotesque Freddy character design and the brutally violent 'Tina death scene' - its an astounding opening act and established a new horror franchise fully equipt with its own icon. And Freddy was THE eighties horror icon, as far as I was concerned, he was fear personified. That grim red striped jumper, the stetson hat, finger knives and of course, the melted flesh that constituted his face - there is certainly no reasonable equivalent in horror for today's generation. They just don't make boogie-men like that anymore.Despite the poor reception, I was always going to check this out, remakes cash in on your curiosity and I couldn't resist - my expectations were low and subsequently, I came out feeling that the cost for admission was justified - barely.This is less a faithful remake rather than a modern appropriation that plays it very very safe. It takes the premise of a deadly alter dream state (that just screams out for so many creative variants) and replicates the original's more iconic scenes with a workman-like verve and nothing else. We see the glove break the surface of the bath water and so on but new and memorable plays on the concept are disappointingly few. They could have gone to town with new and creative death sequences but have ignored the potential entirely.Changes have been made however, the biggest is with Freddy himself, the director has correctly identified that the villain is the movie's selling point and has gone on to fully explain his character. His motives and background are now understood - and whilst this sounds like an interesting idea, it actually removes all mystery, fear and intrigue from him. You'll have already noticed the make up effects now bare a more realistic resemblance to a burns victim, this again throws Fred Kruger into a more explainable / logical light.Remember Tina's first encounter with him in the original; before she actually see's him, she can hear his terrible sadistic laughing. He toys with her before ever revealing himself. There's this wonderful moment where a goat appears for absolutely NO REASON before he confronts her (this happens just 2 minutes into the film, you tube it). That tiny segment from the original has more validity and genuine fright than the entirety of this limp rendition where nothing is left to our imaginations.The choice differences, though largely ineffective, keep you watching. Kruger as a fully realised paedophile was perhaps a miss step but at least the film handles this new direction with some conviction. The young cast do an admirable job with a lumpen script and their drug abusing efforts to stay awake are convincingly handled. The opening scene in a neon lit diner (which is completely original) is an effective sequence and a rare example of success whilst deviating from the source material, elsewhere compliments are hard to raise.A Nightmare On Elm Street's biggest crime is how utterly devoid it is of genuine scares. There are some sequences designed to make you jump but they are so generically implemented you'll see them coming (bar one exception I won't spoil here). It is also an annoyingly loud picture, sound effects and music pummel you as if to compensate for everything the film itself isn't making you feel. As a horror film (and one that bares the name of a classic), this is a dis-service to the genre and one that only highlights the inadequacies of a debut director who seemingly has little understanding in how to scare his audience.There have been far worse horror remakes, this is another mediocre one that is already cleaning up at the box office; if you are still curious, there is some fun to be had here - just don't expect any sleepless nights.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Even though I'm somewhat of a purist, I'm open minded enough to adopt new approaches of tonal storytelling. This film started like a typical Elm St sequel (not a great thing), and then coasted into VERY familiar ground, rehashing the first movie with MINOR adjustments here and there. Because it did not offer enough new things to stand on it's own and avoid direct comparison w/ the first film, you pretty much new what was bound to happen from scene 2 till the end. Any adjustments that Strick made were so subtle, that it felt like his script was a revision to the 84' original, with zero deviations. One example being that there was question at one point whether or not Freddy was guilty of being an actual molester before his lynching, and that detail quickly turns on itself and becomes void. And the style of the movie didn't tread any new ground either (love the look of the new F13). I thought the worst part was Freddy himself... Almost any unknown could've played Krueger. I wanted to get excited about Haley's performance, but it felt like there just wasn't enough substance for him to work with. Boring, lazy re-hash.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
368,tylermoore,Didn't need to be made but superior to the original,6,18 September 2011,"Please hear me out on this. The original is a classic and was good for it's time. But it doesn't hold up like a lot of classic 80's horror films do. Now the original is laughably bad. But it's sort of it's own fault. The original Nightmare was made to cash in on the slasher genre and ended up sparking a pretty awesome concept. Now, this movie is no different. It is just cashing in on the Nightmare on Elm Street name. But, everything has a much more threatening tone. Freddy is actually well developed and I enjoyed seeing his story unfold. It was in no way perfect though. But much better then the development in the original which was nonexistent which may have been done for a reason, but didn't work as well. Now I must mention the thing that people didn't like is the jump scares. Which is annoying. The film is very loud on purpose and uses loud noises to make you jump. That is sort of lame. But, it's due to the atmosphere it provides that makes it work. Which is the only way I can defend that. The one thing I'll say the original did better was the music. All of the tracks in this soundtrack sound alike, just dark tones. Which I don't mind, I love Tyler Bates' music for Halloween, but this is just sort of lazy. Overall I enjoyed this much more then the original, but I can respect anything good about the original as well.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
369,general_zod4ever,Watch out for the Razzies on this one!!!,3,10 May 2010,"SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTAs most of the times, remakes only show pale versions of what originals are, and this one, unfortunately, makes no exceptions. I don't really understand why Hollywood has decided to remake all the classics, but this only shows the lack of imagination that screenwriters have nowadays. They do not invent, they only take a story that already exists and patch some changes here and there, and most of the time they remove the good stuff from the original and they patch the holes with details that are worth less (noting that I did not use the word ""Worthless"" because I am sure that they have put some time writing and that they probably have some producers breathing down their necks to come up with something quick to make money fast).In the new take of A Nightmare On Elm Street, a lot of the good murders were removed. Nancy's boyfriend does not get pullet in his own bed (he gets slashed by Freddy right after Freddy gets pulled out of Nancy's dream... the bed scene is so much better!!). In Nightmare 2010 the wild boyfriend (his name is Rod in the original film) slits his throat in a restaurant (In the original he gets hung by Freddy... making it look like a suicide). In the new one, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub, Freddy's hand comes out of the water and she gets awaken before he reaches her and that's it (in the original, the bath scene is about the same, except that when she gets awaken, she falls right back into sleep and then Freddy really comes for her dragging her down in the tub which becomes bottomless and nearly drowns her before she finally wakes up).The list of changes goes on and on, and what is also a great disappointment is the fact that they lose their time (making us lose our time too) at trying to explain to us, by having Nancy and her boyfriend, investigating at who was Freddy Krueger when he was alive (It really was time consuming). In the original, Nancy has a two minute conversation with her mother that pretty much explains it all, giving the original movie time enough to have Nancy rig her house with a lot of booby traps for when she will pull Freddy out of her nightmare, and that was so cool... but, in the 2010 version, there is no such thing as a house with traps. In the original one, Nancy's father is the lieutenant, one of the parents who put Freddy on fire years before, someone who controls the police and probably managed to protect all the other parents from being prosecuted for murder, by altering the evidences and clues of Freddy Krueger's murder. In the new one, Nancy does not have a father, and the character that comes closest to the father character, is a school principal... LOLBottom line, if someone asks you to go see Nightmare On Elm Street in theatres, might I suggest you to go to the videostore and rent something a whole lot more better instead...

370,ilija-malinovic,Awful remake,3,31 July 2019,"What a terrible remake! This feels like someone trying to remake Harry Potter films, but without the magic - idiotic! They took the basic premise and built their movie around it, completely omitting stuff that made the original so great. There is no suspense, no dreams (seriously, who the hell makes a movie about nightmares without any nightmares), even the acting is not that great (except Katie Cassidy and Thomas Dekker, who both did a decent job). The only thing they did the same like the original is the ending, which I didn't like even then.I'm giving it 3 stars, 'cause if it was an independent movie, with no ties to nightmare franchise, I wouldn't be bored watching it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
371,becca-dietz,Great remake,8,26 October 2020,I mean I've watched the original every October for years and this remake is definitely better... I don't understand the negative reviews. I think the original has horrible acting and a rushed plot toward the end. This remake has a tighter plot and better effects. I now watch this remake every October over the original because it's just too boring/cheesy in comparison.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
372,wryterz,Good but only just about scratches the surface of the original.,6,25 August 2010,"Michael Bay has remade an array of classic horror films from the 80's and earlier, and out of the six remakes, this one turns out to be the weakest, but that doesn't mean this is a crap film. We all know the story about Freddy Krueger, ""the man with knives for fingers"" and how he haunts the dreams of a bunch of teenagers that live on Elm Street, Ohio. Yes we do, and this film is simply a vamped up version of Wes Craven's 1984 masterpiece.This film is definitely a creep-fest from start to finish and what works well is that the original soundtrack is filtered throughout the entire movie. Though it has its conventional and extremely predictable shock moments, this film still manages to make you jump out of your seat more than once with in-your-face and out-of-the-blue scares. Comparisons to the original are inevitable but what I would like to point out is that though many of the iconic scenes and scares are still present in this 92 minute film, it has some original moments of pleasure, though not many. Where the Wes Craven film was haunting in a simple, low budget way, this film is eerie by the way of better effects and tastier sets.My friend said that ""Freddy Krueger was spot on and that the element of the back-story and its execution were poor"". I disagree completely. Unlike the Rob Zombie remake of Halloween, where he spent at least half of the movie in young Michael Myers territory, director Samuel Bayer only touches on why Freddy is the nightmare man, yet he brings with it a complete picture of who and what this freaky serial killer is really all about. People say the flashbacks are pointless, I complete disagree...again. Showing what happens to good old Fred back in the day, in my mind, was a good idea, and one of the movies few major highlights. The acting from the main cast is ""generally"" good as a matter of fact, but the film fails to appoint a main character and before you know it, three people are already dead and you don't even know what the rest of the cast are all about. Character development is out of the window in this film and that's unfortunate because half the time you are wondering who was that and should we care? What I liked about this story was how the writers touch upon sleep deprivation and how hallucination kicks in within extreme situations. Also, we know from the original that Freddy is taking his revenge on the children of the people who killed him (seen as though he was a child murderer originally) but in this one, the writers have gone one step further and given Freddy maybe a slightly better and more logical a motive than in the original, which is a plus point. And we have a clearer understanding of why he didn't just kill the kids when they were younger and easier prey, as in maybe a year earlier. The death scenes in this are carbon copies of the original, or least two of them are. The famous Blondie-in-the-bed-who-gets-whacked-around looks smoother thanks to today's technology yet at the same time it is somewhat brief and disappointing. There are predictable scares, like I mentioned before but death scene number three is so sudden and so poor, you beg for Freddy's Knives to go to a sharpening machine and get a service or an upgrade perhaps. However, because the opening murder is so gruesome and quite simply amazingly disgusting, by the time you get to the end, you realise that it actually goes downhill from the opening scene in terms of blood and gore. The 'jist' of the story is exactly the same as the original with certain tweaks here and there but if you begin to compare this far too much you may find yourself snoring. But then again, the out-of-the-blue jumps are always there to snap you back into the awake zone.The CGI on Freddy's face and the make-up look awful, which is a good thing, because it looks like he really is a burn victim, but even with the help of a voice distorting device, Jackie Earle Haley just isn't Robert Englund, at all. Yes, the original Freddy might seem comical now and it's true the new one does look very creepy, but Robert Englund brought a certain finesse to Mr. Krueger that cannot be recreated by anyone and therefore this is mainly why this film isn't as good as maybe it should be. The Freddy Song is also in the background, but it's not really touched upon much and therefore may go unnoticed. The build up to Freddy appearing isn't given sufficient time and therefore some scenes seem rushed though there are plenty of moments to at least satisfy a majority of the public. And then of course there is the very predictable end scene - sequel anyone? Been there, done that!!!FINAL VERDICT: The film is good, for one viewing at least as it really does have some nerve-tingling, seat-bopping scares and I feel the script has more logic to it but I can assure you this is not a good remake. The cheesy lines at the end aren't real cheese therefore you'll forgive the script and though they've been panned, I think the actors were good though they definitely needed more scope for their characters. Though Haley isn't a terrible Freddy, he isn't really a great one either. But because he's been dormant for so long, it seems as though Freddy's knives are not as sharp as they used to be. No Pun intended!6/10 - Good",A Nightmare on Elm Street
373,werner-891-410144,as always...,4,15 January 2021,"WHY do they always have to do remakes from good movies?The original A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic. And it (well, more the sequels) had a lot of funny moments in it.
The remake tries to be a horror movie with a Freddy Kruger whos face looks like a disfigured animal.No shocking sequences (although the only 'horror-moments' in this ARE the jump-scares...I'd rather prefer a low-budget movie with a good story over this.By this time, about 100000 people decided, this is a 5.2 movie.
Maybe this opens the minds of the movie makers...or they do a remake of Star Wars and see what happens ;)",A Nightmare on Elm Street
374,MovieLad26,A Nightmare for the box-office and for the fans,1,28 January 2011,"A long time ago, or at least what seems like a long time ago, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" hit theatres in 1984. For a lot of movie-goers who were into the slasher genre which was at its hype at the time, this film followed the formula but with an added twist: A killer who only kills in people's dreams. This opened up a lot of possibilities as to how Fred ""Freddy"" Kreuger would tear apart his victims. The film had it's perks, and due primarily to the fact that this film took on an original idea (which is ironic because they did it to cash in on the slasher genre), the film was a success. The movie spawned 6 more sequels and a spin-off, pitting Freddy against ""Friday the 13th"" villain, Jason Voorhees. With the exception of the second film in the franchise, all the sequels were actually half-descent. Freddy became a pop-culture icon, and the Freddy Kreuger name was now known across the world. Robert Englund played Freddy to a tee. He was so lovable, and so devilishly evil that to hear he wasn't going to play Freddy anymore (He has played him since the first film all the way to Vs. Jason), it was like a slap to the face with the trademark glove...without the followed ""Cool! I got hit with the glove!"" In 2010, a remake of the original film was released, and needless to say, we weren't stoked in the least bit. Fans all over were sceptical by the idea of both a remake, and a recasting for Freddy. Gone was Englund, and in the red and green striped shirt was Jackie Earle Haley. An interesting choice. My mind gave him the green light when I heard that Robert Englund himself gave him his blessing, and passed down the torch. And so, I waited until it came out on DVD, and gave it a watch.The idea of re-creating the atmosphere of the original alone made me worry-some. Freddy's voice was not the same at all. I'm all for updating the image a bit, but Freddy looked like a fish. A horribly burnt, scarred fish. The cast weren't as appealing as the original, and for me, that made me want to see them die a lot faster, but Freddy's glove wouldn't be enough. The acting was bland, the character development was weak, and the humour was gone. I don't mean to kick a dead horse, but this film sucked the big one. I wasn't going to be easily mesmerized by the flashy kills, and supposedly ""hot"" girls. The storyline is a bit different from the original, or at least plot elements are. Some pivotal scenes are missing, and it just raises too many questions. The micro-sleep thing was actually a good idea. Yeah! Something good came of this film, but it wasn't conveyed very effectively, and instead just made the film feel like it was being dragged on. For a franchise that has received so much love, you'd think that a remake would be unnecessary. But not to Hollywood, I guess. And so, another pointless, stupid remake goes down the drain, and my patience goes as well.1/10. Very, poor choice. Only to cash in one the ""Nightmare"" franchise. Dear Hollywood: Have you no shame?",A Nightmare on Elm Street
375,SleepKills,Welcome to my nightmare,1,18 October 2010,"In the early '80s Wes Craven changed something in horror cinema with his film 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. It contained an original premise and Craven broke a lot of boundaries. Now, 30 years later, they don't do that anymore. They don't try something original. They just use an old formula that worked in the past and .. do it again. Like with A Nightmare on Elm Street. The remake.So a character starts to fall asleep. Suddenly the location changes, the character starts walking around saying 'hello?' every five seconds, Freddy pops up as we hear a loud sound effect and the character is awake again. You can imagine this working for one scene, but A Nightmare on Elm Street keeps repeating that little gimmick over and over again. Does it grow old fast? Yes. To be honest, the opening of the film, just before the title is shown, isn't that bad. But having to see copies of that scene for the next 85 minutes is just boring as hell.And you know what else is boring? The characters. Oh my god, how dull are those characters. The original film contained some very interesting main characters. People we cared about, people we wanted to see make it out alive. It's not a Friday the 13th, where we just want to see the characters get hacked up as soon as possible. Yet in the remake we get some really forgettable and boring people to look at. And one of the worst is the woman who plays Nancy's mother. Remember that amazing scene in the original where Ronee Blakley tells her daughter about Freddy Krueger. Well, here you get a woman that is so blank, it's almost scary. Like the part of the mother didn't matter, so they gave the role to an extra.So the remake is nothing like the original, you would say. Well, not exactly. We get a lot of scenes that are literally copied from the original. So does that make the movie at least a little bit better? No. Remember that incredible scene in the original where Freddy slowly appears from the bedroom wall. Keep that in mind while looking at that horrible CGI thing coming out of the wall here. Man, how can they still have those kind of special effects in 2010? I mean, look at the flashback scene, where a burning Freddy is running towards the camera. But it's not just the special effects, there seems to be a big lack of creativity as well. Just look at the kills, have you ever seen anything so uninspired and boring? You have a murderer who can do ANYTHING and this is what you come up with? It makes me think back at the good old days where Chuck Russell made Freddy kill Phillip in Nightmare 3. Now that's creativity! So let's go on to one of the most important elements of the film: Freddy. I was actually pleased to hear that Jackie Earle Haley was going to be Freddy. But even a great performer like Jackie can't safe this. I mean, the half CGI make-up just takes away every bit of charisma Freddy had. The man suddenly only has one facial expression the entire film and talks like Sylvester Stallone. Just listen to that monotone voice that shows no threat whatsoever. I think Haley did a fine job with what he had to work with, but seeing this film I really started to miss those sadistic, teasing little laughs and amazing screams and puns Englund gave the character.I also don't understand what the people at Platinum Dunes wanted with the character. They told the fans many times they wanted to get rid of the one-liner shouting clown and go to the scary and dark Freddy. Well, I don't want to ruin your party, but your Freddy ONLY talks in one-liners. And to make things worse, you couldn't even come up with one-liners yourself and so you mainly used one-liners from the other films. Why doing a remake if you want to keep the character exactly the same? And then there's one thing I don't get; with the one-liners and the many, MANY references to the original film, why the hell didn't you just give Robert Englund a cameo? Wouldn't it be fun seeing him as the reverend, the teacher or that pharmacist- guy? But I can imagine you were too busy to ask him for a cameo. Too busy writing a horrible script.And what makes the script so horrible, you may ask? Simple; the back-story of Freddy is completely insane. I mean, in the original you could understand why the parents did what they did. Wouldn't you try and stop a serial killer if he was set free and you know your children are in danger or you know he killed your children? In this film, on the other hand, the adult parents burn a guy alive after hearing a few stories from their very young kids. That makes sense. Even one of the characters brings this up in the film, why the hell would adult, normal people burn a guy just based on stories their kids told them? A legitimate question. Still waiting for a satisfying answer. Oh, and by the way; why did Freddy have a glove in the first place? Since when do you need a glove with knives attached to the fingers when taking pictures of little girls naked? So yeah, this film is indeed awful. Platinum Dunes did an OK job on The Texas Chainsaw and I even enjoyed the Friday remake. But here they screwed up big time. The musical score is OK and Haley is doing the best he can, but otherwise this film is bad. It's contains boring characters, awful writing, bad special effects and a horrible version of one of the best characters in horror cinema ever.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
376,texasthunderhawk,Not as good as the original. But still a fine film.,7,1 May 2010,"We should probably get one thing, probably the biggest thing out of the way first: It's not as good as the original. But then again, few remakes are ever as good as the original.Now once you get that clear in your mind, you'll find that this new version of Nightmare is still a good movie on it's own merits. It has some good ""jump"" scares (plenty of people in the audience I was in managed to jump out of their skins here and there) and it has the required gore (though not as much as you'd imagine). The CGI used in this film does a good job of creating the blur between reality and dreams. And contrary to most opinions, I found Jackie Earl Haley's version of Freddy more frightening then the joke-a-minute Robert Englund (though I still love that version). He's much more menacing. A truly threatening presence.The overall story hasn't changed much. It still revolves around Freddie Kruger, a man accused of terrorizing children, being hunted down and burned alive by a lynch mob of angry parents. Only Freddie didn't exactly die. Instead, he becomes a bogeyman in the dreams of the children he was accused of harming, who are now teenagers. And the simple terror formula is also the same: If Freddie kills you in your sleep, you're dead for real.There are only a few plot variations from the original that make this film sort of a mystery as well as a horror story. And there are a few, well placed references to the original series.When compared to Rob Zombie's woeful ""Halloween"" remakes and the decent but blah ""Friday the 13th"" reboot, this is a far better working and if you just sit back and watch the film, you might actually enjoy it!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

378,destroyyourevil,Turning Back the Nightmares,7,22 October 2010,"The summary was right: they did re-imagine Freddy Krueger. I can see a big difference between Robert and Jackie as Freddy. Even though this was copying a ground-breaking movie and it excited me, there may have been problems.I understand that as a series goes on, things get boring and repetitive. Because this is a reboot, I found the new storyline a little complex at first. In both the original and the reboot, Freddy was bad from the start. Like the other slasher movies I've seen, I was disappointed that all the other supporting characters died.With today's technology for movies, everything looks more realistic. Much detail was put into Freddy's disfigured face. and beaten sweater. As for personality, Jackie made Freddy demonic. What didn't go away though, is Freddy's sense of amusement. I wouldn't say i liked for the gore.When I watched it alone, the suspense got me going. I knew my heart accelerated, thinking at any moment, he'll pop up. The very end told me Freddy was still out there, possibly in other forms. But I forced a laugh seeing him defeated. Every bit was just startling.For this movie, I liked how the suspense pumped me with adrenaline, making me feel alive, the make-up and detail, and the cast. I disliked the blood splattering and how the attacks can be torturing. The new Freddy Krueger is my kind of villain even though I'm not willing to own a copy.

They bring the classics to the people of this generation where we can actually watch them without laughing. I tried to watch the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" from the 1980's and it was laughable. The acting was bad, the blood was so fake it looked like juice, and the dialog was so bad a 3rd grader could have written it. This, however, was smart, scary, suspenseful, gory, surprising, and a great movie all together. Yes, it is a remake, and yes, i liked it a lot more than the original. It stuck to the original without completely copying it. It had enough new material to keep it fresh, but was still faithful to the original.

380,booboobolhuis,Not even sure this counts as Horror......May contain Spoilers!!!,1,13 October 2010,"I have to start out by saying that if you rented this DVD, take it back immediately and DO NOT subject yourself to this travesty! I do not know how you can take something that was so good and just needed a little modern updating and destroy it so thoroughly. Either way that is exactly what has been done with this movie.First off why was Robert Englund not in this movie? No one can replace him as Freddy and he is still an excellent actor (ex. ""2001 Maniacs"", ""Hatchet"" but please exclude ""Zombie Strippers"" from the list). This ""new"" Freddy is just laughable. Every time he spoke a line I cringed, not from fear mind you but from the raspy whine of a voice he used. Compared to the other actors he seemed rather short (height wise) to me and not so threatening. This remake should of been assigned to Wes Craven again or offered at least to Rob Zombie who has become very good at remaking the Halloween movies.To sum it up and to voice my other complaints the movie and storyline was rushed, the characters were hollow and unrelatable and honestly I was rooting for them to die just so I wouldn't have to suffer the pain of this experience any longer. The only fresh face I saw and was happy to see her in a horror movie but saddened it had to be this disaster was Connie Britton. Even Kellan Lutz who I think is making his way through Hollywood nicely couldn't help this movie.

381,colin-883-72549,Pretty Cruddy,4,30 October 2010,"I want to give this a 3.5 but it isn't an option.Jackie Earle Haley is a good actor, so when I heard he was Freddy for the remake, I figured this could be a good reimagining of the franchise.While there were LOTS of problems with this movie - nowhere near as good as the Halloween remake when the original Halloween wasn't as good as the original Nightmare - I found that one of the main problems arose with Jackie Earle's choices (or direction) when it came to playing Freddy.Haley's Freddy comes across as a guy TRYING TO BE SCARY. In the first couple Nightmare movies, Robert Englund's Freddy just plain WAS scary.And a guy TRYING to be scary is like a guy TRYING to be funny. It just doesn't work.Haley just recycles his voice from Rorschach and while the make-up looks like legitimate burn scars...it just isn't scary to look at. Maybe Englund's prominent nose made his appearance scarier. I don't know... But this Freddy just came across as one of those bullies that would whimper away if actually punched.The plot is full of holes and illogical. Everyone's actions are poorly motivated if motivated at all.If there was a plot twist or suspense, I suppose it was meant to revolve around the issue of whether Freddy actually was a child molester during his earthbound day. Hmmmmm, what do you think? Will you be on the edge of your seat waiting for the big reveal here?Just rewatch the original from 1980 or so. It is superior on pretty much every level...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
382,hannahclac,Horrible remake,4,2 February 2020,"This is one of the worst, if not THE worst, remakes I have ever seen. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is my favorite horror film and Freddy Krueger is my favorite horror character so I had high expectations for this. I was really disappointed. I wasn't expecting it to be better than original because that wouldn't be possible, but I was expecting it to be a good remake.I suppose what I dislike most about this movie is the actor who was chosen to play Freddy. I just don't think anyone but Robert Englund can be Freddy. He is Freddy. He made the character what he is. Jackie Earle Haley is a good actor but he is not a good Freddy. The makeup didn't look right on him and his voice didn't fit the character, if that makes sense. If Hollywood remakes A Nightmare on Elm Street again, they need to cast an actor who can come close to Englund. An actor who can recreate how well Englund played him. If they can't do that then they need to leave it alone.I also very much dislike how they changed Freddy's origin story and made him a child molestor. It doesn't make Freddy scarier if that's what they were trying to accomplish. It was just unnecessary.They tried to recreate some of the most iconic scenes in the original like when Tina (renamed Kris) is murdered by Freddy while Rod (renamed Jesse) helplessly watches, but it just didn't work. That scene is much more horrifying in the original. The best part about this movie is Rooney Mara but even she couldn't save it. And although I like Rooney Mara, her acting in this isn't as good as her acting in other movies and she is certainly no Nancy. Heather Langenkamp was a much better Nancy. I think that's another flaw with this movie: the characters are just bland.Maybe I'm just being biased because I love the original so much or maybe this movie really does suck. I'm going with the latter. I give it a 4/10 (and that's me being generous) vs a 10/10 for the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
383,FionaGoode,Yet again Hollywood's lack of originality leads to a disgraceful remake.,4,30 April 2010,"This movie has maybe 10% of depth the original and even the entire series possessed. Crucial things such as plot,pace and back story are just non existent-result being not knowing or even caring about any of the characters, including the notorious Nancy. There is absolutely no suspense at all. I have seen Lifetime movies with more scares. What scares you do find are typical ""it gets quiet then a loud noise"" disgraces (You see Freddy in the first 5 minutes of the film, if that tells you anything). The shadowy build up of the original was just not even considered here.Don't even get me started on the CGI, it's terrible and looks like it cost no more than what Michael Bay pays for a typical lunch. The infamous scenes ( maybe two or three?) that are reused in this adaption last no more than a flash second and are so out of place they should have just been left out. Also the surreal 'dream world' of the original series, totally gone and removed, replaced by one semi appealing 'snow dream' and that is being polite. I fail to see how this movie is rated higher than pg13 there is just nothing there you don't see on every other crime drama past 8pm.Jackie is definitely no Robert but if you think of him as ""another version"" of Freddy, then he pulls it off pretty well, he just has absolutely nothing to work with and it's only his personal style and mannerisms that bring any quality to his character,his dialog and direction are just purely redundant.As for Nancy and all the rest of the cast, think Twilight and High School Musical, if Disney made horror movies, this would be one of them.For the younger generation,(and I am only 25) sure go watch this but make sure to take the time to watch the original, you will be blown away and I would hate to see it not rediscovered because of the moronic outcome of this adaption. I only give this movie 4 stars, for nostalgia and a hope that if they continue with this mess, it will switch hands (and maybe back into Cravens) Michael Bay and Platinum just stop already. The egotistical idea that you can improve on classic concepts from cartoons to films, has been proved (once again) to be impossible and offensive.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
384,NOLDaemon,This movie sucks!!,1,8 October 2011,"Out of all the movies Hollywood could butcher, I never thought they could ruin Elm St this badly.I loved the original Freddy movies. Even though it's been a while since I've seen them, I remember them being some of my favourite horror movies. However, I don't remember Freddy being a child molester. Even if it was hinted he was a child molester, that's not the picture I got of him. He was a child killer before he died, and a child killer after he died. In the new movie, Freddy was a child molester (NOT a killer) before he died, but turned into a child killer (NOT a molester) after he died. WTF??? Why did this sudden change of character occur? Nobody knows. They didn't have to create this plot hole, they could have made Freddy both a child molester & a killer. But Freddy didn't kill anyone until after his own death. Also, what made Freddy stop being a molester? Did he see the error of his ways after his own death? - What's the point of the Freddy claw? Freddy didn't cut the children while he was alive, and didn't even get the claw until after his death. Where did he get the claw from? What was the purpose of the claw? (These questions were answered in the original film) - The script failed to capture the basic plot of every Freddy movie. The premise is Freddy gains strength in 2 ways. By creating fear in his victims, and by having more victims to terrorize. (In the original movies, the only way Freddy could gain access to someone's dreams is if they were told about Freddy by someone who was already being haunted by Freddy.) This whole plot element was eliminated from the new movie.The original Freddy had a sense of humour, and enjoyed killing his victims. He would use people's weaknesses against them. (Such as killing a drug addict with needles) The new Freddy has no fun, and doesn't personalize any kills. He uses the same boring claws every time.I remember more of the plot line from the original movie I saw 20 years ago than new movie I saw last night.The Freddy mask was the most popular horror mask of its generation. Not only does the new mask look worse, but who wants to be a child molester for Halloween? That's not how you build a good merchandising brand.Why remake a movie if you're going to change or eliminate everything good about the old movies? Not because the changes make the story better or give a new twist on old ideas. The changes only serve to create plot holes or ruin what was a very good story (by horror movie standards). They managed to take a likable killer and turn him into a boring creepy pedophile.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
385,Rick_Gershman,"Incredibly disappointing, a slap in the face to true horror fans",2,30 April 2010,"Picture the 1984 horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now picture that film if it was produced by bombastic Michael Bay, director of Pearl Harbor and the Transformers films. Now picture all of the worst possible outcomes of that marriage.You don't have to. You could just plunk down your hard-earned cash – better yet, don't – for this lame remake.Not that I can stop you from seeing it. No number of bad reviews (and this will be just one of many) would have kept me away. Curiosity alone demanded I see the new Elm Street, so when a critic buddy asked if I'd like to tag along to a screening, I did.I mean, it couldn't be awful, right? It's a darker take on a character that had fallen into parody. Its screenplay was co-written by Wesley Strick, who has worked with Martin Scorsese (1991's Cape Fear). And supernatural killer Freddy Krueger is played by Jackie Earle Haley, an Oscar-nominated actor who was so creepy as Rorschach in Watchmen. How bad could it be?Really bad, it turns out. Astonishingly, amazingly, how-could-you- possibly-screw-this-up-any-worse bad.Samuel Bayer, a longtime music video director making his feature-film debut, accomplished his stated goal of draining away all the cheeky fun of the Freddy films. Unfortunately, he also drained away all the scares. What's left is a dreary, poorly-lit slog with uninteresting characters, wooden acting and a complete lack of tension, suspense or energy.We could spend all day talking about the problems, but two big ones sink this new Nightmare all on their own.The first is the new Freddy – he's not scary at all. (Robert Englund's original Freddy at least was creepy for a couple of films before falling into camp.) Haley's tiny frame makes Freddy look puny and his voice sounds like an even-more-ridiculous take on the raspy Christian Bale ""Batman"" voice.Haley's not helped by the terrible new Freddy makeup, which presumably is supposed to look like a more ""realistic"" burn victim, but it robs him of any expression. Freddy's not scary; worse, he's not even interesting.You'd expect the new Nightmare to provide some creative new ""kills,"" but that's the second huge problem. There are only a handful of kills throughout, and the better ones are taken directly from the 1984 original. In fact, fans of the original will note several virtually- identical scenes, all of them done on a higher budget but without a whit of artistry.Special note has to be made of the acting, which (with a couple of exceptions) is dreadful. I'll blame Bayer, because a few of these folks have been decent in other things, but they're laughable here. (I'm pretty sure Thomas Dekker was attempting to portray Casey Affleck if Casey Affleck had suddenly completely forgotten how to act. And he's one of the better ones.)Of all the leads, only Kyle Gallner manages to bring some desperately- needed personality and humor to the proceedings. Gallner single-handedly makes the final act interesting, since you'll have wanted every other character dead from the opening minutes.But he can't overcome Bayer's clueless direction, which telegraphs every shock and dream sequence from a mile away. One of the most effective elements of an Elm Street film is the subtle slide back and forth from the real world to the dream world. Bayer doesn't get this at all. Every dream sequence is clearly defined, completely destroying any suspense.The film spends two-thirds of its running time having its leads uncover Freddy's ""story,"" which is ridiculous because it's a story everyone already knows. It momentarily plays with a slight twist on the original plot – a second of creativity, emerging like a flower through a crack in the sidewalk – then immediately chucks it.Don't get me wrong: I love horror films. I don't even ask too much of them. I only ask that they be either A) scary or B) fun. If they can be both, that's awesome.But with none of A and far too little of B, the new Elm Street barely rises above an F.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
386,LadyDerpyCritic,You dream of a comeback only for it to be a nightmare,2,8 October 2021,"I know this wouldn't be much of a review if I just said it was okay, plain and simple. This movie could have had potential if it was just fleshed out, executed better, and the casting choice could have been changed... In this movie, they just look absolutely depressed, edgy- call them The Emo Kids on Elm Street. They had no emotions in their character other than feeling traumatized, confused, and angry. Also, the characters are out of place and some are new that we don't even know who they even are! That is my only problem with this movie, well, another problem is that they made Freddy Krueger waaay too messed up as well! I know that the movie was trying to lean towards the darker side of Freddy in the remake, that is what I am seeing out of it but no... They utterly made his character even more sick and twisted. He doesn't even shoot any funny one liners like Robert England's version of Freddy does during his kills.I will only give this movie credit on special effects, I guess however, Jackie Earle Hayley did do well for scary meters but as I said, he just could not pull the dark comedic Freddy that we all knew and loved. If I were you, this movie is only good if you are bored and want to watch the whole franchise of A Nightmare On Elm Street. Other than that, if you are a long time fan of Freddy Krueger, a lot of others would probably say to stay away from this film. It could not stay true to the original...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
387,vm04k,I Wanted This to be Good,4,20 October 2021,More or less this is a carbon copy of the original. The actor cast as Freddie was perfect but the makeup they had on him was so thick he could barely move. Rooney Mara looked bored the whole film. The best part was the visuals. I would give the cinematography a 9.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
388,korywalsh-592-670363,Not great!,3,16 May 2011,"First off I'll admit to 2 things. 1) I am not a huge horror fan. Like horror just not my favourite genre 2) I never saw the original. With that in mind you can disregard my review if you feel I'm not qualified.This was not a good movie. It was not at all scary and the visual effects in some scenes were good but they were lacking in others. Having never seen the original but knowing that it generated 6 sequels and, to my understanding, quite the fan base I will use this to compare them. Freddy in this version looks like a next door neighbour compared to the original. Robert Englund had the voice of a killer, this one didn't. He sounded like some who needed a candy to help his throat. The original was frightening to look at, this guy looked like a pink balloon attached to a body. The acting was not bad. The actors did a nice job but it was Freddy that pulled this down.The only screaming this movie had was that it NEEDED nude scenes to keep one interested and that quite honestly would have been out of place and obviously gratuitous. Not saying it wouldn't have been nice getting the right people in this movie as there were some hotties.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
389,BooHoo7902,Slightly surprised....,6,3 May 2010,"Throughout the majority of the first half of the film, I kept comparing it to the original which wasn't good. (It has been a few months since I've seen the original to be honest). However, I was slightly surprised at thinking at the end of the film that it wasn't too bad.I thought although Jackie Earle Haley did try his best as playing Freddy, I felt that he lacked the scare factor that Robert Englund had previously brought to the screen. His appearance in general was rather off-putting, in the sense that I didn't feel he was a genuine Freddy as he looked completely different to the original.I liked the fact that there was no sex during the film, which normally ruins perfectly good modern day horror films, due to being filled with unnecessary scenes. The way the storyline mainly also focused on Freddy and the story of his past rather than mindless killings throughout the film is what I think did it for me, as I wasn't just sitting through a film which had killing after killing of mind-numbingly boring teens screaming their heads off throughout, there was some back plot.The ending was also a very big surprise and a good one at that. I enjoyed the fact that this re-make was no a simple complete re-adaptation of the original scene by scene and that certain scenes in the original weren't used. (Such as the famous scene with Johnny Depp where he is killed and the blood pours from the bed onto the ceiling).I must admit, I've seen worst of re-makes. I'm still a big fan of the original and although I think Freddy has lost his touch slightly with the change of actors, if Englund had taken the place again, he would have just been seen as a sell out.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
390,tom_owens_182,Effective for it's modern day audience. Disappointing for everyone else.,4,7 May 2010,"Freddy had long been an icon in the Horror World. His comic style which developed throughout the series was a a brilliant twist to direct 'tounge in cheek' horror. The Puns were all fantastic. My favourite being: ""Welcome to prime time B*tch."" However, back to this movie. I went to see the midnight screening of this along with around 100 other people. Most of whom horror fans. I even spoke to a couple of them and they all said they liked it. When asked if they had seen the original. Most had not. Which is sad because remakes may now become the basis for people's view of certain films. And this was not a good film.My first problem was the opening. In the original, suspension is built via a hint at the killer. In this version. it takes around 10 minutes for the first death to take place. Suspense??? I guess Michael Bay preferred the 'special effect.' However, credit where it is due. The special effects were good. The 'burnt' face of Jackie Earl Hayley were very good. I just didn't think it could out-do Eungland. Comapare the two and Eungland still creeps me out more. His wicked smile offers so much more than Hayleys Sombre look.As I said in my summary, this films does do a good job of entertaining a current generation. As I've said, the people I saw it with loved it. But I still far prefer the original. What I admire about the original is that it was made with such a small budget. Therefore to accomplish so much was an incredible feat. However, when given a $30 million budget. I expected so much more.Disappointing overall. But if your going to see anything, go see this. It has it's own style and offers enough jump scares to make you think twice about turning in for the night.But don't see it if your a true horror buff. Watch the original and sweet dreams all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
391,facebook-174-672769,Surprisingly pretty good,9,22 November 2018,"I had no idea Freddy was replaced however, when I started watching it I actually jumped a few times and I rarely jump watching movies. I usually sit there entertained but never scared for most horror flicks. This one actually had me micro jump a few times which was a nice change. While I'm not one to jump enough to lose my popcorn like some people, the surprises were decent enough to enjoy this.The pros, actually not bad, decent acting.
The cons. Miss Robert Englund but then again, can't expect him to do Freddy forever.I expected it to suck, but it was overall pretty decent for the jump scenes.Alternate pros... I love the lead female in this. She is a decent actress, and smoking hot. I think it's the same hottie that is in Arrow. Will have to check what her name is when I'm done watching it. So far I'm only 45 min into the movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
392,freakinflax,Freddy Fans Rejoice! Freddy's Baaaaack!,6,30 April 2010,"I just attended the midnight premiere of the new Nightmare on Elm St movie, and it was a rocking good time. You can tell that since I went early and don't even care how much sleep I get going into work for 7, that I'm a big Freddy fan, so I'll try and make this review unbiased but also for the Freddy fan in everyone.Robert Englund IS Freddy. There's no mistaking that. However, Jackie does a fantastic job of bringing this character to life too. He does certain things with the famous 4 knives-for-fingers that is now characteristically Jackie's. His makeup is that of a true-to-life burn victim, yet still scary. His voice is top notch too. Definitely gives a Freddy feel and every time he talked I got chills.The effects are great here, especially the dream sequences. There are times when you don't know if the characters are awake or asleep, and that produces some suspenseful moments.There are some moments that echo the original Nightmare, including the wall scene & Tina's bed death, but they are done a bit differently. There also a few surprises that I know Freddy fans will love.The actors, well let's face it, they're as good as they're going to get. I was never into horror movies, especially 80's slasher flicks, for the acting. It's all about the deaths and the villain, and this film brings a lot of both.I was a bit surprised at how much Freddy showed himself. For the first hour or so, it's not too frequent, but towards the climax he started appearing every few minutes. He was still dark and creepy, but he also had a couple of great one liners that were so Freddy-esquire it was amazing.I personally loved the way the story played out and how it differed just slightly from the original. I really enjoyed this movie and was happy to see Freddy on the big screen again. I believe all Freddy fans will as well.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

394,kirvic_aguilera,"This is sad, how is this possible",4,21 May 2010,"With this title I meant that is so sad how all new Remakes of old classic horror films is going from bad to worst to really painful. I know is a remake, the vision of another director and all other full team of people, but lets face it, the acting is sad, the relation between the kids and the family (mother) is null, it's just an eternal wait for each BOO part, which actually is all the movie. The only acting I did enjoy was Jackie Earle Haley, because, going out of the character he was doing, he did a great work, but being Freddy Krueger is just...No, he's not. The special effects had nothing of special, it's horrible what they did. The gore was just the face of Krueger, but it also have computer graphics. Maybe they make a big effort doing this film, but to me, a big fan of horror and all 'Nightmare' films, the failed in the try but really hard. Hope no other remake of this goes out, I mean, please, DON'T. Save your movie making money and make something original instead of kill all the old greatest horror films ever.I'm not saying all remakes of our favorite horror films are bad or painful, Halloween by Rob Zombie was really good film, and i even liked more than the John Carpenter original version, but then Halloween II by Rob, was a little painful to my eyes.

395,sverige-icebaby,Not Freddie.,1,24 April 2014,"Only Robert Englund is Freddie. It doesn't matter that Robert Englund may have supported the choice to cast someone else, or even that he felt he was too old to re-play the character. He is the Freddie whom we all know and love to fear. He brought such a presence to the character, and it showed his versatility as an actor (see Willie, in ""V"" the original - and best - series). His face is the Freddie face, and we love him as he is. Another actor could not bring the same atmosphere of dread to the role. We love Freddie Kruger, the REAL Freddie Kruger. The franchise is fine as it is, and Hollywood needs to get over the idea that they can improve on a cult hit. They can't. It's been proved time and again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
396,djmmccorkell,Unnecessary remake,2,30 December 2014,"I'm all for remakes when the people behind them think they have something new to add to the original tale. That's not the case here. Every aspect of this retelling is somehow less than the original.Let's start with Freddy. As an original horror creation, he was iconic for the time and quite rightly became an instant pop culture figure (quite a feat for a murderous paedophile). In the later movies he devolved into a wise-cracking almost-camp figure, so maybe he did need a reboot. But the Freddy in this film isn't that reboot. From the Christian Bale Batman voice to the fish-faced inexpressive look spouting out cliché after cliché, this is not the Freddy we want or deserve.Next, dreams. The earlier movies played tricks with the viewer. Often we were never sure whether what we were seeing was real or a dream sequence. In the original we didn't even know for sure if Freddy was a real threat or just the fevered imaginings of the protagonist. Not here. Freddy is there in all his glory 5 minutes in, and the switches from reality to dream are so ham-fisted that only the addition of the Inception vroooom noise could make it more obvious.Killings. Yeah, it's a slasher movie; it needs a section about killings. The deaths in the original were wildly imaginative, pushing the boundaries of what was achievable on a limited budget. Here they're dull affairs and badly paced, leaving the second half of the movie killing-free and dogged down by needless exposition (we all know the Freddy back-story and this film adds nothing to it).Aspects of the original such as the underlying theme of teenage alienation from parents, or the sins of the father being paid by the next generation, are completely dropped here. The original was never exactly deep, but this is as hollow as movies come.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

398,marklynn-15497,Not one of the worst horror movie remakes to me,8,21 October 2021,"A lot to say about this horror movie remake - as I've been eager to watch after watching all other movies in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, and seen James A. Janisse covered this movie's Kill Count on his YouTube channel: Dead Meat - James certainly didn't like it, ranked it #9/bottom of franchise.This horror movie has some good parts and worse moments compared to Wes Craven's original movie - somehow I like them both equally but like this remake slightly more. Visual effects/CGI sort of 50-50. Didn't bother me much.The cast is not bad: Rooney Mara as Nancy Holbrook - slightly as good compared to Heather Langenkamp but more timidly quiet, Kyle Gallner as Quentin (Glen Lantz survived replacement), Katie Cassidy as beautiful Kris who I've seen in classic 2006 Black Christmas remake, the guy as Dean in opening scene: Kellan Lutz, I've seen in the Prom Night remake. , prison inmate yelling he didn't do it Jesse's death made me LOL was mechanic Andy in The Final Destination/3D. Attractive Connie Britton as Nancy's mom Gwen (not sure as pretty to Marge in original film, didn't like how she lied/refusing to tell her daughter about Krueger like don't trust her facial expression, yet her kill in end with Freddy in mirror and finger-knives through her eyes before pulling her through the mirror, much better than mannequin through front door window in original movie ending).This movie could've have gone a whole lot better if Fred Krueger was an innocent man, wrongly suspected of being paedophilic and was killed in a vigilante attack by preschool kids' parents and sought his revenge for injustice. But no, they make him confirmed as a revolting disgusting child molester, even his sexual interaction around Kris and Nancy - it's repulsive, sick to watch! So, he kills the kids, as some vengeful ghost, for disclosing his abuse?!Seems like the only/foremost part I hate in this movie remake, yet still like the movie regardless.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
399,Nsfguy81,"So I love the Nightmare series, and Freddy. But this...",1,16 December 2020,"I saw this with wild expectations when it first arrived in theaters. And I hated it. And then I forgot about it. Meanwhile I would still enjoy some Robert England freddy antics in the original series. Now, let me say that I thought Freddy's Dead was a complete disaster. I hate that movie. And Freddy VS Jason is... OK... I just hate the way Jason looks and is portrayed. But it was much better than Freddy's Dead. So 10 years later, I am a bit older and a bit wiser, and my expectations on Horror have changed dramatically. I am not so snobby about it anymore and am able to enjoy the silly things that used to bug me in horror. But I digress: I'm here for 2010s Nightmare on Elm Street. I just watched it again after 10 years, and it still sucked. I'm not a purest. It doesn't bother me that England wasn't Freddy this time. I actually think that JEH does a great job. But the film is BORING! and DREARY! in a bad way. The way Nancy is portrayed here is about as entertaining as watching a q-tip puppet show. She was so wooden and boring with ZERO personality. She never smiles, and shows no emotion other than total and complete seriousness. (The same can be said for every character here, but Nancy is important and they should have done better with her.) They rehash the scariest parts of the original only to make it look dumb. Idk what to say about this movie other than it stinks to high heaven. And I would watch the horrible Freddy's Dead 100 times more before I would give this garbage another chance. Remakes are stupid. Stop trying to fix something that was never broken in the first place. Hollywood sucks. And they are ruining the best of the best movies ever by ""rebooting"" and completely destroying them. Time to stop.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I thought the lead characters who survive until later in the movie didn't really do it for me I didn't feel engaged by them. I think Thomas Dekker's character should have had a bigger role to play. Great giving the back story some time but the whole film just doesn't do it for me certainly proves there's no need for a reboot and a reboot will never surpass Wes Craven's original masterpiece . 5/10.

I went into the film as a non-remake thought, so I could just take the film as is, and not as a remake. As a remake I would have been MUCH more harsh on the film.Things I liked: - Freddy's background story expanded - Some brutal deaths, including the scene with Kris (I liked the original movies death better because of more blood, but this one, slamming her all around the walls was really awesome) - some of the scenes, who cares what people think about 'glossy' look, were visually really nice, like the snow room scene - Freddy's character, I loved the sick perverted dark character and humor that he had - Freddy's little habit of rubbing two of the knives together to make a sort of scratching sound, so creepy and quirky, I loved itThings I didn't like: - Freddy's voice, didn't sound nearly as sinister as it could have, IMO - Freddy's makeup. Sure it was more realistic or whatever, but it just didn't look as evil. It seemed like with Freddy's character being so sinister in this movie that Freddy should look more evil. And hell, realistic or not, he's in control of the dream world, he could make himself look more sinister hahaha - I thought the overall script was quite boring, I found myself constantly just wanting to leave the theatre, but I just wanted to see some gruesome death scenes, which I did enjoy a bit - the very end, I thought the 'cliffhanger' ending totally sucked in this one. - I also didn't care much about the characters at all, none of them were very nice to look at either, in a teen slasher I at least like them to be attractive and I thought none of the girls were attractive hahahaSo there you have it, my little ""review"" of the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street, overall rating being a 4/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

407,binky8177,disappointing,3,9 November 2010,"By today's horror standards, the original Nightmare on Elm Street is rather tame and corny. I didn't even seen the movie until I was about 25 yrs old. As I consider myself a big fan of horror, I decided it was time to see NOES, so I finally rented and watched all 7 of them in 2002. I had heard many stories from friends and family about how scary the original NOES was, but when I saw it, I was not scared at all. In 2002, I didn't find the original Robert Englund Freddy Krueger very frightening.... but compared to this new Nightmare on Elm Street and the new Freddy, Robert Englund was about the scariest thing ever. This new movie is a big disappointment. Don't bother and the new Freddy looks pretty lame. That is all. THE END",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Though the plot remains more or less the same, the characters don't seem so frightened as they were on the original film. On the other and, Freddy's appearances are all too predictable so if you like to scream in a movie theater, this will not be the film for you.The cast, as in the original film, was selected among almost unknown or (like Thomas Decker) second line actors, almost saying that they didn't expect much from this film...This movie's Freddy isn't nearly as scary as Robert Englund's was...Finally, the special effects,the quality was increased but, in the overall, they aren't nothing special ----> all these things made a lousy film...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
409,jefbtheone,now I have to wait for Hellraiser,2,3 May 2010,"My expectations were not too high on this remake of one of my favorite horror movies ever. Opposed to others, I never thought the original A Nightmare on Elm Street was as good as a couple of the sequels (like part 3, Dream Warriors) just as I was not a big fan of the original Halloween but happened to like the remake just about as much. In this case, there was no Rob Zombie style added and really nothing to make you say ""wow, I like what they did with this"". Of course I expected differences but I hoped whatever change was made would make it better in certain ways; better, as in filling in missing pieces to the plot or creating a great prequel as to how this man became Freddy. Unfortunately that did not happen.Now if I were to list the number of differences between the original and the remake I would probably spoil the movie. I prefer to let others watch the movie so that they can reduce this rating on IMDb. Just think to yourself the creepy, graphic scenes from the original and taking out most of them or changing in a way that does not improve from the original. Basically, I can list the differences and you may say ""it's a fact that this movie is not good,"" because that is how significant the changes are.Some general reasons I hated the movie, other than what I mentioned, is that it is not more graphic, not gorier, not funnier, not cleverer and not more interesting. Adding in parts to the plot that never existed did not help.I cannot criticize the acting much but I can criticize the makeup artists, because Freddy looked like a burnt up character from the movie Sleepwalkers. You can tell from the previews.My recommendations of what they should have done are the following: 1) Show flashbacks to Freddy's childhood, how he became evil, how he began stalking his prey from inside of a creepy house on Elm St., how his death made him possessed by demons, and what the murderers did with his body. That may be a little too much but that basically fills in the plot of the original movie.2) Either make the killings the same or different from the original. Not both. I would start the movie out with a young Nancy walking by Freddy's house, while a couple girls are jump-roping nearby; Mr. Krueger is outside and gives her a wink. This type of flashback would occur one more time but with odd noises coming from inside the house like the sound of a little girl crying. Then that's it. That's all any of the characters know about him except for the parents.3) Later on, after Freddy's house is vacant for several years, a couple teenagers decide to wander into the house just on a double-dare. Then the classic fear factors kick in - residual haunting, boiler furnace flames,steaming pipes, etc. The kid gets freaked out and leaves. He lives but then dies in his sleep a few days later.4) Several years later, Nancy is living with the creepy, divorced mother of her's. It would be a good idea to say that her mother was the mastermind to Freddy's death, and maybe the whole reason for the divorce was because the father (cop) disagreed with the decision. So why not make Nancy the main victim of the haunting of Freddy. As she explores further into this mysterious man in her dreams, he becomes more real, pieces of the plot unravel, and eventually Nancy spreads the name out like a disease and people start dying.5) The deaths should be consistently creative. For a modern day version, a good example would be: a guy smoking weed nearby a barbershop. As he's stoned, urinating behind a dumpster, he looks through the barbershop window and daydreams of being inside the barbershop. The barber says to him ""how about a little off the top"" ""stay still..I wouldn't want to cut you"". Then why not have Freddy butcher him to the point of decapitation. His friends find him dead behind a dumpster scalped with a claw mark down the face.6) The ending should be kept vague only if they plan on making a part 2. I agree with Freddy being pulled out of the dream like in the original. That's cool. Let's say pulling him out makes him become more human but yet still immortal. Using the glove hidden in the basement furnace can cripple him but then ultimately she needs to kill him in the dream world by controlling the dream, bringing him to a church, performing some type of exorcism that frees the souls of the children. Something of that nature would not be a vague ending. But if there's gonna be a part 2, the ending in the original works out or basically any ending.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

This re imagining of Nightmare is absolutely a joy to watch, the only thing is you need to watch it and accept it for what it is. It is it's own film, with its own tempo and atmosphere to experience. Anyone who goes into it looking for Freddie the upgraded nightmare, will only disappoint themselves.

411,hunterhayes49,"Not as good as the original, but a quality entry.",9,2 May 2010,"So, Samuel Bayer takes his first crack at directing a film in a remake of the 1984 classic 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. His shooting style is very intricate. Scenes are carved out very well and the imagery is a definite update from the original's, however some points falter towards what the original accomplished. There is a particular scene, in which Freddy comes through the wall, where the cgi doesn't look very good at all. The new Nightmare also boasts a new Freddy Krueger. If you liked to root for him in the original series, prepare to be disappointed. Because Freddy is dark, and utterly disgusting. He makes no secret of his violent and 'Sexually promiscuous' past. While Jackie brings his own to the role, he can never top Robert, and while Jackie's interpretation is solid, the writing does him in. He cracks a lot of the jokes that fans were told the remake was trying to ""get away from"". The new look is grounded a bit more in reality, and it works. Freddy is bad to look at. Jackie Earle Haley does a very good job with Freddy, from his stance to his voice, he has it down pat. As far as the acting goes, there was good and bad. Katie Cassidy delivers a pretty good performance, and probably the best of the teen-aged children. Kyle Gallner does a pretty good job as well, letting his emotions carry much of his performance. The rest of the cast was somewhat flat. Rooney Mara delivers some very flat lines, and Thomas Dekker's character doesn't stick around long enough to get a worthy performance. There are several parts of the film that show promise. There are also some parts that show a little room for improvement. I do believe that PD tried too hard to please fans of the original. Which, in turn, is a reason the film gets negative reviews. Many scenes and lines are rehashed, and they ultimately don't live up to the quality of the original. Overall, the film is pretty good. You should expect a mixed bag though. If you're open to the idea of this classic being remade, then go ahead. But if you're already against the idea of it, then go ahead and skip it.

The remake of my favorite, Halloween, Amityville Horror, The Fog, The Hitcher, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, House of Wax, The Hills Have Eyes, The Omen, Psycho. Whats next? Remake of Alien? The Blade movies? Why dick around with the classics? I only recognize Kyle Gallner in the cast. The rest of them I've never heard of. Where is Robert Englund in all this? He is the one that did it the best. No substitute can even come half way as Robert. So no more Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, Heather Langencamp or John Saxon. What is the studios trying to tell us with all these remakes? That just because technology is better now then it was back then its time to show it and royally mess up a good movie. Almost all remakes of very good classic movies turn out to be flops. Maybe its what the teenagers of this generation is demanding, I don't know. Hey I have an idea, while we're remaking movies lets remake The Godfather movies or Lord of the Rings.

413,Harleyflhrc,Never quite reaches its potential,6,10 May 2010,"As a threshold matter, I saw the original NOES at the theater when I was a freshman in college, and I can say unequivocally that it literally revived a horror genre that many believed to be finished, as only VERY tired slasher and zombie films were all that were offered back then. What made the original so good was that Freddy toyed with his victims, but in a very evil way, not with the one liners that came later in the sequels, but rather he enjoyed watching them squirm in terror, and he was able to do this by saying very few lines. The second in the series was, I thought, a little underrated, and the third one with the original Nancy was actually very good. They (New Line) should have stopped there, as the rest of the films after that just stank up the place.The primary problem with the remake is one of shallow character development. You never seem to really get to know the potential young victims, especially Nancy the main protagonist, well enough to care about what happens to them. There is just a lot of dead air in this script. This is unfortunate because there were several opportunities for some great new plot twists, like the fact that Freddy was wrongly accused and murdered by the angry parents by mistake, and he was now back to avenge his death. I was anxiously awaiting for this new angle to take off, but sadly it never does. Also curiously absent from the remake was any back story on Freddy's glove or why it is his weapon of choice. In this film he is a gardener at a pre-school, who does not kill any children but apparently molests them, although there was never any indication that it was sexual in nature, but rather the minor physical harming of them. Where and how does the glove come about? That should have been worth a few minutes of celluloid.The attempt to make Freddy as evil as he was in the first one falls flat, despite a good performance by Haley. I would wait for this one on Redbox.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I loved the original and Freddy has scared me since i was around 8 or 9. This movie was good and entertaining. The Characters are likable so you hate to see them die. There's a lot of cheap scares and i loved them. Acting was great especially Kyle Gallner and also Jackie Earle Haley. The new Freddy was GREAT, you could tell he is out for revenge and he is leaving no survivors. What I didn't like was the deaths, like Kellen Lutz and Thomas Dekker's. 1 was to predictable and the 2nd wasn't as graphic as i wanted it to be. And I kinda wish Freddy would have tourtured the characters more, it would have fit with whole he wants them to suffer thing. Also what annoyed me was that the character Kris does moust of the research, that Nancy should have bein doing. But I liked the remake of Tina's death! I liked the dreams but they could have being better. The storyline was OK, not the best. This movie wasn't anything new except the story line, but it was good to bring back Freddy.

415,Zombeefan,How not to remake a film....,5,13 May 2010,"With the glut of studio remakes coming out over the last 10 years it is no surprise that the studio system has managed to completely destroy some of the best franchises ever made by turning them into completely commercialized crap fests from start to finish.A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) now joins the ranks of Friday The 13th (2009) and Halloween (2007)as one of the poorest remakes to hit the big screen in recent memory. In fact, the only redeeming quality to this film is Jackie Earl Halely's Freddy Kruger. Now Jackie can't replace or top Robert Englund, but he does a great job that keeps the film from falling into total mess. I was quite please to hear about his casting in the film last year, but it is a shame how the rest of the film just doesn't match up in expectations. What is also angering is that the shot for shot lifts from the original film are done so hap hazardly that you shake your head in disgust because you think there is no way anyone can screw up some of these great moments, but the people behind this travesty of a remake managed to do just that... screw it way up.Michael Bay, who is listed as producer and behind the company who has remade this flick really needs to look at what made these films great when they originally came out and try not to transform-afy them into MTV based schlock fests which is exactly what he has done with F13 and now A Nightmare on Elm Street.Other than Jackie, the rest of the cast is forgettable and you as an audience member has no emotional connection with any of them, mostly because there is no back story or moment that can help you connect to them, maybe these writers need to look at Chris Nolan's Batman Begins and how he took a small role for Bruce Wayne's father and gave it so much emphasis is such a short amount of time it would allow these writers and directors to learn how to do enough back story on the characters so you can actually give a damn when something happens to them, instead they go for the lifeless quick flash that either shows them to be idiots, morons or completely useless human beings that shouldn't have been brought into the world in the first place.The sad thing about this film is that it tarnishes the franchise, and honestly has no place in horror cinema. Maybe a competent producer or director could have pulled it off, but clearly there was none of that present during the making of this film.I am not saying avoid it at all costs, but don't waste your money on this during its theatrical run... this is a red-box rental at best.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
416,bladexz95,Why? Just... why?,3,14 January 2018,"I don't get it. How did the kids fall asleep while doing important things like swimming or walking? At a funeral? Why would Freddy all of a sudden be a killer when he was simply a child molester before? If he was coming back to haunt them and didn't kill anyone before, why would he kill anyone now? Wouldn't he just feel them up a bit? And how did the parents make the kids forget everything? Yet, almost all of them live in the exact same neighborhood where they grew up? All of these horrible plot holes and convenient tactics just scream lazy writing. Don't they workshop this stuff before they submit it for finals? They broke their own rules repeatedly with the whole hallucination/micro sleep stuff they did, by taking stuff out of the dreams, and on top of that, the kids did weird things that normal kids probably would or wouldn't do. For example, the kids knew the parents knew about Freddy eventually, but why did none of them mention the said dreams they were having? Poorly written characters and dialogue on top of this crap sundae; where the teenagers would solo it out instead of staying together to keep each other awake, and a lack of empathy towards the victims, as they were mostly boring cannon fodder for Freddy's claws. None of the characters interacted all that much, and they didn't seem to care all that much when the others died.Also, the cliche usage of jump scares, the wooden acting, the boring protagonist and antagonist, and the complete copycat massacre scenes of the first film.

417,sam-321-129561,"Superb, underrated re-imagining",6,8 May 2012,"2010's A Nightmare on Elm Street is a remake/re-imagining of Wes Craven's supernatural slasher classic about a group of teenagers being tormented by badly burned killer Fred Krueger in their dreams. A Nightmare on Elm Street has been taken back to the drawing board, to it's very basic premise, and re-done for 2010.So what does all that mean, exactly? Well, to put it simply, we're not looking at the same movie with modern day effects here. We're looking at Wes Craven's idea coupled with today's societal concerns.Fans of the original will remember the intentional ambiguity of Freddy's past, starting off as a child killer who got away with it, killed by angry town folk taking the law into their own hands, and becoming more and more bizarre as the series went on, involving the strange circumstances of his conception, and a lot of religious undertones. This time around, Krueger's past is made a little more clear, and this is what will make or break the movie for a lot of people. Many were upset by Rob Zombie's choice to explore Michael Myers' past in Halloween, as they felt that a mysterious, faceless enigma is scarier than somebody you know everything about.I beg to differ... The slasher genre has slowly become a parody of itself, especially after the ingenious Scream quite literally stating all of the rules and clichés, and even if we can block out their knowledge of the 'rules', the killer still often becomes the protagonist in our minds as we become more interested in how they will pick off the next dumb, drunk teenager than who will survive.This is where Freddy's back-story comes in. Once you know what he is, you will hate him, fear him, and most definitely root for the heroes of the picture. A hint - Freddy's back-story is far more disturbing than the original version, and things which Craven may have intended, but never outright said, come to light here.I will also tell you this - a newcomer to Freddy would probably do better watching this film than a hardcore fan of the original series. Firstly some of the strongest moments in this version are lifted straight out of the original, but more importantly the story is told in a completely different way. Surprisingly, this is not a teenage slasher flick. None of the stereotypes appear here - there's no token black guy, no cheerleader, no geeky do-gooder girl - and there are no house-parties or scenes of characters getting drunk and sleeping with one another. In fact, I don't recall any 'happy' scenes in at all, since we begin the movie with all of the characters already affected by the nightmares, a sombre funeral scene being the backdrop to our character introductions.This, in the long run, leads the movie into much more of a mystery-horror along the lines of The Ring, where the primary concern of our remaining characters is staying alive and awake long enough to find out the truth about Freddy and possibly shed some light on how to stop him, rather than who is going to die next. On the down side, this does mean we have to spend the first twenty minutes trying to relate to the characters as they get stalked by night and attend funerals by day, and it can be difficult to pick which to try and follow as they are slowly picked off. It pays off though, once the cast has been nicely 'pruned', as the few remaining characters really hold your attention and there are none of the ""he just went in there on his own, I can tell he's going to die"" moments due to this structure.So I guess the question on the lips of long-term series fans is ""how is Freddy?""... Robert Englund kept the role for such a long time that it does become hard to imagine anybody else clad in the striped sweater and finger-blades, but equally hard to imagine him becoming scary again after how far he dipped into the 'wise-cracker' character Freddy became. When the funny-faced Englund with pizza-face makeup would don sunglasses, a super-villain costume, or a power glove, and make some kind of game show host gag about it, it was easy to forget you were looking at the ghost of a brutal child murderer. If you ask me, the only way to have truly brought back Freddy's terrifying nature from the original movie was to re-cast him and to re-design his make-up, and that's exactly what has been done. Englund has been replaced by Jackie Earle Haley - Rorschach from the brilliant 'Watchmen' - and his make-up is what, in anybody's imagination, a horribly burned man would look like - he's disfigured, skin melting, bits of flesh missing to reveal the bone and tendons beneath, and parts have 'healed over'. He is not nice to look at at all, and it will upset some fans, but will scare newcomers in the same way that Englund did in the 70s. Jackie's acting is, as usual, brilliant, both as burn victim Freddy and as the past Fred Krueger, presenting two completely different sides of the character so well that you almost sympathise with him until later revelations.'Elm Street recreates a brilliant idea from the 70s in a way that is relevant to 2010 and once again scary and believable.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I have to assume many peoples' opinions on it were made up before they even saw it. Yes, it has flaws. It's not a masterpiece, but it's damn good.First off, the movie is visually stunning. The lighting, the colors, and the set-pieces are all very great to look at. The film stock is very clean and smooth; it just looks great.Second, the directing is great. I don't know if I like Samuel Bayer as a person, but he sure is a good director. The framing and angles are just really good.Finally, the performances given are so much better than people say. Rooney Mara is fantastic. She plays her part perfectly: the outcast nature of her character, the fatigue she feels, and the emotions she goes through are all portrayed excellently.Jackie Earl Haley knocked it out of the park as Freddy Krueger. He's dark and angry. The jokes are still there, but you can feel it in your bones that this is a phantom with his mind set on revenge.There are flaws. The deaths weren't all that impacting on me, and I didn't care too much that these characters were dying. That's a problem. The pacing is a bit slow in the middle as well.But, there's so much more good here than bad. This is definitely as good, if not better, than the original.

Freddy's story is explored a little more in this film, although for the most part they just tell us the story of his demise earlier. But more importantly, his attitude felt wrong. Freddy, in past movies, was a character who would love a kill, make those silly-sometimes-witty jokes and puns. Even in the movies where he was less wise-ass and more evil, he relished the kill. Robert Englund brought depth to Freddy. In this movie he just seems indifferent. Almost bored, as though he was killing people to kill time. Also, the kills often were just CGI-enhanced throwbacks to the older films. Except my problem is part of my love for older films is the clever ways they were filmed. Like in th first nightmare, when the girl crawls up the wall, a spinning room was used for that shot. Or the way they made melting stairs. Overall, I guess I wouldn't say the remake isn't worth watching. But when you put the brand name of an old horror movie on a new film, be it Halloween, Friday the 13th, or whatever it may be, comparisons have to be drawn to the originals.

And that goes for all emotionally triggered scenes from all movies not just horror.I'm definitely not a hardcore NoeS fan but I remember the originals I watched when I was kid with Robert Englund as Freddy and they were awesome and pretty scary for a kid especially.This film didn't make me jump once I predicted every ""jump scare"" before it happened and when the film ended I wasn't left surprised or glad I watched it. I felt a cheated to be honest.Every remake of classic films whether it be horror, comedy etc seems to leave this affect me.

I think it's a worthy remake of the great classic with Robert Englund. I'll start with the bad things. OK the first bad thing for me was that the pacing can sometimes be a little slow for my liking. Some of the talk scenes go on for too long. Second I was a little disappointed with some of the acting. I thought Rooney did a decent job as Nancy, but she could be a little stale and boring at times. She picks up the last third of the movie though. Also Katie Cassidy had some ups and some downs. Some dialog she said just made me cringe at times, like the: I'm so afraid line. But she also has some good scenes, as I absolutely love the classroom scene, she does sincerely look frightened there. Thomas Dekker also did a decent job, nothing special though. I also thought the dream/death scenes could use just a little bit more imagination.One more thing i cringed at was the: She's starting to remember line. That just came out wrong and cheap.Now for the good things. The Special Effect are very good, there aren't that many but the ones who are present are great. I thought Kyle Gallner was the second best performance in the movie after JEH. He has some very strong emotional presence when he's on screen. Therefore i thought the pharmacist scene was very well acted by Gallner. Now for the best part of the movie: Jackie Earl Haley as Fred Krueger. Like many fans of the original i was scared JEH wouldn't surpass Englund by a long shot, but he surprised e with his performance. He did the part so well, i totally forgot about Robert the rest of the time. Also he has some very cool and bad-ass one-liners. But sadly also a few bad and unnecessary ones. I liked his performance as much as I loved Englunds. It's just a totally different take on the character. Now the part, many fans of the original have been b****ing about since the movie came out. Freddy is a Pedophile in this movie and he was a Child Murderer in the original. In my opinion they kept it fresh this way, and it really did not make me despise Freddy less for it. I don't want to imagine what Nancy saw on those pictures in the school. One nice little touch from the original was parts of the soundtrack, as soon as the title came up i felt right at home with the original music playing in the background. I also liked the homage scenes as well.OK, so not all the acting was good, Rooney is no Heather and Jackie was as great as Englund all the way.

423,tripll,Nothing new here,5,2 May 2010,"I went to see the original back in 84 when I was 16 years old. That movie had a lasting effect on me which is why at 42 I was very excited to see this remake. The title of this review says it all. Nothing new, nothing at all. I thought midway through *** Spoiler Alert *** that they may put in an exciting twist, Freddy may have been innocent??? But no, this was just the basic story about Freddy and the kids. It didn't even have any 21st century sex/nudity/drug use scenes that make many of today's horror flicks fun. Then we have Freddy, we all knew that no remake could capture the essence of the original master and therefore this one didn't even try. He wasn't funny at all he was very serious and didn't show off while torturing his victims. In the end I was just hoping it would get over with so I could enjoy the rest of the weekend.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
424,joanneburton-66331,Lands Squarely In The Middle,5,27 July 2019,"We all need to learn that nothing is truly sacred in Hollywood, so we might as well just embrace these remakes and hope that, every now and then, one of them will turn out ok and be able to hold itself up to the original on its own terms. A Nightmare on Elm Street comes incredibly close to standing out from the original film, but for every leap forward, it takes a few steps backwards until it's straddling the line between the two and not really committing fully to anything original.The story is, more or less, the same with a group of teenagers experiencing horrific nightmares involving a burnt man with a glove of knives who is slicing and dicing them. In both films, it's revealed that this man was someone their parents murdered in a fit of vigilante justice after he'd been let free for molesting their children. The new film adds a twist questioning if Freddy was actually guilty or innocent.The new Nightmare has a much bigger budget than the original film, so it's odd that the effects work isn't nearly as impressive as the original film. A bit of Freddy's makeup seems computer generated and a few of the other effects resemble a cheap 90's video game. The cast is fairly strong with Katie Cassidy, Kyle Gallner, and Thomas Dekker standing out as three of the terrified teens. Rooney Mara is the weak link among the them as Nancy. She's made the choice to play the character as moody and depressive, which makes her hard to root for and dull to watch.As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley can only do so much to step out from the shadow of Robert Englund, but he does a good job and brings a different, more pervy energy to the character which adds a little threat that his silly makeup job keeps threatening to take away.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
425,jarretstroud,Decent Film but Freddy lacks the Charm,6,11 May 2020,The movie is decent plot wise. It has decent characters and awesome gore. But the problem is Freddy Krueger. Leave Freddy to Robert England. Freddy Krueger lacks the charm that the original Freddy had. Because of how Freddy looks awful and lack the original charm I took off 4 points. If Robert England played Freddy in the remake I would easily give it a higher score!,A Nightmare on Elm Street
426,paubangs,Needed more creativity and more story development,6,28 April 2010,"When I think back to the original nightmare that made it scary to fall asleep I always think of certain iconic scenes in the film. The claw in the bath tub, the stairs melting under Nancy's feet as she runs in fear, and Tina being thrown around her room with such relentless force. Well if you love those scenes and want to see them again look no further. The ""Director"" of the new Nightmare, if you want to call him that, using many of the original scenes along with many ""old school scare tactics"".I was really looking forward to this film. I hoped that the re imagining would take the concept of nightmares killing teens and really run with the idea. Instead we get basic and easy directing along with a script that looks to of been written in one sitting. The film itself is not that long, so going you should assume the movie will be at a fast pace. I for one would of liked to of gotten more story and character development. Any time I thought we were gonna get to know a character they end up dead. You really have no connections with any of the characters. So when they meet their end by the bladed hand of their nightmarish stalker you really don't care.As for the new Freddie. He was the one saving grace in this poor remake of a classic. Jackie Earle Haley really dives into the role of Fred Kreuger. He makes you think there is more to his evil exterior and that there might be hope that he could change. Which of course is all just misdirection to lore his victims closer to him. If there is a sequel it will be because of Haley's performance.As for the gore factor. Its next to nothing if you compare it to modern standards. The original was ahead of its time with the on screen gore. I really was expecting some more unique scenes in which the director really explores the world of dreams and death scenes that make you afraid not just squeamish.Not a bad movie but not great. If you want a remake that is like the original with a few new twists then your in luck. If you want a new inventive look at the classic. Then maybe next time you and I will get our wish.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
427,marijumanji,Nothing 'New' about this Nightmare,3,4 May 2010,"When it was announced that Jackie Earle Haley would be taking on the role of Freddy in the new Elm Street franchise reboot, a collective sigh of relief went up from the fans of the originals. Haley's Rorshach was one of the few redeeming qualities in the abysmal ""Watchmen"" movie. When pictures of Freddy's new face were leaked, the excitement grew. This Freddy promised to drop the silly one liners and be a return to the frightening, sadistic killer from the first film.Haley does what he can with what he's given, but even a game performance from him and Rooney Mara(Nancy) can't save this film from mediocrity. The male lead is played by Kyle Gallner. He could generously be called a poor man's Robert Pattinson. He does a serviceable job here but the weak writing and directing don't do him any favours.Fans of the original will be disappointed by the brief treatment of Freddy's origins, and it's unlikely new viewers will understand what is going on or even care for that matter. My hopes of a scarier Freddy were dashed within the first few minutes. The film doesn't even try to build an atmosphere and Haley spouts the same tired one liners that the later films leaned on so heavily.Even as the original series aged, one could always rely on the excellent special effects and make-up work to carry the films. The highlight of each film was the creativity of the different ""Dream Worlds"" that Freddy would take his victims to. Each dream world was unique because it reflected the thoughts of the character Freddy was trying to kill. This new iteration strips away any of that creativity and takes place almost entirely in one location (I'll avoid spoilers, but if you've seen any other film in the series you can easily guess where). The makeup work that looked promising in production stills doesn't hold up well on screen, failing to be as frightening or iconic as the original. The effects aren't great, it would be easy to beat the dead horse of 'computer graphics' being inferior but I think the real problem here is directorial. Samuel Bayer simply can't hold a candle to Wes Craven.If you want to disregard my comparisons to the original films and simply take this one for what it is, a brainless slasher flick, it still fails. None of the 'kills' show any creativity at all and audiences already fed on a steady diet of graphic violence won't find anything all that shocking or disturbing here. It's just boring. Adding to that is an over reliance on cheap scares. This film is this the cinematic equivalent of someone shouting ""boo!"" in your face every ten minutes. This technique becomes annoying almost instantly and becomes increasingly more annoying because it is used in every single scene. It's like the director realized he didn't know how to direct a scary movie and instead of quitting and finding a new job, he decided to edit in sudden loud noises and hope no one would notice.By the end the audience I saw it with could hardly hold back their titters of laughter and I don't mean that in a good way. This is one franchise that had some potential for rebirth, but I will be amazed if this one makes it to part 2.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
428,ashleybelsham,Surprisingly Good Amongst Years Of Rubbish Horror,7,10 May 2010,"Hi all. So i'm gonna shoot myself in the foot here as a BIIGG horror fan and say that I was actually pleasantly surprised with this film. WHY...you ask. Well I was surprised because.....its was actually....quite scary. And after the last 3 years of wasting money on absolutely rubbish horror that wouldn't make my Nan jump, I enjoyed being on edge for an hour and a bit.Now lets ignore the fact that its a (sort of) remake of one of the most influential horror movies of all time and its a sacrilege against the gods of horror and all that (Side note - I hated Rob Zombies awful Halloween remake). Taken as a separate movie I would say you get what you want out of a horror. Lots of gore and jumps. Its all there.Although no Freddie will ever be as good as Robert Englunds character, I think the new one was pretty good (although the sort of comical aspect wasn't there and it was a teeny bit Candymanny).But I say if your a horror fan thats lost confidence in the industry, constantly sucked in to these rubbish so called scary movies that promise too much in the trailer (Paranormal Activity comes to mind, and the Forth Kind - that was awful), just give this a go. Granted it will never be as good as the original but at least you will jump out your skin a few times.Hope you enjoy it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

430,rfbeaver93,Nightmare remake.,5,17 May 2010,"Yes it seems that horror movies have gone at there lowest..For the past 2 years all I have seen is horror remakes..Why do we need them? why? They never turn out good..although this one was not as bad as everyone put it out to be.First off, The new Freddy. Is he good? No not at all, but only because of what he had to work with.(the script.) I found him quite interesting and he has some potential being Freddy, but if he does not have a good script to work with then how can he make magic for his role? he cant, no one can. It just seemed like he was forced to say those silly one-liners. I think there was one were it was acceptable and I did not mind it, but the rest of them were just from Freddy vs. Jason. Unacceptable...Most of them he just said out of random. But then again it wasn't Haley's fault..So all in all Haleys got potential as Freddy...the writers just need to do a better job and make him scarier and keep out as many one-liners as possible.Secondly, the teen characters(well, they are not so teenish.) I have been thinking about this for awhile..why does ""teen"" actors always put out a crap performance? It just bugs me how they butcher every character if it is a teen role. Now, the teen cast was not too bad. I think that Jesse Braun(Thomas Dekker) was a complete waste of a character, really. I think the casting crew just said, ""well hey Jesse Braun was a character in the original elm street. So he will be in the remake even if he has no point in the movie."" Come on!! If he was gonna have no point in the movie then why bother put him in. I also thought it was hilarious on how he got caught by the cops. He just runs right in the street probably saying in his head ""This is were the cops are gonna show up. so i better stay here."" He didn't even make an attempt to run away. He just ran in the street and gave up. I just think he was pointless only because he died like five minutes after he went to jail. Next is Kris Fowles(Katie Cassidy) When I first started watching the movie I thought they were not going to bring back Nancy(Rooney Mara)...which is completely fine because I thought they were going to be at least somewhat original. But no. she dies like 15 min. into the movie! Not only that she stole one of Nancys scene from the original(classroom dream scene). I think the writers were screwing around now. Because after she died Nancy finally came into the movie and I was personally slapped in the face by Hollywood. I completely had the impression that Kris was going to be the main character. She already did half of the work that Nancy was supposed to do. And not only that Kris was just a dumb blonde character. She also looked like she was in her mid 20's not teens. Her acting was...well I cant really tell she wasn't in the movie long enough to tell. Nexy is Nancy, she was really bad. Like she acted like she really didn't care that her friends were dieing all around her and she didn't really want to make an attempt to save herself. Next is Quentin Smith(Kyle Gallner)...out of all the characters this was the only one I really cared for. Kyle did a good job of showing how paranoid he was getting as Freddy was screwing with him. I liked him. I felt sympathy for him. These are the things I SHOULD have been thinking with all the other characters.Next is the plot: Boy oh boy we have a mess. The plot pretty much follows the original movie. They stole just about every scene from the original and threw it in the remake. Which is fine especially if its a remake. But they sucked the creativity out of most of the scenes. They just computer animated them instead of the real thing like in the original. Another thing is they sucked the suspense out of the ""dream scenes"" They felt like you were being babied threw them. As soon as someone fell asleep the scenery changed or the creepy music kicked in. It did not bother me though because I had low expectations from this movie. The writers did have a good thing going with Freddys back story but they didn't follow threw with it. As soon as we learn about it they go to a remake scene. It threw me off every time they did that. Overall the plot had some potential but they just screwed it up with the cheap filler remake scenes.Lastly is the look/atmosphere of the movie. This is what the movie excelled in in my opinion. It looked great just with a couple of scenes that were very dark and sometimes I could not tell what was happening. I actually did not mind it because they were at least trying to make it look suspenseful. Although Freddy did not look too good but was acceptable. The whole atmosphere was dark, gritty, and sorta scary to me. All in all it was a pretty bad movie. They had several things that would have been good for the movie...but they just didn't follow through with it unfortunately. It looked great and the atmosphere was cool but looks do not mean everything and here is a prime example. 5/10 but Id say if you are a Freddy fan go check it out in the theaters.(I didn't and I'm glad i didn't.) but if your looking for a good remake. Watch it on the internet like I did without wasting your money.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
431,LeahCoghlan,Pretty decent!!,8,3 May 2010,"I didn't know what to think before I went to see the movie. I have seen so many crappy remakes over the years, like Bay's Friday the 13th ... when he had Jason running, I was done! Jason ... does not run! However,I really liked the new Freddy portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley. If you think about it, different people have played Jason, Michael Myers and Leatherface over the years, but it was always Robert England who killed kiddies in their dreams. So that is pretty big shoes to fill! The new Freddy really looked like he had be burnt to death, giving him a more realistic and creepy look! However, Haley still stuck to the classic characteristic's, us N.O.E.S fans love, lurking in the shadows, chasing the prey and the occasional funny/sarcastic comments he was known for.Sure, some of the teenagers looked like they were in their twenties, but if you look back to the originals, so did those teens. But the blood and gore was great, plus the dream sequences and the scare factor. Plus the back story on how Freddy got lynched was pretty good, something we are seeing more and more of in these remakes ... how our anti-heroes came to be.I think if you're a true Freddy fan and you don't take it too seriously, you'll enjoy the film. A new look, it also stuck to the classic Freddy-isms we have come to know and fear about the monster in our dreams.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The main fault was Freddy, which is always going to be Robert Englund, period. Jackie Earle Haley did the best he could, and I take my hat off for an incredible performance of a great actor, and after watching his part as Rorschach, hope to see more of him in the future. The second fault was the story as it was told this time around, it was boring, it lacked the suspense of the original, and the characters, for the first half of the movie, looked more like lambs waiting for the slaughter, than teens trying to survive. Little changed for most of the second part of the movie... Mind you, the performances of the young actors was good overall, and it was anything but their fault that the story wasn't captivating.

Only thing you can do to like this movie just a little bit, is laugh at the bad moments and make fun of Freddy and the way the whole movie develops.

There were a more than a few things i really didn't like and the first is the lack of Robert Englund, he was the classic Freddy and had been for 8 god damn movies no one can replace Freddy and all though Jackie Earle Haley was a good replacement i just felt he was lacking the characteristics that were performed by Englund back in '84. the next thing that annoyed me was the budget and the special effects, the budget for this film was $35,000,000 and it didn't need to be, cgi is not the way forward it just looks over produced and tacky, and that is not cool, if you have seen any of the originals you will understand how cool the special effects were for instance the bed blood scene in the first one and Freddy coming the the stretchy wall all done in creative ways , and now it's done with cgi which is meant to be more realistic but in my opinion looks like horse dump. overall you will enjoy this film if you see it as just another nightmare film and not a re-make, it has it's own dream sequences, although some similar, and it's own way of presenting the story behind the kids of elm street, so see it how you will, but this is not a bad film. although, final thing, if you are considering to watch this over the original please don't, watch this second if you must, but don't hit on it because it's not faithful to the original or anything else, because come on when are re-makes ever as good as the originals, in my opinion it's a good film worth a watch try not to compare it to the original too much, just enjoy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

And when i heard about the remake of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street i was so pumped because of the new technology in modern day movies. I thought it was going to be kick ass and i got to say i was extremely out raged at this remake. I mean in the original movie Freddy was more how do you joke full and had that laugh and liked to play with his victums before he would finally kill them and the sickest ways and the new Freddy play by (Jackie Earle Haley) that pretty much hasn't had a main lead role in his whole career except for his role in watchmen but he only was seen a few times in that movie anyways. but i think this remake is far from good i would say an abomination is more like it. they made Freddy this no fun serious Freddy that isn't what Freddy is. and they also changed the look of Freddy too which was a make-stake in my opinion and i didn't hear that Freddy laugh either which i thought was a let down, this remake goes with the newer Halloween movies which wasn't bad big changed the mask of Michael so i wasn't so thrill with those either",A Nightmare on Elm Street
439,bonnerjarrod,A great disappointment,2,4 May 2012,"I am in no way opposed to remakes. Not even horror remakes. Consider Carpenter's The Thing or Cronenberg's The Fly. They both improved on their source material.I love Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street but it's not a perfect film. The teenager portion lacks the authenticity of Halloween, probably because those sections in that film were written by a woman who had experience as a babysitter. That said, Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is at its core a superb horror film with a premise worthy of a 1920s silent film. The concept went downhill with the sequels, but Craven really exploited the possibilities of the idea of a cruel sadist with god-like powers in a surrealist playground environment.When I heard this film was being remade, I was frankly delighted. It was time for a new version, and yes, even a new actor. Englund was great but I wanted to see someone else in the role. When I found out Michael Bay's production company was involved, my heart sank. Then I found out they cast Jackie Earle Haley, and my hopes rose. Then I saw the trailer and felt pretty good about it, aside from the character redesign which looks more like one of the creatures from Pan's Labyrinth.Anyway, this film really failed for me. Freddy just didn't look right, and the teen portions this time are really annoying. The dream sequences just aren't the same. They rely more on CGI than practical effects. The Freddy-coming-out-of-the-wall image, for example, was unbelievable in the original, when it was simply done with latex and clever lighting. The remake relies on CGI which makes it look like a video game or a nightmare you'd have after watching a Dreamworks cartoon.Most everyone knows by now to stay away from this film and I suggest you heed everyone's warnings. I can't say anything else about this film other than it's not very good and what you'd expect from an early 90s music video director.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I was 11 when the original Nightmare came out in 84, so it's been some time since I've seen it so I wasn't going into the theater comparing it based on a memory of the original film.My biggest issue with the film is I didn't believe the actors who were playing the victims are really high school students. Even without looking at their real birth years, they just looked like college age kids in their 20's. If the characters were suppose to be college students, then fine, yet we all know the characters are in high school. I was sitting there thinking there is no way these are high school kids so it was hard for me to take that part seriously.Another technical aspect was you could tell that Jackie Earl Haley did a lot of ADR for this film. The tone/volume replacement was a little too loud. Something about it just didn't sit right with me.Overall I'll watch it again when it comes out on blu-ray.

There was nothing very powerful about any scene and they kinda made classic eerie scenes cheesy. To much killing, not enough time spent with the character to give a crap about them. Jackie Earle Haley was great but he was surrounded by a generic teen movie. They could have written some stronger characters and had less killing and it still could have been scary. I hate Micheal Bay so I'm not surprised he was involved and I didn't like it. I didn't hate it but I walked out feeling like I just saw a really long trailer.I would wait for DVD and not get your hopes up about this one. It seems Hollywood has forgotten how to scare people.

One thing I didn't like about this movie was that a few areas of scripts didn't make sense. Everyone knows that when people sleep, they have dreams. In this case, people slept way too easily. I do know that they're tired though but there are just a few activities and scenes that I wouldn't fall asleep in no matter how tired I am. And one more thing I think this movie could've done better with is the remake of Freddy himself, he looks more like a mummy than a human that's burnt. Other than those issues, I really enjoyed the movie!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
444,Blackhawk1989,Stunningly unimaginative,1,11 May 2010,"The first Nightmare on elm street brought some much needed creativity to the slasher franchise, bringing some great special effects, innovative kills and a fun new villain. The fact that the remake kills all three of these within the first half an hour of viewing is testmony to how low the remake culture has brought horror. Characters are flat and unintresting, the cgi looks conciderably cheaper than even early 90's films, and whilst Freddy was given the perfect casting, he was given so little to play with that a legendary horror icon comes across as simply dull. The additiion of realistic burns only make it even harder for freddy to be expressive or interesting.Almost nothing in this movie comes across as scary, randomly playing out loud noises when the killer appears isn't frightening by most films standards, and simply strings together sequences as the director ticks off every horror cliché in the book. Its almost impossible to shake off the feeling that the movie was written by someone who had heard of the nightmare on elm street franchise but never bothered to sit down and watch it.The nightmare franchise gave horror in the eighties a much needed kick up the arse, sadly its not the franchise to do the same to stagnating torture and remake cuture today, avoid.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

He has the look of being freshly burned because he's a nightmare creature and he can be anything he wants and that's freaky looking. Plus he spouts hilarious gallows humor. Remake = A pervy gardener gets burned alive and comes back looking for revenge on the teenagers he traumatized as kids, he scares them with some weird gravely southern accent & has the look of someone who was burned and his skin healed up for a few years, WTF? The whole thing looks like it was put together by first year film students. Every character is boring & every remade scene is worse, less intense, and less creative than the original. Thanks for ruining freddy, A holes. Possibly worse than the Psycho remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
447,TheFewSick,Jumpscare on Lame Street,1,1 May 2010,"I figured this would be an entertaining remake if nothing else, I was wrong. Dead wrong. There was a much richer mysterious element to the original film and to my surprise, much more creative. I thought the kills and nightmare sequences would be vastly improved upon, but alas, gigabytes, greenscreens and CGI cannot compete with hands-on creativity.The biggest question is of course whether a new Freddy is/was a good idea and I tried to give Jackie a chance; ultimately you can interchange actors playing Jason, Leatherface and Michael, they are suits and masks but you can't replace a personality. Known personalities such as Pinhead and Freddy Krueger ARE Robert Englund and Doug Bradley with prosthetics. Robert Englund brought us a believably creepy and demented sadistic killer where Jackie looked and acted like a pedophile. There were a handful of lines I enjoyed such as the 'body dying but brain living on' speech, but the rest seemed like plagiarized, recycled and poorly delivered lines selectively stolen from all the Nightmare films. (ex. Robert's ""Your eyes say no, no, but your body says yes, yes."" From Freddy vs. Jason)I don't understand why everything needs to be explained in full now. I hate that. I didn't need to know what the force was, Michael Myers mom was a stripper? Oh, okay, his killing is justified. I don't care that Jason Voorhees played hockey and was prolific in archery and I don't care that Leatherface has no nose. Some things are more frightening if you don't know why or aren't given a chronological map of where everything went wrong. Where was the creepy nightmare goat in this film? Did they have to cut the sequence showing a young Fred Krueger as a goat-herder on his family farm? In the 1984 film, what Freddy did with kids was implied but never told in full. That gives the viewer the right to view him in any matter, even as an anti-hero. The new film stamps it on your forehead that he was doing unsavory things to children which more or less made me sick and made the character less likable. (I always did find it funny that Freddy had such a cult following and appeal with kids as a child killer, but it worked. Here it does not.) The CGI becomes a distraction here; it's when things look too perfect that they lose believability such as Freddy bending the wall above Nancy. The original was creepier and it was produced in camera. The kills were boring. ""I fall asleep, Freddy shows up, Freddy says something, I'm stabbed, I'm dead."" Remember Rod (1984) being slowly strangled by bed sheets? That was scary, creative and left people thinking that perhaps Nancy was imagining Krueger and that Rod had hung himself. The new 'Nancy in the bathtub' scene was a boring cop-out and seemed more or less to be suggesting that it could be frightening. Even Tina's death being dragged across the ceiling was more vicious and sadistic in the original. EVERY 'scare' in this film is the cliché loud music and somebody jumping into frame.I couldn't care less about the kids in this film, they are bratty and almost apathetic/nihilistic to the idea that they were being stalked in their sleep. Forget about brewing coffee in your closet, these kids are popping pills and using needles to stay awake this go around. I didn't buy that they were sleep deprived as the actors had shaggy or ratty hair and clothes, baggy eyes and looked strung out on heroin since the beginning of the film. The unnecessary 30 second video blog cameo by the likable Asian stoner from the Friday the 13th remake was the only time anyone seemed like they wanted to live.The simplified story, CG, and casting aren't the only problems, the screenplay seems to be jumbled as certain characters have been blended and displaced. The 'Tina' character or 'Kris' in this film seems to take on most of Nancy's research early on in the film imposing the belief that she was the lead actress. I'm not sure if that was the goal of the screenwriter, but it wasn't a very clever or effective trick if that was the intent. The altogether renaming of the characters and traits begs the question of why even do it in the first place? Why not just make a new sequel with a great script and high production value?This film, to me, was more like a terrible modern high school cliff-notes adaptation than a remake. It brought nothing new to the table and improved on nothing. As a film it was outperformed on every level by it's 26 year old predecessor. I truly hope this dies terribly at the box-office and that talk of a sequel gets slashed from the mouths of New Line and producers of this sacrilege. Shame on everyone involved in this crap. Even the worst sequel to the original series has more entertainment value.I am not a purest, I was looking forward to this and I have enjoyed most of the remakes to a certain degree.Avoid.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
448,They-Call-Me-Steve,Fartsicle,2,3 May 2010,"Where do I start? Let me say I don't usually write reviews (this is my first on IMDb) and I'm not a ""fanboy"". I liked the original NOES, loved part 3, the rest I could take or leave. While my expectations weren't exactly high, I did go into this with a positive attitude. I don't have a problem with remakes in general, but I do when it feels like no more than a quick money grab. So, without spending all my words comparing it to the original, this is my review ...First, with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley (Freddy), the cast was terrible. The characters were uninteresting. Not one of them made any impact on me or added anything special to this movie whatsoever. The acting ranged from mediocre to bad. Kyle Gallner (Quentin) has that sickly aids patient look to him, much like the dude from Twilight, so I can only assume he was cast in an attempt to bring in that crowd. He wasn't terrible, but he's like a bootleg version of the Twilight guy, who is average at best in his own right. Rooney Mara (Nancy) was okay but she doesn't have the charisma to play the lead role, or she didn't here at least. The other kids were forgettable plus most of them looked too old to still be in high school. The parents were almost nonexistent and very robotic. Now, being a slasher flick, I don't expect anything Oscar worthy. I do however expect a little emotion and some charm from time to time.Second, the writing felt like it was thrown together. Paint-by-numbers script. The dialog was boring. The story was only decent due to it's source material, but even then they dulled it down. There's really not much else I can say about that because they really didn't offer much to begin with. Very flat.Third, and probably what I disliked most about this movie was the editing. It had ugly special effects for the most part, which in 2010 there is really no excuse for. The quick jump scenes added for cheap thrills mostly felt out of place, but what's worse, it's an already overused gimmick these days and done poorly here. The pacing while not slow exactly, although quite boring, didn't make a whole lot of sense at times. Not in a confusing way, more in a pointless sort of way. There was no intensity or build up. Sometimes the pacing of certain movies benefit greatly from a directors cut (think Daredevil or the Rob Zombie Halloween remake. Those directors cuts were superior to the theatrical). I'd recommend it for this movie as well if I didn't think Samuel Bayer sucked so bad as a movie director.Forth, I like when remakes or adaptations, with respect to it's source material, can bring something new to the table and stand alone. Dawn of the Dead is a great example of that. Super Mario Bros is a good example of what not to do. NOES falls somewhere in between. It mostly stayed true to the original, but it offered nothing better. No fresh take. Blown opportunity. I've already forgotten the new music score completely, whereas the original movie had one of the greatest horror scores I ever heard. I don't mind that they changed Freddy's origin around slightly or how they changed it, but they did a lousy job of incorporating it. I don't mind the use of modern special effects, in fact it's encouraged, but again they missed the mark. As for Jackie Earle Haley, I liked his version of Freddy. It's pretty much the only redeemable factor in this movie. Still, he wasn't as cool a Freddy as Robert Englund (not many could be I suppose), though that's probably due to having very little to work with. The best comparison I can make is this : the original was a cultural icon, the remake was lazy, forgettable, formula film making.Bottom line, I give this a 2 out of 10. Call me unreasonable all you you like, but really when I struggle to find a single positive thing to say about a movie (especially a movie that would normally be right up my alley) then what would you expect me to rate it? By the way, that extra star it gets was earned by Jackie Earle Haley alone, otherwise I'd give it a 1.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
449,gottahustle,"Great Re-Imagining, Did the Franchise justice!",8,21 October 2011,"From the opening of this film, they jump right into it, you see Freddy within the first 10 minutes, which i feel was a great move. I am a huge fan of the series of old films so i was holding this to a certain standard. Yes the old films are a bit dated, but i saw them when they were released. The new way they portrayed Freddy was more appropriate for the times. Making him a pedophile that got away, instead of a murderer that got away when he was alive was way more believable. They followed a lot of the outline from the original film but took a few liberty's, and as a hardcore fan, they were good choices as far as I'm concerned. There are a lot of scary jump out at you moments, the music for scary parts are spot on! The whole feel of the movie is true to the original franchise. This film was better than the Friday the 13th remake as far as sticking to the originals feel. I fully recommend this to any Nightmare on Elm Street fan.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
450,digiphorik,Such a shame... no way near as good as the original!!,1,7 May 2010,"Anyone who's seen the original will agree this was an awful money making remake of a classic horror which could have been amazing but it just wasn't...Seriously, if i had the chance to remake a movie like this.. it would have been awesome...So much was missed out by this director.. the casting was terrible, the acting was lame, the story was choppy, there was no background build up with the characters at all so I really couldn't care less when they started to die. There was hardly any nightmarish scenes with Freddy being mensing which I obviously expected and was really looking forward too. Instead of creepy acting and eerie scenes the director just decided to overdo the music score to build up tension which just didn't have the desired affect and was obviously just to cover up the flat acting and equally flat script. The guy who played Freddy was OK I suppose but he just wasn't scary enough to look at and didn't really creep me out as much as Robert Englund did.The whole charade was lacking everything I liked about the first Nightmare On Elm Street movie due to the complete lack of vision and story telling by the director.Throughout the whole movie I had my head in my hands thinking "" WHY OH WHY IS IT THAT NO GOOD DIRECTOR EVER GETS THE CHANCE TO REMAKE CLASSICS LIKE THIS...WHY??""I think it should be a rule in future by which all remakes of horrors MUST be as good as or better than the original in order to be released. I mean, it must obvious to them and everybody around them when they make a dud movie which is blatantly going to flop?? All be it after after raking in some initial cash at the box office of course before fading out into a forgettable mess..So many classic horrors get remade by rubbish directors who just have no idea or loyalty to the original masterpieces. They have no idea how to set a scary scene at all.. such a shame... could've been great.. but it was a terrible and very forgettable money making piece of steaming crap.Will all Michael Bay's and other similar phonies please sit down and stay down because my Granny could do a better job than you lot!!Rant over...Whats next...

451,krissymaried,"I can't believe I'm doing this, but....",8,15 May 2010,"....I'm actually giving this a good review. I don't particularly LIKE the remake yet, but hear me out on this one. When the remake first came out in theatres, I knew I had to see it, even though I was sure I wouldn't like it. Just one of those things. But I also knew, that since I like the originals so much, there was no way I'd be able to watch this movie as openly as I should. And that really wouldn't be fair. Enter my boyfriend. He loves horror movies, but is not big on slasher-type ones. As a result, he's never seen the Nightmare films, Halloween, or Friday the 13th. (Believe me, I've tried to remedy this) In this instance, though, it's actually a good thing! He's a complete blank slate. He doesn't even know the basic background of what Freddy Krueger is. So we watched the original at home, then went to the theatre directly afterwards to see the remake. When it was over, I was all disgruntled, hating it. But I didn't say anything about my opinion, and just asked him what he thought. He loved the remake! Said he liked that Freddy actually seemed to have a personality in the remake, that in the original he felt Freddy was more amusing then generally creepy. He also said that while he didn't like the special effects in the new one as much, he did feel that Nancy was more likable and more cute. He also mentioned that he felt the old Freddy seemed ""kind of unintelligent"" in comparison to the new one. I was horrified! I particularly hated the long back story explaining Freddy's past, because, duh, everyone knows it already. When I voiced this, he pointed out that people like him didn't know it already. And that he thinks that a remake is made to make old movies more accessible so people like him can watch them for the first time easier. I get his point. And the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is actually a GOOD movie - just one I'm not able to appreciate right now. And the second thing that bothered me most about the movie, making Freddy a pedophile,turns out that they meant to do that in the original anyway, according to the trivia here. I'm definitely giving it another chance sometime soon; and just looking back on it, not comparing it to the old one I'm so used to, I think it really does deserve those 8 stars.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Sure, no one can fully replace Robert Englund but Jack Earle Haley did a terrific job! He actually creeped me out at times. He was darker and more evil than Englund, who was cheesy.The originals acting wasn't good. Even Johnny Depp was okay at best. This movie however had great acting from everybody.I really enjoyed all the characters, even Kris who you didn't get to know very well. When Jesse died, I actually felt devastated. I've seen plenty of horror films, but his was the saddest I've seen. The way it flashed back to dream world and he was hanging upside down and Freddy said something along the lines of ""The brain is still active for 7 minutes after the heart stops. You still have 6 minutes"" and Jesse is still slightly moving was actually very hard to watch.Quentin and Nancy were very likable too. I cheered them on and was so happy they both survived! The pace of the movie was perfect and it had a perfect amount of blood. It wasn't too much, and it wasn't too little.Best of all, there was no nudity! Anything sexual was from talking about Freddy who they made a pedo in this film.Freddy did have one or two wise cracks in this film but it was still an excellent job of a remake!

456,xxjennyfajaxx,"One, Two, Freddy's coming for you... Three, Four, but it's... such a bore...",5,16 May 2010,"Much to my delight, whilst I was browsing Youtube last October, I randomly typed in 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' to recall my nostalgic memories of the film and what appeared in front of me was 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010', and after confirming the trailers in the website were accurate and real, I was overjoyed. Not because by the time the film came to the cinema I was actually old enough to go and see it on the big screen, but the fact that producers such as Michael Bay had re-created my all-time favourite horror film. I had seen Bay's work for 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' re-make in 2003, and couldn't help but feel excited about the idea. However. When I went to see the new 'Nightmare On Elm Street', I couldn't help but feel disappointed. Yes, I had been forewarned about the dreaded results of a 'new and improved' version of a classical film after hearing dreadful reviews about the re-make of 'Friday The 13th' and 'The Omen', but I taught myself to ignore the desperate cries of dismay from these examples. And I regret it. So, the plot is very basic: A bunch of teenagers are haunted by a maniac in their dreams. Couldn't be simpler. That's what I love about that particular plot. It's psychological horror. The fact that the deaths occur in their dreams are much scarier since anything can happen in dreams, in which we don't, naturally, expect to happen in real-life situations. Yet, here is where the movie went down-hill. If you've seen the original movie and it's many sequels, you know what to expect. It's tedious and rather annoying the fact that the film runs in a particular order: Night, then day. A funeral. Then night. Then day. Then night. Then day. So horror fans, overall, become bored during the daytime shots, eager for Freddy to appear to scare the living Hell out of us. As for Jackie Earle Haley - He was... sufficient as Freddy Krueger. I'm not saying he is BRILLIANT, because he does have flaws. If you've seen the previous 'Nightmare In Elm Street' films and read the books based on the franchise (""Suffer The Children"" by David Bishop in particular) you can easily visualise Robert Englund saying the dialogue and doing the actions instead of Haley. For example, in ""Suffer The Children"", Freddy's dialogue is rather much like Englund's characterisation of Freddy - no offence to Haley's acting, but I could NEVER imagine Haley's portray of Freddy Krueger saying particular lines in his deliberately slow, low-pitched voice. It was as though every line and action for Freddy Krueger was specifically made for Englund, and Englund only. There's his flaw - Haley deliberately slows down the action of the film. For example, when he chases Kris in her garden... sorry, did I use the word 'Chase'? I actually meant 'stood there behind her deceased dog - killed by him - whilst she made a run for it'. I beg his pardon, but what happened to the tension in this scene? Because it is NOTHING like Freddy and Tina in the original, where he actually taunts her by chasing her slightly and appearing out of random places, and actually trying to slash her whilst they wrestled on the ground. And when Quentin appears in Freddy's world, Freddy doesn't jump on him and slice Quentin to pieces - like he SHOULD do - he instead shakes Quentin about shouting, ""YOU. CAN'T. SAVE. HER!"", and only after Nancy arrives in his world after about 5 minutes of menacing glares between the two characters, Freddy then decides to lean towards Quentin and whisper, ""Tag... you're it"", and - FINALLY - slice Quentin on his chest. What happened to the Freddy Krueger we once knew who attempted to kill somebody at every chance he had? Where he claimed his success by slicing a pillow in the original movie whilst battling Nancy, in which the feathers of the pillow obscured our point-of-view, but he STILL tried to kill Nancy regardless, and we all knew it. However... I'm not saying Haley's characterisation of Freddy Krueger is all gloom-and-doom/End-of-the-world. There are a few interesting aspects to this. For example, he doesn't emphasise the black comedy in dreams where he deliberately went to extreme lengths to torture teenagers through specific dreams where the teenagers' interests are reflected for example, a jock = A dream which involves football where they are killed, which we see in the numerous sequels. No, in the re-make, the dreams all refer to a nursery and the characters are killed in slightly unexpected ways. Another factor which was slightly interesting was the surprisingly intriguing sexual attractions between Freddy and Nancy. In my opinion, I found this quite amusing particularly when Freddy asked Nancy what game she wanted to play to which she replied ""Fuck you!"", and he replied, ""Ooh, sounds like fun! It's a bit fast for me, though"". This builds to the background of the plot where Nancy was alarmingly sexually abused by Freddy before he was burnt to death, in which Freddy never forgot her. The final scene in the film where Freddy nearly rapes Nancy, in my opinion, was quite dramatic if not slightly predictable, but it DID distract us slightly and engaged our curiosity over what would happen next. Not to mention hints of humour within the script which are quite hard to grasp at the particular moments. In conclusion, yes I was rather disappointed by the film, overall. However, those who did not have the advantage of seeing the original or haven't seen it yet, I suppose the re-make would be OK for that particular audience. But perhaps I am slightly exaggerating - I admit there ARE some scary bits in the films which are slightly unexpected the majority of the time, and the plot is quite stable, and it is quite easy to get into.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The effects were 80's and the makeup on Mr Haley's face did not do justice to the character. At least if you're going to do everything else 80's try and make the character at least look like the monster we all know and love. I watched the movie but went out feeling like I paid for nothing.

463,ultra_kid,Not nearly as bad as many would have you believe,6,11 May 2010,"I'm confused. It would seem the critics and a number of supposed fans of the original NOES franchise decided long before this was released that they were going to hate this movie. I just don't understand this complete loathing of Hollywood choosing to remake horror films. The original is still there and available should you choose to watch it again. To the fans out there, if you're so averse to the idea of a remake, don't watch it. It's not mandatory. To me, it reeks of snobbery. Although I'm yet to see a remake that's actually improved on the original, some have come close.Let's be honest, the original Friday the 13th was dire. Untypically, whilst still generally rubbish, a few of its many sequels actually bettered it. The remake too was awful, but not a great deal more so than its 1980 counterpart.The only saving grace of the original Amityville Horror was that it was supposedly based on fact. The film, in actual fact, was distinctly average. The remake too was just about average.On the other hand, take two of Craven's films that have been subjected to remakes – The Hills have Eyes and The Last House on the Left. I loved these two growing up but neither have aged particularly well. OK, so neither remake was too great, but they were both watchable and serviceable horror films. I could go on, but you get the gist.Whilst I can't think of any good reason why a horror film should be remade, nor can I think of any good reason why not. Who cares? If it works, great. If it doesn't, so be it. Heaps horror films being released these days that aren't remakes are dreadfully sub-standard, so a failed remake just needs adding to that list. The supposed classic horror film you love isn't suddenly going to become dreadful just because a below-par reboot is made.Let's make this clear – I loved the original NOES. I saw it when I was 10 years old and it scared me stupid. Incredibly, it still scares me today and is one of my favourite horror films. It was flawed, for reasons I've gone into on previous posts, but the principal reason behind its effectiveness was its truly brilliant villain – Freddy Krueger. I've watched all six sequels a number of times and have witnessed the decline in the quality of the films and, most notably, the decline of Freddy's scare-factor. He transformed from a horribly terrifying baddie in the first two into a spiteful and cr@p stand-up comic who happened to murder hapless teens in increasingly elaborate ways. Before the remake was even thought about, Freddy had already died a slow and horrible death thanks to a number of pitiful sequels. Consequently, to me, there was nothing to lose in an up-to-date reboot...NOES 2010 undoubtedly isn't as good as the original and isn't nearly as effective in horror terms, but as remakes go, it's the best I've seen. Like the original, it's flawed, but for different reasons. Whilst I don't agree it was bad, the CGI was unnecessary. It wasn't required in 1984 (it obviously wasn't an option), so it shouldn't be now. Freddy coming through the wall and Tina being dragged around the bedroom were classic scenes and they've been ruined this time-around by this apparent necessity to use modern technology. Furthermore, the death scenes weren't particularly inspired and were surprisingly simple and unimaginative for 2010. However, this is where the negatives end.I was expecting to thoroughly dislike the characters, but I didn't. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't too fussed about them either, but they weren't the deplorable bunch of fools we saw from NOES3 onwards. The dream sequences were sufficiently sinister. The back story, whilst somewhat off-kilter with the original, was good. The film too ultimately made more sense this time-around. Finally, Freddy. Nobody does it better than Robert Englund in the original, but Haley was as good as one could have hoped. He looked good and scary, kept the humour to a minimum and was unquestionably the foreboding presence that Freddy should be. My only problem was with the voice – too much echo.This film gets an A for effort and a B- for execution. It was never going to go down well with the critics, nor it seems with a number of fans of the original. Granted, it could have been better but it could also have been a whole lot worse. Omitting the original, this would likely come first if I was to rate all the NOES films. I can hear the gasps from those hardcore NOES fans out there, but the truth is that the franchise was already bastardised a long time ago. The 2010 reboot has, if anything, reinvigorated it and reintroduced Freddy to a new generation as something he should be remembered for being – scary.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
464,dfiorentino415,an attempt of an unbiased review..for those who love the series and those new to it,10,6 April 2012,"I think it's a bit unfair to totally blast the movie if we are truly being unbiased. If i just try to watch through this as if the nightmare on elm street never happened I'd say it is a halfway decent flick. that being said, and being a huge fan of the franchise, it did not perform anywhere near my expectations and did not do the original great justice. The story was altered a bit, and their was lack of originality in the plot, but although Jackie Haley was no Robert Englund he did an impressive job as Freddy. He was dark and evil and there are mixed opinions on the realism approach to the burn scars on his face..but all that aside, Haley was a good choice to play Freddy. His performance should not go unrecognized regardless of the poor direction, writing, and substance of the rest of the movie. The tension, thrills, kills were lackluster and much of the acting was victim to the substance in the scripts. Not their fault. The best kills were exact kills we've seen with no artistic touches or creativity anywhere. Truly upsetting this was done with zero passion for the series and it's appeal. It's sole intent is cashing in on the times and nothing more. I do still think it was worth a watch..and for those who maybe never saw the first one..it wouldn't be as bad bc there would be no frame of reference to compare. I myself love Freddy the character but my favorites are the darker titles in the series. I enjoyed the first one, dream warriors, the concept of new nightmare was outstanding to keep the nightmare series interesting (i think it was genius but could have been done better maybe with more budget and fell victim to the more comedic less serious entries to the series), and yes i did enjoy Freddy vs Jason just because it was cool to see those two stories intertwined and the fight scenes were nice. I watched that movie with a less then serious approach and it's probably why I was able to truly enjoy it. I feel watching this nightmare on elm street remake or reboot should be viewed with little expectation to enjoy it. If you expect too much you will be disappointed but if you realize it is the 9th installment, remakes are usually not as good, and Wes craven was not involved, then try to watch it with a less analytical/comparing approach. It was worth watching Jackie Haley's performance...I just wish some of the other parts of the formula such as direction, writing, etc were in different hands. As said earlier, it seemed more of a cashing in on the times with a classic of old and nothing more...no passion to do it right. American movies have become formulas re used, classic stories done again and again, or international stories applied to our culture. The problem to me is NO ORIGINALITY or UNIQUENESS ANYMORE..or not much at least. Where is the want to try something different and show us something that's yours. Christopher Nolan's vision and portrayal of the darker more comic book like Batman was phenomenal. It's OK if great stories are told again but what makes it YOURS?",A Nightmare on Elm Street
465,photoguru22,Not as bad as people say,6,3 November 2021,Wasn't bad. I don't know why internet critics expect remakes to be masterpieces and almost as good as the original. Its not gonna happen so let it go and just enjoy. It was entertaining with a decent cast and lots of nods to the original.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
466,MoLetalis,Better than the original,6,20 April 2019,"I've watched the 1984 version several times, and I never thought of Elm Street as a really scary movie. The concept is scary yes, but the execution was poor; Krüger was too jokey for me and there were some really bad special effects, combined with an awful synthesiser soundtrack. Not sure why it became such a cult classic tbh.I recently discovered they did a remake in 2010 and I'm probably one of the only people who actually enjoyed it. Yes there are several things we have already seen before, and no it's not a perfect movie. But I like the new take on Freddy. In the originals he was just sort of there without a real purpose, and here they actually try to build a story around him. Jump scares are apparently seen as something negative, but if executed right, they actually make the movie (especially a slasher like Elm Street) more suspenseful.Some remakes don't work (Friday the 13th, Hitcher), this one did for me.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
467,jonas33333,At Least This Movie Should Guarantee No Further NOEM Remakes!,1,2 May 2010,"If you watch this, you will discover that this movie, unlike the original, is completely forgettable. If the original movie NEVER came out and this was entirely new - it would fail miserably as there is nothing memorable about it. To be fair, you should know that the original Nightmare on Elm Street is my All-Time favorite movie ever made. When I first saw it at the age of 17 - 4 years after it's making - I was instantly in love. I watched it over 100 times in a short period. I memorized every word, every inflection in the entire film. I made a cassette recording of the movie so that I could play it at all times, including while I slept!For those that sadly don't know:The original movie is considered one of the finest highlights of the horror genre, even today. (NOEM 2 was terrible - the rest had highs and lows) The movie told a very chilling story of a fiendish child MURDERER and the fact that he was killing from the dream world was a whole new terrifying idea. The Lead character of Nancy Thompson is known as an ideal example of the female victim who becomes a powerfully strong heroine. It also served as the launchboard for Johnny Depp. This 2010 ""version"" is so far from the original and has no coherent plot, awful character development, boring characters, underdeveloped death scenes, poor writing and lines, bland acting, plot holes and blatantly corrupts the original Freddy villain. This movie relies on a few, decent special effects and lots of ""Surprise! Scares"" to get you through the 135 minutes of play. I wanted to leave out of boredom. The leading characters of Quentin and Nancy (why they changed everyone's names but Nancy's and Freddy's I have no idea.) are sorry Emo-based lackluster humans that happen to be going through this ordeal. Edward and Bella (because they clearly are trying to achieve connections to those characters for some ridiculous reason) bear no resemblance to the interesting characters from the original that one could actually relate to. This version's Nancy claims ""she doesn't fit in"" but not only is there nothing to indicate this, it's simply pointless. And she's soooo boring! After listening to her mumbles and dull angst for an hour, I wanted her to die. She was clearly trying to channel something between Kristen Stewart and Zooey Deschanel - of whom I hate both. Quentin volleys all around from ""loser"" to ""caring boyfriend"" to ""misunderstood"" somehow without retaining any character at all. At one point he makes a change of heart that makes no sense whatsoever. I have to wonder if the actors even bothered to watch the original. Freddy. Freddy Krueger was a filthy child MURDERER that worked in a boiler room. He was NOT - (here's the ?spoiler?) a pedophile or child molester that worked in a preschool. This film makes him out to be just that. In fact, nowhere in this movie does it even indicate that he ever killed a child before the parents got him. That they changed this fact completely infuriates me and undoubtedly countless other fans. Are they trying to alter the way today's youth perceives this villain? Do they think that simply being a child murderer is not scary enough? Or perhaps that's considered too scary now. Way to ruin one of the best villains of all time. And to think I was angry that Robert Englund was not going to play Freddy - Now I'm so glad he's not in this movie!!! As far as his look goes - Yuck! He's a cross between a melted cat and an alien Grey. His persona is yucky-creepy and disgusting rather than powerful,terrifying and scary-creepy. His lines mostly fail and his voice lacks character. The original Freddy had substance - all the characters did actually. Horrible!What a sad/poor choice to lose the parents as interesting characters. All the parents of the original both maintained and supported the story while in this one, remain unconvincingly concerned and once again, boring. I mean, I didn't expect anyone to be able to live up to Ronee Blakely, but you could have tried to have SOME sort of connection to Marge Thompson. And apparently, Nancy just lacks a father..somehow. Way lame. The only - and I mean only - decent aspect of this movie goes to the camera/special effect teams. The boiler room had the right ambiance although there was little reason to have a boiler room when Freddy is based in a preschool... The TRANSITIONS into the dream sequences were nicely done and actually echo the way some dreams can be. The recreated scenes from the original were good, but I felt robbed at the bathtub scene - at least in the original we got to see some of what was supposed to be Nancy's boobs. I'm not sure what clenched the R rating for this film. It certainly wasn't most of the death scenes. At any rate I don't want the camera/special effects people to suffer job-wise from this travesty as they did good work.So lastly, do yourself a favor and just watch the original Nightmare on Elm Street. You don't need this garbage. Oh, and who the hell falls asleep, micro-naps or not, while swimming laps in a pool???",A Nightmare on Elm Street
468,superchunk5000,Like Sweet Tea With Saccharin,4,2 May 2010,"As a big fan of the recent remakes of Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes and the first twenty minutes of Friday the 13th, I was geared up to love this one. I enjoyed the original Nightmare and truly had no issue with the fact that Robert Englund wasn't involved. The idea was to start fresh and Jackie Haley is a very capable actor, who did a fine job.Low expectations in hand, I walked in with an open mind and walked out with an open wound. A feeling not unlike the one I had leaving the latest installment of Indiana Jones: emptiness and disappointment.This Nightmare(ish) remake is a paint-by-numbers, uninspired story, filled with on-the-nose dialogue and a parade of boo scares. I was surprised there wasn't a 'screeching cat jumping in the window' scene just for good measure. How is it possible that the effects and makeup were better in 1984? Really? This was a story primed for a reboot and someone with a sense of story, character and suspense could have hit it out of the park. Unfortunately, it was no more than a broken-bat single. Maybe not the worst of the series, but when you get the original story to work with and land behind ""Freddy vs. Jason"" something has gone awry.I've heard a handful of teenagers comment on how much they liked this movie, so maybe that is the age group that will find it appealing. They deserve better.A side note: One of the college kids behind me dozed off during the movie. The irony of falling asleep during 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' says it all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

470,nadmtg,I don't understand the hate here...,8,15 April 2015,"First things first: this is not the Freddy Robert Englund gave us. Robert Englund was a cynical horror villain that can't be topped in his role. That is why they didn't try to top him. They reinvented him. In this adaptation, we see a more monstrous Freddy Krueger, with hints of the original. Instead of the creative and playful style of the original Krueger, we now see a more direct, vengeful, and downright scary version of Freddy. The movie plot certainly stays true to the original in how everything works, but this Nightmare focuses on the basics: stay awake or die. Period. Sure the deaths weren't as creative, but like I said before, Freddy is more direct in this one. He doesn't toy with you. He goes for the kill quickly. Let's get to the face and voice though... one look at this Freddy gives you the impression he is dead serious on his mission. The original Freddy looks burned, but in a way that was meant to look cool. They don't go for that this time... this Freddy looks REALLY burnt, making him look more sinister... but still keeping to the idea of the original. The voice, while simply sounding angry and sometimes taunting in the originals, was replaced with an evil, mostly calm, and satisfyingly scary voice... one that reminds you how dark this villain is really supposed to be.While you can never replace the original Nightmare on Elm Street, nor Robert Englund, this is an enjoyable new take on Freddy that I personally liked a lot. Sorry to all you haters but I think you were expecting an intricate story or something, and that's not what these movies were ever about. That or you were expecting someone trying to act like Englund, which I would have seen as a simple ripoff. 8 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I liked how dark it was, I liked how they toyed with Craven's original idea of Freddy Krueger being a pedophile. Jackie Earle Haley also did a great job as Freddy, his voice was pretty cool imo.Now the flaws: This is supposed to be a remake/re-imagining, so I understood it was supposed to be a little different, but I don't get why they changed the names of all the characters, except for Freddy and Nancy, who actually didn't really keep her name. Just the first. For some reason, they changed her last name to Holbrook, I didn't really care for that idea. Other than that, I didn't think of a lot of flaws, but it really wasn't really amazing.

While the acting was good and the new Freddy was good. The new look of Freddy and the special effects are awesome that isn't the bad part.The bad part is them rewriting the origin story...Fred Krueger was an employee of Springwood Power Plant who had his child taken away from him and then killed the children of the parents who helped them do so as payback. The parents chase him down and burn him alive for it and he makes a deal with dream demons be the dream slayer, where he again goes after the future kids of those from Elm Street in Springwood...and so on and so forth his horizons broaden as the series goes on.Now for the rewritten origin story...Fred works as a gardener for a local preschool where he does unknown things to the children that attend...it only hints at first for him being a child molester but more of a mutilator as it shows a few quick images of scars on a child and claw like slashes in the upper torso of a dress. Then at the end they truly make it apparent he was a child molester by not showing pictures but making it known he had a lot of them of Nancy...I gave this 2 stars because of the acting...if that had not been any good I would have not even given it that because of it's blatant hatred of Wes Craven's story.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

475,Halloweenfan23,"Tries to be original, but falls flat in a few areas",6,1 May 2010,"Let's get one thing straight before I start in: I love the Nightmare on Elm Street series and I like some of the new remakes of old horror films (yeah, I enjoyed Halloween and Friday The 13th, but RZ killed Halloween 2). After viewing this new take on Nightmare on Elm Street, I left feeling like it was rushed.The film takes parts of the original films (Freddy of course, having a heroine named Nancy living with a single parent, and of course a few all to familiar scenes), but adds enough new things to make it fresh and somewhat interesting. However, you must bare with the first thirty grueling minutes to get to the good stuff.We start out with Dean sitting in the Springwood Diner (a nice nod to Nightmares 4 and 5) while having a nightmare. He gets his hand sliced by Freddy and wakes up to Nancy telling him if he falls asleep again, he's going to be kicked out. In comes Kris (re: Tina) who believes Dean's story and then watches him slice his own throat open in the middle of a waking nightmare. We are also introduced to Quentin (re: Glenn) and Jesse (re: Rod). Quentin has a crush on Nancy and Jesse is Kris's ex boyfriend. After a funeral scene (much like Rod's in the original NOES), we learn that Nancy has been having bad dreams too. Quentin tells Jesse that he needs to leave her alone, but as we'll find out, both boys are also being visited by Freddy in their sleep too.Now, we end up with two blatant rip offs from the first film. The first is Freddy coming out of the wall while Nancy sleeps and the second is Kris's death which is just like Tina's, but involves more body slamming and less cuts. I was beginning to give up by this point, and they had already given Freddy some lame jokes. Sorry, but only Robert Englund can do Freddy humor right, this new guy just doesn't hit the spot.Jesse ends up in a juvenile center for the murder of Kris, and ends up dying.... now this is where it gets fun. First off, his death scene is just down right awesome. Then, out of no where, Freddy gets really evil. I mean downright scary evil....no jokes, just a very vengeful boogie man. With all their friends now dead, Quentin and Nancy decide to get to the bottom of the mystery of who's killing their friends in their sleep. They stumble on an old photo of a preschool class and find out they were all in school together, but have no recollection of ever meeting before middle school/high school. This is when it got REALLY good for me.At first you think Freddy was killed wrongfully and that he's killing the kids as revenge for the parents burning him alive. Freddy is made out to have been a janitor at the preschool who loved children more than anything and was a good hearted guy....but then the truth comes out. Freddy was obsessed with Nancy and sexually abused her and the other kids in a hidden room in the preschool.Without giving away the ending, I will say that it does involve a chase through Nancy's home (and yes, sticky stairs, but much more elaborate) and yes, Freddy does come out into the real world. I will say that the end does leave the door open for a sequel much like the original did, but in a more violent way.The acting is pretty good for a group of up and coming actors and Jackie Earle Haley is a great new Freddy when he isn't trying to be funny. If you liked the original, don't go in expecting the little movie that could that Wes Craven made when you were a kid. It's a good attempt to reboot the series, but needs a bit more polish and a better first act to really shine. Not as bad as other remakes and if a sequel is made, it could be great if they cut the BS humor and make Freddy mean like he was in the original film. As I said, new Freddy is not cut out to be humorous.Overall a 6 out of 10.... go see as a matinée with your friends or with movie cash from that new NOES Blu-Ray disc... or just wait til it's a rental, but don't pay full evening show price, it's not worth $8 or more to watch on the big screen.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

When you see bad horror movies, at least you can have a good laugh or two... this was just plain boring. As regards the new Freddy, well, it's true that this makeup is more similar to what one expects to be a burnt face (seriously, who has seen a really burnt face?) but it's also true that the old makeup gave Robert Englund some way to act, to have some facial movements and memorable grins.

Especially if they have nothing new to bring to the table, in terms of story or character development? Even the worst Hollywood Horror Remakes (House of Wax, The Hills Have Eyes, etc.) Have SOME SORT of interesting twist to include, but this movie had none. It's as though Michael Bay was watching the original and thought to himself ""Man, I wish I had thought of this."" Then, instead of using his inspiration to go make something fresh and original, he just hijacked the classic franchise and then dulled it down to its most basic and crappy form. And now, when I refer to A Nightmare on Elm Street, I have to specify whether I mean A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) even though they're essentially the same thing. Now I have another question: When is the next ""genius"" in Hollywood going to ""reimagine"" 2001: A Space Odyssey? Or Pulp Fiction? And for that matter, when is Nickeback going to come out with their own version of Abbey Road?A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is a charming, entertaining and occasionally-terrifying romp. It is the Crown Jewel of a Golden Age of creative and energetic horror films. A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is a bastardized Hollywood rehash with no soul. It was completely pointless, even by Horror-Remake standards. Hollywood ran out of Japanese horror films to remake, and decent comic books to adapt, so now they've victimized another American Classic. There's one interesting sight gag, and they blow that load five minutes into scene one. The horror is not psychological, or even tangible. It is just a bunch of spooky, ominous whispering for minutes at a time, followed by the obligatory jump-scene, where the bad guy jumps out of nowhere, makes a startling hissing sound and the victim screams. The audience jumps, a bit, and then let's out a little giggle. But they're never actually scared. Cheap and Lame.Before the film started, they showed a preview for Robert Rodriguez' upcoming film ""Predators"" When the title flashed across the screen, I couldn't control myself. I shouted ""Boo!"" A few people in the theater laughed. I hope they were laughing because they feel the way I feel: I am sick of remakes, and prequels and sequels.

Freddy always had a sick twisted since of humor and would play with the people as much as possible.

Horrors movies are the one genre that is perhaps critic-proof because most people love to be scared. So it was a no brainer after the spate of recent remakes - Chainsaw, Friday the 13th, etc. - that Michael Bay would remake the most beloved of all the slasher flicks - Nightmare on Elm Street.I grew up with Freddy and even had a poster. People nowadays forget but Freddy movies were huge. Dream Warriors, was a big movie, for instance. The Fresh Prince even made a song.This new movie will soon be forgotten but it may cause kids to go rent the new one which has been re-released on Blu Ray. It had many, many iconic scenes: The goat, the arms that got longer, the blood in the bed scenes, the tongue on the phone, the bathtub scene, etc. None of the scenes in the new movie had any power, and the few that looked decent were lifted verbatim from Wes Craven's.The movie had no logic of its own to follow. The kids never drank coffee (or even Red Bull, for goodness sake.) All the sex was removed, along with the parents. In one laughable scene, a girl falls asleep to dream about Freddy - at her boyfriends' funeral after he was murdered. Stupid.I only saw this movie because it was showing at the drive-in and went with friends. All of us moaned and fidgeted. It was a horrible, horrible, film.Possible spoiler here.And Freddy did not molest children! He killed them. He was the boogey man. And yes, there is a distinction. Nancy as a hero - no more.

Especially since it was being done by the same people who remade Friday the 13th (which was horrendous). Then I saw that Jackie Earle Haley was playing Freddy and my nerves eased... a little.But for a remake, I would say it's a spectacular job. Most of the acting was decent and Haley made the movie for me. They didn't completely destroy the characters and even had some good thrills. I love Robert Englund and was glad the character that he brought to life wasn't beaten to death by the remake.

483,Hylia,The Nightmare on Elm Street Returns!,10,14 May 2010,"This was hands-down, the best horror movie remake I have ever seen. It had all the right ingredients, a frightening antagonist, a scary story and well made characters to boot! It starts on the titular Elm Street where a group of teenagers including the infamous Nancy are all bonded by a strange event that occurred in their past, one that they cannot remember. To refresh their memory, enter Freddy Krueger the Nightmare of Elm Street. Once a gardener at a preschool turned child molester, he has come back from death to haunt the dreams of the children belonging to the parents who burned him alive all those years ago. He kills them in various ways, from making one girl thrash on the ceiling of her room, to stabbing a boy through the chest in a jail cell. All the kills are creative as are the ways in which he comes to haunt them before he does them in. There are several nods to the original Wes Craven classic, including the bathtub scene and the bedroom kill scene. All the kills however involve the gruesome clawed glove for which Krueger is best known. The movie itself had many good jump scares, most of which were effective enough to cause me to jump a few times. Some of the scenes where you see Freddy haunting the teenagers were well done as well. A great example of amazing blurring between the Dream world and Reality is the pharmacy scene. In this scene Nancy is trying to go into the pharmacy to find Quentin when she suddenly has a micro-nap and is forced to run from Freddy as the pharmacy becomes a dank boiler room around her. She manages to escape from Freddy but she is forever scarred as she finds out that she was his ""Number One"". I also loved the scenes that showed Freddy's past. It made Krueger almost likable, one might even say pitiable, until you find out his disgusting secret. He was molesting the children of Elm Street by taking them to his ""secret cave"". The scene where he is burned alive and is running out of the boiler room on fire is also quite striking. All in all this is a great movie! GO FREDDY!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
484,feedbackfrommrroy,"Regarding the expectation, everything is «less»; for the worst and the best",5,3 May 2010,"As John Huston said, «why don't we remake some of our bad pictures and make them good? », at the opposite of the usual. And this one is no exception.From the very beginning, even the opening credits is less catchy than the original; pretty announcing what is going to happened with the whole flick... Not as gore as we can expect (and as the original film was), that straight line means two things : less spectacular but they (the production) avoid the try-to- impress-cheaply-by- over-toping-everything (which require good taste that we not so often cross on the boulevard of horror movies remake; hail to the prod). But there's another thing in the «less» list that we regret; it's way less scary. Yes, your going to jump a couple of times, but you're not set in a scary mood. We also got to notice that the original «Nightmare» is a bit hard to top, «less» to say. They keep a couple of stuff from the original but in less effective.At my huge (and I mean huge) surprise, there's no useless-sex-between-teens scene; another of those «less» for the best. And now let's talk aesthetic and cosmetic, would you? The face, but the face of Freddy is pretty not the same..., for the worst. He really look too much like I-can't- recall the race of dog (for those who have seen the 1989's movie «Baxter») but Fred is more between a devil and monster kind than a slasher guy. More a scarecrow than anything else and, as I said, it's really not for the best. Now, watch out! Spoilers coming! They also updated the background of Krugger; he was not a children murderer as we knew him (no no no!!!); he was (watch out) a pedophile! I got to state that this new approach is more close from the, humm, common and day-to-day pathologic criminal around (which I find it good). I had say that the film is less gory (for the best) but it's in the exception of the last scene which they were cheap in the try-to-impress. And by the reaction of the audience, they thought so too. And talking about the audience... Remember this : a theatre on an opening night of an horror movie is not a theatre: it's a kindergarten!!!

485,brittannlee,This movie was so-so.,6,10 May 2010,"Note: There is no big spoiler in this review, at least nothing you don't already know. A Nightmare on Elm Street has always been a cult phenomenon and I am still sure that it will continue to thrive for many years to come. Though this remake is not going to be remembered as much as the original series. I guess the reason why this version of the Nightmare on Elm Street series was not really all that successful was because it focused mainly on two things instead of just one. This movie should have stayed with one idea instead of taking two, which killed a bit of the movie's flare. I think this movie could have made a lot more money if it was more of an origins type of movie. A couple of other people think that the movie would have been a lot more interesting if the movie just focused on how Freddy got to be a vicious killer of dreams. I have to agree with what other people say, because it would have been a lot more intriguing. But of course, the writers of this film decided to show bits of how Freddy came to be, while also having Freddy kill people because of a grudge he had. Characters with grudges are so predictable, and by no means are they exciting.So, besides Freddy's story, there were also other problems that I noticed while watching this film. One of the problems that bothered me the most was that Freddy's kills weren't all that brutal and scary. The second thing that bothered me about this film was that the acting was not really all that fantastic, it was just okay at best. This movie could have been something quite marvelous, but it is duly flawed by the choices of the writers, directors, and perhaps even the casting director. This movie is alright if you didn't know anything about the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, or if you are just bored. Definitely worth about one watch and that is it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
486,heisenberg1925,a decent remake..that's it!,5,14 May 2010,"The problem with a remake is that your target audience will always compare it to the original. Although there's been quite a few films that have done a great job of upgrading a cult horror classic (i.e. last year's The Last House On The Left),which is coincidentally where Freddy Krueger's name was taken from (serial rapist Krug). I thought Jackie Earle Haley was a great choice to play Freddy due to his outstanding performance as Rorschach in ""Watchmen"". But after seeing it, I must say this movie lacks the ominous and sinister appeal that made the original a horror classic. You just can't easily replace a legend like Robert Englund. He made Freddy Krueger a household name. I grew up watching the original movies on VHS and cable TV. I remember our parents admonishing me and my brother whenever they catch us watching horror flicks. I miss those days when Freddy Krueger and Pinhead (Hellraiser) used to dominate the horror scene. Hollywood is trying to gain a new generation of horror fans by doing remakes of classics like; A Nightmare on Elm Street,Friday the 13th,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few. However, they always fail to hit the mark because they will never be able to reinvent a character that had left an indelible mark in the minds of its audience. They should have learned by now that scaring people will not always be easy. Most people don't get scared by too much gore and a masked killer hacking off someone's head! Sometimes you just have to use your imagination.Perhaps, they should learn a lesson from Freddy himself, a menacing villain who's more than just steel claws and prosthetic—best of all, he actually has a personality.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

No, you aren't dreaming, I really found this to be an entertaining film.It was a comedy to me. There were so many moments of suspense that I found myself laughing at when I should of been on the edge of my seat. Is this a bad thing? No. For me, the horror genre has never been about scares and not being able to get to bed that night. Don't get me wrong, I've seen many horror films in my time that have absolutely given me the creeps, but it has always been the fun that has pulled me in.The lame acting, intense violence, and over all campy nature of it all has never ceased to grab my attention. And 'Nightmare' is no exception. While the audience is never quite sure what is reality and what is a dream, I sat in the theater I felt like I was in a dream of my own. A fun one.Jackie Earle Haley has, once again, proved he is quite a talent and made Krueger very much his own, never attempting to top the infamous Robert Englund. Haley didn't try to become Englund's Krueger, but rather crafting his very own striped sweater-wearing slasher.I simply can't bring myself to rate this film above seven stars. The hour and a half slasher re-imagining is chock full of cheese, laughter inducing acting, and some of the silliest (yet hilarious) one-liners in recent memory. It is never a good idea to try and recreate a classic; and if that was their aim, they failed.

Even i knew to go in that cinema with an open mind AND try to forget the original Nightmere!! As for my opinion of this film - i gave it a 7. It is one of the only films this year that is truly a classic teen-slasher horror film - hell it is the only one that has managed to make me jump this year! I love how this re-make has decided to delve into Freddies past this time instead of ""!flash-backs"" galore.

It was a good remake, however Freddy was NOT scary in this one. The new actor playing Freddy did a good job acting, but the new Freddy is more goofy than he is scary. Not to mention, his dialog is kind of dumb. Seriously, the majority of Jackie/Freddy's lines sound like really, really, corny jokes that are not the least bit funny or scary. The only time I jumped was when they would briefly flash Freddy with loud music, and the music is what really caught me off guard. I'm sorry, but as good as Jackie did in the role of Freddy, NO ONE will ever do the role better than Robert Englund! (no pun intended) To me, Englund will always be Freddy! :-)I do have to give it credit though, I think the remake gives a better description of Freddy Krueger's past, and why the parents killed him.

It's just some details, nothing really important, but read it at your own risk.OK, to start with, I've not seen the original ""A Nightmare Elm Street"", but I'm sure that I can say that it is extremely superior to this one.The movie starts with the death of a guy, and after that, strange things start to happen to his friends while they sleep. They all dream with a weird guy with a burnt face, that chases them, probably, for some blood. They try to discover why is this happening, and after realizing the old man in the dream it's not kidding, they conclude that if the person dies in the dream, she dies in real life. In the beginning, the plot and the acting weren't that good, but it was even a little enjoyable. You expect it will get better and, oh, surprise, things get REALLY worse.First, let's talk about the plot itself, and the characters. The story is dull. Simply put, boring. You don't get hooked to it, and nothing gets as intense as you would expect from a horror movie. Not even the chase sequences or the nightmares are exciting, fun or scary. The characters or, going straight to the point, the actors, are... uhm... let's say, ""below average"", specially the protagonist, who just doesn't seem to be the girl in the leading role. You just cannot relate to them. In fact, you just hope for them to die as quickly as possible. The acting is very bad, and the ones who are a little better die soon in the movie. The rest of the cast are not even good to scream. Yeah, it's that bad. And about Jackie Earle Haley, who is often a very good actor, does not receive enough space or freedom to work on his Freddy Krueger, thanks to the mediocre plot.This Freddy just didn't work. He is not scary, he is not funny, he is just as boring as the rest of the cast. I normally like villains in horror movies, or just hate them, in a good way (when the portrayal of the character is very well done, and makes you believe he is that evil). But THIS Freddy is just empty, and ads nothing to this already void film.The soundtrack is not that bad, or good: it is obvious. That scary music plays only when you already know the outcome of that scene, making the scary level even lower.So, I think this is it. This flick was a huge disappointment to me, who was expecting something at least more entertaining or, at least, funny. Instead, what we get is an extremely dull movie and, when it is over, you'll have the feeling that its 95 minutes seemed like and entire night of endless boredom.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I've seen worse movies, but not many of them carried a hallowed horror name like this.The biggest travesty is the loss of Freddy's sense of humor. The scenes became darker and grittier as expected with newer horror movies, but Freddy lost any sense of himself. He is supposed to delight in tormenting his victims before killing them in creative manners. The characters are supposed to be in his world when they sleep. They are supposed to be helpless. Part of the terror is not knowing if you are sleeping or not. It's not just the being killed part that's supposed to suck.Jackie Earle Haley's performance is flat and monotone.

It just is disappointing that more and more people think that you can just take a big movie name take a s**t all over it and sell it.But as i said before it has its own original thrills and is a descent horror flick, But the title ruins it all.My rating: 5/10!

Compared to the Original Cast i didn't give a damn if everyone died or not because none of these Wb types were anywhere near sympathetic or even halfway developed right.The Cgi gore effects in places were downright shoddy and the ending was completely predictable well the whole movie was really.The only people that could enjoy this film are todays generation of film goers who don't really have anything to call their own since this generation will be known as the generation of hacks and copycats. People that Truly loved the original first and Second Film will hate this. As for which Kreuger is Superior well hands down Robert England.

It's like a good example of how not to make a good movie.There was just nothing to be excited about. Some stuff happened, in a very mediocre way. The dialogue. was. monotone. with. woeful. expression.Every other minute is a quick cheap scare. The sound goes quiet, then a large BOO to make you jump.

I was honestly actually looking forward to a new Freddy since the character has become so comical. I was looking forward to bringing him back into the realm of Horror. Not that Jackie did a bad job, I just feel he wasn't really given a chance to do a good one. And all I could think was man, I miss Robert. Sometimes you don't realize how good someone is until someone else takes their place.I swear the kids looked like a less attractive Twilight cast, and just as flat and two-dimensional.

498,justin-mylanson,"Alright movie, Not TERRIBLE.. but Not GREAT either..",6,3 January 2016,"This movie didn't add too much that was original in the final cut of this film but it did bring certain elements to the forefront that late great Wes Craven intended to have in the 1984 version. Freddy was originally going to be that sick, Wes (ruffly) has said that himself. He was never meant to be likable or be a comedian.Wes didn't take kindly to this remake (then again he thought of the sequels as just a way for New Line to roll in the checks and nothing more) and I understand why. Me personally other than it being completely unnecessary, it was actually pretty decent. Jackie's portrayal of Fred is strait and to the point; relentless and intimidating. Not that the original Freddy isn't but after the Jokey Freddy of 4-6 and Freddy vs Jason this is very refreshing to say the least.The new concept for this movie plays out quite well. It takes the opposite approach than the Original films did. It makes obvious the line between dream and reality but it also intertwines both, sort of.There are clear problems with this movie but they were not as bad as Dream Master's incomplete script or the ham fisted plot of Dream Child and thankfully this has a better direction than Freddy's Dead. You can argue this movie had as much fan service as FvsJ and in this movie it was a problem. It took me out of the movie, so now I can't help but compare. This ruins the original movie for a lot of newcomers as well, having them favor this one.I think it's insane that someone can favor this movie to the classic. Yet since this movie takes a much different approach it's no wonder a group of people didn't accept the 1984 version; just like people who saw the originals first (like myself, well the first 4) didn't find this movie particularly satisfying. It's no surprise fan's hate this movie and they're not entirely wrong but they're not completely right either.I wish we could see some of those deleted scenes present in the trailer but absent from the actual movie itself and unavailable to view in full for some reason. A few scenes that made it to the DVD/Blu Ray would easily make the film better. Certainly that alternative ending would.To clarify the Original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Dream Warriors (1987) are both on my top 10 movie list! I love the first 3 movies and personally wish the later sequels we're more gruesome and dark.Yeah 6 out of 10 sounds like an appropriate rating. This installment is far too over-hated some love it too much as well I would say to. 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare had real good ideas that were realized well but it's not as solid as I was hoping for but it still gets a star above this one at 7/10.

499,rutgeralan,"In defense of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)""",9,2 May 2010,"Let me preface this by stating that the haters of this film have been out in full force trashing it before it had even opened for viewing; critics had blasted the ""horrible, banal, acting"", ""hackneyed jokes and predictable scares"", and ""the inappropriate historical back-story of Krueger"". Unlike most of the critical reviewers, I have seen the entire film franchise of Nightmare on Elm Street from part I to Dream Warriors and yes even, Freddy V Jason, and I am here to say with confidence that this film not only does justice to the historical precedents set by the original, but furthers its future existence into the next realm of this new decade. Let's be frank, Freddy needed a new start, an introduction to a whole new generation of dream frightened teenagers. The idea of Freddy is still as fresh as ever and its repackaging was much needed. I feel like the director and the cast did a great job of reinventing the film franchise while also paying homage to past Freddy films. Now, in response to the criticisms': This movie has strong performances by Rooney Mara as Nancy, Kyle Gallner as Quentin, and of course Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. I was never a big fan of the original Nancy, but this movie provides great character development of Nancy, and allows the audience an opportunity to gradually sympathize with her, and eventually root for her in the final sequences. It was a strong, underplayed, performance by Rooney Mara. Kyle Gallner almost steals the show as a medicated, emotionally damaged, friend of Nancy. His acting is both tortured and genuine, which is apt for the horror movie. He may turn out to be the ""Johnny Depp"" of the new Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. Ever since I saw Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschac in Watchmen I have been in love with the guy, and when I heard that he was cast as the new Krueger, I thought there wasn't a more appropriate actor in Hollywood for the role. He is, in a word, perfect. Now, I am not comparing him to Robert Englund, who was masterful as Krueger for all the previous films, but Haley has the potential, in future films, to take the franchise to a new level. The jokes are what make Freddy Kreuger so unique and endearing. Yes, it is kitchy, but they serve a vital role in the film's success, in that periods of brevity allow the audience to catch its collective breath in anticipation of the next scare, which, despite what the critics have wrote, does catch you off guard at times. If there were a recording of these critics' viewing of the film, I'm positive you'd have seen some eyes wide open, mouths gaping, and body shaking from these jokers. As far as the historical back-story goes, it is a serious subject that perhaps should have been dressed down a bit for the film, but in today's era of Rob Zombie's Halloween and the Dark Knight, character development and realistic back stories describing current psychological underpinnings of characters are a necessity in today's age. This is why I believe this film is not only solid, with justice paid to the original, I also believe this franchise has great potential to be treated with some degree of seriousness in terms of the psychological explanations of Freddy's motives. Overall, I gave this film a 9 out of 10 because while there still is room to improve, it is a solidly acted, visually impressive, nicely directed beginning to the Freddy Krueger franchise.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Plus, the dude's a child killer, it's very odd to be liking a child killer. He's supposed to be creepy. Now, if he killed Michael Myers after he had killed his sister, I would probably be okay with him being a child killer.Don't get me wrong, I love every entry in the original series.

I remember seeing the original Nightmare on Elm Street and having nightmares for a week. Simplistic compared to the movies of today, but you didn't need over the top explosives or CGI, the fear pulled you in. There was no escape even after the movie ended and you sat in the dark theater you heart was still racing.What I noticed when I watched this less than stellar remake is that the writer turned Freddy Kruger into a joke. He wasn't scary like in the original film. He was a borderline comedian. I'm sure Jackie Earle Haley did his best for the role, but his performance wasn't even close to Robert Englund.One other important thing was missing from this remake...Wes Craven! Craven is the King of Horror! Look how popular his movies are! Not only the Nightmare movies, but there is also Scream movies, The Hills Have Eyes, Shocker, Invitation To Hell, etc! It amazes me no one approached Wes Craven about remaking his movie. If you liked this movie then you obviously never saw the original.

It was not a perfect film, but it was suspenseful and gory.The remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street was terrible.You're hearing it from a hardcore fan. I was not someone against Platinum Dunes making the remake. I was fine with letting Robert Englund go. I was just excited to see Freddy once again on the big screen. I wish I hadn't. This was worse than the Halloween remake. Worse than the Texas Chainsaw remake. Worse than the AMITYVILLE HORROR remake. Stay far, far away.You know you have problems when Freddy is revealed five minutes into the film. Not in a silhouette, but in full make-up. Right away we know the writers aren't looking to create suspense. That's what made the first one work, so why in the hell would we keep it here? It's never a mystery as to who or what Freddy is. Granted, with all his popularity, it might seem pointless to keep him hidden, but it would've made his character a hell of a lot scarier.The acting is on par with the Twilight series. It's a one-note job for everyone available, even for Freddy. Robert Englund made it work because of his unpredictability. Jackie Earle Haley, a very good actor, is clearly given a poor script to work with. His one-liners aren't scary. They're not funny. They're just terrible. Haley had just as much to say as Freddy in his funny-days, but the difference here is how contrived his dialogue is. I watched ""Freddy's Dead"" right before the premiere to lower my bar for this film, and I found myself wanting to watch that one all over again. THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN.The original didn't have the best actors by a long shot (not even Johnny Depp), but they felt real enough to root for them. Here, Rooney Mara and her good-looking cast create no sympathy. They just don't feel like real people.The whole mystery IS FREDDY A GOOD GUY plot? Terrible (word of the day). I don't want to spoil anything but...come on...this is Freddy Krueger we're talking about. He was scary because we didn't know much about him. As soon as you throw in a back story, he's just any other killer. Remember when Freddy wasn't just any other killer? Good days...good days...Oh, and SPOILER ALERT....there's only 4 deaths. But, unlike the original, they're poorly placed throughout the story. You shouldn't have to sit through 40 minutes of a phony, pointless mystery in order to NOT see anyone get killed. And the deaths themselves are unimaginative, perhaps the most boring of all the 7 films. Thanks for playing it safe, Platnium Dunes, that should rake in a few more target audience members.The original Elm Street is beginning to show its age. Still, nearly 30 years later, the original is still more terrifying than this play-it-safe-and-by-the-numbers reboot. I'm appalled by the wasted talent of Haley. This new series won't draw in any new fans like the studio hoped. This new series doesn't cater to the original fans. This new series is...well, just like every other reboot in recent memory; it was created out of greed, not entertainment. As a lifetime Freddy fan, I find myself sad to say that this franchise is dead.And my coupon for a free ticket I got in the blu-ray edition of ANOES isn't eligible at AMC theaters. I hate you, Platinum Dunes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
503,umbrellascientist,Something lacking...,4,5 October 2010,"I was probably one of the few who were expecting this film to surpass it's original source. Worst case scenario, it would be as good as the original, which is great. But, nope, they ***** that up alright.I won't go into details, but the movie doesn't have that scary tone and mood of the original, where everything was downplayed and subjective to it's characters. Now, everything is there, it's like a slasher movie: You're not scared, you're not worried about the characters, you're simply waiting for the next gory scene to put you briefly in the edge of your seat. Too bad they are kinda far in between as you'd probably be sleeping yourself when they do happen.Now that I mentioned the characters... Boy, they're lame. I really missed someone whom I could establish some sort of emotional bond. Among the fairly large cast there isn't one single person worth of sympathy, maybe one, Quentin, but state that I really cared what was going to happen to him is a stretch. Nancy, the main protagonist of the series, in this remake, is just one of the gang, she isn't really all that special and was just lucky she got picked last to be tormented by Freddy so she had way more puzzle pieces to place together to take some sort of action against what was going on (if there was any action taken, that is).Just to close it up: The ending SUCKS. While in the first movie you got a sense of doubt about what was really going on (since the entire final act could've been a dream from the start), in this movie they actually DO (in real life!) what was supposedly a fantasy in the original. I mean, come on... I know this is fantasy and all that, but there's a fine line between something that could happen (like dying in your sleep) and something that is impossible (like bringing a dream to our physical world).And the dream sequences are obvious. So, no surprises here. There a few good moments, specially regarding the editing of the movie from dream to real life. Other than that, it's very weak, considering the original. Can be mediocre to good to someone who is new to the series, though.For me, Four out of Ten.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

505,Nicky777,I want my money and time back!,3,1 June 2010,"Just watched it yesterday and this movie is a perfect example of how miserable remakes can be.First of all, all the parts that were meant to be scary were only terrifying sounds and things suddenly popping out of nowhere.Secondly, this film had no even mediocre actors in it.And the last and foremost thing that didn't make it right was the plot. Movie was more funny than scary and while Freddy was really terrifying in the original, here he was portrayed more as a pedophile than a serial killer. Plot was different from the original, though many scenes were taken from it. However, I was surprised why the filmmakers didn't use the bathtub scene - it had some potential.All in all, avoid this film.

In fact it was dull, dull, dull! the only reason I sat through it was because I couldn't honestly write a review without having done so.Like a lot of the pointless remakes of the last few years (Wicker Man, Omen, The Fog) it's a visually and technically slick production with almost no substance whatsoever.It has 2 minor redeeming features 1) Jackie Earl-Hayley's creepy voice 2)a genuinely chilling reveal involving the main characters digging up their personal past.Save yourself the trouble, don't bother with this hum drum piece of rubbish.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

509,redninjaboy,I'm the minority,8,14 January 2018,"Tell me something. What was so great about the originals? Is it the acting? No. The acting is terrible. The effects? Maybe. I'm sure they were awesome for their time. Robert Englund? Again, maybe. He really seemed to be into his part. Johnny Depp? ...No. The fact that Freddy kills a total of three people? One of which was barely on screen? No. That sucks.Ok, maybe I'm being a bit harsh. The effects even today aren't that bad. And the two kills that weren't painstakingly slow and boring were actually pretty awesome. And Johnny Depp's death was iconic. But I was never a fan of the original movies. The acting always made me cringe, the sound effects were goofy, and Freddy was always... well... goofy. I get that he likes to play with his victims, but he's supposed to be scary. Terrifying. But most of the time, I just cringed or laughed when I saw him.This movie, on the other hand, takes all of that out and remakes the original movie with some better characters and a better Freddy. Granted, I know Robert is iconic as Freddy and me saying anyone else is better than him is probably blasphemy to the name of horror as a whole, but I don't care. The only Robert Englund Freddy I liked was in Freddy vs Jason. And even then, he was STILL really goofy and weird. I like Jackie Earle Haley better as Freddy. He was more terrifying, more clever, and was able to have fun and laugh without being over the top or goofy. It even remade some of the iconic scenes while introducing new ones. Like the Nancy in the tub with Freddy's hand scene, Kris' death, the body bag scene, Freddy in the walls, and Nancy's mom getting attacked at the end... Ok, so they weren't very original in that regard. But what do you expect from a remake? They probably just wanted to trigger fans' nostalgia. ...That... words. Anyway, they do some new stuff, too. Like the way they get rid of him. ...For a day or so. In the original, Nancy reads a book on traps, sets them up around the house, then goes to sleep. All in the span of, what an HOUR?? That's not even possible. And on top of that, when Freddy's finally out and ready to kill her, she beats him with what? Willpower. She does NOTHING but say that he can't hurt her. And he just vanishes. BORING. The remake has them go to the school. It's this whole thing about Freddy being accused by the kids of hurting them and taking them to his basement, then he gets killed by the parents, kills some of the kids years later after they've forgotten about the whole thing and leading Nancy and Quentin to the pre-school all of this took place in so they can remember, only for them to realize they were telling the truth about it and going to drag him out of their dreams and fight him two on one with a broken paper slicer... thing.

Analyzing is not going to help! Just had to say that. So anyhow, the film wasn't above or below my expectations, there are several scary moments, the movie keeps a consistent dark atmosphere, oh and Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley) was a great pick for the role he's got a very evil voice that can get under your skin a little bit. I found the acting in the movie to be quite well, really, I wasn't sitting their just nit picking it though. Honestly I haven't seen the original Nightmare on Elm Street so I can't compare the two. I thought the movie was well put together with fair enough scoring that keeps a gloomy atmosphere to the movie. There was a part of the movie that people misconstrued, the part was supposed to be scary and intense but some people thought it was hilarious. I do see how that peek crazy moment of the movie could be a TINY bit humorous, but I didn't find it funny at all, and anyone who thinks it was hilarious, here's my solution, try taking a little acid and then watching it, we'll see if your smiling after that, seriously though how can anyone laugh at that part, imagine if you were her, you'd be completely terrified ::people, people people::.Anyhow, Overall I thought it was a pretty fair movie with good scare moments, sure it could've been better but whatever.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

You can't remake a movie and actually make it worse can you? Well obviously you can because Platinum dunes is great at that. They butchered Friday the 13th and guess what? they butchered A Nightmare on Elm street but only worse if you can believe it.Jackie Earle Haley was a huge disappointment as Freddy. This movie promised to take out the goofiness of the old Freddy, but I must say This movies version was just as corny. His Lines were so cliché and have been said 100 millions times before by Robert Englund. His look was a mirror image of the old Freddy but they actually were able to make him look worse. CGI Burn marks!!! how original! The other characters were absolutely horrible. I'm not expecting Oscar nominated type performances from these kids but come on. Compared to the 1984 version. I'm in awe at how terrible everyone was. Especially the parents. Nancy's mom was probably the worst concerned mom actress I have ever seen!! Bottom line don't ever watch this movie because it will tarnish everything you loved about the 1984 movie.Please no more remakes of classic films!!!!!! I give it a 1 out of 10.

512,Prosercunus,This movie proves that the Nightmare formula works!,7,30 April 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) is the remake of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and is a fantastic one at that. Put aside all your previous biases on remakes and take a good look at this movie. Unlike the horrific Friday the 13th remake, the Elm Street remake managed to actually be scary instead of just plain silly. However this remake is not without its flaws...The Good: The movie manages to be generally creepy, I got the same feeling from this version of Freddy that I did from the original one, a sort of uneasiness from his very presence. Some of the death scenes were really well done also. Kris's death (like Tina's) was executed very well. I found only one thing about the movie that was superior to the original and that was the suspense throughout the entire film, unlike the original the remake had an element in it (i.e. ""Micro naps"") that made Freddy capable of popping out at any given moment, which was actually quite effective overall. The acting overall was not bad at all, it wasn't amazing but it suits the movie.The Bad: The movie doesn't start off slow; instead of building up suspense it just takes a flying leap into the very basis of the movie. Over half of the times Freddy comes on screen it happens by way of the old sharp music and jump tactic, which I found alright at first but it soon got kind of old and annoying to be honest. Two iconic elements from the first film were executed very poorly. The wall scene from the original was now a very poor CGI version, I hated it and it was completely unnecessary to add it just for the sake of paying homage or whatever they intended on doing, it just looked bad... then again I despise CGI with every fiber of my being. The tub scene was also poorly done; it was simply his hand coming out of the water with again some sharp music to get the squeamish. I still don't care for Freddy's look in this movie even after having a very open mind about it, however his voice far makes up for it.Overall this film is worth seeing, I was a complete skeptic with low expectations going in and the movie managed to be very well done. Robert Englund will always be the true Freddy, but I will accept this as a replacement. The Nightmare formula works to this day and is the scariest concept I have ever witnessed in a movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Okay, let me start by saying that I have never seen any of the original ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies, so everything I have to say about this movie is me judging this movie on its own merit, without making any reference or comparison to the originals. With that said, this, on its own merit, is indeed a terrible movie, even for a slasher/horror movie. This was the first slasher/horror movie that I have seen in a theater, so naturally, I expected a lot of people to be screaming or gasping. Needless to say, there were no screams whatsoever in my theater. In fact, there was nothing but laughter in lieu of those absent screams. Sure, some people say that Freddy Krueger's one liners are supposed to generate a lot of laughs, but not in this movie. His one liners are so stale, the only thing people were laughing at was the over-the-top acting, the poorly shot death scenes, etc. The only compliment I have to give is the cg burn face for Freddy, but everything else about him was terrible. His voice was just irritating, with Haley just re-using his annoying Rorschach voice, and being unfunny. Pass on this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Freddy Krueger worked at a tire factory not as a gardener in a preschool. 2. Nancy's Surname was Thompson not Holbrook. 3. Nancy's father was a sheriff and her mother wasn't a doctor. 4. Nancy's mother was called Marg not Gwen. 5. Glen was Nancy's boyfriend and not called Quentin. 6. Nancy's boyfriend and mother died at the end of the movie. Glen on his water bed and Nancy's mom at the front door. 7. Her other friends that died were called Tina and Rod.

521,Koltsunfri,Probably the Best Horror Remake Out There,10,23 May 2010,"I Have start off by saying, everyone who is giving this film bad reviews can go back to their basement and whine to their online friends because this movie is one of the best horror remakes to date, even better than Rob Zombie's Halloween.Plot - The Plot was great, it was different but still paid homage to the original film. It was about a group of teens trying to piece together their past and find out secrets about their life. It was a race to live, if they couldn't find out within 48 hours (or something) they started to dream while they were awake, which was an interesting twist, and started to see Freddy and actually feel fear.The New Freddy - Very good acting and realism, I especially loved how his voice echoed from everywhere when he talked. Jackie Earle Haley did an amazing job, far surpassing Robert Englund (Who may I add, was the biggest joke of a character). He didn't act stupid and didn't make you cringe (in a bad way) like Robert did and he, in my opinion, brought a new face of horror to the screen.Scares - A Nightmare on Elm Street had mainly jump-scare, which wasn't that bad, it actually added a enjoyable moment to the experience. But it did have some unexpected things like Spoilers Jackie coming from behind Nancy's mom in the mirror and grabber her back into it and when Jackie says to Jesse ""Did you know, after the heart stops, you remain conscious for 9 minutes? That means we have 6 more minutes to play"" was just a very intense and eerie line, also when a former student Marcus Leon gets pushed into his web cam by Freddy. Very Enjoyable.Nightmares - The only thing I had a problem with. Some need to be improved so the sequences are more, twisted and distorted to be like a nightmare, kinda like in some of the original films you had upside down nightmares and everything and that would be great to see in the sequel. The Teens - Did an amazing job portraying the startled and fearful kids in the film. And they weren't stupid like in the original, they were all pretty bright and didn't ruin the film with pointless screaming.OVERALL - I give this film a 10/10, Far surpassing the stupidity of the original and bringing a better, broader, Nightmare experience to the silver screen. At the end of the film I, and everyone else in the theater, applauded and I hope to do the same with the upcoming sequels!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

It was more of a TV movie rather than a movie for the cinema.

I mean look at Freddy's Dead, Nightmare 5, Freddy vs. Jason and Nightmare 2, all of those are horrible but were accepted. Those movies were campy and Freddy turned into a running joke than a murdering psychopath. This one however has a very serious Freddy, played by Jackie Earle Haley, and was truly creepy and perverse, which is what the last few Freddy movies were missing. Haley truly embraced Freddy and made him truly disturbing. The other actors in the movie are campy and not attractive like the original. They are very lifeless and very annoying for the most part. What saved this movie for me personally was Haley's outstanding performance and the suspense. Samuel Bayer did a great job setting the mood and kept me jumping from the very beginning. The main part in which the movie suffers is the very poor story. I liked the daycare idea but they needed it to be on Elm Street and not some other random street. And the fact that some of the children were in different places was jut a dumb idea, no clue what the writers were thinking.

525,Zac111111,Not TOO bad...,5,21 May 2010,"NOTE: there are SPOILERS in this review, but I've tried to keep them to a minimum...This film has been slammed by critics world wide for a number of reasons. And all of these are valid to a point. However I personally didn't find it as HORRIFICALLY bad as its being made out to be...First of all, as pointed out, the film is completely unoriginal. It is, in the truest sense, a remake. Even the deaths are almost identical to the 1984 film. Seriously, I was hoping for something at least a little refreshing. But in sticking so close to the original story line, the 2010 take on such a well remembered and time honored horror classic has steered well clear of one of the most common vices that plague the countless remakes which hit the cinemas these days, it didn't try to overhaul the story. there were SLIGHT variations to the story, but these were minor details. and completely transparent at that. Freddy the good guy? come on.Freddy himself was a constant source of irritation. Haley has exceptional talent, and his performance in Watchmen (one of my all time favorite films) was genius. but I'm sad to say even Haley can't pull off a roll as shockingly presented as this. They re-made Freddy's face to make it look more 'realistic'. it looked terrible. I was so disappointed. it didn't even resemble the old Freddy we all know and love. and the dialog was disgustingly sloppy. gone is the psychopathic, supernatural, aggressive and menacing Freddy we all were so scared of in the first film. Meet the new Freddy; docile, unintelligent and not by any stretch of the imagination witty. in several scenes he actually stops and talks to the victim. full conversations. It (coupled with the new 'back-story') humanizes Freddy. with the mystery gone he's just another killer. Haley brought his unique talent to such a horrific role, and did a phenomenal job considering what he had to work with... but in the end a VERY disappointing new Freddy.The acting was terrible. honestly, with few exceptions, wooden and shallow. The movie relied completely on jump scare for its kicks, which is never a good thing. there was no suspense, no genuine terror. I walked into the cinema actually expecting to be scared. instead, I jumped at some loud noises and walked out in confusion.All this having been said, it was a fairly entertaining movie. I did enjoy it to a degree. Haley was the highlight for me, although his role was truly shocking. so for every fault, it's about 50/50. its not bad, but it's not brilliant. If you're a die hard Kruger fan, steer clear. the repetition and flaws in the characters will drive you insane. If you're a horror fan, steer clear, its not even remotely frightening. but if you're looking to waste some time and be entertained to a degree why not...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
526,tbrocker5,Not just another remake,7,1 May 2010,"Let me start by saying that when I first heard about this film I was immediately frightened...about having to sit through another ridiculous and over-the-top remake that is. However, certain details perked my interest back up to the point that I did give my arm to go see the film on opening day. After reading some of the more pessimistic reviews on the remake before I went, I again became a little uneasy about what to expect; however, I still went into the theater with my expectations up...though not high. And as one can tell by my rating the remake did not let me down. This was not just another remake.First off: Freddy. This was the aspect I was undoubtedly most worried about. I felt that if Haley could pull off a good Freddy, then the film would be worth seeing. Ladies and gentleman it is worth seeing. Haley keeps up the character's humor well and in my opinion is the scariest Freddy since the original; he might even be more frightening than the original. His ""scare factor"" is aided by the fact that the story goes a lot more in depth about his origins which was probably my favorite part of the film. Was he as charming and witty as Englund's character? No, and the movie no doubt would have been better had Englund been able to reprise his role. HOWEVER, Haley definitely does a fantastic job. Haley's Freddy is darker and meatier, hence his awesome voice, and gives the audience a great reason to fear him.The cast: Unlike the remake of Friday the 13th and other horror films of today, the cast was clearly not chosen based upon their looks. These kids definitely sold me on all their roles, especially Quentin who was by far my favorite character next to Freddy. Nancy was a little less complex than I would have liked to have seen but is still notable in this section.The plot: Definitely the only part of this film that was lacking. I don't believe that it was the actual events that caused this. The death scenes, though at times a little uncreative, were well executed (pun intended) and the development of Freddy's character was excellent. I think it was the underlying story that was showing a lack of color. I remember in the theater thinking that things were going a little too fast in the beginning and that they could have taken their time more with the development of the other characters. The movie is also slightly shallow until Quentin and Nancy start to unravel why these events are happening to them. However, once the plot starts rolling I was definitely hopping in to enjoy the ride. The entire second half of the movie is great and definitely makes up for what was lacking in the first half.As I'm sure you've noticed, some people aren't as optimistic with this remake because they don't think it even touched the original. But I think that these people are missing something...this is a different movie and it possesses its own creativity. Freddy is not the exact same, the characters are not the same, and the plot is different. However, I think what they did with this movie was definitely a great new take on the series and by far better than most of the sequels to the original. So when you go to see this film, which I recommend you do, keep this question in the back of your head: Can they do much worse than the second Nightmare?",A Nightmare on Elm Street
527,guitarman0203,Not Quite What I Expected,7,16 May 2010,"I went to see A Nightmare on Elm Street last night as a last minute decision to go out with a friend of mine. We both wanted to see it because we thought it would be fun, not expecting much from the movie. Being a fan of the original, I was both nervous and excited to see what would come out of the remake, and I liked some things they did, while others were a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, I don't feel as if I wasted my $10 to see it.To sum it up (for those who may not have seen the original), the film is basically the same premise. A badly burned, very creepy bogeyman stalks and kills high school students in their sleep. What's different in this movie compared to the original is the inclusion of mystery. The connection between the victims goes deeper than the original. Without saying much, they aren't just the children of the angry mob who killed Fred Krueger. Additionally, Freddy's intended victims don't just try to kill their nightmare, they dive into the past to try to discover why they are being targeted. While some shots and scenes are taken almost directly from the original, the story's progression takes on a path of its own, which is both a success and a failure of the film.The film's biggest success, in my mind, is Jackie Earle Haley's depiction of the new Freddy Krueger. He doesn't try to model the character off of Robert Englund's original. Instead, he takes the identity of Freddy Krueger in his own direction. It's not at all the Freddy that most fans will be used to. Now, he is much darker, creepier, and more sadistic. We get to see Freddy both before and after his death, and I think both sides of the famous bogeyman were portrayed very well. I can almost understand where the parallels are made to Haley's depiction of Watchmen's Rorschach, since they sound similar vocally, but Freddy is a much darker, but less complex character. Some other pluses I saw in the movie were a few effective jump scenes and an overall interesting and more realistic premise. I think the producers dove more into the psychology of the characters this time around, and that made the film much easier to be involved in.The actors do a pretty good job overall in portraying the victims and acquaintances of Freddy. His teenage victims aren't your average horror movie clichés, they're overall likable, more lifelike students. Granted, there has to be a character or two that makes the obvious mistakes that usually lead to their demise, but keeping in mind that half of this movie takes place in a dreamworld, these mistakes are almost forgivable. The biggest downfall of the acting were some of the interactions. The dialogue had its flaws, and a few times, I chuckled at the parent-son/daughter scenes, just because they didn't work off of each other well. You could tell it was scripted. Conversely, the acting between the students was relatively well done as they work together to find a solution and deal with the losses caused by Freddy along the way.The story itself is a complex review subject. A few of the subtle but scary moments in the original are used again, but this time they don't have the same effect, and seem to have been thrown in as a way to try to draw in fans of the 1984 version, which makes them lose the original effect. The last half hour plays out very differently, taking on its own original storyline, and I think that was a good move on the screenwriters' parts. You never want a line-for-line, shot-for-shot remake, as it defeats the purpose of enjoying a new movie if you've already seen it done before. Since they base the root of the movie on the original, the writers must have had some problems finding unique ways to incite an audience reaction, but in finding these unique ways, they may have lost some of the fans along the way. The film loses the mystery surrounding Freddy throughout the first few films. Was he really innocent and wrongfully accused, or was he guilty and deserving of his fate? Before they even reveal the true nature of Freddy, we already know what he did and how he ended up this way. As the go-to moments for a horror remake, the jump scenes can be effective, but they also tend to be predictable, and at times I found myself scared more by the main characters than by Freddy. The film didn't have much shock value. The scenes that do hold it, for instance the first death scene and the prison scene, use that shock to a very good advantage. Often, Freddy's interactions with his victims can be difficult to watch, but this is because of the level of sadism and overall presence of evil in the Freddy name.The film really lost some of its development to the trailers and TV spots. A bulk of the scenes meant to scare are included, in some way, in their advertising campaign. I think during the filming process, the director and producers need to find ways to market a horror movie to sell it as one, while not sacrificing some of the better scenes. If I had never seen a single spot for the movie, I think I would have found it more tense and enjoyable.To sum it up: Pros: Freddy, believable characters, movie takes on its own story, realistic premise Cons: Dialogue can be ridiculous, loses its thunder to marketing, predictable jump scenes. Overall, I say 7/10. Newcomers to the series will probably enjoy it, but some fans of the original will not give this one a warm welcome. Personally, I got my $10 worth out of the ticket and enjoyed the movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
528,emt4988,Terrible Movie,1,5 May 2010,"Hi everyone this is Jack Red, I been a fan of Freddy for a long time and I can't believe how bad this movie actually is.At the time I seen it I thought A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge was the worst though on it's own, it's a good horror movie.Where to begin on actually describing this horrible remake based one of the greatest horror movies ever made.Wes Craven wasn't involve since he is currently working on Scream 4 as well as a few lawsuits with the company behind the franchise.Nancy in this movie was nothing like the one in the original in fact I don't even think it was her at all.Nancy's friends in the first film are replaced with ones that suck pretty bad.Too many dreams are in this movie along in fact if I did count all of them of the series this one would win it.You barely get to see their parents though you do see a lot of Nancy's mom in the movie.The deaths all suck so bad because they're so unofficial and terribly planned out scenes.A lot of lines from the previous series are taken in the movie sadly according to a fact four of the fifteen scripts they came up with ended up being messed together.Originally they were planning a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason which got a comic series one with Ash from Evil Dead series.They also planned a prequel to further explain why Freddy is this way but that got canceled so they can make this end of story.I waited ever since Freddy vs. Jason for a new Freddy movie to be very upset.They change him to the point that I hope it doesn't get a sequel in fact what happen to him, he used to be quite a character but now he just sucks.Freddy doesn't even look scary in this movie at all I tried to not laugh at him for trying to be scary.If you want a good Freddy movie then you are better off with the original.So in conclusion stay the away from this movie at all costs even Wes Craven hates the movie anyway thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
529,emiliovelia22,A Nightmare on Lame St.,3,9 October 2010,"Where to beginFirst of all, its confirmed that the original movie with Robert Englund is by far superior, there is no doubt about that but for a remake you would expect it to be a LITTLE good, but this is one of the remakes that are promising by cover art, but they don't deliver at all.This is one of those movies. A good idea poorly executedFirst the good 1.Robert Englund is easily the superior Freddy but Jackie Earle Haley, the actor who plays the character ,despite given poor material to work with, he delivers his lines and scenes perfectly and hes the only one here trying 2. The camera effect does a good job to give that horror feeling and Freddy's ''1,2 Freddy's coming for you'' song is well remadeNow the bad 1.JUMPSCARE, talking... JUMPSCARE, talking... the movie goes on that pattern over and over again, up to the point that it gets repetitive, boring, non scary, and ridiculous. If the movie had 2 or 3 jumpscares only it would be OK but for a horror movie that is supposed to scare the audience,its ALL THEY USED. For starters, jumpscares in horror movies are barely used nowadays. Jumpscares today, are only videos on YouTube that just want to scare for fun with simple jumpscare example.There's like hypnotizing wheel and the creator of the video tells you to stare at the dot in the center of the screen. Then, you stare at it and suddenly scary face appears right in front of you with a scream.This movie tries to scare the audience with a silly jumpscare which is not even as scary as a cartoon scare. It just tricks you into thinking that you're going to watch a well made horror movie and to satisfy the fans of the NOES franchise, but it just in the purpose of them stealing your money. Its the definition of an extremely LAZY movie, and unbelievably LAZY movie creators 2. The new Freddy face is one of the most disappointing things about the movie. It doesn't look anything like a burned person, the original makeup should be left as it is it should not be changed A BIT 3. The rest of the characters. Like I said, Jackie Earle Haley was a perfect choice and does a great job but I cant say the same for the supporting cast. Why does the movie in the begging have Kris as the main hero of the story and after she gets killed off, Nancy takes her place in the middle of the movie. Automatically, Nancy is the main character, she's the one Freddy is targeting from a young age, shes the one that has to stop the nightmare, so why Kris has to take her place for a the first half of the movie? But... I don't like to criticize actors that i have never seen before in movies but Nancy is by far the most BORING character of the whole movie. The original version of Nancy was kind and you actually cared about her and was a strong character.Great Horror movies have been remade. Why do filmmakers do it? because they want your CA$H. The cash that people get to live. People like Michael Bay want your cash to become filthy rich. They remake great classics poorly and they get people to see the movie because of its name, because it carries the name ""A Nightmare On Elm St."". It sucks you in, because they know that people out there are fans of the franchise and they know that people are going to go and watch their movies and like that, easily your money that you spent time and effort to get, go to their hands.Its sad.Overall, the movie was a big disappointment, just not what it should be.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Why are there so many stupid people who expect it to be better? Robert Englund will always be the original and best Freddy Krueger. But can't people have mercy on this movie? This movie wasn't so bad. It had some cool scares, good jumps (which I think are quite fun), and Jackie did a pretty good job considering the shoes he had to fill. Don't get me wrong I know this could of been a better film, but it is till a good film to watch on a late night with friends. The original Nightmare on Elm Street will always be the best and no remake could make the film any better. The film was classic so everyone should of known this film couldn't compare to the original. You have to admit this film was better than Freddy is DEAD lol. So i recommend anyone who watch this, take it how it is. Don't criticize, have fun with it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
531,deathmybeloved,Accept it for what it is,7,13 May 2010,"Let's face it- the slasher genre has never been respected and film makers have relied on these films for a quick paycheck. For the most part, these films are made quickly (as it was seen in the 80's when slasher films were churned out as if they were coming off an assembly line). Yet, every once in a while a film comes along that defies the standards of the slasher genre. The original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" did exactly this. The dedication of the Cast and Crew as well as Craven's use of Hitchcock's ""Suspense builders"" made the film not only terrifying in its use of a new concept, but also its ability to keep the viewer begging for answers. ""Is she asleep or is she awake?"" I had looked forward to this film from the second I heard it was being made, and after viewing it, I've made several conclusions.There is absolutely no suspense in this movie. NONE. I mean, we all know the story and we know how its basically going to end, but throwing Freddy Krueger in our faces in the first 5 minutes was a bad move.One of the bigger complaints I had was that the film gives the viewer absolutely no reason for the audience to care what happens to the characters. Generally, a writer or directer will do this by giving the audience a view into the lives of the characters and while this film does this in places, I really could care less about seeing Nancy Thompson play with her coloring books or listening to music. It's irrelevant garbage. What's more is that the character's aren't convincing in their roles and they hardly even seem upset when they are at the funeral. I mean, come on, look at how people react to death and tragedy in real life and compare it to the reactions of the actors in the movie. They're trying so hard to act that they are overacting and ultimately, not thinking about how their character(s) should respond. It's sickening.The death's in the film, though brutal and in your face, were dull.Next, I must confess that I was quite impressed with the new Freddy. The voice was perfect. Though this is solely a matter of opinion, I have to say it was far more unsettling to me (a kid that grew up having horrible nightmares about Fred Krueger)than Robert Englund's cheesy jokes in the role. And I have read reviews that have completely bad-mouthed the new Freddy. The whole point of a remake is to take a different approach to the film. It's not Robert Englund, Wes Craven, or Heather Langencamp. Don't use the old film as a means of setting the standards.I gave the film a 7 because it does take a new approach to the series that is fresh and new. Though the film had a lot more potential than it lived up to, the new Freddy is raw, unsettling, hateful, angry, and evil. If you are not a fan of the slasher genre, you may find this film a bit outlandish. But accept it for what it is- there's nothing that can fix the mistakes now. The film has been made.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
532,paradoxicalblues,Is this the new Elm Street????,7,19 May 2010,"OK. I have to admit I like this movie more than I really should and here's why... The ""New Elm Street"" fares well as a homage to the original. It manages to adopt familiar elements of the first 'nightmare' into a new story line without becoming cliché (except the inevitable and overwrought last scene). Yet the new story line is as flawed as it is successful, just falling short of being the ""stand alone"" film that it could have been (something a ""Directors Cut"" might arrive closer at). The film's problems likely stem from an overstay in 'production hell' - as one might expect adapting or re-imagining Wes Craven's intricate master work for a modern audience - would.The film suffers most from a somewhat misshapen identity and what apparently seems an overall lack of spontaneity. What was 'left-out' of the narrative does little to enhance the film (deteriorating character & relationship with the mother, Nancy's father, etc.) and results in a slightly less poignant portrayal of the shortcomings of intergenerational communication. The re-sketching of Kruger both physically and psychological, for me, is the most refreshing idea the re-make has to offer. Where the 1st Freddy was the 'demonic clown' luring us into his deathtrap nightmare branded by his own hellish style of comic relief, today's Kruger is both literally and figuratively a more realistic portrait of a monster fueled by sadistic hate (sadly I miss Freddy's more masochist tendencies) and vengeance. In this sense the films scores it highest marks. Some other gripes: The opening Edward Hopper/Hells kitchen scene was forgettable and an otherwise more interesting back story on Kruger was misplaced, looking more like an after thought and not like it could have... the beginning of something really interesting.Give it another go on a directors cut, I say, and it might worth my while to watch again on DVD.5/19/10 M.Merrill",A Nightmare on Elm Street
533,sleiva86,Crappy reboot of a film that never need a remake!,3,6 November 2010,"I give 4 points to this tittle since I can't deny that it is a watchable movie and I enjoyed it on the cinema, but comparing this cheesy crappy light horror flick to the superb masterpiece by Crave is almost an insult!First, the original doesn't need a remake. There is nothing to improve and this film, although certain old (it dates from 1984) has survived well with the time. We have now a modern film in which any hint of the previous film, which led it to its tremendous success, has disappeared. The story is shamefully focused on an unassuming young audience. Deaths are free, fast, light and less powerful than in the first film. Surprisingly, in our times, films are much more prudish and self-censored than the older movies. The characters are tremendously empty that prevent actors to develop their performances properly, the dialogs are boring and cause laughter. And the story has tremendous inconsistencies: Freddy becomes a gardener at the school, then why do the boiler rooms appear in dreams?, Freddy was a child molester, so why does he kill their victims without almost even harass them? To make matters worse, the music is average, it is good but does not stand or striking, and is much less atmospheric than the synthesizers of Charles Bernstein, in that first film in 1984. And the worst of all: Freddy ISN'T SCARY. He's very boring. Makeup, in an attempt to make it more realistic, it's ridiculous, does not impact or cause the panic than the festering face of Robert Englund caused in the first adventure of Freddy Krueger. In addition, he takes things too seriously, to be more intimidating than the original ironic Freddy, he's just talking over the account, which has no grace or cause fear.In short, what can I say? How to compare this s*** with the scary (REALLY SCARY) Elm Street movie of 1984? From the beginning to the end, this movie SUCKS",A Nightmare on Elm Street

For one, Robert Englund was not Freddie. I don't blame him, because he would be know as a disgrace. Hollywood use to have great movies, now all of the good movies are being remade for the audience today. Teenage kids who do not want to watch ""stone age horror movies"". I know this for a fact because I have asked around, and many people thought the remakes were the original, and when they saw the actual movie they hated it. These remakes are just full of pop culture crap that gives these movies a bad name. If you like these remakes, by all means watch it.

I apologize because, gladly, I was wrong. While this is the angle some of the advertising and perhaps early released scripts might have taken and or hinted at; this is not what the film ended up as. I love Elm Street and Freddy, enjoyed the new film very much, and hope, as always, to see more.I have been a fan for years, and enjoy the many films in this series. Jackie Earle Haley did a great job as Freddy. It took a little getting used to, as it always does when a classic character is played by someone new.

536,jammix32,The Bad News Bears meets Freddy Krueger,4,4 July 2011,"It seems as though producer Michael Bay is hell bent on remaking all of the iconic horror films of the 1980's. First Friday THE 13TH (which was nothing great to begin with) and now A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Wes Craven's 1984 horror classic (which was a great film). Frankly, this one didn't need to be remade at all because the original still stands on its own and is just as effective now as it was 26 years ago. To introduce Freddy Krueger to a new generation of technology obsessed teens, Bay and original NIGHTMARE producer Bob Shaye made this film- which is more of a re-envisioning than a standard remake. The story, conceived of by Wesley Strick and written by Strick and Eric Heisserer, takes a different approach to Freddy Krueger. In this new version he's personified by Jackie Earle Haley (the tough, cigarette smoking teen, Kelly from THE BAD NEWS BEARS films and more recently, Rorschach from 2009's WATCHMEN). Haley is a good character actor who can disappear into his roles quite well- but how do you step into the shoes (and sweater) formerly inhabited by Robert Englund? His Freddy Krueger is a horror movie icon and even teenagers living here and now in 2010 have at least heard of and probably seen the original incarnation of Freddy that he portrayed so wholeheartedly in 8 films and a TV show. Yes, yes it's a new century now- but FREDDY vs. JASON (the last time that Englund donned the claw) was released in 2003. That's not all that long ago. Here, Freddy looks more like a burn victim should look, with oozing blisters and narrow eyes bordered by scar tissue- but is this necessarily better? He looks completely different than Englund's Freddy looked, and he talks differently too- he talks like Jackie Earle Haley's raspy Rorschach talked with some sound effect used to make his voice even deeper so that it echoes through his scenes. I didn't find it all that effective. He's still a smart-ass, he still shoots off one liners before offing his victims- but none of it was any fun for me. Freddy has more of a back-story now. Turns out he was a maintenance man at a pre-school and he just loved children, spending lots of time alone with them (where were the teachers and the other staff?) and taking them down into his ""cave"". It's a dungeon-like hidden room in the basement of the pre-school and in that room, Freddy had his pedophile lair. Stop right there. In the original, Frederick Charles Krueger was a child murderer, freed by the courts on a technicality, hunted down by the parents of the little Elm Street kids and burned alive. There was no mention of him being a pedophile- no, he was a vicious murderer who liked to kill children and he was evil personified. Without going into too much detail about Freddy's origins- he made a deal with the devil, who kept him out of hell in exchange for bringing him souls- the souls of the kids that he stalked and killed in their dreams. Here Freddy isn't the personification of evil, he's a sick pedophile who doesn't even get a trial! He gets cornered and chased by a lynch mob of parents into a warehouse boiler room and then burnt to a crisp. This film actually makes Freddy into a somewhat sympathetic character (ok, maybe that's a bit too strong), or at the very least- he's watered down heavily. Thusly, it changes the feel of everything- including Freddy's presence. He's less intense, less frightening- in fact, he's kinda boring.Bottom line: This movie owes nothing to Wes Craven's classic horror film. Usually that's a compliment but not here. This unimaginative mess thinks that it's better than it actually is and it's made with a lot of confidence. Haley tries his best with the role of Freddy but he's no Robert Englund and that's all there is to it. This is actually an insult to fans of the original series and even though we're mostly in our early 30's now and have grown more mature- we still fondly remember the 1984 original that scared our pants off and introduced us to a wise-cracking serial dream killer with knives for fingers. Watching this update made me yearn even more to see Robert Englund's Freddy back on the screen again. I won't go as far as to say that this is a bastardization of the original, it's well made and decently acted- but it just doesn't work. You can't improve on something that doesn't need improving. If you are a teen who wants to get to know Freddy Krueger- go on Blockbuster online or Netflix (or even drive to an actual video store) and rent the entire series and make a day of it. Don't bother with this cheap imitation. Michael Bay, Bob Shaye : Some movies don't need to be remade because the original will always stand the test of time. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984) is one of those films.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
537,revgutterat,Not your cute and cuddly Freddy.,10,30 April 2010,"For a remake I think they did a fantastic job on this movie. Even though it isn't the most original plot ever conceived, the content, effects, and gore more than make up for the lack of originality. Freddy does look more like a burn victim and even though he still has a sense of humor they have up played the negative aspects of his character (his attitude toward young children... the teenage murders are why we loved him in the first place) which makes it harder to root for him. Some of the people at the show thought this ruined the Freddy character but I believed it gave him a much more savage edge that his cute and cuddly counterpart lacked. Don't get me wrong, Englund put his heart and soul into Freddy and has flavored the franchise since 1984 but Haley puts in a very respectable performance for a character that we are very familiar with. It appears that more concentrated energy was put into set design, which was beautiful, than original kills, which were savage but mostly homage to movies throughout the original series. Our new Freddy did add some new flavor to some of our old favorites but fans, and especially fanatics, of the old school will spot many nods to the old films. Finally, even though latex and buckets of Karo are my favorite mode of delivery, the updated CGI gore was extremely well done and didn't have that plastic edge that tends to ruin these types of movies. Horror fans both old school and new school should drop whatever they are doing and go see this film. Freddy fanatics, even though they have taken Freddy away from us Haley carries the torch with honor and we should judge him on his own merits, not on a ""he's ruining Robert Englund's character"" basis.

However the remakes have been very disappointing thus far with the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a slight exception. Enough of that though because they don't even belong in the same conversation with what Bayer & the cast of this movie did! It seemed like I was in a time warp & I finally got to go back to the early 80's and see Freddy on the big screen. He was a sort of different Freddy, Yes but he had all the same torturous tricks for the kids and even added some demented new tricks & lines of his own. Robert Englund is & will always be a horror master but Jackie Earl Haley is showing he has legs to carry the new series of Nightmare movies with his own vile twist. Kyle Gallner in the lead male role & Rooney Mara as the ""new"" Nancy were both great I felt in bringing the seriousness of the situation out without revealing too much playing their roles to perfection.

Freddy was the biggest disappointment. I was a child of the 80's and I grew up with the nightmare series. Freddy was my favourite horror bad guy. But this guy, was just BORING. His voice lacked character. I kept saying ""common dude put some enthusiasm in your voice"". But no, he seemed dull and bored. The old Freddy really loved to mess with the characters heads. He loved to kill and he showed it in his actions and voice. This new Freddy was so lame. The kills were a snore as well. Those that were remakes were done worse then the originals. You would think that after 20 years they would make them BETTER. But sadly no. There was more blood and gore in the originals. The end was so predicable and the characters were not any that you felt bad for. Nancy in the old one was likable and you really didn't want to see anything bad happen to her. But this new one wasn't likable and they all seemed like crappy emo kids. You just wanted to tell Freddy to just get it over with. Also the fact that they focused on Freddy being a paedophile was so stupid. It made you wonder, was he misunderstood? That is NOT what you want to do to the character FREDDY KRUGER! Freddy was always an evil person who killed children and bargained in hell to come back to seek the soles of his children. He was not a POSSIBLE GOOD GUY. We shouldn't pity him at all. The original made that bluntly obvious from the start. This one made you wonder, and damn it this is no suspense thriller!!!Anyways I did go on longer then I thought.

If you view this movie by itself without regarding any of the past titles, it's a hollow movie with some cheesy acting and some anti-climatic action. However there are a couple of creepy scenes that you'll be remembering for a while. When you view this movie as part of the entire franchise though, it can be satisfying. A lot of people complain because the movie has a Swiss cheese story and doesn't do the old ones justice, I say to that if you're looking for a good nightmare on Elm Street story you can't really do better than the originals... So go watch the originals! This movie for me does with the prequels do for Star Wars takes a classic story and puts a 21st century take on it. I didn't fall in love with this movie but seeing Freddy with a ton of realistic special- effects and some pretty cool bloody scenes made me happy movie watcher. So if you haven't seen the original movies I would suggest watching the very first one and then watching this one. The movie may not make you cry cheer or stand up screaming Oscar!!!

542,mrhitch32,Misjudged by too many and for the wrong reasons!,8,5 August 2013,"Let me start this review by touching upon a major issue that any remake faces; the people who will hate it just because it is a remake. More often than not, this is because these people were very much into the original film and it stops them from being open minded. I liken it to when you liked a song when you were growing up, which turned out to be a cover of a song from the 60's (a big thing in the 80's ad still goes on today), you love the song but as soon as your Mum or Dad heard it, they would tell you that the original was much better, but when you hear it yourself, you disagree; the same thing happens with film remakes, trust me. Add to that, many people are also 'peeved' at Hollywood cashing in on the name / success of older films instead of coming up with new ideas and I get their point, I truly do; but if that's how you feel, don't go see it then! The thing is, any film that is a remake is under double pressure anyway, not just because it needs to be a good enough work of cinema in it's own right but because in order for it to be appreciated it HAS to be better than the original and in my opinion, this NOES IS better than the original.This version, to my mind, actually does try to scare you; Freddy is a lot creepier than the original (i.e. not camp and silly) and I felt there was more honesty about Freddy's origins in this version than there were in the original (part of that being that as a society, the things that we used to 'not talk about' we talk about more and are thus more desensitised) which also added to the creepiness and Jackie Earl Haley's performance, to my mind, was brilliant. Robert Englund's Freddy is a cult figure, no doubt about it and I certainly wouldn't wish to take anything away from that, but remember, this is not Robert Englund's Freddy so do yourself a favour and don't try and compare apples with bananas. I hasten to add that I am 110% certain that many of the bad reviews it has received here on IMDb would not have occurred had it had not been a remake. Fact.I grant you, this is not the best film you will ever see; it has its faults and it's slow points (hence why I gave it an 8 out of 10), but it IS still a good film; it is well acted, much of the suspense and jumps are well thought out and delivered and if you can watch it without pre-judging it, you will enjoy it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
543,majabucko-997-967794,Not bad at all,8,30 October 2019,"I liked the movie, even though it's not as good as the old ones.

However, the story is ok and it reminds of the old times.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
544,RogerDAWN,From A Die Hard Freddy Fan!!!,1,20 October 2011,"I am a die hard fan of the series. You put Freddy in almost anything and I will enjoy it, well until now. I don't know what it is about this film but I can not sit through it. I even own it on Blu Ray and believe me once a month I'll throw it in but with the same results. It is extremely boring, dull acting, rehashed scenes from earlier movies, nothing new. Even the worse of the Nightmare sequels I can watch multiple times this is just awful and even for a remake! I never thought I would say this but the Friday the 13th remake wiped the floor with this one and I hated that movie but at least I can sit through it from beginning to end. Well look on the bright side if New Line makes a sequel they can not do any worse.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
545,groovybruceman,A Different Kind of Freddy,7,24 March 2016,"My first intro to A Nightmare on Elm St. was Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy Krueger. I was taken aback by the way he captured the air of a serial killer closely reminiscent of a demon. Jackie's performance was fantastic and he completely made Freddy his own character. Nothing about his performance copied Robert Engulund, who by the way, was FANTASTIC too! Robert made Freddy a wisecrackin' sicko while Jackie portrayed Freddy as a no-nonsense killer. This movie should not be hated so much. I would say both Robert and Jackie's performance are brilliant. Also, the origin story is different and more relevant and contemporary of today. It is more believable than the Freddy released on technicality of the old Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
546,al_clark-18234,Nostalgia can be a nightmare!,7,25 June 2020,"Jackie Earl Haley puts 100% into this role but his delivery is less over the top than his predecessor. He's trying something new here which is all he could have done given the outrage that he would have incurred had he tried to mimic the amazing Robert Englund. Damned (to hell) if does or damned if he doesn't. JEH is an amazing actor however and if this was the first ever NOES movie ever made then this performance would have cemented him in the Horror Hall of Fame.The younger cast were relatively unknowns which hurt this movie. The glue holding the legitimacy together for the studio were Clancy Brown, Jackie Earl Haley and Connie Britton. 10 years on its clear that this movie did no harm to the younger casts careers however as most of them moved into great roles in TV and film. This and a new take on the lore did outrage people at the time. However, I liked the new twists and turns.The crux of this review however is that this movie should never have been made. Not because it was bad, but because you can't take the original story and performances that were so unique and iconic and strike gold twice.The original series of movies were a cultural snapshot in time and filmmaking. They were dreaming if they thought that this was going to land any better than it did as diehard fans just wouldn't let it.Pros and Cons time;
PROS
100% effort to make a good movie from all involvedWell paced with a new twist to the taleNot too many empty jump scares, most drive the story forwardCONS

I see many going in with expectations to the contrary. That's where all the hate comes from.I loved every single thing about this movie. I will go so far as to say that, although not as epic, Jackie Earl Haley did with Freddy what Heath did with The Joker. I enjoyed the music to go with what you see. I enjoyed the new cast of sleep-depraved teens. The new Nancy (Rooney Mara) was gorgeous by the way, as was Katie Cassidy. The way things played out with all characters went by rather smoothly with a substantial amount of early and later twists. I hope they make a 2nd one.Until then, I shall enjoy Saw VII come October.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
548,xsilenttigerx,An excellent remake,10,23 October 2011,"First and foremost, I want to state that I have seen the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and I did enjoy it. This is one of the very few remakes of any film however that I like slightly more than the original. One of the things that I like the most is the pacing, coupled with the fact that we learn more about Freddy. I've noticed a ton of reviews complaining about this, stating that having some mystique about him is what made it interesting. From my point of view, getting to know why the killer is actually killing makes them even more disturbing. Everyone who kills has some reason for doing so, and when you find out why (again for me personally) it takes them to a new level. I felt the same way about Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"".Onto a different point, I've read conflicting reviews about the material in the movie. Some say there wasn't enough originality, while others seem to have a problem that it wasn't a shot for shot do over. I think it was the perfect balance of blending the old with the new. I believe they added the most iconic scenes from the first one (i.e. - the gloved hand coming out of the bathtub). While I did enjoy the ending to the original one more (the rag top on the convertible going up and having it revealed to be Freddy's sweater vs. Freddy sticking his knives into Nancy's mother's skull from behind and having them come out her eyes, before dragging her into the mirror), I thought the special effects for that scene were top notch. In fact, that brings me to another point...Some have said that the special effects were seriously lacking, and the only thing that made the movie semi-scary was the excellent sound. A few have even go on to say the special effects were cheesy and that the make-up for Freddy was stupid looking. To me, I think that's fans of the original just being too nit-picky. Speaking of which...I think FAR too many people made too big a deal of Robert Englund vs. Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy. It was just like the gripes over Jack Nicholson vs. Heath Ledger as the Joker. Both played the part different and because of that, both were superb for the role. Same rule applies here. Freddy still kept a few of his one liners, but he seemed more dark.As far as the other people in the movie, I love how people have said they come off as boring and will never amount to anything. Which is kind of funny, because aside from Johnny Depp, no one from the original ever made it to the big time. To me, I found them to be not so bad. We're they anything stellar? No, but they weren't so bad as to ruin the movie for me. Also, let's face it. They were supposed to be sleep deprived. How much substance do you expect an insomniac to have? All in all, I thought the movie was done excellently, as far as remakes go. The die hard fans of the original will never give the remake a chance, because they don't want to see a movie that they love get done over. To me, they both have their redeeming qualities, I love each one for different reasons, and I'm proud to have both in my horror genre collection. I think the biggest thing that people forget is that a remake isn't going to be an exact replica of its predecessor (""Psycho"" being the exception). You have to go in with an open mind and remember that a remake will not have everything the original did. If that's all you wanted, then I question why you would even bother watching it, only to gripe about it later.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
549,Morrighan1129,"As far as the 'modern' slasher movies go, it's not bad",7,3 November 2019,"Alright, so here's the thing... It's actually not bad.The acting is definitely passable. Some are actually pretty good, although I will say 'Jesse' and 'Nancy' get a 'C' rating. Quentin, Kris, and Dean are all very well acted.It doesn't go for the sheer brutality of the new Jason movie, instead more of a creepy, almost thriller with bits of slasher thrown in. When Freddy finally strikes, it's not always 'gorey' it's just creepy.It gives Freddy a motivation, and it gives you a reason to actively want him dead, beyond 'he chopped up teenagers who had sex'.Again... it's not a great perfect movie. But for a remade 80's slasher movie, it's decent. I enjoyed it. It was a good horror night movie to watch.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
550,bootown_inc,The Death of mainstream Horror?,1,5 May 2010,"Watching this poor excuse for a film made me wonder, what is left for the mainstream horror genre? As a lifelong horror fan I am deeply disturbed at the murder of the Freddy character and the butchering of Wes Craven's classic.Why these morons decided it would make sense to portray Freddy Krueger as a pedophile is beyond me. It was tasteless and actually took away from the character. The other actors were cardboard cut outs of the Emo variety, a trend that has surely run its course, and in all honesty, they couldn't die quick enough. Which leads me to the death scenes. Holy lack of ideas guys! This is Freddy Krueger! Master of dreamland. Able, in past incarnations, to dispatch victims with everything from hypodermic needles to televisions, make puppets of victims, hang them, suck the life out of them, turn them into roaches etc etc. So how do you tackle the endless possibilities? Oh just have him cut them all. The same way. Every time. Yawn. The story hinged on movie goers having seen the original as some plot points were just skimmed over and the Freddy dialog was laughable. This movie was completely generic unoriginal bile. Freddy could have been replaced with any number of villains and renamed Nightmare on Sorority Row, Nightmare on Halloween, The Nightmare I had last summer, you get the point.Come to think of it,this movie would have been better if Jackie Earl Haley showed up as Rorshach and killed all the characters for being so lame.It is bad enough that Hollywood has had to resort to countless remakes (get some ideas!!!!) but to flat out destroy them in the manner of A Nightmare on Elm St is just depressing.What next? I can't think of a single mainstream horror film in the past year that has shown any semblance of originality, even a clever spin on an old idea. Not that it worries me too much. Independent Horror movies always seem to show the big boys how it's done. It's just sad that we can't sit in a cinema any more and watch something fresh.I know they will keep sucking the public in with clever marketing and advertising ( I must admit the new NOES trailer had me excited) and rake in the box office dollars, but what they are really doing is dumbing down movie goers and ruining a genre that used to be entertaining. Now it's just boring.R.I.P Freddy. I'll miss ya.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
551,JigsawDude,Excellent remake! Top notch scares! Better then the original?,10,30 April 2010,"If you read the title of this review then guess what everything I said was true. I just got back from the 7 pm showing of Nightmare On Elm Street and right away i knew that this was by far the best remake i have ever seen! Im not the person to jump In my seat or scream at scary parts, my girlfriend did both lol, when i get scared my heart races and thats what happened through out this whole film.The remake pays great homage to the original, not trying to be better or worse then the original but damn let me tell you even without trying it was better then the original! Now I know that i will like get fanboys of the original reading this review that will bash me for my opinion on this film but I'm sorry guys this movie is scary, though predictable when it comes to jump scares, its not predictable exactly when and how they will happen, Jackie takes the role of Freddy and makes it his own without trying to overshadow Roberts performance.All and all this Is an excellent horror film, even if you are a major fan of the original and know that to you this film will not be better then original try seeing it as a stand alone film and giving your opinion on it that way, cause if you go in wanting it to be worse then the original then it will be.10/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street

You gotta be kidding me! The acting in the original was horrible. Depp wasn't even on his A game and the main character Nancy was pretty bad.

The only this that should be changed is the face of the new Freddy. Other than that this movies is a stud. Technically i give this movie an 8 but i gotta give it a 10 so that the score gets brought up cause people are being ridiculous with rating this movie. Im seriously annoyed with the critics.

554,djosephh,Would watch it again,10,6 May 2010,"As a fan of the Nightmare franchise, NOES (1984) is in my top ten films to watch, I wasn't to sure what to expect from this. Don't get me wrong I have been anticipating this films release for quite some time. Having just watched, I have to say that I came out of the film with a smile on my face, and that is a good thing as I really enjoyed it.It strikes me as strange that supposed ""fans"" of the original have been on the hate bus since it was announced that the film was being remade. I mean anything that keeps the character of Freddy in the minds of people and introduces him to a new generation is good with me. If you ask anyone that knows me I have been a fan of Freddy for a long time, actually when I was 11 I used to have pictures of Freddy on the inside of my desk, when most people had pictures of footballers or New Kids On The Block.Anyway onto the film I really enjoyed that they used the concept from Freddy Vs Jason that if no one talked about Freddy he would not exist as it was the kids fear that fuelled him. I also enjoyed how they blurred the line between the real world and the dream world, not just using the micro-naps, but also visually. I really enjoyed Jackies take on the character of Freddy, there was so much anger in his voice. The humour was not over the top, which is good as it was getting really annoying in some of the sequels.Some of the dream sequences were excellent too, especially when Kris is in the classroom and falls asleep. I also enjoyed the fact that it payed homage to the original and the many sequels that came after. I really enjoyed the very last scene were Nancy and her mum come home from the hospital a Freddy appears in the mirror and drags Nancys mum through the mirror.The back story was good too, as you did not really know if Freddy was guilty of the sick stuff that he was supposed to have done, until near the end, it was good how they used a dream to explain the back story. They could have done a really cheesy thing and did the back story at the beginning and then something come up on screen saying ""ten years later"".The score was good too, they used mostly the original music but updated it a little. The only issues I had with the film is that Nancy needed to be stronger she needed to be more of a fighter, also the dialogue was not the best, but then again the original wasn't that great.Anyway I would definitely go and see this film despite what some haters are saying about it. I'm actually going to see it again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
555,ferarri007,What happened to Freddy's Imagination and Sense of Humor,6,21 May 2010,"I grew up watching the nightmare on elm street movies so it was easy to spot the difference in this one. During the movie I was wondering, whats wrong with the dreams? Why are they not creative and creepy like they are supposed to be? And Freddy is supposed to have and awesome sense of humor. I mean, the new Freddy tried i give him props for that, but his tone on voice and his too-realistic, burn-victim new face mad him seem more dark and gloomy than funny. It was a good movie, but it lacked what made Freddy such an awesome villain. I mean, I know its a remake and they try to take a different angle on it, but I think that they should also try to preserve the qualities that made Freddy Kruger so lovable in the previous movies. I also thought the dreams wern't ""trippy"" enough. I mean, in the old movies, all the nightmares were creative and interesting and even funny. I give props to Kyle Gallner though because he was the most interesting and believable character in the entire movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
556,bx_version_2,Best Nightmare since the original,10,1 May 2010,"I have been waiting for this movie since i first heard about it and i must say with mixed reaction since the remake of Friday The 13th was a bomb IMO. This A Nightmare On Elm St far exceeded all of my expectation.The new incarnation of Freddy goes farther than Robert ever took him. This new Freddy is darker, more evil and sadistic than the original. The back story of this Freddy was so much better than the original, it gave it a more intense feeling and would make even the most hardened horror movie fans skin crawl in some parts.This movie like all the Elm St's is not without it's comedic elements but they don't take it to far. They try to keep on track as much as the possibly could, and stick to the story.They did not skimp on the new Nancy, she is as strong and believable as the original.Well all i really need to say now is see this movie... then again... and again... and again... i know i will :D",A Nightmare on Elm Street
557,dannyboyanderson,Honest review from a Huge fan of the Horror sub Genre.,6,9 May 2010,"the late 70's and all through the 80's were times when horror movie icons were born. as time went on through the 2000's remakes have become a big deal which meant that Hollywood was running out of ideas for an original horror movie. Michael bay and his platinum dunes have been known as of late to make reboots to all of our favorite horror films. Texas chainsaw massacre being one of their better products.when the movie was first announced i was excited. because i have never liked the nightmare on elm street movies as a kid, and i was banking on this to change my mind about Fred Kreuger. so as time continued, i sat down and watched every NOES movie from the first one up to Freddy VS Jason. i guess when i got older i fell in love with the series and really had high hopes for the reboot. it was time to go see the movie.now my thoughts on this film and I'm going to be completely honest. i wasn't impressed as i was hoping to be. i felt that the movie was lacking a lot of the feelings that the original would give out. the Characters to me felt as if they were put in the movie just to die. the main character isn't as outgoing as the original. there were a lot of areas that i loved and a lot where i was wondering why they even bothered.now Freddy Kreuger i will admit was on par with Robert Englund, and i am glad to know that they casted the right guy. he feels much darker than englunds Freddy, which is what Freddy was supposed to be to begin with.the Overall movie experience is a good one, but not a great one. you feel happy when you see Freddy, but not when hes off screen, if that makes any sense. i will buy the movie when it comes out, just because i love Horror films. i give this movie an 8 out of 10. good but not great.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
558,m-a-b6954,SHOCKINGLY BAD!!... contains minor spoilers,2,26 May 2010,"This movie was essentially a bad rip off of the original ""A nightmare on Elm Street""! They took a classic and destroyed it...They could have done so many things with this movie. Part of what makes the Nightmare on Elm Street movies so memorable are there sheer creativity. However seeing a character being knifed through the stomach is about as creative as this movie gets.The acting was just plain bad, the actors were supposed to be portraying high school students even though they looked old enough to be teachers. The new Freddy Kreuger is boring, and keeps repeating the same one-liners from the series, even Freddy versus Jason!I was expecting the typical B grade movie nudity when a scene popped up showing Nancy getting into the bath tub... Surprisingly there was no nudity, although there was no suspense either. This movie is extremely predictable, I literally predicted nearly every moment of it and kept poking my friend to mention what was going to happen next.It's generally a bad sign when you're paying more attention to other people in the cinema rather than watching what's happening on the screen. Although I did manage to notice the girl behind me had fallen asleep.I rated this movie a two as it may be worth watching for someone who has never seen the original. I read the reviews on here before seeing the movie but simply refused to believe that Hollywood had destroyed my favorite horror movie character. I wish I hadn't had seen it.Do not pay to see this movie at the cinemas, wait for it to come out on DVD. This is the last crappy remake ill be seeing from Platinum dunes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
559,Dragon_slayer124,I had enough of this stupid remakes.,5,29 May 2010,"i was actually hyped for this, sure it had mixed reviews. But people said that it was original. So i wanted to see this badly,and now and want my 90 minutes back and my money. Why do they keep making this remakes? The answer is of course money. The story is what makes the movie interesting. A dream demon named Freddy Kruger is killing teenagers in their dreams.The problem with the movie is that it keeps stealing from the original but gives nothing back. I wouldn't mind if the movie could make me afraid and get me frightened like it is supposed to. But at the beginning of the movie you will notice that the movie follows a really linear path. It keeps trying to scare you over and over again, and in the end it just feels ridiculous.The only thing that was good with the movie was the performance of Jackie Earle Haley who did a great job as Freddy Kruger. Sure he will never be as good as Robert but he did OK.At the end i am really disappointed . I can't see a good reason for this remake unless money. And i hope that they let the franchise die.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
560,Black-Fandango,Elm Street sure is one boring place.,2,8 July 2011,"With one change to the mythology, the Nightmare On Elm Street remake gets off about as wrong as a film can. In the original film, Freddy Krueger was a convicted child murderer released on a technicality. Outraged by this, the vengeful parents of Elm Street track him to the abandoned boiler room where he took his victims, and burn it down with him inside. After his death, Krueger haunts the dreams of the Elm Street children, killing them in their sleep, and punishing the parents for what they did to him. The idea behind this is that retribution for an evil act does not redeem it, but only perpetuates it (a strong theme in another Wes Craven film: The Last House On the Left). In sort, two wrongs don't make a right.In this film, Krueger is an alleged child molester who works as a custodian at a preschool, and is similarly lynched by the parents after they learn what he did to their children. Their reason for not going to the police is that they don't want their kids to have to go through a trial. Years later, the kids are in high school, and they have all repressed the memory of their molestation (seriously, every single one of them?), and all for the better as far as their parents are concerned. But, the kids start having nightmares, and start dying off (big shock). They start putting together the story behind the man in their dreams, and condemn their parents as they believe they have killed an innocent man. Later in the film, however, it is made clear that Krueger is indeed guilty, and is killing the kids out of revenge for telling their parents about what he was doing. So the message here is, I guess, if you are raped, don't report it because, if you do, your attacker will kill you. The morality in this movie is seriously messed up.This would all be somewhat forgivable if A Nightmare On Elm Street were a well-made film, but the problems with this film are legion. Whereas the original film painted its picture in dark, primary colors, this film's entire color palate consists of this ugly green-brown tint – as if the camera has a special dirty shower-door filter. Replacing the surrealism and atmosphere of the original are...JUMP SCARES, and....JUMP SCARES, and....................oh, just a cat...............MORE JUMP SCARES!!!! Yawn. The film tries to pull a Janet Leigh on us by naming one of the characters Kristen (also the name of Patricia Arquette's character from Dream Warriors), but once the movie tries to recreate Tina's iconic death scene from the original, you know she's dead. Sorry movie, you can't have your cake and eat it too. Instead of practical effects, here we have unconvincing CGI. The acting ranges from Popsicle-stick wooden to a form of underplayed melodrama (I know that sounds like an oxymoron but, trust me, it's not). A recreation of the body-bag scene from the original is amateurishly edited with all the shot in the wrong order. The film also spends way too much time establishing stuff we already know. ""If you die in your dream you die for real."" Yeah, I know.The only bright-spot in this reprehensible piece of garbage is Jackie Earl Haley (most famous for playing Rorschach in Watchmen), who seems to be relishing the part of Freddy Kreuger. If only he were given a better movie to play it in.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
561,Varian321,Very Very Bad,2,1 May 2010,"I have nothing against remakes in fact sometimes I feel they are rather good, like the first Texas Chainsaw remake. This movie however is just bad, the acting never a biggy in horror films feels like you are watching people who have not yet learned to act. The special effects look no better then the original, and freddy just doesn't have the same spookyness that the old one had. The movie does not scare at all and is more a comedy at how bad it is than anything else. Everything in this movie lacks orginality, which I feel is its greatest weakness, the movie should try something new, that is what made the first Nightmare on Elm Street so great was it was a new type of villain a new way to scare, this goes for by the book trying very hard to capture the greatness of the original without ever coming anywhere near close to it. This is not only a poor remake of the original but just an all around horrible movie that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, trust me save yourself and don't even rent this one wait till it goes to Big Lots for $3 I would give it a year tops to hit that point if the public and critics voice their opinions.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The director did not come with anything new... All the things happening, even the lines are the same as in the other parts.. All he did was just take the good scenes out of the others and mix them together. And something that I never expected...Freddy is not Freddy anymore, because he's not played by Robert Englund anymore... So the result is a more wise-effect slasher but with no story and absolutely no idea whatsoever, not to mention the cast... It's not a remake and it's not a sequel.. It's just a marketing strategy.. 3 out of 10, just because I feel nostalgic.. I miss Freddy. The real Freddy. If you want to see this, just stay at home and turn your volume up, that should do it, since the sound of his claws on the metal pipes is omnipresent.. and try not to fall asleep, but not because Freddy's comin' for you, but because this is boring, especially if you saw the other parts.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
563,divisionbell-2,Finally a Freddy movie truly worth caring about!!!,8,10 May 2010,"The first thing you need to know is that you can forget all of the critical reviews of this movie. If you read through most of the reviews (rottentomatoes has a great supply of them) you'll notice that almost none of the reviewers actually have anything to say about the movie. They clearly hate the film on the basis that it is a remake, without any substance to what exactly is wrong with it. The scenes they call out are all shots from the trailer and one has to wonder if any of them actually watched this movie. They've called out the kids for being like Twilight (because one of the actors is??), they say the CG is bad (because of one quick shot of Freddy coming through the wall??) and they say that Freddy is nothing but one-liners, yet can only seem to reference his one line from the trailers. Do critics even watch movies anymore? Let's just say that this is quite possibly the greatest Nightmare on Elm Street film ever made. Allow me to explain before disagreeing with me.First off, we have to talk about Nancy. I went into this movie expecting her to be awful. From the trailer she looks like all she can do is make the ""deer in the headlights"" look. She actually turned out to be good! She's 10x better than the original Nancy (who has to be one of the worst actresses I have ever seen). I can't understand why everyone is complaining that the old Nancy was so amazing. She was just awful and one of the worst parts of the original. The new Nancy actually comes across like a real teenager.Then there's Freddy. The studio could not have hired a better actor to fill those shoes. Forget about people complaining about him being too small, bad effects, or too skinny. This is the Freddy we've always loved. Not the jester he became, but the evil, angry, psychotic Freddy who launched a franchise. Did people forget that the original movie had a skinny little Freddy running around waving his arms in the air and laughing like a psycho?? The ""new"" Freddy is creepy, seriously, and absolutely angry at the world and it shows!! His one-liners are perfect and he's driven by an anger that keeps him coming for more. This is the serious nature every fan should be excited over!! Jackie Earl Haley nailed it!! This is the kind of remake I wish we could see more of. The director took the best parts of the series and blended them together beautifully. The dream sequences are dark and creepy and slip in and out perfectly. There is a constant feeling of dread as each teenager is pulled into the nightmare and for once the whole story just seems to make more sense. There is a legitimate reason why this is happening to the teenagers and for once Freddy is the monster he always should have been. And his ""new"" back story (the original story Wes Craven intended) makes all the little details that much more disturbing. We finally see WHY Freddy is so angry and hell-bent on butchering these seemingly random teenagers.So forget everything you read and give this movie a shot. It's nowhere near as bad as the critics want you to believe it is. My only guess is that it is because A) the movie is a remake and B) the material is darker than before and it upsets people. But if you are a true 'Nightmare' fan, you'll be more than happy with this reboot. And let's just take a second to think about the first movie. If you watch it again, premise aside, it's actually a bad film. While the story is cool and the effects are decent for their time (although one has to question how a man who was burned alive has no burns on his chest), the acting is absolutely atrocious across the board, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. Don't get me wrong, I grew up on these movies and I love them! But the original is slow and it's pretty terrible. We all just have a fond memory of it.It's easy for critics to make pop-culture references regarding this movie (how many critics now have likened the teens to the movie twilight??) and write this film off. But it's dark, brutal and one truly angry horror movie!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
564,aladinsyne,Just as advertised......A REMAKE!,3,3 May 2010,"The original 1984 ""NIGHTMARE"" is and will always be the best of the ""nightmare franchise"",which WES CRAVEN both wrote & directed. This REMAKE, well...director Samuel Bayer did absolutely that...he made a remake...AND by doing so, he failed to incorporate what WE CRAVEN created, the scary alternate world of a nightmare, a world where FREDDY KRUGER reigned supreme & the ""ESSENCE of EVIL"" from the original. This remake failed to carry over the intensity of the scenes, the FEAR that Robert Englund conjured as FREDDY. All the CGI and special effects in the world failed to resuscitate this ""all ready dead by Fred"" at the gates effort of a remake. HOWEVER, a stellar performance by Kyle Gallner, a role originally played by Johnny Depp, his medicated yet righteous take on teen angst stole the thunder from everyone, including the lead. This movie failed to even scare a single hair from my body....I gave it 3 stars simply because, it had the original in mind.....sorry folks, no nightmare here....",A Nightmare on Elm Street
565,oneiroi,"Three, four......this is such a bore",1,1 June 2010,"While watching this remake, somewhere around the forty minute mark, I became incredibly drowsy. Ironic, isn't it? I'm just grateful I didn't pay to see it, although I'll never get that ninety minutes of my life back.This movie is truly bad and there are plenty of reasons why. Lackluster writing with illogical plot holes, sluggish pacing, poor editing, unappealing characters, dull, uninspired kills, banal, pedestrian dreams sequences, bad acting and a non-menacing, non-threatening, non-charismatic villain. Some key elements necessary for a successful thriller/horror (suspense, tension and atmosphere), are nowhere to be found. Instead, we get jump scares (with the requisite high volume) that have no effect, as every one of them is telegraphed ahead of time. Like nearly every horror movie of the last decade, Nightmare is visually drab, dreary and a touch grungy, relying on either desaturation or over-saturation of green, orange or blue. The jump scares and depressing/nauseating color palette are tropes that have long outstayed their welcome.Recycling lines and scenes from previous Nightmare films is sheer laziness and the recreations of the iconic scenes from the original (wall, bathtub, body bag) feel like last minute inserts hurriedly added as an afterthought. Poorly executed, they fail to deliver anything resembling creepiness or suspense. (As a side note: am I the only one who noticed that Nancy obsessively drawing grotesque and frightening pictures is lifted from Wes Craven's New Nightmare?) Kris' death was unintentionally hilarious, what with the somersaulting and ping-ponging around the room via obvious wire work, but even worse, it was anti-climactic. Another problem was that there was no emotional investment created with any of the characters, so their deaths had no impact. The viewer doesn't know them at all or finds them so bland that you either don't care what happens to them or want them to die as quickly as possible.Nancy's perpetually expressionless face and leaden monotone made me question if her diet consisted solely of Quaaludes and pasty faced, emo Quentin looked liked he wandered in off the set of a Twilight movie. I was hoping Jackie Earle Haley could offer something to justify my watching this, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Freddy in this remake is far too chatty, not in the least bit frightening and doesn't possess any of the physical gracefulness and élan that Robert Englund provided. I don't, however, blame Haley, but the director and writer.Some other maddening items. Freddy's glove is never explained. Nor why all these kids suffer from repressed memories/collective amnesia for all those years, or why Kris' mother kept her daughter's dress (presumably torn by Freddy). The excuse that Freddy fled town before the parents could call the police was nonsense; if the parents were able to track him down, surely the police could have? Nancy and Quentin's non-reaction when they learn they had been molested by Groundskeeper Willie - sorry, Fred Krueger - is not only laughable, it's beyond stupid.I'm not sure which Platinum Dunes remake of an '80's classic I detest more; Nightmare or that exercise in the craptastic, The Hitcher. It really doesn't matter, because the Anti-Christ Michael Bay and his minions will continue to churn out the product, ie: s*** sandwiches; flavorless processed lunch meat on stale white bread which will continue to be consumed by those with short attention spans who were weaned on flash edited MTV videos. Avoid this and watch the original instead, or the excellent four hour documentary, Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy.This remake is nothing but a crass cash grab and it shows.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
566,Revolutionumber9,worse than pearl harbor. good job mike,3,1 June 2010,"Did anyone feel that the audio on Freddy's voice was mixed louder than the rest of the characters emphasizing the terrible overdub job? Additionally, this had some of the worst acting i've ever seen. The clichés were, simply put: poop. And, most importantly, they relied on quick camera cuts and sudden loud noises as the sole method of scaring the audience, whereas in the old nightmare on elm street, Freddy himself just scared the bejesus out of you, proving that Robert Englund is the man. Last but not least, it took less than one minute for lame Freddy to appear. don't good scary movies (jaws, the ORIGINAL nightmare on elm street, the exorcist, and on and on...) delay the appearance of the bad guy to create suspense? You could feel the corny ""michael bay"" touch that is in all of his movies. He should have just remade pearl harbor instead. that movie sucked, but not as much as this movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
567,ondaalex,"Honestly, the best remake in recent years",8,6 May 2010,"So when I was going in to the theater to see this movie, I had a gut feeling that this movie wouldn't be very good. I thought this because I had seen the original and LOVED IT. However, I came out thinking a very different thing. I thought that this movie was FANTASTIC! It paid it's homage to its original while still holding its own. I thought that Jackie Earle Haley played a great Freddy, and the whole cast did a great job. It was very well made and I enjoyed it a lot. In comparison to the original, it was equally as good. Freddy still had some great comedic lines in this movie. Granted, not as many as in the original one, however he still had some funny lines. The dream sequences were a bit darker but who cares, they were very good. So, both the original and the remake were great! The original was good in its own way and the remake was good in its own way as well. I really enjoyed it and it was very fun to watch and I think that if you're a Freddy Kruger fan, definitely put this one on your list! I thought that this was very good and definitely owned up beyond my expectations. It was the absolute best remake I've seen so far.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
568,smithc266,"Not Bad, But Not Good",4,30 April 2010,"I can complain about how Jackie does not compared\ to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, or how Freddy's face now looks more like an alien than a burned victim, but there is so much else wrong with this movie. I went into this movie actually excited for this, to see how Freddy Krueger changed. What I found was a massive disappointment. ***(Somewhat small spoiler) The plot itself was changed to a sort of ""uh oh, we forgot what happened"" thing that just made the movie sort of cheesy, and unbelievable since I don't see people forgetting about it. (Spoiler ended)*** The characters were underdeveloped, and I didn't find myself caring about a single one. The limit of their development was them saying obvious lines on what was going on. ""If you die in your dreams, you die in real life!"" On top of that, the only scares offered were the cliché ""pop into view with loud music playing"", going for trying to make you just jump rather than having the creepy atmosphere which the original movie did quite well. And it didn't make me jump once since it was rather obvious throughout the entire movie where Freddy would show up. I think the worst thing about this movie was how boring it was. It grabbed my attention with the first scene, but after that I was just sitting there watching the same exact thing happen over and over again. The beginning and the last scenes were decent, but everything in the middle just had me checking my phone to see how much longer I had to suffer through. A Freddy Krueger movie has so many opportunities to grab one's attention, yet the directors managed to make it far too slow and uneventful. The only reason I'm giving this movie four out of ten is because it was interesting to see Jackie's version of Freddy. His voice got a little old after awhile, and as I mentioned earlier his new face makes him look like an alien, but it provided a different version of the beloved character.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
569,cheetahwings,"I wish I could rate it zero stars, and I haven't even seen it.",1,22 October 2010,"I have done the same thing Wes Craven did, I absolutely REFUSE to watch this movie, and if you think it is unfair to review it without even seeing it let me tell you why.It is a remake, I think we all know that, but some casual movie goers might not realize that and that is truly a shame, if they absolutely have to remake anything they should at least slap ""Remake"" on the poster. I always disliked remakes, especially Horror remakes, From the remake of the perfect Hitchcock film. The huge trend in horror remakes specifically seemed to really start with ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre"" which I believe did well at the box office, but that was from unsuspecting fans, I mean who hasn't heard Of ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre""? then after that the one that stands out on my radar is ""Friday the 13th"" That one I suspected from a hundred miles away, like the franchise wasn't milked enough with the large amount of sequels, (My favorites being 1 and 2) but if they really wanted to cash in on the title, why not make another sequel? Sure the sequels were getting pretty bad, but it would be better than remaking the GOOD first movie!!! God, the last sequel was Freddy vs. Jason in 2003, (That was actually pretty good) thats only six years till they remade the original, 7 till a nightmare on elm street, But even after that I didn't expect ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" To be Remade EVER. The movie was already perfect.But then the big one happened, ""Halloween"" was remade, and it was then I knew every good horror movie would be remade eventually, Its sad now Child's Play is being Remade, it sucks, There we but there are the occasional good ones, like ""Cape Fear"", and ""Scarface"", but there really never should be a remake in the first place even IF they are good. Go ahead and milk the Nightmare series to death. Go ahead and let Freddy come back to life and go on killing in endless sequels, but don't actually remake the original GOOD film, in fact remaking good movies has NO POINT at all besides cashing in on the title,when allot of studios don't realize what they are doing is completely dumb, if they really want to cash in on famous movies, why not RE-RELEASE the films? This seems to never happen anymore, at least not like a normal movie being released, they always put it in theaters for a week, or in the Case of ""The Exorcist"" only ONE day, which was a shame, because if it were released for the rest of October, it would do amazingly in the box office again from younger fans wanting to see it in theaters for the first time, and if they did this with all the films they remade, I bet they would make Much more than the remakes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
570,connor_sniper,"Not perfect, but a trip for the people who have been dying to see Freddy again.",8,3 May 2010,"Before writing I should clearly disclaim that this review will be written with a bias towards the Kruger films. I am certainly a fan boy and this is written to the people who are fans of the ever-popular villain, but are still on the fence as to whether or not to see him in his own film after 16 years.In all truth I will start out by stating what should be obvious: the acting is abhorrently bad. This is true throughout almost all horror films to date, and this movie is no exception. There are only two actors who truly stick out, the character of Quentin (apologies for not knowing the actor's name) and of course Freddy Kruger. Jackie Earl Hayley's performance unfortunately does not rank above the great Robert Englund, however after seeing him in Kruger's shoes I can honestly say I could not see any other actor taking on this role.Hayley carries the one-liners almost as well as Englund. He has some of the classic lines from a couple of the previous films as well as an additional comment to an older, however slightly changed, classic scene.The addition of classic scenes have a mixed reception among fans. Some say they were just thrown in there for a lack of better ideas and others say that they were homage to the classic considering the fact that it is a remake. In all honesty I can see how both of these claims could be true, however seeing some of these scenes remade with modern technology made the fan boy inside me smirk throughout the entire movie. I loved being able to see some of the things that scared the crap out of me as a kid reinvented in another way, and if you are any form of fan I can promise you will too.The musical score has the same creepy vibe as the original did, which fits well with the undertone of the more sinister villain we encounter in this entry of the series.The only problem is the score doesn't make up for the terrible pacing the movie puts forth. The script is changed ever so slightly to fit the more modern audience but the way it was done completely strips away the character development that the original had done so well. Unlike the Friday the 13th remake, which included the typical ""drugs, sex and gore"" routine, Nightmare tried to reach that audience without sinking as low as the other film had. There is blood, but to be honest I think the older one could be considered more violent than the remake. Lack of sex and ridiculous amounts of drugs made me feel as if they had retained some of the Nightmare style of the 80's which didn't focus on that sort of thing as much as F13 did.For that reason alone I could hear teenagers walking out of my theater saying how ""it wasn't scary at all"" or ""that blonde chick should have gotten naked"". Its sad that this is what the horror genre has to appeal to now in order to make it successfully.I personally loved the film and plan on seeing it again soon. Friday the 13th was a butchered remake for a bunch of 14 year old kids to see at the brink of their curfew. Nightmare on Elm Street will not be appreciated by all, especially teenagers, however those true fans who knew someone who lived on an Elm Street will have some major nostalgia coupled with a large smile on your face upon leaving the theater.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
571,Rdavison1412,Let's just lustfully daydream as to what it could have been...,5,2 June 2010,"A huge disappointment! OK, I know these horror remakes of late are often proving that classics are often best left alone, but I actually fancied this. I thought the Krueger franchise would really provide a great source for a modern imagining. A darker Freddy, some developed back- story, gorier dream sequences... what could go wrong I thought (hoped!). The answer must lay heavily on the door of director Samuel Bayer. He demonstrates a monumental lack of skill behind the camera throughout this movie. The film is terribly paced, the clichés aren't akin to nostalgic joy as one hoped, but simply stuffed-in because it must've seemed like the thing to do at the time I guess... it's just horrible in this department! However, I would argue this is what tends to happen when you put what could have been a great reinvention of fabulous source material in the sole hands of a director that has nothing more to his name than music videos. OK, everybody's got to start somewhere but, please, not with Freddy. Also, just because Fincher proves the exception to this rule doesn't mean lightning can strike twice! I am so disappointed to see that Bayer has been given the sequel. I can only lustfully imagine what this could have been...Jackie Early Haley is OK as Freddy but at times I felt like he was no more than an amazing Freddy impersonator. He would certainly steal the show at a Halloween party of Horror convention. This role is easily still Englund's! Also, there is no matching of roles, a la Nicholson and Ledger like I really hope there would be. Englund should have been brought back, just as I sincerely hope they will retain Brad Dourif for Chucky. If it ain't broke, don't fix it... certainly don't take such a blind punt as this.The worst part of the movie however has to be the incredibly unforgiving concept of 'sleep' throughout the remake. In the originals this concept acts as a character in itself, often one of the scariest elements. This is sadly ignored in this version and is instead replaced by one minute healthy teens suddenly falling victim to chronic narcolepsy, as when called for them to be in the Freddy-slashing spotlight. Please... this could have been an angle of suspense, adding some scares rather than being as cringe-worthy as it proves. Here's just hoping Bayer ups his ante for the sequel as remaking this franchise has so much potential. It would be a shame to waste it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
572,lindsay_lund,There really is no 'Nightmare' without Robert Englund!,7,2 May 2010,"I saw this movie last night. I admit, I read all the reviews on this site while waiting for the movie to start. I am an avid horror/suspense/thriller/gore watcher and I was excited about a remake of this horror classic, but was apprehensive when I heard Robert Englund was not going to part of this project.Overall it was an OK movie and I would suggest it to anyone after it made it's way to Redbox.It had a typical story line, some great gore and gave a different take on the whole Elm Street story. But no one can ever replace the stellar performance that Robert Englund did for so many years, even through those horrible spin-off TV shows. The one thing that truly bothers me is the HORRENDOUS make-up job they gave to Freddy. OMG - he looks deformed! No dimension or expression to his face at all. ANd I kept thinking to myself when they did full face shots of him, was I really looking at Freddy or a distorted, burned, hairless image of the Beast in the 80's TV series ""Beauty and the Beast"". It was awful!!! Another thing was his voice. Very monotone. The pitch and sound never changed. It was stiff and rigid like lines read by students in a high school play.In the end it was worth the $20 spent, a kid-less night out with the hubs!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
573,mschumann,"Solid ""re-imagining"" of this classic horror film.",8,2 May 2010,"Platinum Dune's ""re-imagining"" of A Nightmare on Elm Street was in my opinion a wonderfully make film that far surpasses the remakes of this time (Friday the 13th, Black X-Mas). This film finally brings Freddy back to his roots as the dark, ominous, and terrifyingly sadistic dream killer. After its premiere, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews, stubbornly comparing this film to the original. Even though this film was basically a remake, viewers should take a disinterested approach when watching this film. Meaning, they should judge this film solely on its form. This film did a wonderful job giving the a new background to Freddy, including wonderful flashback scenes that really gave us some temporary sympathy for poor ole' Fred Krueger. I loved how this film actually had us guessing if he was innocent or not for a good bit of the film, even though it was vaguely obvious that he wasn't from the start. This background information really built a solid foundation for this film to stand on, and that is what sets it apart from various other horror flicks that just focus on the next kill or sex scene.I'm not going to make this review long and boring, so I will get straight to the main points. The GOOD: - The acting was not bad at all. Yes, Rooney Mara's character was a bit dry and monotonous at sometimes, but thank goodness that Kyle Gallner stepped in to save the day. Katie Cassidy does wonders with her small role as well as Dekker's solid performance. - Jesse's death scene was the best of the film... but it was mostly Freddy who did a wonderful job on this scene. - The background of Kruger was phenomenally done, with his death and his life as the school's grounds keeper. - The death scenes were very nice, not overly CGI'ed and actually suspenseful. I really did not see the generic scare formula in these scenes as so many critics have been complaining about. - Haley's Freddy is absolutely wonderful. Not taking anything away from Englund's Freddy which was very iconic for his Nightmare films. But, Haley really stepped it up, as expected, making Freddy scary again. I loved his one liners, which weren't over done. - The tone of the movie was perfect, and YES, the serious route is the way to go. I have not the slightest clue why some critics have complained about how the film does not make Freddy funny like in the original. This film makes Freddy what he should be, a burned up, enraged killer. Come on, that's what this film needed! Platinum Dunes does right with Freddy, making him into the sadistic pedophile he should be. - The idea of Micro naps was ingenious and a refreshing way for Freddy to attack. - The ending was perfect, not the fight scene, but the ending with Nancy's mom. This was a wonderful homage to the original and was really done well. - Kris's death scene, like Tina's from the original, was also done well, maybe not as good as the original, but certainly awesome. - I don't care what people say, I loved his new look. It had just the right amount of CGI to take his look to whole other level. Well done!The BAD: - The film did seem to be a bit rushed. - They killed Freddy way too fast, however, if we all remember in the original, they got rid of him just as fast. Although, if they wanted a fight scene, it should have been longer. The way he died was lame, and Nancy's final words to him was basically the same as in FvJ. - As well as the bathtub scene, Quentin being pulled underwater kind of took care of that. But, why even have Freddy's glove come up from the water if nothing eventually happens? - Marcus Yeon... ehh, could have done without this web cam scene. But, it was understandable why it was added... just saying, it could have been gone about in a different way. - Platinum Dunes cut too much from the film... I read about all the deleted scenes and was a but frustrated why some of them weren't kept in the theatrical version... oh, well, I guess the DVD will have tons of extra features to satisfy me.The UGLY: - The CGI wall scene... yeah, I'm with everyone else on this one. It was overly done and not effective; pretty much useless.So, overall... this was a very solid film. I very much enjoyed it. Like I said, I just don't understand its negative reviews, especially Roger Ebert's review. I can't believe he gave it one star and Friday the 13th remake 2 stars. (probably because he liked the sex scenes in that one, heh...yep.) Anyway, I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, and this was mine. Furthermore, I DO recommend seeing this film, especially for those die-hard fans like myself. But, I will suggest not overly comparing it to the original... you'll enjoy it much, much more. And yes, I will buy the DVD when it comes out. :)",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Texas Chainsaw Massacre, WAY to much gore. Halloween, don't get me started. But, A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) was a really good remake! It had a plot (*ahem* Friday the 13th *ahem*), it had GOOD jump scenes, and there was no excessive profanity or nudity! Of course, I prefer the original because it's a classic, but, in this one they didn't completely destroy a horror icon!

That erases 70% of the excitement previous movies had, because it's obvious who will die next. From some reasons, Krueger usually stabs his victims only once in the stomach, although they can't run away from their dreams!The only good part is the ending.

As a long time fan of the franchise as well as JEH, this movie was my event movie for 2010. I saw the movie opening night and i was...well a little disappointed.

Also the movie seems very trimmed down. Several scenes i read about never appeared and the movie winds up feeling a little haphazard as a result. The pros of the film comes from good performances, especially the ones from Jackie Earle Haley, Kyle Gallner and Thomas Dekker, a stylish look and a few genuine psychological scares.

I was worried of this while watching the preview, but I didn't like the new look or sound of Freddy. He didn't look scary at all and I was really disappointed with this makeover. At times through the movie his head/face looked too large and he looked alien like. Warning: May contain spoilers!The movie started out great! I loved what they did with the character Dean. I was a little confused at the beginning about the character Kris. I felt like she was the main character. Nancy, as you know, is the main character in the original, but here was not enough character development with Nancy in the beginning of this movie and too much with Kris.I feel like they took all the good parts of the original (mud stairs, bathtub scene, girl slaughtered on the ceiling, jail scene, Mom being pulled through glass, body bag) and threw them in the new one all over the place.I am torn about how I feel about the story line with Freddy. I like the fact that it went more into detail about what happened.There were many times in the movie I was bored. It was too slow.Bottom line: I wasn't scared at all!

580,rockyrambofan,I enjoyed Haley but not much else,2,1 May 2010,Yes I took a chance and saw the reboot of a nightmare on elm street. A film series I grew up with. When I heard about the remake I was not happy about it. I said i would wait until DVD to see but I went with my brother and saw it yesterday with very low expectations and the movie was pretty much what i thought it would be crappy. The acting was average to terrible. CGI was overused and the ending sucked.The only reason this is getting a 2 is because of Haley's performance. While he is no Robert Englund he does a good job even with crappy material to work with. There was some terrible one liners and Freddy's makeup was horrible but Haley was good.So overall avoid this remake at least until DVD but don't expect too much because it is not very good.,A Nightmare on Elm Street

Now I've been looking for months for a horror movie I haven't seen yet that would scare me. Haven't had any luck. I thought the old NOES movies were good for their time but I don't really like older movies much.. so I got really excited when I saw the trailer for the remake. This movie made me jump, bite my nails, had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time, and even though I've already seen the old one it still kept me guessing the whole time. Brutal, scary, and suspenseful. Every movie me & my boyfriend have went to see in theaters for the past year we walked out saying ""well that wasn't worth the money"" With this one we walked out saying it was worth every penny.

This is by far the best remake i have ever seen in terms of the big 3 horror icons- Freddy Krueger, Jason, and Michael myers..I would really like to know how they can justify making myers in the new movies a giant steroid freak when he was a little fat kid growing up..stupid..anyways this movie was great..a must see.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
583,WildKatz,Please don't make a sequel!!!!!,1,6 May 2010,"As a fan of the original Freddy movies, I was quite apprehensive about a remake. I had a feeling I wasn't going to like it but I thought it would have at least been a movie of good standard if not compared to the original. Boy was I wrong!!!We start the movie in a Diner and this is the ONLY scene where all 4 main characters are seen together and even then they aren't really TOGETHER... they are just in the same place... which to me is just weird considering all of them are sharing the same nightmare.Then when two of the characters realise they are dreaming about the same person (Freddy) there is no reaction to it... they just go about doing what they were doing without any shock! The acting is terrible. There is no depth to any of the characters and no character building. You don't care if they live or die since there's nothing about them to like or dislike. As for Freddy - I am shocked at how poor his character is. You see him about 5 times throughout the whole movie and the longest he's on screen for is about 2 minutes. He can't have more than 10minutes screen time total. His face looks plastic, his voice is just weird and Casper the friendly ghost is scarier. I was actually quite offended they did this to such a cult classic name and I really hope they leave well alone now!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
584,Nsrule,"Fans will be curious, worth a watch to appreciate the original even more",6,7 May 2010,"I'm only 22 years old so the original Nightmare was made before my time but i've been a fan ever since i watched it at 15. Since then i have watched every Kreuger going and watched the franchise become forced further and further into the abyss. Curiosity shoved me into this new entry and i'm glad it did because now i just wanna watch the original to soak up the perfection that it is and forget about this poor excuse for a horror.I was really glad to see Freddy go back to his darker more appreciative routes (think of Freddy v Jason and you can realise the appreciation), but they went down the wrong path at the cross junction when it came to the horror. Its just way to predictable, going for the 'jumpy' reactions every time so there's no edge-of-your-seat anticipation, or arm clinching bury your face in partners chest scary moments (girls you know what i'm on about lol) Jackie Earle Haley kinda carries the film slightly and does put in a decent performance as Fred but the make-up for the face just isn't up to scratch...i much preferred the hands on approach for the original than the modern scientific crap he seems to sport here! I definitely recommend watching this if you are a long standing fan or not, you will still be curious to what this has to offer and will want to make you're own mind up! As a Freddy virgin definitely watch this first then take on the original...you will appreciate the earlier entry a lot more, especially with our so called advances in technology. you will have a new found respect for what they did back in the day lol",A Nightmare on Elm Street
585,joeydel23,Not even a good plot can beat good old Special Effects and Makeup!,5,16 May 2010,"I must say, The plot wasn't half bad. Im not saying that it's better than the original, Just that It made a bit more sense. In this movie, Freddy had a reason to kill. (The kids told their parents). The thing that worries me is the sequel. Once they get past explaining HOW Freddy came back they will run into another plot hole. WHO will he kill? Quinten and Heather... and thats it? The biggest problem though, was the effects. The movie companies seem to have the idea that audiences like CGI and that it looks more real that special effects make-up. And don't get me wrong, maybe a fraction of the audience does. Maybe the Majority! But in MY opinion it sucks. I think that it just ruins the whole experience knowing that everything was done with a computer. Even Freddy's scars and burns! I mean come on!!! A great example is the bed scene when you can see Freddy almost come through the wall and look around. In the original, They used a sheet of stretchy rubber in place of the wall and Robert Englund pressed his face and claw up against it. It looked great! It looked like he was actually stretching the wall! In this one, it was all made with CGI. It looked horrible. I hope some people agree with me!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
586,jacquailayancey,i loved it!!!,8,18 May 2010,"This new version of Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm St. was better than the original. I say that because it gives us a better in-site on the crimes Freddy were convicted of. It had more detail than the last also. There were a few points I did not like, I didn't like the new look of Freddy. The old Freddy looked better, but the new Freddy looked like he was really a burned victim. I also like the way they could fall asleep even while being awake which allowed Freddy to come through their daydreams to haunt!!! Freddy also wasn't into as many punchlines as the original. He made a few wise-cracks but nothing too over the top. It was an edge of your seat adventure from beginning to end!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The new Freddy has a totally different story, only similarity is that they both kill children and now reappear to kill them in their sleep.BTW, whats up with Kyle Gallner, looks like he is about to puke in every single scene.But I guess the worse thing is, there is a number 2 on the way, I will boycott it for 1, I hope everyone who feels betrayed by this remake will boycott it to.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I cannot guarantee my review will be 100% unbiased but I will give my opinion.I went to see the remake on April 30, 2010 dressed as Nancy Thompson with my Freddy doll in my arms. I had good expectations for the film, especially since I liked the trailer. However, I went to watch it and found an overwhelming amount of jump scares. The performances felt cold to me and I did not connect with any of the characters. The CGI was rather bad, Jackie was practically the same facially and vocally the entire film, Rooney Mara was very bland, and the recycled scenes and lines were unnecessary. I walked out of the theater disappointed, as did my non-ANOES friends. Nevertheless I gave it a second shot. I was even more bored. Still, I received the movie for my birthday, and as time has gone on, I've loved it more and more. Yet, as the remake love grows, so does my love for the original.I liked the neat back story and the slick dark look of this film. But overall, it had so much potential that was never reached. Freddy became a typical ""slasher"" that only used his glove(or even a knife) to kill. Freddy lacked a personality...and everything was off kilter. It's great entertainment, but certainly leaves no mark in horror history.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The actors did a good job in the making and the special effects really made the experience of watching this movie better with the settings and environments, Details,better kills, along with Freddy's makeup this movie is really a steal.It always had a way of really keeping me on the end of my seat.

I was totally fine with a remake but I am an enthusiast for killers and psychos and what makes them tick. I also like being told the whole story behind most all things and not having it left up to my imagination because I could come up with so many different things I end up driving myself nuts, lol. The origin films have really been ""blowing my skirt up"" so to speak. Also I liked the idea of putting a fresh look to Freddy, he looked more like a real burn victim and I thought that made more sense in my head. Real burn victims don't have noses or ears because cartilage melts. The only thing I did not like about the movie is that they decided that Freddy had decided to torture and kill the kids because they told the truth, it would have been more pleasing to my sense of justice if it was because they had lied. All in all I would recommend this movie to friends.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
592,lifesabeach412,I'm just going to assume this contains a spoiler.,3,28 September 2010,"I am a MAJOR (and I mean M.A.J.O.R.) fan of the original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. Freddy Krueger is one of the scariest horror icons of all time; the story-line is a force to be reckoned with; and Robert Englund had the voice that gave us all nightmares.I was SO excited to see an update to my favorite.horror.movie.ever.And it was very disappointing to me. Like, I wanted to go into the Usher Booth and spit on the reel. That annoyed.From all the research I'd done online (prior to the midnight showing that I absolutely had to attend), the comments and articles pointed out something along the lines of ""This Freddy is not going to have funny one-liners. He is going to be more serious and less of a joking character."" And then.. all he stinking had was one-liners. His voice sounded like a clown. At least Robert Englund's voice was creepy. The make-up was like ""oh wow. a burn victim. wait a minute. did Freddy die in a fire or something?"" No crap. Make him look like he came out of your NIGHTMARE (key word. I believe it's even in the title?), not the godforsaken burn unit at your local hospital after a blazing inferno just engulfed his entire apartment before he could escape. Ugh. The original make-up was at least gross and evil looking. Whatever. Moving on..Granted - JEH is a good actor, sure. But you can't change an iconic horror character that easily: this isn't reminiscent of Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw, or Halloween, darnit. This character has speaking lines, and the feel of this entire movie was off for me. Parts that should have been scary made me laugh. Umm.. I thought this Freddy was going to be more serious. ? Yeah. Okay.The only credit I can give this flick is that the Kellan Lutz kill scene was actually pretty kick-ass. They threw that in right at the beginning, as to lure you into thinking you didn't just waste your money. Oh, let's not forget the few cheap thrills they threw in randomly. I can't even recall any, specifically. But what's a cheesy remake without them, right!? Sorry if this is a mean review, but I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in this 'reboot'. I will not waste my time watching it again. If you liked it, I'm glad that it wasn't a total waste of time for everyone.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Wansnt that great, in fact the only good thing about this movie was the beginning. I watched this movie at home the other day, couldn't keep my attention on this. Freddy wasn't scary at all. Freddy really looks fake to me, like a mask on someone's face. About the story itself; There is this man, Freddy Krueger, who did or did not hurt children when they were little. This man hunts these kids (now a bit older) down, since the parents of those kids killed Freddy. (short version). This movie is fun to watch, if you have NOT seen the old once.

594,aaronebrown,*Sigh* Nightmare on Elm Street Remake,6,28 October 2010,"Why does Hollywood bother remaking old movies instead of coming up with new ideas? Money is the answer. Film-making is no longer an art, it is no longer about story telling, nor is it about a passion. It's about money. And a remake of an 1980s Slasher Classic is sure to make a lot of money.NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET: reviewThe New Nightmare on Elm Street is very difficult to review. There will always be the die-hard fans who will despise this film from the beginning due to the lack of Robert Englund. There are also the new- comers who have yet to the see the original and give this film 10 out of 10 for originality.This new film does have its moments of brilliance - however, these are mostly nicked straight from the original but with a CGI upgrade. There is nothing wrong with that, but it does leave the viewers feeling a bit ripped off. The acting is a little wooden but the story does move at a quick pace and has a plot that gives the characters an objective. Although there is no Robert Englund - I like the new Freddy. I think that Jackie Earle Haley manages to pull off a creepy killer however the CGI on his face stops any real emotion - or lip movement for that matter - coming through. *****Some Small Spoilers***** The plot twist to make Freddy a paedophile was a poor one and not one bit justified by the explanation that Wes Craven had wanted to do it in the original but was told by the studio that he could not. The is he? isn't he? part of the plot was no bad thing despite what you may hear from other reviewers on IMDb however, it doesn't keep you guessing for that long as we all know that that they were never gonna change the franchise THAT much.*****No More Spoilers****** OK, so why 6/10? The film is not as bad as people would make you think. It should by no means replace the original and given the choice people should go with the original. However considering this is a series that has brought us bullsh*t like Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare and Nightmare 5:The Dream Child I think this new film deserves some praise.A slasher movie is an hour and a half of unsettled viewing with a few jump-out-of-your-seat scares and a few cringe-coz-of-all-the-gore-in- your-face moments. The New Nightmare on Elm Street does achieves this. But with two sequels in the pipeline I don't know how long it can keep it up.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I think the first and biggest mistake of this movie is 'Freddy'! I'm sorry but you cannot give a pair of scissors and a striped shirt to a hobbit and expect it to be scary. With all due respect to Jackie Earl Haley, that I found great in Watchmen, this wasn't a role for him. The rest of the movie is only disappointment over disappointment... the only light in the tunnel was Katie Cassidy.. she's pretty enough to make you forget that you're watching the crappiest remake ever.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

No I am not a die hard Nightmare On Elm Street fan but even I think this is just an atrocious mess. wtfI'm a fan of Jackie but he should not have replaced Robert Englund at all. How adbsurd. Decent performances by Thomas Dekker and Roonie Mara, but the rest of the cast sucked. Michael Bay and Platinum Dunes destroy yet another horror franchise with flying colors. The storyline sucked.

597,camcrafton,This movie gets a ton of crap...,8,20 January 2013,"when really it doesn't deserve it. I understand that it is a remake, and most remakes suck, most people refuse to watch remakes or just blindly give them a bad rating because it isn't original. I completely disagree with this as one of my favorite horror films to come out in recent years, Fright Night, is a remake in itself. The original Nightmare on Elm Street came out in 1984 and was both a critical and commercial success. It has become a must watch movie to both horror fans and just movie fans in general. Everybody knows that story so I'm not going to dip into that, but I am going to say something that a lot of people are going to either A) dismiss or B) call me completely crazy...I think the original a slightly overrated. I loved the movie, its the horror film that got me both into horror films and over my fear of watching horror films, however the film is slightly overrated. Now what's that have to do with this film? Everything. You see not only is this film a remake, but it is a remake of what many consider to be one of the greatest horror films, heck, one of the greatest movies of all time. This is the same problem with The Amytiville Horror remake, The Texas Chainsaw remake (Which I did hate), and the Friday the 13th Remake (Which I don't really feel is a remake, I coun't it more of a sequel to the fourth or third), and thus people give it bad reviews. Now onto why I think this film is actually a good film, especially by horror movie standards. Not only is this film actually scary, but shockingly it has a good script. The acting is mediocre, with the exception of Quintin, Freddy, and Nancy who I felt were amazingly acted, but the script itself was good. This film also makes the Freddy character actually scary...while keeping in the tradition of awesome one-liners, Freddy manages to be both sadistic and quite scary in this one just like he was in the original until the sequels completely destroyed the character. Another key thing about why I feel this film is a good film is that it has a backstory and the way the backstory is explained is genius. Sure the research thing has been done a million times, but the characters don't only find out the backstory by doing research but it is also told to them in their dreams. Its also has a mysterious feel to it, as you are never quite sure until the end as to whether or not Freddy was innocent or guilty of raping the preschoolers and the director does a good job of actually making the viewer feel that perhaps Freddy was innocent and that the parents wrongfully killed and innocent man because their children lied. Of course in the end it is reveled that Freddy was defiantly guilty and deserving of death. I have seen many reviewers on here give this film a bad rating because of the fact that Freddy was a child rapist instead of a child killer like in the original which makes it hard to view him as an anti hero. I really don't understand this criticism, as both crimes are extremely wrong and to view him(Freddy) as an anti-hero is twisted in its on way no matter what crime he committed to deserve death...people he is suppose to be a monster both physically and mentally, plus Craven was originally going to have Freddy be a rapist but changed it last second. This film manages to be clever, scary, and intense all at the same time. Its plot is fantastic and isn't just kill...kill...kill like some slasher films, and while it does sort of benefit from using details from the original plot, it does differ in many ways. I found the two main protagonists, Quienten and Nancy really easy to root for, and while the other characters weren't as well acted or as easy to root for they were still necessary to the story. The movie had an all around great atmosphere and I found Freddy to be even more sick, twisted, scary, and disturbed then he was in the original or any of its sequels. The only criticism I have is that it had a little to much jump scares, but so did the original. All in all, I give this film a 8/10, which is slightly below what I gave the original (9/10). This movie was defiantly not a waste of a time, and if anything should at least be given a chance by movie fans or at least by horror movie fans. Guilty pleasure? Maybe to some, but to me, it was legitimately a great and enjoyable film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
598,rob-h979352,Never Seen the Original,7,15 March 2011,"I'm young, OK? So I did got scared in a few moments of this movie. With the bad reviews, I decided to see it myself. You don't like it? Fine! But I did.I thought the acting was great! They all did a great job in their roles. Especially the girl who played Kris (I forgot what her real name is). Jackie Earl Haley who played Freddy Krueger was actually good! I didn't know it was him! But I do understand people who found his voice annoying. I know. It is a bit weird.I don't know if this movie is better than the original or not because I've never seen it but from seeing the trailer of the original, there is an obvious change in the CGI. *SPOILERS* (maybe): When Freddy was tossing the girl around the room (you couldn't see Freddy), the CGI was good. In the original, it was pretty bad. It looked like she was being pulled from a rope. But I know it's because they got stuck with a small budget of 1.8 million dollars while this remake had 35 million dollars.Anyways, it's a pretty good movie and certainly enjoyable. I had a couple of jump scares in this movie but my brother found them predictable. So is it scary? It all depends on you. See this movie for yourself. I'm not asking you to watch this movie or not but decide for yourself.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
599,Coreytheguy,Give It A Chance!,8,15 April 2011,"The review you are about to read is only my opinion, and as you read this keep in mind that I don't consider myself a follower. So I won't be bashing this film because it is a remake, and I won't be bashing it because it doesn't have Robert Englund wearing the ever ominous glove. This review is based on my honest opinion as a film fanatic and a fan of the dream demon, Freddy Krueger. So please, continue reading if you have an open mind. I'll start off by speaking on the actual feel of the film. There are a lot of ""jump scares"", which is the main reason I didn't rate this film higher, because they aren't as effective during the second watch. There is definitely more of a focus on the effects of losing sleep, in fact, the way this is done actually adds a bit more fright to Freddy himself. The story is somewhat the same, the only real difference being Freddy's occupation before he was killed. However the film does delve deeper into Freddy, and that makes it worth watching ""the stuff we already know"". As far as the make-up goes, its not for everyone. Its realistic, and its not how we remember seeing Freddy as a kid. You know, when you woke up at 3 am and snatched it off of the shelf and watched it with the volume kind of low so your parents wouldn't catch you? Then you were afraid to go to sleep? However, in hindsight, the pizza face make-up was not convincing at all. As an adult, it looks sillier than I remember it. The acting is a mixture of hits and misses. Kyle Gallner and Katie Cassidy were great, however Thomas Dekker and Rooney Mara were less than impressive. Jackie Earle Haley made me nervous to see this film. I was excited to see it, but when I got to the theater, I thought to myself ""Dear god I hope he doesn't ruin this movie."" Robert Englund was practically my baby sitter growing up, but if you watch the movies, you have to ask yourself how his performances were. And they were good, but they changed. Freddy Krueger seemed to have a different personality starting in Dream Warriors. Suddenly, he was giggling and showboating. Jackie Earle Haley does nothing of the sort. He put everything he had into this role. He made a Freddy walk, a Freddy voice, mannerisms, and he added a touch of heavy breathing. If I were in an alley and there was a Freddy at each end, I would hide behind Robert Englund's Freddy. Jackie Earle Haley is intimidating, creepy, scary, and powerful as Freddy and nobody admits it. However they did at least vote for the movie at the peoples choice awards. This is a movie I suspect people are afraid to admit they like. A lot of people say things like ""It doesn't look like Freddy."" Yes he does. He's a fairly short, badly burned man wearing the right kind of clothes and the right kind of glove. ""He doesn't sound like Freddy."" Neither does Robert Englund, in fact Robert Englund explained that he would have to speak his lines fast and his voice would be changed later when the special effects crew slowed it down to make it sound deeper and more devilish. So the feel of the movie is pretty good, the acting is mostly good, with two mediocre performances and an even better Freddy, and the script is more in depth than the original. All in all its a solid film. A bit of advice: Stick to your guns, keep an open mind, and give it a chance. Don't allow your experience to be ruined by stubbornness, and don't say ""they killed a classic"" because they didn't. If you are the true Freddy fan that you claim to be, than your A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) DVD or cassette is still safe in your collection, and a remake can never change that. If you are the Freddy fan you claim to be, give this film a fair chance. Its a solid 8/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street
600,doombat666,Sad sad sad,1,30 April 2011,"This is a very sad and disappointing take on the original. Freddy, was just not creepy and make-up was not up to expectations of a horror movie watcher.

The characters were different mixed in with the old characters.I understand that things change but let's face it a classic is still a classic.

601,awdgt,why this movie is so awesome and deserves praise.,10,28 January 2012,"okay, first off, i love the original nightmare on elm street. this movie totally blew me away. i haven't been this excited since i saw back to the future. i have loved and been obsessed with the nightmare on elm street movies ever since i was a child. i think this movie did a great job. i was sad at first they didn't use robert englund. however, i gave the movie a shot. i have to admit, the first time i saw freddy, i was kind of shocked. i expected to see the Hollywood monster that we all came to love. but if i wanted to see the original then i would have watched it. i wanted to see a remake. the make-up they did on freddy was unbelievable. he actually looks like what someone would look like if they were terribly burned. he doesn't look cheesy and silly. yes, i have read most of the hate-reviews. people didn't like the voice, the make- up. they wanted the jokes, and the silliness from the old ones. well, this movie strayed away from that. they didn't want any cheese. it's different, but still a remake. that brings me to the remake. they add more of freddy's previous life in this. instead of just talking about what happened to freddy, and it being ""understood"" you actually see what happened to freddy. they thought of everything when making this movie. however, i think they could have implemented one thing. the glove. why not show the origin of the glove, how it was made, why it was made. here's my idea. freddy was a gardener for the preschool. why could the movie not just have shown freddy make the glove to help him dig in the garden better? duh! they brought some other stuff back too, like the girl being thrown around in midair, the infamous marshmallow hallway/stairs. i wish they lady at the end could still have been sucked through a window of a door instead of a mirror. that was so hilarious! but i really see how they wanted this movie to come across and i appreciate it. 10/10 easily",A Nightmare on Elm Street
602,Jornh123,A great remake for a new generation,9,10 July 2012,"Many people are up in arms about this new remake talking about how the original film is much better than this one and who can disagree? I myself have seen both films and if you compare these two side by side the original by craven is much better. BUT older folks don't understand that most teens right now have not watched the old Nightmare. I think this movie is a nice modern twist on the classic. There are many scenes that stood out to me throughout this movie that made it great and most of the time the way the director accomplished flawlessly creating transitions from reality to dream, or nightmare really. One scene towards the beginning when kris falls asleep in class is one of my favorite new interpretations. The transition of when kris beings falling asleep in class and the classroom turns dark and charred is a great way to make the setting seem real. Another great transition was when nancy goes into the pharmacy with Quentin and the store slowly turns into the boiler room setting that is the nightmare for all the kids. Another great scene was with nancy again after she gets out of the bath tub. While us as viewers think she's awake, we soon realize she's fallen asleep when she walks out into her room to find snow blanketing the entire area. a few reviewers touched in this in earlier posts but of You haven't seen the movie before, you do feel sympathy for Freddy in the beginning because you truly don't know of he did hurt the kids or not for a long time and in flashbacks they make him seem like a nice man. The actors were great in it especially Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara and of course Jackie Earl Haley. Yes, I can agree that Haley is no Englund when it comes to being the true Fredy Kruger but I think Haley does a tremendous job at filling the part and he takes a very interesting spin on Freddy. This line up of actors is also going to pull teens in too. He familiarity of them makes them feel more connected to this movie jut like the original cast did for teens at that time too. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and it's a great horror film for younger fans to enjoy but I equally enjoy the original as much as I enjoyed this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
603,DemonKnight5150-1,I Rather Enjoyed This Movie,9,4 May 2010,"I'll just get this out of the way. No matter how hard they try, Platinum Dunes or any other company will not surpass the original. It was a great movie with decent kills, a ruthless killer, and a premise that could truly terrify people. What could be worse than being killed in your dream only to find you're dead in real life? I consider myself a horror junkie. For me, the cornier and gorier a movie is, the more I find myself enjoying it. Acting's not Oscar worthy? That's okay because I just watched a person get their head cut off with a piece of broken glass (Halloween 2). Story line a little far-fetched? No problem. A giant pair of beautiful woman parts have just graced the screen. I think the problem with 90% of the negative reviews on here is that people go in with the original movie in mind therefore automatically creating a bias towards the film. So in my mind, the review is irrelevant because they're not judging it for what it is.SPOILER TIME Once the first kill occurred, I knew I was in for a treat. It was a pretty nasty one watching Dean slit his own throat. I was a giddy kid getting ready for his first day of school, anxious for what events would transpire. Kris' kill was pretty dang awesome and watching those blades viciously rip through her body was an absolute delight.Acting was okay for a horror movie. Nothing to write mom home about but it was solid. A lot of people on here complained that Nancy was wooden and (once again) felt Heather was a better Nancy. Just stop right there with the comparisons and view it as a stand-alone role. Her character was written as a loner, someone disconnected from society and I thought Rooney excelled at bringing a quiet, tortured girl to life.To all the naysayers that feel Robert will never be surpassed in the role of Freddy, again, I ask why you feel inclined to constantly compare. I thought Jackie was excellent as Freddy. He was, in short, one ticked off perv with a score to settle. ""You tell on me, I cut you up."" And speaking of the kills again, so what if all he did was kill people with his finger knives. They wanted to base his makeup more in reality so why not the kills too? I dug his voice, his makeup, and his back story. I was especially loving the cheek-to-ear lick he performed on Nancy. How disgustingly awesome for this guy to toy with his victims. He threw in a couple of f-bombs too and I didn't care.The one part I would have to say really sucked was the CGI wall effect. Meh. Could have been done better but it did not distract me from the rest of the movie.I'm a guy who has been watching horror movies for 24 years. My first was, surprisingly enough, the original Nightmare. I was four years old when that movie changed my life forever. Other than a few duds, Platinum Dunes has, for the most part, kept me entertained because I shut my brain off at the door and just tag along for the ride. Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw; brutal remakes of great movies that may not be better than their predecessors but still hold their own. Don't know about you but that glossy look they bring to these movies just make the kills that much more pretty to look at and that's what I like in horror movies (I am, however, very much a plot and acting guy, just not with horror). Gore, nudity, sub-par acting, questionable script all mixed together to create a movie that does nothing for my intellect but satisfies my primitive desire for violence. Yummy.A solid 9 out of 10. Very entertaining.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
604,markeymark_15,NOES 2010 Review..or just an opinion,9,3 May 2010,"Well...I am almost afraid to post my own thoughts/review of this movie in fear of some extreme hater showing up at my house and trying to pull out some kind of Freddy kill of his/her own. But..I'll take my chances.First off, I have been a horror fan since I was about 3 years old. My 'rents were always very cool. I've seen a lot of different horror movies/characters over the years but none of them have ever come close to Mr. Freddy Krueger. I loved all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. From first to last. And some of you may already be saying ""well that's ridiculous because Freddy's Revenge this or Dream Master that"". And here's my first point...not all of the past instalments were perfect..dare I say any of them. But we all still had a hell of a time watching and enjoying them for what they were..horror movies with one hell of a lead character. And we all know him as being Robert Englund. No matter the supporting cast or even the storyline, Robert Englund had a way to bring something new and fresh to every movie and kept us wanting more.Now with that in mind I come to A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't online everyday looking for any new news on this remake. I was obsessed with it. Any new picture, sound clip, video, interview that was out there..I was gonna find it. My hopes were very high and that worried me as I went into the first showing at Midnight. But I went in with the mindset of ""none of these movies have been perfect, they all have had cons and pros so just enjoy the ride and enjoy seeing Freddy up on the big screen again"". So I did and I'm the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Was it perfect? Nope. Much of what others have said about the story being pushed too fast and some of the characters not being interesting are true...but so what? This is a Freddy movie guys and gals! The main stress should be on him..and this movie nailed it! Every scene has something to do with the man in the steel fingered glove. We get the back story in the form of flashbacks, and he makes many appearances throughout. Not to mention that Jackie Earle Haley does an amazing job as Freddy. Robert Englund will always have the #1 spot in my mind, but Jackie will do a fantastic job for the new generation. Say what you want about the not so great acting of the teens (and I agree) but that should never be the focus of these movies.Now for those people who argue about the lack of kills/blood etc...I can somewhat agree. I was hoping for a little more blood and guts, but then again this can take away from the real center point of this film which is Freddy.(Try to also remember that the original didn't have a whole whack of victims either). What many have to remember is this is a remake/ re-introduction of the character for a newer generation so for those of us who already know the history of Freddy this movie can be a little bit boring and repetitive and creatively held back. The film makers try to play it safe by sticking to the original formula but safely adding in their own spins and twists. I'll give them positive credit for that. I can only hope there will be a sequel to this remake so the ""remake guidelines"" can be tossed and the film makers can be more creative and let loose with Freddy and the gore factor. But until that happens (or not) I am very happy and content with ANOES 2010. There are some plot points that the original never fully touched on and some pretty damn good scares/kills.There are always going to be two ends to every spectrum. Those who hate and those who love. Everyone has their own set of standards and focus points. For that I would never say my word is stronger than anyone else's. I respect everyone's opinions. But I would ask of anyone who has yet to see this movie to give it a chance. Take these reviews for what they are: personal opinions. Respect them, but go and see this movie and make your own. Movies are suppose to be a treat for all of us to jump out of the regular status quo and be taken for a ride through something different. Not all of them will be perfect, but if at some point a film can evoke some emotion or reaction out of you(which this movie did..for me at least) then it's doing what it is set out to do. Just enjoy the ride!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
605,aaronbusiness79,First Place Finish...for the First Film,1,20 August 2013,"Let's put aside all the nostalgia that the original "" A Nightmare on Elm Street"" still holds today. Let's just compare the two films on a few technical points and a couple widely accepted facts. Otherwise the review, like all others, will devolve into irrelevant fan on fan bickering. The 2010 affair was directed by Samuel Bayer. This was the first film he directed after a long and fruitful career as a music video director. Wes Craven directed the original. At the time, he had directed eight feature length films that included ""The Last House on the Left"" and the original two ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Wes Craven is well accepted as one of the best horror and suspense directors of all time. Wes Craven is also one of the finest horror film writers ever. He wrote half a dozen horror classics. These are movies that are such classics that four of them have been remade. His writing not only launched the ""Nightmare"" franchise he is also responsible for the series of highly successful ""Scream"" films. Wesley Strick wrote the amusing ""Arachnophobia"". He then went on to write ""Doom"" and ""Wolf"" amongst other utterly forgettable films. Granted he did have success with ""Cape Fear"". However, that was a remake just like his ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" script.The original was also better because of the score, lighting, editing, and sound effects.When something is original it has an untraceable charm that the most gifted copycat cannot replicate. This is true in paintings as well as films. I could point out a slew of other great reasons why the original is superior. However, they could be chocked up to subjectivity. I will point out that it has been twenty nine years since the original was released and we are not just talking about it, we are are arguing about it. In twenty nine years I have a feeling the 2010 remake will be forgotten.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
606,btkfan-1,As far as remakes go....not too bad..,5,29 May 2010,"As far as the recent horror remakes/attempted reinventions go, this IS one of the better ones. Anyone who was expecting it to equal the original were simply deluding themselves...of course it wasn't going to be SCARY for fans of the original and of course it was going to have a 'seen it all before' feel, it's a REMAKE. That said, unlike many recent horror remakes, this one is at least worth watching. It won't give experienced viewers new nightmares but at least will keep you reasonably entertained for the duration. The added footage of perverted pedophile Fred Krueger's back-story serves to make Freddy more unsympathetic than ever, and while he does throw out a few suave one-liners, he is mostly portrayed as a sickening entity. Of course, the Robert Englund vs. Jackie Earle Haley debates will never end. But for what its worth, Haley puts in a gutsy effort here, simultaneously paying homage to Englund's prior portrayal while also managing to display his own interpretation of Krueger in certain scenes. Whether on par with Englund or not, he does a fine job and is perhaps even more disturbing as a perverted preschool gardener than a melted blade-fingered maniac, which is either quite an acting accomplishment on his part or a failure on the screenwriter's part, depending on your viewpoint. Either way, his creepy Freddy interpretation does have some miles in it. Rooney Mara does a better acting job as 'Nancy' than the majority of young actresses who land these kind of roles; she is believable and clearly attempts to add some depth to her 'misfit girl' character. Unfortunately, the rest of the young cast are the usual 'we're here to get slashed or provide support for the central victim' fodder.While it drifts off into predictability on occasion, which is to be expected as everyone already knows Freddy's M.O., the film carries just enough entertainment to make it worth viewing at least once. On a small note, the use of the Everly Brothers 'All I Have To Do Is Dream' in the soundtrack was a masterstroke; the song fits perfectly. It's surprising Wes Craven didn't think of using it in the original, the sweet love song actually adds a level of creepiness to the film.5/10. A purely average rating, but with the lack of competition in the horror remake ranks, this is not too bad at all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
607,jake-osborn89,Lackluster,1,29 June 2014,"More than likely you have seen the original and you want to watch this out of curiosity My advice don't or at least try to remember that the old one can't be tainted this abomination of a remake I watched the Halloween remake in the hope of something new and I was disappointed on every single count and I went into this remake with not much hope I wasn't wrong, instead of an unwinding of the story with suitable scares and jumps and the final realisation that you can't sleep is destroyed before the opening credits The smooth transition between the real world and dream world is lost here you know exactly when they are in a dream and when not with only one exception I can think of (the blonde in the bed before she's chucked about a bit and opened like a can of beans in a very unscary way)You will read this prehaps and still watch this terrible film Just watch the real one after to remind your self how scary Kruger should be and how a decent horror is made Good luck",A Nightmare on Elm Street
608,epsilondefute,"The reboot has potential, but lacked plot depth.",3,28 January 2014,"The casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Freddie Krueger has potential, but the character's personality was highly underplayed. Jackie could be profound at the part, but his role was downplayed too much. The movie's graphics were OK, but not for a 2010 movie, no matter how low the budget was. The plot was kind of original, but it really ventured too far from the story. It was linear and the movie really seemed like there wasn't much effort into visual quality. Even some of the original ones were a lot more visually impressive. There is a lot to improve and I believe another reboot is necessary due to the lacking quality over all of this iconic film's reboot. An improved sequel wouldn't make sense because its like having the original Godzilla come out when it did and then have the one coming out in this year (2014) be it's sequel. I think Jackie is a great actor, but the other ones leave a lot to be desired, and the movie had some interesting new concepts, but over all the three things that bugged me most were: (in order of significance) Underplayed Character Personalities, Plot Depth, and Visual or Graphic Quality. Nightmare on Elm street has always been my favorite horror movie franchise and I feel like the reboot took great potential and butchered it brutally.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
609,pritti_hippie,'Don't fall asleep'....but the audience might just!,3,10 May 2010,"For anybody who hasn't seen the original and is a fan of cheesy modern horror then you'll love this film! But...for the die hard cult classic lovers who like movie that needed imagination to create special effects, not computers, don't waste your money!!!!! Freddy looks like voldemort from Harry Potter, the 'teenagers' are probably all nearly 30 and computerised quick scares have stolen away the tradition creepy moments that we loved and associated with Robert Englund.Don't get me wrong, the film was well made and easily fulfilled todays criteria for a horror movie but why remake a classic and change it that much. I don't care for making use of modern technology such as internet browsing during a movie. As far as I am concerned the opening credits, which were visually creep and a great start, set me up for disappointment thereafter.The special effects within the movie were established using computers which lead to fake looking, over-dramatic scenes. Mostly, I missed the sense of fear from the original when Freddy would be stood ten metres away just looking at the victim prior to chasing them. This movie had too many 'suprise' scares with characters turning around to find Freddy stood behind them.So...sorry but only 3 out of ten for me. Remaking a cult classic is usually a bad idea and I feel the new movie has misses out all the fundamental factors which made the original creepy and scary. Plus it didn't even make me jump!

This movie and watchmen made me a fan of Jackie Earle Haley . I highly recommend this movie the movie gets to the point Freddy Krueger is as crazy,evil , comedic as the original in this movie I would watch the movie a thousand times it's great watch the movie you won't regret it this movie will really make you not wanna sleep again .

This movie is not going to be nominated for any Academy awards. Visually, it's way better than the original, I love the Freddy movies, but they look terrible by today's standards. Haley did a great job, he made Freddy genuinely creepy and scary, not cheesy like Englund's Freddy. I love Robert Englund's Freddy, but though they are the same character, you are comparing apples and oranges. The death scenes everyone seems to be complaining about are what I wanted to see: reimaginings of the original scenes with better effects. Rooney Mara did a solid turn as Nancy, she's a pretty girl and a good actress. Admittedly, the rest of the acting was left wanting, but again, this is a horror movie, that's what I expected. I gave the movie an 7 out of 10, because I rate movies based on how they fit into their own genre. As far as horror movies go, I'd say this one is much better than most of the crap out there. I have a couple hundred horror movies in my collection, and have seen as many more, and there are many that I can't even get through. This ain't one of them.

613,B3lmon7,The best of PD re images?,7,30 April 2010,"I'm having trouble sleeping, and when I do there's this man ... and he's burnt. After a midnight screening of the new nightmare, I figured I would help give one of the first honest reviews to IMDb before the details become fuzzy.Well lemme start by saying I'm impressed and disappointed all at the same time. The movie is good, but there are flaws everywhere for veteran fans. So I'll save you some trouble and say that if you're a fan of the old movies, you probably won't like it nearly as much as just being introduced to the films. The CGI is alright, but overused. Same with jump scenes. The kills are okay but are few and far between. The theme song is arranged and barely resembles the original, but the sound is still there. The actual theme is played for a few seconds for the title card.-Story- So it's pretty much the same story but cut and pasted with new material. The innocent/guilty thing works surprisingly well and the major changes(yes there are major changes) can be accepted easily without any problems.*spoiler* A big problem I found was that, original Freddy wasn't a gardener at a preschool, and he didn't live at the school. This may not seem like a big change, but it really affects the background of the story. Nancy doesn't live in Freddy's house anymore because there is no Freddy's house. This is a little weird and difficult to accept.*/spoiler* Overall the story works, and that's good enough for me and most of the crowd I saw it with.-Acting- I'll start this category by saying that acting in horror films is usually poor, and here it's a mixed bag. I hated Dean from the moment I saw him. His acting is bad, *spoiler* and I'm so glad he doesn't last long at all.*/spoiler* Quintin did very well and I commend him because I've never seen or heard of him before. Nancy did an excellent job and was very modern/emotional. Jesse was weird, I didn't like him at first but he grew on me. Kris was definitely my favorite of the elm street kids, she was so believable and innocent. And of course, Jackie pulled a decent Freddy out of his bag of magic tricks. In fact I'm having a hard time choosing who was better. Some of his lines were cheesy but I'd blame the writers for it, not him.*spoiler* He also has a heath ledger homage with a ""Look at me!"" line. Pretty cool.*/spoiler*-Major Scenes- I think this movie would have been a lot better if they just changed some of the scenes to fresh ones and made an original sequel. Also the movie seems very rushed and probably is so because a lot of it was cut afterwards by PD. *spoiler* The bathtub scene seemed like it was thrown in there, and didn't really come off scary to the crowd. It would have been fine, if Freddy actually pulled Nancy under like in the original. However, they used this scare later in the film with Quintin instead. Same with the wall scene, which I'll get to later. My favorite scene had to be the opening, watching Dean force that knife in was really a satisfying opening to the movie and left me wanting more. My least favorite was the wall and probably the too obvious cliffhanger ending.*/spoiler*-CGI and Jumpscares- So there's a lot of CGI, and I mean pretty much all of the Freddy sequences are CGI. This is really disappointing because they didn't have to be, at all. The wall was supposed to be an iconic homage, but instead it just looks bland and awful and is only there for like 4-5 seconds. It really could have been executed better. However there are good CGI scenes, very good in fact. The Kris classroom scene having everyone turn to ash was brilliant and should have been slowed down for a better effect. Nancy falling through the floor and into her bed was also very good looking, and reminded me of the Glen death from the original because of all the blood. *spoiler* The ending, although didn't make any sense and was pretty dumb to me, looked very well done and clean. Freddy rips through a mirror and destroys Nancy's mother, afterwards pulling her into the mirror which comes back together seamlessly. Pretty cool, but pointless. Definitely better than the original ending though, I'll give it that.*/spoiler*Jump scares are way too common as well. There are a bunch that are just great and would have sufficed, if only the others were just replaced with generally creepy scenes. Since this has become the milestone for horror films of the decade, I really can't blame Sam because this is what the producers and studios think we want, and to an extent they're right. However, there are more than 20+ jump sequences with loud noises in this movie, waaaay too many.As a side note to some of the threads on here, there really could have been a little nudity in this. In the original there's Nancy's side-boob and the underwater bathtub scene where there's basically full frontal. In here, there's barely any bare skin. *spoiler* Kris seemed really sexy and I expected something to happen between her and Jesse but nope, nothing at all.*/spoiler*When put up against the original movies, I'd say that my order now goes like this: 1,3,Nightmare 2010,New Nightmare,4,Freddy Vs Jason,5,6,2.Pretty good and is worth seeing, but there are some rough edges that should have been noticed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
614,markgrizzly,I Thought it was better than...,9,1 May 2010,"90% of the other Bullsh1t remakes that Hollywood keeps pumping out.. Last year (09) we had ""My Bloody Valentine"", ""Friday the 13"", ""The Stepfather"", ""Last House On The Left"", ""Sorority Row"" and ""Halloween 2"" to name a few. Basically The Olny good ""Original"" release of 2009 was ""Drag Me To Hell"".. This year we've already had ""The Crazies"" - Coming Soon are ""Mothers Day"" (Which may be good), ""Pirahna 3D"", ""Straw Dogs"", ""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"", ""Friday The 13 II"", ""Halloween 3D"", ""Hellraiser 3D"", ""Scanners"", ""The Orphanage"", Night Of The Demons""... The List Goes FOREVER!! I Think Its BEYOND Fugked up that Hollywood keeps pumpin out these remakes when all they have to do is copy the original 80's slasher formula, create a villain and write a good script. But Anyways, I HATE to say it, I actually like this remake.. Freddy Looks/Sounds different, The Directing/Cinematography was GREAT and the gore was not too bad either.. I don't support these lameass remakes AT ALL, but 1 outta 10 ends up good, and i think they nailed it with this one.. Whats gonna be LAME is if they make a ""Nightmare on Elms Street 2"" remake.. Will they follow the original story and make it about Freddy trying to obtain a human form like the original? Probably not.. N.O.E.S II Sucked - Anyways shouldn't this film really be ""Nightmare On Elm Street Part 7""??? It technically could count as PART 8 if you count ""Freddy Vs. Jason"".. FUHK YOU Hollywood.. The fact that they remake mainstream and obscure horror films strictly for profit (and at the same time alienate fans) shows the TRUE shallowness of Hollywood studios.. It shows that film has become nothing but profit and the actual ART has become a joke to be REMADE.. Seriously.. If somebody repainted the MONA LISA would that be a big money maker in the Art World?? If somebody remade some lame 80's bestselling album like ""Thriller"" would everyone go out and buy it? Would it save the recording industry? It doesn't seem like ONE PERSON supports these BULLSH1T remakes, so why keep making them?? BTW - ""Clash Of The Titans"" should have NEVER been messed with.. That sh!t makes me SICK!!As for Freddy... It wasn't that bad.. BUT, It should've just been left alone (and how could they leave out Robert Englund??)",A Nightmare on Elm Street
615,KillDaSpiders,Do Not See!,1,13 July 2011,"Please, I beg of you. Don't rent this movie...don't even pirate it. It is BY FAR the most disgraceful remake I've ever beheld. Even the remake of Friday the 13th was better than this (oscar worthy really). I'm a fan of the 80's slasher movies and when I heard this was being remade I nearly screamed. When I heard Robert Englund wasn't Freddy, I nearly ripped the screen from my computer. It is a prime example of what's going wrong in Hollywood today- no more original ideas. It seems as though everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to redo classics and ruin them. Can we not make up an original idea anymore??? There's so much wrong with this movie I'm not sure where to start. I guess my big beef is that the Springwood Slasher is now the Springwood Molester. What, did the writers think it would be too gruesome killing kids? The whole idea about Freddy is that he would take his fantasies out on children BY killing them. Next, Freddy was a family man. Like Ted Bundy...the killer next door. He wasn't some creepy janitor that took kids to his hideout in the basement of a school. He was the son of a hundred maniacs! Not some week pervert! Ugh...I digress. Also, what happened to making REAL makeup? You can tell that his face was 90% cg, and not good cg as it were.Really, where was the suspense? They throw you right into it and don't get you to care about the characters. In the original, you came to like Nancy and care about what happened to her. In this one, I was glad to see her and her idiot friends die off one by one (well..she lived...). And let me tell you, I tried to give Jackie a chance but his voice made me think more of Christian Bale's Batman...All I kept thinking was ""when will he say 'Swear to me!'"" It just got irritating after a while.Conclusion- don't waste the hour and some odd minutes of your life on this flick. Heck, don't give the writers or the studio the money by watching it anywhere. This piece of crap doesn't deserve the DVD's its printed on. Go watch the original...At least you'll be SOMEWHAT scared from that one.

First are they really going to touch a classic? And two if they do it right it can be good. Well when I heard Billy Bob Thorton was in serious contention for the role I was all about it. I mean if the guy can play a slow kind hearted reaper of justice, what makes you think he can't play a HORROR ICON! Insert Jackie Earl Haley. Never heard of the guy until I did research. BAD NEWS BEARS I mean come on!!! It has to be a good choice! Well it was. Heath Ledger Syndrome to the 10th degree. This man lived and breathed this role for however long it took to make this flick. You can see he didn't want to disappoint. And he not only didn't he far exceeded my expectations. Now obviously because I have seen every movie but Freddy's Dead the whole way through I may be considered a little biased. But even if I had never seen one of these films, I believe I would have still walked away enjoying every minute of it.I don't believe in running my mouth about what I thought was great and what I didn't like. I like to let people judge for themselves. I will say the tributes that they did pay to the original were done in amazing taste and not out line at all. The trailers do obviously let you in on some info, but I don't think they over did it. All in all a damn good movie if this is what you are going for.

The actor that played ""Freddy"" in this remake did a fantastic job. He brought a new and fresh terror to the character. And I DID like the back story to the killer. It was nice to see WHY this guy had it out for the people he targeted. Open your minds, people. This was a great film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Holy hell what do you expect him to do, be Freddy with a cane. HA try getting a chase scene out of that. Give it up cause Englund himself wasn't trying to be in the movie, he said it himself he is too old to do it. Cry cry cry is all critics do just to get heard by someone like me who thinks I just wasted my time but happened to still read it anyhow. Okay the old Nancy wow she starred on what show back in the day. Just the 10 of us, wow some awesome show that was. You complain about actors sucking , story lines blowing, blah blah blah. Why don't you get out there and make a movie then worth seeing so I can go ahead and bad mouth it. Big deal Michael Bay was somewhat producing this movie, he is making millions while you are on your couch wishing you were making anything at all. Great movie, will see it again. There will an actual review from me after I relax from having a headache from all the non sense negative reviews people are leaving about a horror movie they expected the makers of Avatar to create.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
621,llcproducer,Develop a Fear of Bedtime,10,22 September 2010,"The words ""remake"" or ""reboot"" can instantly create preconceived notions from the audience, most of them not being open to a new modern experience. I walked into Nightmare on Elm Street with no such attitude, instead choosing to forgo what I knew about the series so I could sit back and enjoy the ride! The movie puts a new spin on the great formula that fans love and know from the past installments, following a group of teenagers who are all haunted by a burned man in their dreams, but if they die in their dreams they die in real life. We soon discover that this group is connected to Freddy by way of their parents, who chased Freddy out of town and burned him to death. One of the girls, Nancy, discovers a class photo of her and the other haunted teenagers and slowly begins to unravel a past that's been purposely erased.The film features a cameo from Kellan Lutz (Eclipse, 90210), the first of the group to begin having these nightmares, quickly bringing us back into the deranged world of Freddy Krueger. The film also stars up and comer Katie Cassidy (Gossip Girl, Taken) who makes her mark with a terrifying and exhilarating encounter with Krueger that literally made me jump out of my seat. But the film's and this year's breakout star is Rooney Mara (The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) who plays the lead character Nancy, delivering a solid performance as we watch her uncover Freddy's mysterious past. Oscar winner Jackie Earle Hayley, answers the challenge of recreating the iconic 80's character, and definitely succeeds at making you scared to go to sleep at night.NOES looks great and gets your adrenaline pumping thanks to acclaimed music video director Samuel Bayer at the helm. Expect to cover your eyes, hold on to that person sitting next to you, and develop a sudden fear of bedtime!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
622,tru_x1987,New take on a classic movie,7,29 July 2012,"Coming into watching this film i had high hopes because of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Freddy Krueger, and some of his previous work. I knew it was not going to be the same as the original and was surprised that they recast Robert Englund, who previously played Freddy Krueger. I was also pleasantly surprised with the casting of Rooney Mara as Nancy, who was such a major part in the original movies. Being a remake, which Hollywood seems to rely on more and more, I knew it would be an updated version of the previous films and hoped it would keep some of the sarcastic humor that Robert Englund utilized in his playing of the role. Though there are a few spots where Jackie Earle Haley will say something slightly witty, the remake has definitely toned down the humor in exchange for a more suspenseful horror film. The overall theme of this film would be that of vengeance and revenge. This stays true throughout the film, with the killing of Freddy by the angry townspeople and the subsequent killing of the children by Freddy. A huge reason that i prefer this remake to the original movie would be the inclusion of the origin versus being told of the events. Freddy Krueger was a child molester that would later be burned alive in a fire set by the angry parents of Elm Street. Freddy would come back in children's nightmares and find elaborate ways to kill the children. This fear of dying caused the children, who are really teens, to refuse to sleep and try not to at all costs. The reason that Nancy is targeted so greatly in the film is due to her father's role as a police officer and his role in Freddy Krueger's fate. This film does a great job of utilizing lighting in the dream sequences and ensures that the viewer is on the edge of their seat while watching the film. The music and in some instances the silence of the film creates a suspense that only an iconic character like Freddy can utilize. When the little girls begin to sing ""One, Two, Freddy's coming for you..."" you brace yourself for him to come out of no where and this kind of feeling is what makes horror movies so irresistible, yet scary. It is films like this one, the Friday the 13th series, and Halloween that have iconic theme music that gets you to look over your shoulder and turn the lights on just so you aren't scared, and the theme is much of the same in all of these films, revenge. So even though Freddy was a complete sicko as a human being and the townspeople managed to exact their revenge on him, he may get the last laugh when seeking vengeance on the children of the people responsible for his demise.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
623,jamesljohnson-17674,"A Soulless, Disappointing Remake",4,26 July 2021,"I grew up watching the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and I've always held them very near and dear to my heart. When the 2000s came around and every major horror film from the last twenty years started getting remade, I found myself apprehensive towards the idea of a Nightmare remake. What drew me to this series as a kid was the creativity of the kills. In Friday the 13th and Halloween the killers had to obey the laws of reality, but in these movies Freddy gets to do whatever he wants because they're in a dream. I loved the original Freddy, played masterfully by Robert Englund, and I tried to give Jackie Earle Haley the benefit of the doubt. He's a good actor in other projects, but here he is totally eclipsed by Englund's shadow. The whole movie just lacked the passion, drive and creativity of Wes Craven's original film. The characters are bland and unlikable, the movie has terrible special effects (such as the infamous wall scene), and overall it just felt like a huge waste of time and resources. They should've tried to do something different instead of making a cheap copy of the original. Because as it is, the only thing this movie makes me want to do is go watch the original again.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
624,jessie-persoons,Does Freddy need a tissue?,4,7 May 2010,"I remember watching a scene on TV of the very first Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 11. It was the sequence in which Nancy falls asleep in class and sees her slaughtered friend Tina in a body bag. I tried to stay awake for about a whole week... I am not against remakes at all, it's a fun way to bring classics to 21st century youth in a contemporary manner.. However in spite of the efforts in staying faithful to the original Nightmare and the few scares you do get in the new one, I couldn't help myself being disappointed with the poor performance of Jackie Earle Haley. Where Freddy is a cruel, nasty character who enjoys a good kill with a good sense of humor and a few well placed one-liners,let's face it, the guy is a good laugh and at the same time he is able to scare the living hell out of you. Jackie Earle Haley puts down a Freddy Krueger who seems more melancholic for the old days when he could play with small children before torturing them and who sounds like Rocky Balboa with a hang over from hell.. Let's face it... the guy talks way too much. The originality of Freddy's humor is simply absent and the few winks to the original one just don't sound natural and I wonder sometimes why Nancy doesn't think of giving him a tissue? I did however enjoy the performances of Kyle Gallner and Rooney Mara. Their characters where more evolved that in the original one, but an original Nancy, no matter how much we loved her and her early grays in the 80s, she simply would not sell anymore... I would not recommend this movie to anyone who's seen the original one, because although it stays faithful to the original one, you just can't help yourself comparing the two, which will make you realize each time that Wes Craven's original work was not meant to be tempered with.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
625,josiep-41764,Such a disappointment,4,4 August 2021,If only the people behind the scenes had more confidence and further explored the (few) new ideas that were introduced.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
626,samkaveli,Started off good but Spoilers,3,2 May 2010,"Turned into ****... random thoughts on the movie.JEH as Freddy: First JEH was the **** as Freddy, the best actor in the movie. hes not Englund, but a wordy replacement. if only he had Wes Craven directing him. this Freddy was also very angry, I like that. he was pretty funny. but not really scary like the Freddy from the original movie until the end. his make up was alright, but the pizza look is better IMO... if you like his make up here no problem.Dialogue: In the original the conversations seemed real. this, you can tell their reading off a script. people who say the original had bad acting. I don't see how they thought the acting in this one was any better. it was worst, very rushed. like the actors where bored in just where ready for their pay checks to be signed... very bad. the mothers argument with Nancy was so forced. in the original, you can tell Nancy is upset. this, not so much. so those who diss Heathers acting, and think this girl is better, your wrong.Deaths: Lets start with the worst. Cris, her death was to quick, everything happened to fast... in the original, we got to see Freddy taunt Tina, you can feel the hopelessness and felt sorry for her. but in this, you could give a **** about Cris, or the rest of the characters deaths. how they thought these death scenes where good or scary is beyond me.WTF moments: Why does the character Cris mom look just as young as her? makes no sense... and too many jump scares, seriously, they where not scary, because I didn't jump once. the micro naps where pointless really, I guess they needed a excuse to put in as many unnecessary dream sequence as possible. the class room scene had no tension the teacher comely act like nothing happened. in the original, you can tell the class are like WTF. but in this, no one seem to care. the students should have been talking about her as she walked by(they should have at least did that)their was nothing to indicate they had a WTF moment, NOTHING.CGI and Scenes form the original: Oh god, the CGI on the well was just bad. wow, how the **** do you **** that up? not just that, but all the scenes from the original were so forced and crap. how does this director insult Wes Craven about the way he did his dream sequence. then go on to **** up all the classic scenes in make them worst? how the **** do you do that? how the ****? not to mention his dream sequences sucked. they don't hold a candle to Wes dream sequences. what a prick, thinking he could do better then Wes lol.Ending: Way did they keep the original ending? they could have done better here. and when they pulled Freddy out of the dream. it was so forced, heck everything in this movie is. the ending fight(I guess that what it was)was the only good thing about the ending.Final Thoughts: This movie just sucked. how anyone can think this is a good movie, or even more laughable, think it's better then the first is beyound me. I thought it was good up until the funeral. then just got worst, and worst, so bad I wanted some one to shot me. it's a good thing I didn't pay for this, PD once again makes a horrible horror movie. the only thing ""horror""about this remake is setting throw it.god why? I think I'm going to get drunk to forget about this movie.don't see this movie at the movies, see it online. at least you wouldn't have to pay anything for it. oh and the red hair kid was good too. I can see him as the Joker in the dark knight sequel( put that make up on that kid) he sorta looks like Heath in some scenes that kid has a future.Anyway 3/10 if you love PD crap you'll love this movie if not you'll hate PD even more.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

628,aaroncatlow,THE best Freddy film i have seen!!!,10,8 May 2010,"At first, i was expecting another 'scene-for-scene' remake but this was just something totally different. I know people say you shouldn't remake a classic BUT this has been done in an excellent way. For starters, the look of Freddy. Yes, its not as you remember him from the original but thats what adds to the whole atmosphere of the film. We see a more scary looking Freddy who's more violent than ever......PLEASE Don't READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THIS FILM SPOILERS!!!! As you remember if you have seen the original, Tina (or Kris in this movie) was just slashed open in her sleep, dragged round the bedroom then dropped back on the bed. But this 1 is more violent, as Kris is slammed off the walls, into a mirror, off the ceiling then she lands on the bed and it looks like its over for a second... then whoosh, she gets levitated while screaming and takes her final breath, all goes quiet then she is slashed right open from neck 2 waist.The use of sound effects was absolutely brilliant. at the beginning when dean first sees Freddy, he falls asleep again only this time Freddy is holding a steak knife to his throat but all Nancy can see is dean holding it to his own throat saying 'your not real, your not real' then Freddy slams the knife into dean's neck on the left side, all the way to the handle and then cuts right across to the other side and you can hear the blade cutting through the tendons and his windpipe and everything else. really got me going for the rest of th movie.If you haven't yet seen it then i would really recommend it before you start saying 'oh its just another remake it will be s**t.' Im telling you now you will not be disappointed. i know i wasn't and now i cannot wait for the DVD.oh and if you have seen all the clips and trailers for the film on you-tube etc, there not all in it. some have been changed, some just didn't make it in the final cut but I'm positive they will be on the DVD extras and mentioned in the commentary.please comment on this and if you do thanks for your time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
629,shawngsu02,Okay at Best,6,4 May 2010,"This was an alright remake minus the fact that they did not use any of the original music to actually open the film. Some of the CGI just ruined certain scenes of the movie like were Freddys wall scene where the original was so much better than this movies. Also some very bad acting through the entire beginning of the movie but got better. A scene I thought wasn't to much CGI is where she came falling through the ceiling it made that scene a lot better than the original. Still don't understand why they changed one of the characters names also, and why in this version did they decide to make everybody responsible teens instead of bad ones? But it was still a good movie I would have just rather have waited to watch it on DVD instead of in the movie theater, don't really think it was worth my 12 dollars to see it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
630,zareke,Where do I start...,4,22 October 2021,"The good new ideas are few and far between, most of the film is just a generic rehash of scenes from the original, only their done in a worse way. Easy way to see that the main motivation for making this was to get money.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

632,felixthekat5,Honestly...,7,16 May 2010,"I loved the film. With all the hateful reviews I thought I'd add mine. It was way better than any horror film released recently and I thought it was fun and true to original IDEAS in the first film. I also might add that I was never a die hard fan of the original freddy/films so that might be a reason why I did appreciate the recreation of Wes' original story. It was up to date, entertaining, and I loved the cast. The new Freddy was an awesome villain and still had a sense of humor that I found more disturbing and effective rather the the old one which was totally comedic. Hope this review sheds some light on a different opinion. MY FAVORITE LINES FROM THE FILM WHICH MAKE IT BADA$S AS F*CK!.........why are you screaming, I haven't even cut you yet....I was only petting him, we still have 6 minutes to play, and talk about a wet dream!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
633,dafairygirl,This movie is the pits,2,29 March 2011,"If you are a Freddie fan as huge as I am...you will NOT like this movie. The graphics and the blood factor are awesome, but Freddie is supposed to be a wise guy with a lot of smart mouthed remarks. Freddie is dull and boring and not at all funny, like Robert Englund's Freddie. He is way too violent, and not sarcastic enough. The story line is not even close to the original. Yes, the parents burned him to death in the boiler room, but he was not a gardener, he was a carpenter. This movie was a huge disappointment to me as a Freddie fan. It did not do Freddie or the original ANY justice whatsoever. If you have not seen the original you may enjoy it. The movie it's self was not too bad, but the butchered Freddy ruined it. That is not something that us die hard Freddie fans can overlook.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
634,docpage-1,Definitely not as bad as everyone else says...,6,14 June 2021,"So, here's my 2 cents: this is a terrific movie; excellent scrip; the acting is SO much better than the original (sorry, Heather, Johnny). The lighting, special effects, mood and pacing are excellent; really dark (as it ought to be), and twisted (again, as it ought to be). The problem (and it's a BIG one), is that ironically, Freddy ruins the entire thing. Maybe I'm just used to Robert Englund (and let's face it, who can top him?), but the guy playing Freddy just simply blows. No style, no class, no frights whatsoever. I blame partially the director, who could have PLEADED with him to put some personality into the role (who knows? Maybe he did, and this was the best the guy could come up with). I found everything about the film intriguing, spooky and engrossing, until HE shows up. And since Freddy is one of the baddest of the badasses, this makes the entire film...uh...crap. Here's an idea: take the same shooting script, same actors, pay R. E. The 10 million he'd likely want, and re-do the damn thing.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
635,dacarmanu,A Nightmare on Elm Street: Something NEW.,8,3 May 2010,"This movie was really impressive. My favorite scene was when [ SPOILER ] ""Freddy chases Nancy in the house and she runs to the hallway and falls into the blood-soaked floor. As she falls, the ceiling from the room downstairs breaks, making her fall into the bed."" [ /SPOILER ] This film was very intense: JEH was really good as Freddy. I thought he added something different. Many people were angry they didn't add Freddy's signature jokes into the film. THERE ARE MANY JOKES IN THIS MOVIE. They are more morbid jokes than flat out comedy jokes that made him less scary.PROS: The weird atmosphere, the random scares. Freddy's realistic skin. His morbid jokes. The CGI from [ SPOILER ] when Nancy falls and the blood comes off of her... [ /SPOILER ]CONS: The bad CGI from where [ SPOILER ] Freddy comes through the wall at the beginning...""\ [ /SPOILER ]OVERALL: This film was very funny/scary/creepy all together.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
636,LoidaDGarcia,A Detailed Review of the New Nightmare,7,4 May 2010,"Costumes:It was just your everyday basic preppy clothes. Freddy remained in his well known red and green stripped sweater and dirty brown fedora. They did tie in the fedora by showing him wearing it while gardening and they also tied the sweater in by showing him ripping his jacket off during the fire therefore revealing his sweater. Now I would have like a little more consistency. If he was going to be wearing that sweater because he died in it then he shouldn't have worn the hat because it was nowhere near him when he died. They should have explained that a bit, at least let people know the reason he wears what he wears.Music:As with most horror movies the music is one of the key elements in causing the jump factors, and this version of Nightmare on Elm Street stays firm with that use of music. Some of the jump scenes are somewhat given away by the slight changes in music and ambiance. The Kids:Apparently anorexia is still in high demand in Hollywood. Now I'm not saying that there shouldn't be any thin actresses. There should just be a more realistic representation of society. When it came to the ages of the characters I have to say that they failed miserably. I understand that most movies hire 20 something year olds to play teens, but these actors couldn't pull it off. Everyone at the school looked like they were in their 20's. They should have just set it up to take place during college especially since they never even explained why their age was so crucial to Freddy's return.The overall acting was a little poor from the ""kids""; especially from the first one that dies (I believe his name was Dean). It wasn't as bad as it could have been and they did manage to pull it together. It would have just been nice to have stronger actors in the roles.Parents:The actors chosen to portray the parents did an excellent job. My only tiff is that the parents didn't have as big a role as they should have. This whole situation was caused by them and while they did explain what happened it just feels as if they should have had a bigger part.Freddy:I really liked the more realistic look that they gave Freddy in this movie. While silent the makeup looks amazing and very disturbing, the problem comes when he speaks. Jackie Earle Haley did an amazing job; it's just that the makeup/mask that he wore did not allow him much facial mobility. With that said though, in my opinion Jackie Earle Haley did a phenomenal job giving Freddy a personality that went deeper than just cracking jokes and killing teens. Haley truly gave Freddy a personality, and a reason. Freddy wasn't just mindlessly hacking and slashing as he has in the past. This time you can see that everything he does is precise; there is a rhyme and reason to it all. He still ""plays"" with the kids before killing them, but he does so in a very different way. Instead of just instilling immediate fear upon them by threatening them, it's almost as if he gives them just enough to allow them to create and build their own fears. He takes his time with them in the same manner that a cat takes their time killing a mouse. They give the mouse a little freedom, just enough to give them a false sense of security just to bring them in again. This goes on for a while until the mouse is so scared that they themselves commit the ultimate fatal mistake, causing their kill to be as easy as cutting butter with a warm knife. This is what Haley has turned Freddy into, the ultimate cat, in this cat and mouse game.Story:After watching the entirety of the movie I firmly believe that they should have stuck with him having been innocent. It would have been a nice little twist. For example, in one of the scenes of the movie they show you the kids getting their kindergarten class picture take outside. You see the photographer and Fred Krueger (who was the school's gardener) standing behind the photographer acting goofy and trying to get the kids to smile. They go on to explain how it was such a shock to the parents when they found out that Krueger was molesting their kids because he never showed any signs. He was always playing with the kids and they even stated how the kids were his life and he adored them (in a non molesting way). So having him actually turn out to be a child molester seems like a cop out. I think that it would have made a lot more sense to have someone else be the molester, say the photographer or a male teacher, and just having the blame placed on Fred Krueger. Scare Factor:I remember many years of sleepless nights after watching my first Freddy film when I was 6. Whether it was my age or the fact that around 20 years ago society wasn't as conditioned to such horror and gore, I can't say. This version will not be giving you nightmares or keeping you from much needed sleep, but then again it is very rare to find a horror movie these days that will do that. What it will do is offer numerous jump worthy scenes that will extract at least a small yelp will watching. Overall Opinion:If you're looking for a very well put together, yelp and jump worthy movie, then the new Freddy is right up your alley. One last thing, thank you Samuel Bayer for proving that good horror movies do not need nudity or sex.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and that's exactly what I got, other than the opening scene this movie offered nothing!People giving this movie a positive review have no perspective or creativity. I felt like one of the cast of in this movie.... Fighting to stay awake.I don't really write too many reviews but I couldn't stay away from this one. It's frustrating to watch them ruin these classic movies, I'm always open to watch them just because I love the genre of horror but my god. The CGI was way overused and Freddy looked like a burnt vampire/alien? I didn't think the acting was bad at all, I just think the script itself wasn't very good, definitely could've taken this movie in all kinds of crazy directions but instead just made it bland, it seemed like it was 3 hours long, Save your money!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
638,pepe812003,Where is Robert Englund & the make-up crew from the originals???,6,30 April 2010,"I would have given this movie a higher score, but Freddy's makeup/face and performance all together pretty much ruined the movie for me. It was almost as if he thought he was in Watchmen again, he used the same tone of voice. To top that off it wasn't even a creepy voice, he just deepened it a little. Next is his face. Did they hire some high school kids to handle the make-up for Freddy? If I didn't know better I would say they just borrowed the Scarecrow mask from Batman Begins. Lastly, he only had something like 2 gestures or motions. He either just ran the blade of the claw down some type of metal for a spark and screech effect or as he walked he would just wiggle his middle and ring finger up and down to make the metal to metal sound over and over and over. At least Robert Englund had some style. Beyond Freddy I thought the movie was pretty good. The rest of the actors were very convincing with the emotions they were portraying at the time. Even in some scenes where I knew what to expect, I still jumped. That is pretty good for a movie these days to be able to do that.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
639,sorrellart,"It is a Remake, but it is a Fair Remake",6,10 June 2011,"I love reading the reviews of these pseudo-intellectuals who think they are making some novel-point by criticizing a remake for lacking the creativity or originality of (gasp!) the original. Good-job, Internet film-critic, we are all amazed by your clear grasp of the obvious.Now, for a more honest review, this film accomplishes everything it sets out to accomplish. It is a darker REMAKE of the original classic. For those who have not seen the original (and a generation of two or those people exist), this is not as gory, scary, or interesting as many of the horror-films made recently, but it is still a creepy-film that holds its own. For those of us who have seen the original, this film simply updates the classic film, giving voice to much of what we assumed about the Freddy Krueger character, and uses modern special effects to replicate many of our favorite aspects of the original.Because it is a remake.This film does offer some twists, suggesting that it might go in a new direction. For a moment, the viewer is asked to question what they know about the killer, only to have their worst assumptions confirmed. While it lacks some of the surreal aspects of the original, it has a surrealism all its own. It also strikes a little closer to home, with news-stories relating to similar issues to the ones that make Fred Krueger a real monster cropping up almost daily.If this film were the original, I feel confident in saying that it would have been hailed as ""edgy"" and ""disturbing"". Robert Englund will always be Freddy Krueger in my mind, and Wes Craven is the better writer/director, but this is a decent homage.

I saw this movie--it was awful and could never live up to the original's standards! It was horrid! The actor playing Freddy looked like a scared banker in the scene where Freddy is supposed to be burned to death by the parents. the character Nancy Thompson who is a great heroine and had smarts when dealing with Freddy in the original 1984 classic is turned into a wimpy sniveling baby as Nancy Holbrook in the 2010 remake. Jackie Earle Haley does not have the same charisma and wit that Robert Englund had playing Freddy Krueger. His attempt at humor is dry and too serious to be taken as humor or wit. Overall F--!!! Save your money and rent all the Nightmare movies with Englund as Freddy--you'd have a better time! maybe people are being so desensitized by Hollywood's new standards for Horror they do not know a good movie if it came out in theaters!

641,tabobbyrocks,"I, for one, thought it was very well done.",10,8 July 2010,"This is not a remake so much as an updated version of the 1984 original ANOES. The back story of Freddy is told better than the original. It actually makes you feel bad for Freddy for a time. The way his story is told is also well portrayed. You learn what happened to him through the dreams of the teens he is haunting. He gives them (as well as the audience) a look into how he became the iconic monster he is today.Freddy Krueger is perfectly played by Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen). He brings the scariness that is Freddy without the cheesiness of the 80's. He knows just how to scare you. His voice fits the character. The burn makeup of Krueger is more realistic and scarier than Englund's Freddy. Although Englund did a great job as Freddy, I think it's time for him to move over and make room for Haley.The teenagers in this film are exceedingly more well acted than the originals. Rooney Mara is the very believable new Nancy. She shows her emotions without giving us the feeling that she is ""acting."" Katie Cassidy, Kyle Gallner, Thomas Dekker, and Kellan Lutz are also extremely good at playing their parts. The deaths of the three of them who do die are very sad. Almost to the point of tears. They pull you in, make you feel for them, just as Freddy sweeps in for the kill.This film is very scary. It will make you jump several times. Even if you think you can predict all of the scares, you will still be startled at the realness and the scariness of the new Freddy.I highly recommend this movie very much to those of you who enjoy horror films with a good story that is well portrayed.

But I do remember how frightening the parts I saw were (the wallpaper scene...). Truth be told I wasn't planning on seeing this anytime soon. But my buddy was paying, so what the hell. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Now I'm no obsessive fanboy. I went as an unbiased observer hoping to be scared silly by a decent horror. I ended up being more frightened of the usher's little beard. I can't say enough about how poor this film is. The script is pathetic, there is absolutely no tension, you don't care about any of the bland characters and Freddy is just small, weedy and irritating. The most frustrating thing about it is the directors insistence in blasting us with OTT sound effects whenever Freddy appears or something (supposedly) terrifying happens. It's the equivalent of having a stage hand hold up a megaphone and scream ""THIS PART IS SCARY! BE FRIGHTENED!"" I was almost insulted at the thought that Samuel Bayer expected us to be horrified by it. Well I was, but I'm sure not in the way he was gunning for. This is the ultimate in dumbed down, brainless ""entertainment""; it's more redundant than I Know What You Did Last Summer. For anyone hoping for a little subtlety, psychological horror, genuine shocks or any semblance of intelligent film making, don't waste your money on this. I can't bear the thought of Bayer lining his pockets with more money than he's already earned for doing a job that he's clearly incompetent at.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
643,smackdownkid001,Like watching the original... Without being frightened.,5,8 May 2010,When I had heard that they were remaking the Nightmare on Elm Street series i thought one thing. It was going to suck just like all the other horror movie remakes around today. I sat through this movie watching the same things happen that were in the original with the only difference being it was happening to different people. The cast wasn't anything special and Nancy wasn't even that big of a character she just seemed to be in the background most of the time. There were some parts of the movie I enjoyed but throughout most of the movie i sat bored and wanting it to end. They didn't do anything new and I wasn't even frightened which is the whole point of horror movies. So all in all I thought it sucked.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
644,HypotheticallyMonotonous,Fantastic,9,11 May 2010,"The week before ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" opened in theaters, my sister and I bought a collector's edition of the original ""Nightmare"" movies. Every night we watched one of the four movies. I'm guessing these movies were scarier as a kid, because we spent the whole time laughing our heads off while watching these movies. From feminine hands switching to manly hands and back again, to the clearly seen mattress laying on the stairs to protect ""Freddy"" from his fall, to the guy in a fat suit lit on fire in one of the final scenes; the movies were totally laugh-out-loud worthy. And 'shockingly' the movies didn't get any better.So my sister and I went in to see the remake with pretty low expectations. Perhaps that's why we enjoyed the remake so much. We thought the movie moved a lot smoother than the original which might be due to the advancement of technology. We had some 'jumping' moments while watching the remake and even decided it was one film we wouldn't mind seeing again.I find it amusing that some would call the new ""Nightmare"" unoriginal...well yeah- it's a remake. What exactly were you expecting? I was perfectly happy that they didn't stray too far from the original plot, they just made the plot a lot more appealing and satisfying. And as for the original ""Nightmare"" being deep, intellectual; are you sure you watched the same original as I? The original was merely a slasher flick just like the remake. And for the always trustworthy movie audience reaction? Well I can honestly say that I didn't overhear anyone saying, ""Boo"".",A Nightmare on Elm Street

With each movie, Freddy seemed to find a new way to make you jump, and to draw you in. Making you feel for the characters. So I went this weekend to watch the remake. I had a hard time even staying awake. It was boring from the get go. The new Freddy was not scary at all. There was nothing to draw you into the movie. You didn't feel for the characters. And the background story of Freddy working at a day care was beyond stupid. There was no thrill in the nightmares. None of the magic of the past movies. They failed big time on this remake. Please don't mess up and make more of a mess with Freddy. Needless to say, I wont be buying this remake when it comes out on DVD.

The score, they played the main elm street theme very sparingly, and not the secondary themes used throughout the franchise, I think they really helped set the mood for the scenes, which this was missing, and probably the single most disappointing thing to me. 2. They never really connected Elm Street, I mean before it was the street Heather lived on, and all the kids basically lived there, were it was Chris who lived on elm street and very little emphasis on it. What I did like . I did like they make you question Freddy as a good guy or bad, and then connected the story with the school. I Think overall the movie has a good feel, very hard to compare to the original, I think Jackie was an excellent choice, but not really maximizing the score with the original really took it down for me , at least two stars.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
648,ericdavidami,Fantastic re-imaging of NOES,10,24 May 2010,"The re-imaging of A nightmare on Elm Street is a fantastic horror film. And yes I said film. It is beautifully shot, has great acting and is ultimately a smart horror film.JEH's performance as Freddy completely out does Robert Englunds. JEH was terrifying and brutal killer. (thank god he didn't fly on a broom stick like Robert).I felt for the main characters and the acting compared to the original is 100x better. The excuse that the original was done in the 80's isn't a viable one. Look at all the classic movies from that time period and beyond. Good acting comes from talented actors and actresses and good direction and Sam Bayer let us, the viewer, feel the stress and terror that is A Nightmare On Elm Street.What I really like was the dream sequences. Though, Freddy coming out of the wall was better in the original then in the remake, the remake had some awesome additions and revamps. Tina/Kris's death scene was scary, and simply brutal. Jesse's death was pure horror! The way Freddy teased him before kill him. It's like swimming in the ocean and knowing a shark is in the water and you are just waiting to feel those horrible teeth.I also like the very smart and original micro-naps. Reality and the nightmares started to blend together to create a very uneasy atmosphere.Another thing I liked about this was the quick Freddy pop ups. usually this doesn't work in movies but it did for NOES cause the characters are having micronaps which would make Freddy appear when he wants to.To please the fans the PD crew added some one liners that are simply disgusting and perverted. Which works because Freddy after all was meant to be a pedo!all in all this is far better then the original and Freddy is once again terrifying.

649,brokendownsuicide,Nightmare On Elm Street review,9,9 May 2010,There are a lot of bad reviews on this but as a lifelong fan of the Elm Street series I'd have to disagree with the critics. This movie was well worth seeing. There are a lot of people out there were disappointed but it's because they were expecting to see an exact copy of Robert Englund's Freddy but it's a new day and a new Freddy. Jackie Erale Haley's performance as Freddy was really good as any role he plays. I really felt that picking Jackie for the part was a great choice. This movie may not hold up to the original but it is one of the best horror remakes out there in my eyes. It does live up to the Nightmare On Elm Street name. Freddy's look isn't really great and hopefully they make some changes to it in the sequel which they have already announced this past week. I can not wait for the DVD to come out so I can watch this again. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and recommend you check it out if you are a fan of the series.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
650,cabbienigma,I loved this movie. I don't understand why it got bad reviews.,10,5 May 2010,"Personally, I loved this movie. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, especially any thing to do with Freddy Krueger. I consider myself one of the biggest Freddy Krueger fans out there. I've been collecting Freddy Krueger memorabilia for a while. In honor of this movie, I wore a different Freddy Krueger shirt every day in April. I had been looking forward to this since I heard that they were planning on making it a few years ago. A lot of people gave this bad reviews, but I don't understand why. I thought the movie was amazing. I thought Jackie Earle Haley did a great job of portraying this iconic figure. He was not trying to duplicate Robert Englund's portrayal of Krueger, but rather make it his own depiction. I have nothing bad to say about Robert Englund either. He is the original that we've all known for so long as Freddy Krueger. But, they were trying to make a more modernized update of Nightmare On Elm Street, so they had to change Freddy a little bit. I love both portrayals of Freddy for many reasons and have nothing bad to say about either. Regardless of how the movie turned out, I would have still loved it, just because it has Freddy Krueger in it. But, it was still everything I hoped it would be and so much more.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
651,kjansia,"C'mon, man...",2,5 November 2010,"I didn't have the highest expectations going into this, but...but this was terrible. No, no, seriously - absolutely horrible.I feel that Englund's performance as Freddy in the original was a large part of the original's success. Filled with camp humor and menacing silliness, he's got his own thing going on, which lent itself immensely to the quality of the finished product. That being said, when I saw that Jackie Earl Haley was casted as Kruger in the reboot, I thought that I'd at least get a decent, idiosyncratic little part out of him. I expected J.E.H. to add a little flair, a little razzle-dazzle, a little SOMETHING to everyone's favorite Villain of Dreams. But whether he was being hampered by the director, a poor script, or that bottle of cough syrup he chugged before hitting the set, well...let's just say he sucked. Bad.The rest of the cast should stand trail in The Hague. Sweet Christmas. Strike that, as Clancy Brown was good for the entire three minutes he was in the film, and I hope he at least made a coupla car payments with his check. Save yourself a few bucks and: (a) buy an apple (b) eat said apple in the traditional fashion (c) now, set the core on the table in front of you and watch it turn ever-deepening shades of brown over the next hour- and-a-half.

652,amilddisclosure,Excellent remake. Disregard horrible reviews.,8,27 May 2010,"Yes, it was a cliché teen slasher flick. Yes, it had pretty girls and attractive guys. Was it exactly the same as the original, just remade with new special effects and a bit of a switch on the storyline? It was. Some reviews I've read said that this remake was an atrocious movie and was just another crappy remake of an incredible horror movie. What was the ORIGINAL Nightmare On Elm Street? It was a teen slasher flick! Nothing more! Nothing less! Yes, it was a great horror movie and will forever be remembered. This movie was just an updated version for the current teen audience. People are just peeved because its not EXACTLY the same. In reality it had a better deeper plot and dug just a bit deeper into Freddy. He was extremely creepy and still had his sick sense of humor. There was nothing really wrong with this movie, for what it is. The ONLY part I didn't like from the movie was the one scene they show in the preview, when you see him rip off his jacket and reveal his sweater. I thought that was a bit too cheesy, but the rest was golden.8 out of 10 for being the best horror movie remake I've seen in quite some time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
653,zenthful2000,The lack of creativity and direction.,4,3 May 2010,"why did they give Samuel Bayer a shot for this remake. I was extremely excited to see this movie because of Jackie playing as the new Fred. Now from the very start of the movie I already knew I wasn't going to like what I was going to see. This movie didn't seem like it was taken seriously and even though Freddy was in the movie a lot killing everyone, he still didn't have much of a character. Yes I did like the new image they gave him and dark personality, but they could have done a lot more. This movie just lacked so much in creativity.A great example of this would be when these kids would fall asleep in the dreamworld and would die a plain crappy death, also to add on the bad acting. Haley was the best actor and I'm sure he could have made Freddy better if the writers had expanded more to his story instead of just going on kill after kill. Yes they explain the story of his death but it still didn't seem like enough =/. I could really care less that it was a remake and actually I hope to see a lot more remakes.

656,conquest85,A short sharp shock,8,26 May 2010,"I think that Nightmare on Elm street is a compact, succinct telling of a really cool dark tale. No matter what else is said about it, it get's in and out of the story with very little exposition or drawn out boring parts. It ramps up the violence and intrigue really quickly and delivers the goods. It's comparable to a really tight rock record...like, mob rules or slip it in. It gets in your face grabs you by the throat and screams at you and then knocks your lights out.That said, the characters have to be read into or projected onto to have much substance but screw it, who cares...who are these suburban waste-cases? Isn't that sort of the point? It's no great loss when they're gone. It's angry, an angry story to tell in the mid-80's world of consumer complacency and even angrier still in an age when we're at war and dying and people just sit on the computer all day and wish they were the Jonas Brothers, Paris Hilton or some such. I think that N.O.E.S. is a really well crafted piece of anti-society art that will be recognized in years to come by fans and by people that want to give the artist behind this movie another vehicle to unleash his fury.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

658,zombie_nougat_madness,"Haters will hate, but a solid strong revamp, that could use more muscle, but a much needed modernization from a tired ""dated"" original...good Freddy performances too!",8,1 May 2010,"As a self proclaimed expert ""Freddyologist,"" having seen and owned all the films, and having a host of paraphernalia through the years, as well as an expert horror movie aficionado; I feel this movie, if it wasn't for all the preconceived notions and expectations of Freddy and the look and feel of such an iconic film and character, was a pretty decent adaptation to such a popular film. If not compared to its predecessors, this was a fresh, raw, and fully developed horror movie that succeeds at standing alone sturdily as a well made horror movie.Without giving anything away, the movie succeeds at giving us the sensibility of the original, through certain dream sequences and a certain look and feel. Characters were developed at a good pace, there was a nice amount of ""who is the main character, who is going to die"" mystery, and I believe it stuck to the program quite well, even if a bit too much I thought. They could have been even more daring in being original and adventuring into a new direction I felt, though it was not distracting to an ultimately entertaining and quality movie. Freddy. Hmm...lots of folks here don't like this adaptation, saying he's not burned enough or he looks like a mongoloid, or something silly like that. I felt this character was developed quite well, this time going more into his more disturbing psychology, such as his child fetish, and his back story of where he works and how he came to be, whilst discarding the silliness of the original as being the ""bastard son of a thousand maniacs!"" Hokeyness removed, child lover depicted unapologetically and..eee, man, just plain yucky and creepy! Also he is pretty darn scary and brutal, and although his physical presence is not nearly as developed as our main man Freddy we all know and love, it is more realistic which makes it seem more real to the viewer, where the performance sells the scares, not just the make up effects. We get a more visceral scary experience because we can believe this guy is real, and not just see this guy as a horror movie icon, or our good friend Robert Englund, who most of us horror fans know and love! The acting performance of the new Freddy, not to take sides, was captivating and a brilliant performance...All in all I thought this story was imaginative, and gave a good face- lift to a much needed ""dated"" original. Not too Hollywood, not too Rob Zombie in its hyper gritty scratchy nicotine stained film noir, and not too over the top slasher or teen titty romp. Just a well told imaginative story with some good twists on an American masterpiece that truly needed some amping up for more modern audiences. I mean, look at those clothes the original Nancy is wearing! And the acting, whewie! The parents are like 50's parents, and the teens are all goody two shoes! Just sadly dated by todays standards is all. This movie gave this iconic theme the nip tuck it needed, and did it justice, though I will always have a special place in my heart for the originals...",A Nightmare on Elm Street
659,vezzam1,"Decent ""reimagining"", but still needed a lot of fixing.",6,29 April 2010,"It could have been worse - so, so much worse. But it was still an enjoyable psychological thriller. Even if you are familiar with the original series, there is still enough to keep your attention, even if you know how the film is going to end.One of my biggest complaints was the rushed opening twenty minutes where you learn too much, too fast - and then the film slows down. Honestly, ten, fifteen minutes we learn his name is Freddy (in the original you don't learn that until close to the hour mark.) Also, Freddy is overexposed overused in the beginning and it really destroys the effect of his presence because then it is no longer a surprise when he'll be on screen, but rather you expect him to be on screen at certain times.Some good points; surprisingly the developed relationship between Nancy and Freddy is vastly different from what we saw in the original series, yet in its own is just as intimate. Nancy is still strong, but she is not Nancy Thompson (I learned to deal with the last name change since her last name of ""Holbrook"" is not mentioned ONCE in the film). This Nancy is not the Nancy of the original, but while she is completely different, she still possess the inner strength and courage to face Krueger on his turf.Kris: very well done. Yes, the film focuses almost solely on her until she dies, but you empathize with her. For the audience members NOT familiar with the original, her death was a huge shock to them. On that note, her death doesn't hold a candle to the horror of the original; it happens all too fast without not as much blood. Kris is thrown around the room and beaten against the walls and ceiling mercilessly until she is gutted.Jesse: a majorly undeveloped character. His relationship with Kris is never fully explored, but you experience pity for him the suffering he has to endure at Freddy's hand.Quentin: in the words of Freddy ""just f*cking die."" Really. His relationship with Nancy was annoying (Nancy could stand on her own), his wimpy, whining attitude was a distraction, almost cliché. Besides escorting Nancy, his character doesn't add much to the plot or film. He could have died leaving Nancy to face Krueger completely alone.Freddy: There were some amazing moments, and some seriously off moments. Some moments it was unsettling how much he enjoyed the depravity and suffering of these children. It became clear that even if he hadn't died, he would have visited this same horrific atrocity on these children. The child molester aspect works, and it makes it creepy when he gently runs his hand down Jesse's side before executing him, or when he has pinned his favorite, Nancy.Overall, the film was satisfying, maybe not to all. I can see where some will have issues with it, but if you take it on its own it does well, but not with the impact of the original.Some trivia:Look for Kris wearing the #10 Jersey. Nancy's house is still 1428 Elm Street. Nancy's Mom gets offed again by Krueger, and dragged not through the window in a door, but a hallway mirror - a double homage to the original and the mirrors in part 3. The hallway of the blood was an excellent modern translation to the goo stairs. Rather than burning herself in English class, Nancy uses a cigarette lighter in a car. ""How's this for a wet dream,"" makes a cringe worthy appearance. You will hear ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy."" Tina's body bag scene is there and it is excellent.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Unfortunately this ""action by camera shaking"" technique crops up a few more times throughout the movie.The main characters are average teens in an average town, so thankfully, no time is wasted on pointless character development and setting meditation. As it should be, the focus is always on Freddy, whose afterlife appearance is wonderfully gruesome as he stalks a dreamland that melds seamlessly with reality to create interesting transitions. The suspense created by these transitions, however, is quickly destroyed by overt musical cues.The mystery of Freddy's past was a great angle and ultimately served to darken an already very dark tone set by the brutality of the preceding.Overall, the acting is quite good, although Mara's sleep-deprived Nancy does occasionally border on woodenness.The only head-scratcher was the fate of the Asian blogger whose head is seemingly thrust into the camera.

The movie moves fast and doesn't leave much time for suspense to build. Freddy becomes more like the classic Freddy only towards the end of the movie, using the environment and dramatic effects to scare his victim. I prefer to look at the movie now as more of a psychological thriller, but not a smart one. Your seeing these kids react to these mounting issues. I don't hate this film, and because its different enough I don't feel any need to replace the classic's place in my... heart I guess. I don't really mind that they made Freddy an alleged child molester. To me its just a reminder of how our real world can be as horrifying as any nightmare. I do feel the original is a much better movie, but this new version isn't so bad I would use the film as toilet paper. They just don't make movies like they used to.

662,AussieV8,Very Disappointing,1,23 May 2010,"This movie was pathetic, I have been waiting so long for this reboot, I'm a huge fan of the original movies and was hoping they wouldn't stuff this one up but they did, hey have destroyed what Freddy was all about, why he was above the other slasher icon's i.e. Jason and Michael. Freddy tormented and played with his victims before killing them. In this pile of Garbage he was just plain boring and the death scene's were unoriginal and over in 5 seconds....... If your going to replicate a death scene from the original make it better not shorten and cheapen it. Wes Craven created a great scary movie with a very small budget, it gave me nightmares for weeks when i watched it as a kid and i still find it creepy today, sure it had it's flaws like all the movies in the series did (some more so then others) but they always had an eeriness about it and kept you interested. Now with today's technology and a pretty huge budget for a horror movie they couldn't even make it remotely scary or creepy and turned Freddy into a boring joke. Prop's to Jackie Earl Hailey for trying, I think with a decent script and story writers etc He could pull off a truly scary Freddy but he didn't have much of a chance as his script was just terrible apart from 2 stand out lines and his make up was crap, he didn't have any facial expressions at all and it didn't work, where's the evil taunting grin Freddy is famous for?? The Kid's in the movie were so bleak and uninteresting I couldn't wait for them to die, I don't think they were bad actor's but they had nothing to work with. The lead Nancy came across as a down n out ""depressed"" Emo who had no real strength about her. The rest of the cast was pretty much the same, they were trying for a dark atmosphere?, yeah that doesn't mean your characters are lifeless drones.The concept of the back story is a part i did like, seeing a bit of insight into Freddy before he died was something the original lacked but to change him from a Child molester/murderer to a straight out Pedo didn't work, if he didn't kill the kids where does the glove come from??, they took away his Presence as a true Psycho who was so evil that when they killed him he came back as a supernatural monster for his revenge. The Dream sequences were unimaginative and weak, and just repeated the same environments over and over again. I really could just go on and on tearing apart this poor excuse for a horror movie, but i better stop,New line/Warner bros what ever your called now if you are going to make a sequel to this please don't let Brad fuller and his buddies have anything to do with it, they should not touch horror Movies, Find a good Producer and Director who are real fans of the originals then you might have something worth paying for.

Through the remainder of the movie Freddy's voice became more of an annoyance and distraction than a cause for fear (very similar to Christian Bale's Batman). I entered the movie expecting to get whisked away to the wonderful dream-world of Freddy Krueger but was instead pulled into a high school slasher film promoting a typical killer with a grudge and thirst for blood. The fact the victim was trapped inside a dream battling with Freddy wasn't quite enough to satisfy the sense of a nightmarish killer's dream world.

The pacing was a lot quicker than the original and the characters aren't quite as well developed but I think it works because Freddy has so much screen time in this one. This movie basically takes the best deaths of the original and grows upon them. I have always been a fan of these slasher movies and we all know that none of them are masterpieces. Obviously, if you're looking for a story with a strong plot and great characters you should know not to be watching a slasher flick. I thought that this was probably the best remake of all of the modern takes on these movies. Much stronger than Friday the 13th and Halloween (yet I still enjoyed both). My only big complaint is the back story of Freddy has been changed to quite an extent. If you're a fan of the originals then you should be able to point it out easily, and to an extent it takes away from how evil Freddy was before died and became the dream killer. All-in-all, a great modernization.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
666,enc_4789,The Nightmare Reboot Delivers,9,30 April 2010,"In the beginning, as most of us know, Wes Craven gave us an insidious specter of a burn victim, with a dirty red and green sweater, who chased teens in their dreams for the sins of their fathers... and mothers. He began as a creepy, sado-masochistic maniac. But unlike his fellow teen-slashers, he held a lot of personality and charisma. Throughout the series, this personality caused him to become a household name. A dark counterpart to Ronald McDonald. Many would say that would lead to his downfall, but I think it made him more lovable. More iconic. It's surprising that the Friday the 13th series outsold the Nightmare series, in my opinion, although I still love the hockey masked titan...Robert Englund's Freddy became cartoony, as us series fans know. He lost that darkness that was given to him in the '84 film. He lost what made him scary, and intimidating. New Nightmare tried to give it back, but the film was more like the classic 90's soap operas that aired on day-time television. Except with a lot more blood, and killing.Now, with Sam Bayer behind the re-imagining, and Jackie Earle Hayley filling in the shoes of a beloved horror icon, we come back to the darkness. We come back to the twisted dream demon that made us afraid to go to sleep when we were children. I can't say they disappointed. I had initial trepidations. The usual Freddy-fan-letdown when I found out Englund wasn't reprising the role. But he's 62 now. He's done with this whole thing. He had his turn for 20 years. It was time for change. And it was a great turn around.The cast, though widely different, was a lot deeper than those of the previous installments. In the past, it was mostly the redundant formula of ""here's a handful of teens, now watch them die in interesting ways"". This film still had the good death scenes and they didn't try to force you to connect with the characters, but they still allowed a bit of character development for the people that enjoy that. But, as they should have, with an almost rockstar character, they focused a bit more on Freddy. His backstory has changed, only slightly this time around, but I think it gives a good diversity to his character. Your feelings toward him throughout the film are ambiguous. From fear, to sympathy, to realizing he is just purely evil. His appearance, while sticking close to home, is slightly updated. His skin, instead of having the ""Split-cheese on pizza"" look of old, looks like an actual burn victim. His voice is back down to a deep, echoing drawl. He still has funny lines, but they're a lot more sadistic and black-humored this time around, rather than just slap-stick headshakers.Some of the 'homage' scenes didn't do the originals justice. Such as the ""man-in-the-wall"" scene. The spandex idea worked and looked way better than the lazy CGI. The hand in the bathtub scene was less effective than the original, and just kind of silly looking. But the bodybag scene in the school hallway was MUCH creepier. As well as the hallway of blood, as opposed to the sludgy stairs. And the ending was actually exciting.Overall, the film was a great re-imagining. Much better than the other Platinum Dunes productions. It had a lot of originality, while still not being a let-down to the veteran Fred-Heads. Robert Englund wore big shoes, but I think Hayley filled them out quite nicely with his own adaptation of the character. The teens were modern, and realistic. And even interesting. I believe the cast and crew delivered in the way that they promised, and I'm so glad that they did such a beloved franchise justice, if not more. This film is definitely worth money, or at least to see. *Especially* if you are a long time fan. I suggest to give Hayley a chance. His Freddy is different, but it's done extremely well.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

For those of you who don't know, this is not a remake of the first freddy but a new look at the original idea.my only complaints weren't for the movie but for other patrons of the theater. yes, we all know robert englund is a legend and can never be replaced but he's like 60 now and no one wants to see a geriatric freddy. If you're going to compare Haley and Englund, you're an idiot. Keep your thoughts to yourself and stay home in mommys basement, order up another plate of pizza rolls and wait for it on DVD. If you can stay open minded and appreciate a new take on an old favorite i don't think you'll be disappointed. It's an old school slasher with a little more depth. I wasn't impressed with the dialog but it doesn't take away from the movie enough to be upsetting. As the movie progresses so does Haley as he seems to come into his own. The last 30min. of the movie you can see a subtle shift in his behavior and comfortability that really sells the freddy image.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The 84 film was great but Kruger was a little campier than I would like; This Freddy is a creep and in the end you really route against him. Simply put: What Jackie Earl Haley is to Freddy is what Heath Ledger is to the Joker! QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD STOP LIVING IN THE 80's AND TAKE THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS. I love the original but if these came out at the same time with the same effects, the 2010 wins by a landslide! I really think that people who grew up watching the original have a really bias opinion going into this movie.

I truly mean that too, like it's not even to the point where you think it's funny it's so bad it's more like ""Wow, i'm actually kind of embarrassed by watching this film."" When i first heard about it i thought ""Oh, cool, this might be good. Maybe he can pull of being Freddy."" I have never been so wrong in my life! I have failed History tests and have been more right then this film was. Once this film was over i rushed to the bathroom to puke out all the dignity this film lacks. I mean, what were these people thinking? I surely hope when this was being made it seemed a lot better than it turned out. Whoever was the first person to ever come up with this idea should be smart enough to never show their face in Hollywood ever again for as long as they live. I can't believe this horse crap.

But when i just saw this it gives Freddy more of a horror type of guy which u barley saw in the original he was more of a clown killer. So i gave it a 10/10. I also took there was 1 bad thing. They use to much of the original Freddy. They should have just started fresh. New characters, besides Nancy of course. i also loved the makeup design of Jackie Earl Haley. It looked very realistic. But in the end Jackie did a great Role as Freddy. I would love to see a sequel. So i also change my vote i believe that this film should be a 7,8,or 9 vote. No way in hell it is 10.

I went to the midnight premier and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I liked the overall pace of the movie. It was very fast, which gave the audience no time to relax. I thought the plot stayed true to the original and was not butchured or ruined in any way. Nightmare on ELm Street was by far the best remake of the classic slashers so far. I enjoyed Haley's take on classic villain Freddy. He didn't try and copy Robert Englund's Freddy which i thought was smart.

672,eric-726-260812,Twilight + Freddy Kreuger + SLIGHTLY Better Writing than Twilight = This Movie,2,30 April 2010,"I admit I was rather excited to see this. But after given a night to sleep on it, I have a nice list of reasons this movie is such a let down:1 - The film seems to take place in the ""Twilight"" universe.// Every ""teenager"" in this movie is a skinny emo kid with pale skin, eye liner, and hair product, with a brooding / """"""deep"""""" personality, and 6-pack abs. Ugh. Twilight is the biggest joke of a movie series that has ever existed, and it's infecting / destroying other (once) GOOD movie series' now.// This world it takes place in seems to be void of adults, other than as plot devices, much like the ""Twilight"" series, as well.2 - The writing is extremely linear, and faulty.// No sense of build-up at all. Freddy starts out right away in terror-mode, and then immediately jumps straight into the gravity-defying rag-dolling of one of the girls, followed by a chest slash that seems to kill her instantly (right....). Seems to me that lifting someone into mid-air is something they may have wanted to build up to. It was kind of all down hill from there, in terms of HOW he kills. // The movie's premise seems to be built around the ""common knowledge"" (aka: complete nonsense) that if you stay awake long enough (seemed like 4 maybe 5 days?) you end up in a ""permanent sleep"" / coma. Okay. Well that isn't true. But if it were, why at the end of the movie, after passing that threshold and only awakening due to a shot of adrenaline to her heart, was it suddenly fine for her to go to sleep?// Edit: And did anyone notice the massive 2-story houses, and brand-new hybrids that can be afforded on the salary of single-parent flight attendants and high school principals? Just.. wow.3 - Freddy could have been much better// I don't mind the acting too much, though he could have been more menacing. The main issue was with his face. More specifically, the eyes and mouth. The eyes just didn't say ""Freddy Kreuger"" at all. No expression. Just a blank, uneven, droopy stare. And the mouth looks straight off of the creature of the black lagoon. (the voice acting was pretty good though. despite what some say, it definitely had a ""freddy"" sound to it, although it could have been better)// It seems to me they were going for a more blunt-force scariness in this movie. Applying more of a Texas Chainsaw / Jason Vourhees feeling to Freddy, when what was needed was more of a Dark Knight's ""The Joker"" feel. I know they went for a more realistic burn-victim appearance, but they took it a little too far. Hell, I don't think Freddy actually smiled once, and that's kind of what made it all so terrifying. That he had such a sick and twisted sense of humor about it all.4 - I could go on, but I'm hoping these 3 points make it to the writer / director / producer's ears. Fix those 3 major issues, and it won't be a disaster. Though at this point, it may require another reboot. :\Enjoy the movie! Sigh.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
673,shirelleallen2001,"Bad Movie, Bad special Effects, Not Worthy.",1,30 April 2010,"This movie was awful. The script was weak. It was a sad knock off of the original Nightmare with less special effects. I see why Robert Englund wasn't in this movie. It wasn't worth it. I'm sooooo disappointed. I yawned more than anything and I wasn't scared not once. I really wanted this to be a good remake, but it wasn't. The special effects were 1980s at best. The acting was pretty good, but the script lacked originality and depth. The twist was stupid. I felt like I was watching the original Freddy only unscary, unfunny, and uninteresting.

But, lets go over what's wrong with this movie. **SPOILER WARNING AGAIN** 1) Freddy was not scary looking at all. His ""burns"" looked more like he was wearing his mothers pantie hose on his head with a run up the side. 2) Freddy's house. Non-existent. He actually lives in the basement of a day care. Really? This doesn't send a red flag to ANYONE?... 3) Overuse of the scraping of the blades together while ""stalking"" his prey. 4) Scraping his blades on pipes causing enough sparks to cause a fire. 5) His voice. Seriously. Take some lozenges. Froggy and monotone... 6) Leaving people alive to go kill someone else (in a dream). Seriously? In the middle of slicing someone up and you wanna go kill someone else?. 7) This one is trivial, but, during opening credits, they have it written in font on screen and written in chalk in the background so it's double-typed basically. Hmph. Okay, I can go on forever. Let's talk about what's RIGHT with the movie. 1) Kellan Lutz from New Moon got killed. Gotta love that. 2) Average looking chicks. Killers don't always go after Megan Fox hot type chicks. Sorry Hollywood. 3) Final Scene. The ONLY scene in the movie Freddy actually looked scary and evil. 4) It Ended.Way too much downtime.

Hopefully whoever is reading this will ignore them too and go see it for yourself. Remaking a classic like this, you can expect to get all the negative reviews. How can anyone live up to Robert Englund? You can't, he's Freddy. I was born in 1980 and grew up watching all the Nightmare on Elm Street's multiple times. It was my favorite horror movie. When I heard about the remake I was excited but still worried that they wouldn't do a good job and it would be the end of the franchise. I'm not worried now, the movie was great. At the end of the movie the whole theater was cheering. The only thing that worries me now is that people listen to these reviews from others who already go into the theater with the mindset of how does this compare with the original. Lets just say there was never an original and you just saw Freddy for the first time; this movie blows out any horror film in years by far.

677,Autch97,This Isn't Your Daddy's Freddy,7,30 April 2010,"I was 6-years-old when I saw the original Nightmare on Elm Street (NOES) back in '85 and since then I was a fan. My favorite nightmare films are in the following order: 3rd, 1st, New nightmare, The Remake, Freddy vs. Jason, 6th and the last 3-films are in the same pile-of-crap with the 4th being on top. NOES IMO isn't a ""great"" horror-film. Great horror-films are of the likes of The Exorcist, Dawn of the Dead (original), Jaws, Rosemary's Baby, IT, Poltergeist, Scream, and 28 Days/Weeks Later. One can find many things wrong with the original NOES such as the non-spectacular acting with the exception of Robert England, the poor special effects, the pizza-faced Freddy make-up. The film was scary when I watched it as a kid and it had a ""rawness"" to it especially with its synth-driven soundtrack. Nowadays NOES isn't very scary, but the entertainment value is there. The reason why NOES is still entertaining is because of Freddy; he is entertaining to watch. Freddy is the Sinatra of horror if there ever was one. The remake is truly a different direction for NOES. It's good in its own way and here is my breakdown of the movie: The Good: Jackie played a great Freddy, but he is a different Freddy from England's. He is very angry and very scary. I would rather meet England's Freddy in a dark alley than Jackie's; with England's Freddy I might die with a smile on my face, but with Jackie's I would die pissing in my pants. The imagery was great The special effects, with some exceptions, were good The young actors did a good job. Thomas Decker and Katie Cassidy did good jobs. I would have preferred them to play Nancy and Quentin instead of the other two actors. The Bad: The film relies too heavily on ""jump"" scare tactics, which gets annoying after a while. Jump scares aren't permanent scares and I'm sure the films scariness will wear-out after a few run-throughs. The best scary films continue to be scary for years such as the Exorcist and 28-Days-Later. I just hope for the sequels they rely less on the jump-scares and more on situational- or survival-type scariness. The Ugly: Let's just say Dean's demise was probably one of the most violent and gruesome deaths I've seen in a while.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Most remakes are horrible, like the 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho""... yuck! The new Elm Street has a totally different story line then the original 1984 release, as well as different characters. Again, this is a ""re-imagining"" so it is made from a different perspective.The new Freddy I feel is more scary then the original. Great make-up effects. Freddy's face looks more like burned human skin then the theatrical make-up from the original. I appreciate the story line getting more into detail as to what Freddy did to the children when he was alive and why the parents burned him alive... and how.My only negatives about the new Nightmare is Jackie Earl Haley's voice is identical to his voice for ""Rorschach"" in ""Watchmen"". Freddy's one-liners are kinda' dull and the ending was anti-climatic (one of the few pieces from the original that made it into this version).Please understand, before you go see this move, it is NOT a remake.

My fiancé wanted to see this movie. I THOUGHT I did too. There were several times throughout the movie that I laughed, thinking it was supposed to be comical. (Oops!) It was so cheesy. The acting was ridiculously bad. The ""death"" scenes weren't even a tiny bit scary-and I am a girl! The ""blood"" didn't really look like blood. The ""gore"" wasn't really gory.

He has a gaping hole in his cheek, and still has a big mouth area? Hmm. His voice made me laugh. I agree that he sounds like that weird Christian Bale-Batman gruff-whispering loudly voice. Weird. The volume goes way up when he speaks as well. The whole molestation thing is just gross. I understand that they wanted to explain the whole story, but was that necessary in all of the old NOES? Was there even any reason for Freddy to kill other than, they (unfortunately) just so happened to live on Elm Street? I can't remember Freddy needing a reason... and why would he?...

682,livinthedream92109,I have an issue with some of the content of this film.,3,3 May 2010,"The producers of this movie have been VERY careless with an extremely sensitive subject.scary movies can be fun. When done properly, they will give you that adrenaline rush that some will pay big bucks for. Sometimes the thoughts will haunt you for a few days and you feel yourself being paranoid about the aggressive character. I have no problem with that. But 'A Nightmare' has taken it to an entirely different level. The whole CHILD MOLESTATION and RAPE are topics that are WAY too real within our society to be carelessly thrown in the face of movie-goers without warning. Sexual abuse is much more common in America than most people realize. I bet YOU know someone personally who has been a victim, regardless of whether you're aware of it or not. It is a very traumatic experience that never leaves a person. It affects every aspect of their lives and touches every relationship they will ever have. The direct assault by another human being on such an intimate level leaves scars deeper than could ever be imagined. Most victims will never tell anyone but will instead internalize it, maybe even blame themselves. In either case, it eats them alive from the inside out. For someone who has been treated this way, it takes a lot of work to cope and move on. Great lengths are taken to avoid reliving the trauma. That is why it is so incredibly offensive for the producers of 'A Nightmare' to have carelessly thrown depictions of sexual abuse on the big screen without any hint of it in the trailers. The story has suddenly become based upon the sexual abuse of children. That wasn't in the original! The movie even shows a disfigured killer forcefully making intimate contact with a teenage girl, using one of the most cliché rapist phrases. An individual who has been a victim in the past and is moving on who goes to this movie with friends, expecting a good time, will suddenly be confronted with a vivid memory of what they have tried so hard to overcome. This can trigger an amazing amount of backlashes, relapses and other psychological harm. The producers of this movie have been VERY careless with an extremely sensitive subject. I find their inconsiderate content highly offensive and way too real for 2010. Murder is one thing, rape is an entirely different demon. Similarly, being frightened of a fictitious killer is one thing, being incessantly haunted by memories of the rapist(s) from your past is quite different. Those who made this film never considered the months of relived trauma and tens of thousands of dollars worth of therapy that some viewers will suffer through as a result. I would consider legal action against the writers, producers and director... I wonder if any viewers will commit suicide as a result of their awakened memories after seeing this piece of 'entertainment'.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

The new Freddy, I guess was kinda cool,but I felt it was a lame attempt to remake a great movie. A very lame attempt. Some attempts were made at humor (a key characteristics in any ""Nightmare..."" movies), but the writing was simply NOT FUNNY! I would suggest buying the DVD box set of the originals, rather then spending $20+ for you and a date to see this piece of garbage. Seriously, don't waste your time.

But then everything went downhill from there. The ""dream sequences"" seemed to all be very short (with the exception of a very few), which was very disappointing because that's the scariest part of Freddy movies to me. I mean anything can happen in a dream and I just didn't feel that they exploited that enough. There were a few sequences that made you jump in your seat, but overall I didn't think it was that scary. The sequence when Freddy is coming through the wall (just like in the original) over Nancy's bed looked stupid to me and I thought the original was better. The length was insufficient. It was only five minutes longer than the original, but it had all of the back story in it, so it felt like the whole movie was extremely rushed and choppy. On a positive note, I really liked Freddy's character. He's always evil, but in the original he was kind of playful and silly (sorry, but he was). I thought Jackie Earl Haley's Freddy was more sinister, scary and a lot more serious about getting revenge. There just wasn't enough of him in the movie to make it scary. They also left it open for a sequel (just like the original), and if they do make one, it had better be a ton scarier than this!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I would give it a 7. I think its worth giving a watch if u were a fan of the first, before Freddy became a comedian.. Definitely better than the ""Friday The 13th"" remake.Jackie Earle Haley i thought portrayed Freddy great in a much darker sense.Your not suppose to root for the bad guy =p... I liked his voice and also liked how realistic the makeup was. The other acting was average.. It was good enough to have a sequel for sure...Give it a chance, you wont be disappointed.. 2nd or 3rd best in the series imo......",A Nightmare on Elm Street

I admit, I had a hard time trying not to compare it to the original. To quote a review that I completely agree with: ""With its mess of a script, wasted potential, and questionable effects work, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is sadly disappointing and definitely not made for fans of the original."" ....so for anyone who is a fan of the original and thinking of going to see the new one - I would wait for it to come out on DVD @ Redbox - you'll only have wasted a buck",A Nightmare on Elm Street
690,jbluv2005,Stick To The Blueprint,5,8 May 2010,"First off, let me say that my ""out of 10"" vote is as high as it is, simply because I like Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. Do I think he was right for this role? No, not really. And I don't know whether or not that is because he literally did not fit the original mold of the Freddy we've come to know and fear, OR if it is because the character makeup seriously sucked.All in all, I really don't understand why ""remakes"" can't stick to the script. Of course, with technology being what it is today, some things can and will be different. But they should be better. If a remake is being done, NOTHING involving the plot line should be changed. Maybe a name, an outfit, night and/or day - but the major details in a story should not be substituted. And they definitely were in this new Nightmare on Elm Street - hence the movie falling miles short of its original.It's very annoying to see a person try to make a classic into his/her own. NO. NO. NO. It's details are the reason why it is a classic. If you're going to take a stab (literally) at remaking a milestone in American Horror History, do it right. For example, despite the original movie not being from America, The Ring was as successful as it was because (for the most part) it stuck to the script. The second (again, literally) it tried to go off and do its own thing, it got stupid - hence the hot mess we got with The Ring Two (American Version). Some filmmakers' arrogance is astounding. I really did have high hopes for this movie, but it fell short. Horrible acting, nonsense story lines - I was not feeling most of it, at all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
691,c-rees511,why wasn't robert englund cast as freddy krueger,4,9 May 2010,"this film is very average indeed , the whole thing is just made up of set pieces which aren't even jumpy whatsoever, and the bloke who plays freddy is nowhere near as good as robert englund in the originals , they should have just remade the first one scene by scene with him in and wes craven directing, there is some nice extra ideas in it with the scene with the gardener fred krueger being burnt which wasn't in the original but in the TV series freddys nightmares , but as this film is not bad it is far from being any good either , the murders are quite gruesome which is OK , and the scenes like the bed and bathtub like the originals r just OK nowhere near as good or memorable as the original , with freddy vs jason and the rehashed Friday the 13th being far better ,this seems like an opportunity wasted by being another average forgettable remake like clash of the titans .",A Nightmare on Elm Street
692,jakeandcarrie,really good,8,9 May 2010,"First, I have to start by saying that Wes Craven's original Nightmare was the only horror movie I ever liked.I've seen it a dozen times and was really excited that they re-made it. I circled the date on my calendar (literally) and definitely went in with really high expectations.Taking all of that into consideration ,I actually thought this re-make was really good.If it tells you anything,I went to see it 3 times in the first 4 days it was out.A lot of the reviews I read(and by a lot I mean about 99% of them)said that Jackie Earl Haley sucked compared to Robert Englund's original Freddy. It's probably unfair to say one played Freddy better than the other considering they were so different,but I definitely liked the new Freddy better. In my opinion, Englund's Freddy was just a little too funny for someone who was supposed to be a child rapist and a serial killer.Because he made you laugh as often as he creeped you out, combined with all the one-liners while he was killing people took away from the fact that he was the villain.Although the re-make gave Freddy a couple of jokes, you definitely didn't leave the theater thinking how funny he was and this was something I liked about it.Somebody said that they didn't like that the movie placed such an emphasis on Freddy's past as a child molester,but I think this made the new Freddy much more real and much more creepy. I also thought that going deeper into Freddy's back-story answered a lot question's the original movie left unanswered. Such as:1.Freddy's apparent obsession with Nancy2.Why Freddy was after these specific kids (the original did this too but not as well in my opinion)3.And Freddy's link with these specific kids.As for the other aspects of the movie aside from Freddy, I thought this one was much better.The special effects in this one were much better(this is no fault of the original obviously because it is almost 30 years old but it is still true).I thought there were more scary parts than the original and a deeper plot line.The fact that you didn't know whether Freddy was guilty or innocent for two-thirds of the movie added something new.When it comes to the flaws of the movie--the not so great acting in parts and some predictability in the sudden frights--I think they can be said about any horror movie.The re-make,in my opinion, preserved the most famous moments that made the original memorable.Kris (aka Tina in the original) being killed by an apparently invisible man while in bed with her boyfriend,Freddy's face pushing through Nancy's wall,Freddy's glove coming up between Nancy's legs in the bath tub,Nancy pulling out something of Freddy's from a dream,and Nancy seeing Kris (aka Tina)being dragged through the halls in a bloody body bag.For the major points, this remained true to the original and improved on the rest. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie and an upgrade from the old Nightmare.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

695,nupi_333,Another teen film,5,11 May 2010,"Personally, I am not fan of this type of teen films. I normally find them awful and this was probably no exception, but compared to other very teenie films I've seen in my life this is one of the best. The acting is not too bad, I almost believed that Krueger was a scary dude, although the voice ruined everything, whats with that voice? Kyle Gallner is a bit crap but luckily we don't see him that much, I was impressed by Rooney Mara who's acting is definitely good for this film, I think she could do something with a better film. The rest of them are just what I expected, rubbish! The narrative is not very imaginative, just another one by one with the cherry at the end, and why are the parents so stupid to think that 3 dead dudes in a row is just coincidence? Many things made me mad, like Freddies make up kept changing and I imagined him more gutty and disgusting... I should say it did, made me jump once, or maybe twice which kept me from leaving the screen. I also liked the music, its very tensional and will keep you in suspense. To be honest, I don't pay for remakes, and I definitely do not pay for teen horrors but I thought I give it a try, the fact that I didn't watch the original didn't tell me much and doesn't give me a vast background to comment on. The film itself is just another joke created for American teenagers who are smart enough to think that Freddie is coming for you. If you're up for this movies then you should definitely watch it because it might be the best around. If you're not for this movies and think you should give it a try I recommend not too, or wait for the DVD. Conclusion: Only to be handle with no care.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
696,zanee2003,Awful remake,1,13 May 2010,I have nothing against the director but this remake is not in any shape or form an original. Needless to say I think you need to hit the paper and write or read something that is worth making. This has been played out. I believe Wes Craven ended it when he made the New Nightmare cause he went to the point of reality. So no offense to you but it was kinda awful. I believe you have great music videos but cinema is just not your thing unless you make something original. Think about using all the music videos you have helped make and create a story from that. Imagine if all your videos collided into one another what kinda of story would they tell. Would they talk about themselves or how they wished they were in each others videos. Just an idea. Good luck on the next film whatever it may be.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
697,epic-reviews,A Nightmare On Remake Street,2,14 May 2010,"Freddy Krueger, a name which, in days gone by, struck fear into the minds of children worldwide and resulted in months of sleepless nights. I would know, I was one of them. 26 years after the release of the original iconic movie by the mastermind that is Wes Craven, Samuel Bayer, a relatively unknown in the movie world, attempts to retell the horrific tale in this 2010 remake. Unlike in many other attempted remakes, Bayer sticks very close to the original story, only differing very slightly at points in an attempt to bring the story up to date with modern life, unfortunately though, this could be its largest downfall.Looking at the movie on its own, it really isn't all that bad. The story has a good flow to it although as previously stated, it is very close to the original that made the franchise so famous. As with its predecessor, the story follows a group of high school teenagers who begin having the same recurring nightmare about a man called Freddy who is trying to kill them. After a few of the group are picked off in their sleep, the remaining members become very much aware of what is happening. Fighting a losing battle against both sleep and Krueger, the group attempt to find out what is going on and why. Eventually the group is whittled down to just two surviving members who eventually find out the truth about the chilling man baying for their blood. If you have seen the Craven version, you will know the ending; it is pretty much the same.The cast selected for the movie are also fairly solid. Haley, who plays Krueger, is simply a stunning actor and really attempts to make the character his own but still keep in tune with the original story. Unfortunately though, Haley has massive shoes to fill and I really doubt anyone could make a more convincing psychopath than that Robert Englund moulded Krueger into in the original. The supporting actors playing the teenagers are also fairly complacent. Everyone gave a solid performance throughout and in a way the film was convincing. The actors helped build the tension in scenes well and Haley added a different twist to his character which helped also a bit of comedy to parts of the movie, but it really was not enough to bring this up to par.Although I admire the nostalgia it was slightly disappointing watching the film, leaning over to my friends and openly discussing what is about to happen. There was simply no way to get over it, this remake is almost a carbon copy of the original with just some scenes altered to give it a fresh new look. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a good film but it simply is not in the same league as the first telling of the story. Looking at it as a single entity, this film would very much deserve a win, perhaps better, but it is impossible to overlook the fact that this is a remake and does not even come close to being as good as Wes Cravens masterpiece.Final verdict: Fail",A Nightmare on Elm Street
698,tommiegunn2,Not what I thought !,2,16 May 2010,"I was very unhappy with this movie when I went to see it last night . I have a 8 and 11 year old , and they actually went to sleep . Far as I'm concerned , nothing can outdo the original Freddy ! I didn't like this new Freddy at all . He didn't stay true to the original . He didn't have the originality of the true Freddy the way Freddy use to come into your dreams and take the things you love and your hobbies and use them against you . If you like trucks , Freddy would take your love of trucks into your dreams and use them to take you out , thus not only turning your dream into a nightmare , but feeling like your in hell ! This movie doesn't stack up at all to the original . It wasn't scary at all to me and didn't have anything about it that would stay with you and keep you thinking about what happened .

699,Brokenheart612,Complete insult to the original Freddy,1,19 May 2010,"Ever since I saw the very first Nightmare on Elmstreet movie, I have been a huge fan of Freddy. I have seen all 8 movies, including Freddy Vs. Jason, and it is by far my all time favorite horror movie, so naturally when I found out there was going to be a remake (even though I am not big on remakes) I HAD to go see it out of pure curiosity to see if it could live up to the standards of the original. I was extremely disappointed and actually angered by the new take on Freddy! Here is my hang up about the movie; Overall it wasn't horrible. The acting was good, the characters were believable, but the story itself was just boring and not pleasing. First thing: Freddy is a child MURDERER! OK! He was not a pedophile pervert with a whiny high pitched voice. He was sadistic, he was a psychopathic child killer, and whether he molested the kids or not was never said but either way he was a generally scary, vengeful, evil man with satanic spirit. The new Freddy was just some creepy jack-off who molested children and then let them go. He didn't murder any of them, he was not a psychopath, he was just a sick freak who no one was scared of except little defenseless children. The original Freddy was frightening! Also the original Freddy lived in a house and had a wife (that he killed) and a daughter (who was taken away from him which spiked him to start killing everyone else's children), he wasn't some weird gardener that lived in the basement of the school.Freddy had motive, Freddy was out for revenge for having his daughter taken away, Freddy was actually evil and sadistic. This new guy is nothing compared to the REAL Freddy.One last thing that bugged me about the movie is the dream sequences. I was expecting SO MUCH more with all the newer technology that we have now and basically felt like I was watching every other horror movie that comes out these days. There was NO creativity to it, none! The old ones were extremely out there and weird like dreams really are. The ones in this movie were basically them walking around in different scenes being chased by Freddy,. There was no oddness or dreamlike creatures or any kind of weird things growing out of their bodies or him screwing around with there senses or anything! I think this movie is a complete insult to the original and don't suggest anyone who appreciates Wes Craven's vision of the nightmare, or anyone in general, to go see this movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

701,baybeese,"NOE: A Tight, hard-edged movie. take it or leave it!",9,26 May 2010,"( this was written by my friend J.D. I am reprinting it with his permission. ) I think that Nightmare on Elm street is a compact, succinct telling of a really cool dark tale. No matter what else is said about it, it get's in and out of the story with very little exposition or drawn out boring parts. It ramps up the violence and intrigue really quickly and delivers the goods. It's comparable to a really tight rock record...like, Mob Rules or Slip It In. It gets in your face grabs you by the throat and screams at you and then knocks your lights out.That said, the characters have to be read into or projected onto to have much substance but screw it, who cares...who are these suburban waste-oids? Isn't that sort of the point? It's no great loss when they're gone. It's angry, an angry story to tell in the mid-80's world of consumer complacency and even angrier still in an age when we're at war and dying and people just sit on the computer all day and wish they were Paris Hilton or something.

703,tellen03,Worst Remake of all time!!,1,4 June 2010,I just watched this movie yesterday and I watched it for maybe 20 minutes. The acting was terrible! The new Freddie guy is horrible. Make up looks ridiculous and his voice sounds like a drunk man talking slowly. Everybody sounds like they are reading straight from a book with no emotion at all. I am a huge horror movie fan and I was really excited when they came out with this movie but after seeing it I was disappointed. I wouldn't waste your time. I am surprised to see they are releasing a second one in 2012. I mean this movie couldn't possibly have done well in theaters.

704,FreddyKruegerfanatic,Amazing Movie! Favorite movie of all time. Review from a Freddy Fanatic,10,4 June 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) was by far the best remake ever, and is my favorite movie EVER! I thought everything about this movie was good, I think every movie could use improvement including this one if i had to change anything it would be to speed up the beginning a little bit. Jackie Earle Haley did an amazing job as Freddy, some say that his face looked bad but it is more realistic, since they did study what a burn victim looks like i thought the realism was a good touch. Freddy's dialog was great, unlike the original he wasn't as cheesy, he had some pretty funny one-liners in this one which still gave him that funny sadistic personality. I really liked the micro-naps thing they added to this movie it was a really interesting and neat thing and it turned out to be for the better. There's a ton of debate over how in the remake Freddy is a molester not a murderer but what people don't realize is that in the original that was Wes Craven's idea but he thought people at that time wouldn't want to watch it if Freddy was a molester so they changed it, but it is still implied that he was one in the original series. The acting was pretty good in this movie I have to say i enjoyed it. There is one thing that bothered me in this movie and that is something very few people recognize and that is they have about two small scenes that are almost exact to scenes from Freddy Vs Jason, I kinda wish they would have changed that a little bit but its whatever. Effects were excellent in this movie, and good use of blood. There were quite a few of jump scares but I liked that about this movie because it was NOT just jump scares it had a lot of intense and tension built scenes through the movie. Overall I loved this movie, I am going to have to say I liked this more than the original, I don't care what people say beside the fact that Robert Englund was in the original what makes the original better? And really I like Jackie better. I have yet to find a solid reason for that. I give this movie a rating of 10 out of 10 and I would even give it a higher rating if i could.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
705,pravus-inc,Welcome to your new nightmare,9,5 June 2010,"Nobody can deny the huge impact that ANOES has had not only on the horror/slasher genre, but on the entire film industry. The recipe couldn't have been more simple or more effective. Unfortunately this recipe spawned some of the worst films that man has ever seen on screen ( no use to name them, you all have seen at least one), the teen slasher films. Without gorging further on this subject, let us return to this remake of 1984's A Nightmare On Elm street, directed by Samuel Bayer, written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer with original characters by none other than Wes Craven, produced by Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, with music by Steve Jablonsky and themes by Charles Bernstein.As I have seen so far, the majority of reviews here on IMDb split in two sides of the same coin : the ones that criticize the film as copying to much from the earlier movies, and the ones that state the opposite. In my opinion, both sides are wrong. When you read a book, or look at a painting, or watch a film, you, first of all, have to try and figure out the address the writer, director etc. tries to establish. By address I simply mean , who is the film/book etc. addressed to? Many useless misunderstandings followed when the address has not been clearly received by the audience. This film, wants neither to be totally different from its predecessors, nor a copy, so stop judging it because of that. This film wants to keep some essential aspects of the first movies, but in a more darker tone, more mature one (we all know that Wes Craven has his share of dark humor fine-printed throughout his motion pictures)focusing more on the untold (but implied) story, than the gory action. Its address is clearly set to fit the tastes of the unfamiliar with the ANOES audience, but also to hardcore fans. I for one got all I was hoping for: a fresh Freddy (8 films with the same actor, it kinda gets old, but I respect Robert Englund for supporting any new attempt at portraying the chaotic mastermind that Freddy is), some genius scenes from the first movie(like the one when Freddy comes from the walls etc.), and, last but not least, the fact that it does not center on the teens, as this type of film usually does; by that I mean : no more focusing on the libertine, sometimes depraved teenager lifestyle suddenly interrupted by a frustrated homecoming queen kind of killer, not to mention the fact that all those teens were downright stupid!! I can't believe who would pay to see some stupid teens running from left to right, hanging upside-down, killed by some tooth fairy..I mean c'mon people!. This film is very believable because these teens actually don't exist! What I mean is, as long as their history is practically unimportant for the 3/4 of the film, nobody really gets bored at seeing how they wet their diapers when they were 15 years old, or how dumb they are, screaming like hell for no reason. These teens actually seem normal to my eyes. Not knowing their past just makes it more interesting, and the killings more chaotic. I don't want to care about them, that's a huge cliché, I just want to keep guessing what's next.Another important factor of this film is its pace. It is flawless, non stop action. I adored the fact that you sometimes really can't tell if they are dreaming or awake, which is a huge plus for this series, congrats to the director and the art department.You just have to appreciate the work and imagination that went into this movie.If you think that these crimes aren't brutishly enough for you, than consult a specialist. In my opinion this film does not exaggerate one bit, because, as I have said, it focuses on the story, which is well logically driven. Steve Jablonsky's score fits in very good, it could have been more original as I can still distinguish some vague similarities to Graeme Revell's score for Freddy vs Jason, but nonetheless a good score; well timed, a little bit to obvious at times (but not that I complain). One of his best scores yet.Jackie Earle Haley was perfect in my opinion for the role of Freddy Krueger, not only because he has the looks, but because of the sheer intensity he has infused Freddy with. No longer a sloppy, cheerful homicidal maniac, but a cold blooded, contradictorily driven individual with a taste for innocent children. A new face that I think suites like a glove (a knife-fingered one if you wish)Wes Craven's original themes like the loss of innocence; this time, not through teen promiscuity, but by sheer demented pleasure of a legendary character who is about to get even more chaotic through his darker appearance and voice. His performance makes all the other members of the cast seem but peons which he plays them as he wills. Because of this, it's utterly pointless to try and analyze the others, although they fit in nicely with the address I was talking about earlier. They all are complete strangers to the audience, the only real character is Freddy, and it always has been, this is his show, so do not try and steal it from him, 'cause you then might be forced to lock your door (pun intended).Taking all of this in consideration I strongly suggest that you hit the theaters as soon as you can and enjoy(preferably choose to go late at night) this very fresh remake from Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes and co, you will surely not regret it, and even if you do, you will still have some nasty nightmares to try and control. Do not forget...one, two, Freddy's coming for you....",A Nightmare on Elm Street
706,Crazy-Jungle-Fetish,A Nightmare That End's In Sadness,10,6 September 2010,"After viewing this film numerous times, my opinion continues to rise and fall. Although i did enjoy this remake better than the Friday The 13th remake, this movie still needs a boatload of work. For starters, in this film everything is seems so predictable. You basically center on the exact same characters from the first, and everybody knows what order they die in. I mean COME ON Platinum Dunes, even the deaths are the same. Do you not have any originality, at all? *cough* NO! Then on top of a boring, emotionless NANCY, the new Krueger has been type casted as a pedo. Which is one of the downfalls in the film. No one wants to hear kids find out they were molested. Now on to the positives... First, the imagery and visuals are amazing. Very beautiful. Second, the effects and makeup of Krueger look magnificent. Robert would be proud. LOL. Also compared to the draft script, the re-shoots did some justice. Things play out better, but there are still plot holes, and lots of them.I could drag on, waste your time, and bore you to death, but i won't. Overall this film gets a 7 out of 10 in my eyes. Nice attempt but next time keep Jackie and let Wes Craven be director.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
707,deliveratetu,Despite of being a bad remake... it's a very bad movie.,1,2 August 2010,"OK, so, a lot of people are bashing this movie saying it's a bad remake, an unnecessary remake, that the original was a hundred times better, and so on. They are right, of course. We all know this remake doesn't even come closer to the original and it's totally unworthy. But let's forget it's a remake for a moment. Let's forget about the original Nightmare and let's take this as if it was an original movie. Let's get over the remake issue. If you do that you will realize this is a very bad movie. LOL. It is, it really is! The storyline seemed to be written by a 10 year old, not only for being a mess but also for being too stupid. The characters realize what's going on almost by divine inspiration, they never get to find out anything, they know everything instantly. And when they do that they don't go through any change. So, that sucks. There's no mystery at all and it's just not believable. And the characters are not really related, they are kind of wandering around. Nancy, the main character (I guess) spends half of the movie sitting on her bed drawing things. It's too lame. Now, the special effects. What where they thinking? It looks too fake, TOO FAKE! It's like a video clip instead of a movie. I didn't like the FX at all. The deaths were boring, the whole movie was boring and somewhere in the middle of the film you kind of forget what movie you were watching...and why. And Freddy is not scary at all, he's rather boring. And he seems to be bored himself and you feel like he doesn't even care and wants to go to sleep or something. It's a complete failure as a movie and the people who made it can't be called movie makers. They tried to do a good Freddy movie and that's the problem: they tried. They never thought they could do it. I would call this an amateur attempt of doing something... ¿scary? made by people who had no idea how to write a decent script or direct a good movie. Bad FX, bad acting, bad lighting and photography, bad direction, bad make up, bad script, no atmosphere, so sense. Don't bother watching this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
708,liam_jessup,put your time to better use and watch the original,4,12 November 2010,"Like most remakes these days..this one was god awful. Jackie Earle Haley did an alright job playing Freddy but no one will ever play Freddy better then Robert Englund. The thing that annoyed me the most was how they made him look, nothing really like the old Freddy and the voice...he used the same damn voice as he did playing Rorschach. I realize i'm comparing this allot to the original but inst that the point? it is a remake and I feel like they could of done a better job. And the actors, personally i think they weren't fantastic but they did alright I suppose. Overall I give it a 4, maybe 5 out of 10. I was very disappointed but after seeing the Friday the 13th remake I wasn't surprised honestly. With the new child's play movie in the works, I won't be keeping my hopes up for a descent remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
709,inventiveinsanity,Boo! I'm scary! and then a Freddy pops out!,1,28 October 2010,"This film is terrible.Let's start with the obvious, shall we? Every five minutes, this movie tries it's hardest to make you wet your pants with fear, it employs the ""skeleton in the cupboard technique"" which consists of waiting until everything goes quiet and then having the monster jump into frame and go ""OOGA BOOGA BOOGA!!""Note: being shocked isn't the same as being scared. Jumping is a reflex action and the heightened heart rate fades quickly, fear stays with you and bleeds into your dreams. A point this film should have made. It seems fitting, anyway.Aside from the rubbish directing that basically says ""skeleton 5 miles ahead!"" in every 'scary bit', and the mannequin-like acting, this film isn't even written well. It does what a lot of films try to do these days: shove 50 years of character history into your throats before the timer hits 10 seconds. With the original series it took us three films just to find out that Freddy was f'd up from the get-go, having been born from the constant buggery that his mother was given after being accidentally locked in an asylum for the criminally insane... No, really. That's what happened. Watch Part 3. But even this isn't as bad as Freddy himself was.Yep, even the big-bad was pants. His make-up alone was cruddy, making him look like an emotionless, half-melted Action Man rather than the depraved, skinless monster he's supposed to be. His one-liners were pretty weak, too. This doesn't seem to be a fault in the writing, according to IMDb Jackie Haley decided he was so amazing that he should improvise a lot of lines because somehow that made him scarier or... or something.I'm not even going to bother with the other problems.In short: this is a bad sequel, with bad acting, and bad writing, that ends in a boring fashion, with lame jump-scares containing dialogue no deeper than a spoon.Don't go and watch this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
710,bbjames84,The new Nightmare is just as frightening,10,9 September 2010,"The new ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" did not disappoint, I was a roller coaster of gore and fear that kept me and my date on the edge of our seats! The film carried through its story line by killing off protagonist after new protagonist until landing on the final heroes. Freddy was back and freakier than ever, no longer could you laugh off attempts to kill and maim like in many of the previous sequels. This time around Freddy had more than the jump factor to scare the audience, he really seemed to have a hold of these kids minds. One of the greatest attributes of the film were the dream sequences. Truly eerie were the times where not only the character had no idea that they were asleep but we as viewers were confused also. liked the nods back to the original but ultimately the new characters and twists were welcome changes. Personally, I thought the new film rocked, and hope they have a equally good sequel right around the corner!!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
711,sexydanny21,A Nightmare On Elm Street 2010 IS BEST REMAKE OF ALL TIME!,10,17 September 2010,First of all let just start out by saying not only is this a fantastic remake but its the best remake of all time! Now lets go back in time and take look back at original Freddy films shall we Part 1 is of course a true horror classic not just my eyes but everyones eyes. But of course some of sequels made Elm Street into a comedy rather then a true hardcore horror film which should be. For example by Elm Street 3 Freddy was killing boy wizards by Elm Street 4 Freddy was eating people off a pizza and by Elm Street 5 Freddy was turning a kids into a motorcycles! By Elm Street 6 Freddy Dead he was killing people with a Nintendo power glove WTF! Alright now now there was a few sequels that did keep Freddy dark such as Elm Street 2 and New Nightmare and Freddy Vs Jason all admit those were good but other sequels made into a comedy act. Now the 2010 Elm Street remake is amazing its sick twisted and everything a horror film show be the direction by Samuel Bayer is top notice it keeps edge seat screaming your head off. Now A Nightmare On Elm Street Remake grossed 116 million dollars making it self the second highest grossing Elm Street film out of the entire series so clearly I am not only fan who thinks remake is amazing! Jackie Earle Haley acting in this remake was amazing and even Robert himself supports the remake saying quote Jackie Earle Haley is one best actors to come along in last 50 years of film! So I say if your looking for a film that freaken scary and brings back true heart and soul of original go see this film its original with its concept of Micro Naps and acting is amazing! BEST REMAKE EVER MADE!,A Nightmare on Elm Street
712,davemorgan142008,The Best Remake So Far,7,24 September 2010,"I am a massive Freddy and NOES fan however barring the 1st and 3rd film the rest if we are being honest were awful it became more of a comedy and less of a horror and Freddy became a figure of fun. The remake has taken quite a bit from the original, I appreciate that they have made him darker, Freddy looks more like a burns victim however less scary and not too keen on his voice either. People are writing negative reviews based on the fact that Robert Englund does not play Freddy however Jackie Earle Haley does a brilliant job of reinventing the character. Let's think about the negative parts from the original that were just plain lame:- Freddy down the alley with giant arms. The Telephone with the tongue. The blood fountain coming from the bed. When Tina pulls off Freddys face and reveals a cackling skull. The drunk mother. The mother disappearing into the bed. Freddy vanishing after Nancy is mean to him. The Booby Traps. The car driving away at the end. And absolute worst of all the mother being sucked through the door window.I'm still a big fan of the original but I think all Freddy fans should realise that the original was not the greatest film. You know when you have a film from your childhood that you loved and you tell a friend about it, you watch it with them and are sorely disappointed, it's like that. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but before you review this film go back watch the original dropping the idolisation from 20 odd years ago and then maybe you will see it is a pretty good remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
713,dsegein,Sadly it was exactly what I expected from these guys....,1,2 October 2010,"I think that horror fans have given Platinum Dunes plenty of time to grow, but they just keep getting worse and worse with every movie. I was annoyed at there first few assaults on classic horror, but I justified it as them learning. However they don't learn. I was outraged when I saw Jason take off running like he was on the track team in the Friday the 13th Remake. I felt sick when I found out he had constructed a security system at crystal lake, and even more furious when I saw his underground layer, where he actually kept a prisoner.....However nothing could prepare me for the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. I knew it was going to be bad from the start, but since Jackie Earl Haley was involved and I am a fan of his work, I gave this one a chance. There was no suspenseful buildup, and within 5 minutes Freddy makes his first appearance showing that Platinum Dunes still hasn't learned the difference between suspense, and cheap meaningless shock value. After this things just keep getting worse. The ""Nancy"" character went from being a seemingly normal and innocent teen in the original, to being a closet lesbian in this film, while her boyfriend went from being played by Johnny Depp, to a weird lil emo guy who is constantly doing speed. The biggest thing that bothered me is, in the original Freddy Kruger was a child murderer. We all knew that he molested the children, but they didn't throw it in your face. In this movie, he is a child molester. While he was alive, he didn't even kill the kids. He just diddled them, and cut them a little with his glove....So instead of Freddy being a evil, child Killer...he's just a like a creepy uncle with a knife fetish.The most tragic thing in this movie though, is they didn't even have the common sense to really give Jackie Earl Haley a chance. Robert Englund had loads more Charisma, and the perfect voice to pull off his epic one liners in the 80's. When tried in the remake with Jackie Earl Haley's creepy Pedo voice, they just come off as making him seem even more like that dirty old man down the street. Everyone has complained about the makeup already, so I'll just say that I agree. It looked good on paper, but on screen it looked really bad.Now to the special effects. Seeing as this is Michael Bay's camp, I figured that even if the movie totally blew (Which it did), I'd at least be able to see amazing looking Dreamworld scenes.....denied. The only really cool effect comes from where she sinks into the blood, only to fall through the bottom completely clean in the bed, and that was even ""Standard"" special effects. Nothing even stood out as far as special effects go.I'll give it to Jackie Earl Haley. He did what he could, with what he was given. The fact is though, even Robert Englund couldn't have saved this one. Bad writing, bad direction, mediocre special effects and lack of imagination made this film nothing more than another extremely boring remake.Sometimes I think that Michael Bay is sitting in an office somewhere with a list of all the things from my childhood that I loved. I picture him scrolling over this list and asking himself ""So...which one to ruin next?"".Do yourself a favor and watch the original instead. Do not ruin what fond memories you have of Nightmare on Elm street with this boring remake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
714,LordJaja,It was OK.,5,9 October 2010,"I am a huge Freddy Krueger fan and when i saw this film for the first time, I was furious. I thought it was the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. I hated everything about it. I wanted to punch Michael Bay so hard.Then...I gave it some thought and realized that this will never top the original. It'll always be a crappy remake but I decided to watch it again but this time just suspend my disbelief and just go with it as just a movie.The movie was too fast, the character development was terrible but, I enjoyed it. Jackie Earle Hayley was a great Freddy, he did his best, and he brought some cool things to the new Freddy, like the claw twitch for example. This is a terrible remake, but it's an entertaining stand alone film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
715,cyberchris1976,This movie sucked!!!!!!,1,4 October 2010,"This movie f*#king sucked. They didn't even show the house on Elm Street! How is this a nightmare on Elm Street? It's more like a nightmare from preschool. Not only that but Freddy looks like he has some kind of retardation. I'm glad i didn't go the theater for this. It would have been a waste of money in my opinion. I rate this zero stars out of ten. It was nothing like the original. They completely trashed it. Dude who played Freddy was just horrible and way off. There were a few scenes from the original, but they were totally out of context. It was just a really really bad film over all. Could have been more gory for the rating. Expected a lot more out of it. I wasn't even scared. More like really bored. I do not recommend this movie to any horror film lovers at all.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
716,all_about_sandra,Sandra Hua,5,8 October 2010,"A Nightmare on Elm Street is a story about a group of high school students are killed one by one by a horribly disfigured killer, named Freddy Krueger, in their dreams. Freddy Krueger, is the biggest horror icon in this whole serial of films. His burned face, he wears a glove with four blades embedded in the fingers, his low and cool voice, his sweater, and his old fashioned hat are all contributed to build his horribly disfigured image. Though out the film, A few popular symbols are used; those symbols reflect the American's horror film cultural. For example, the main character, Nancy, draws paintings of one scary image, a man's face; these paintings are shown in a lot of scenes thought out the film. Another symbol is there are three little girls wearing white dresses without any face expression; they appeared few times in the film too. Paintings and little girls with white dresses are common symbols in American horror films, examples: Silent Hill, Orphan. In most of the cases, paintings are used when the main characters in the films are children, they paint to express their feelings and the paintings served as evidences of what they ""seen"" in reality. However, paintings are used differently in this A Nightmare on Film Street; first of all, Nancy is not a little girl, she is a teenage, she can talk with her friends to express her feelings; secondly, the paintings are not used as evidences to alert her parents that their daughter is dreaming straight things; instead, the mother in the film ignores her daughter's paintings, she knew Nancy is having nightmares and draws a lot of horribly images, but the mother has no response to all of these. I feel that the writers have done a terrible job in the story development of these little details. Industry analysts generally agree that the remark of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 is designed to reboot the serial's franchise. This American horror franchise consists of nine slasher films, a television show, novels, and comic books. This kind of Media Convergence, which allows cult fans to search the similar kinds of entertainment in different types of media. The first movie of this serial was introduced in 1984, the same year that I was born, just like many other young horror movie lovers, most of us have not seen the 1984 version of the film, and we are likely not going to judge on whether the new version of the story has improved or whether the director uses the same old scary elements in each scenes; as long as the film can impresses us, and gives us enough sensory stimulation, we will purchase the ticket. Although A Nightmare on Elm Street is a slasher film, but it also has some science fiction sense in it. The switches between dreams and reality are very straight forward in the narrative process perspective. As audience, we can tell when is in reality and when is in a dream. For example, there is a scene, when Nancy though she wakes up, but she actually is still in a dream, the way I can tell this is, the water drop in a cup was going up, instead it should be sliding down; when Nancy finally wakes up and the scene changed back to reality, the water drop is sliding down to the bottom of the cup, which represents it is the reality. This actually reminds me of another Sci-Fi film, Inception, where Leonardo DiCaprio relies on using a spinning top to figure out whether he is in a dream, or in the reality. A Nightmare on Elm Street is both a Slasher and Cult film. It is a Slasher film because it ""involving a psychopathic killer stalking, and killing a sequence of victims in a graphically violent manner, often with a cutting tool,"" (Wikipedia, 2010) in this case, it is a glove with four blades embedded in the fingers. It is also a cult film, because it has a specific group of fans, who are highly devoted to the A Nightmare on Elm Street serial. As a first time viewer of this film, I do not think it attracts or convinces me to watch the next film of the same serial. Reasons for this are: firstly, I think the writers have used many American's horror film cultural symbols, but they are not connecting to the story, examples: Nancy's paintings and the three little girls wearing white dresses. Secondly, the scary points are not scary at all, they failed to impress me; for example, there is a scene, where Nancy is hiding away from Freddy in a closet, and it turns out that Freddy was standing in the closet besides her. Does this sound familiar? Lastly, even though the writers have left some unexplained points throughout the film intended to leave an undeveloped story for future films of the serial. However, the ideal of a person's inability to control his/her beliefs causes insomnia, sounds unattractive to me, so I will not likely to go see the next A Nightmare on Elm Street unless Leonardo DiCaprio invents me to go with him.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
717,ed-remaly,Great pull back from the 'goofy' Freddy,9,8 October 2010,"Being a fan of all these manner of movies (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street) I was worried about the re-make. As the movies progressed before, Freddy went from supernaturally frightening to the equivalent of a class clown who happened to kill people; a gruesome comedian. The killing he did seemed to mandate a moronic one liner at the end (""nice hearing from ya Carlos"").So I settled down and watched this re-make and I enjoyed it immensely. It features a darker and more manipulative Freddy which I appreciated. The CGI did not detract from the film for me but made the dream sequences more interesting. The actors and actresses playing the kids / victims did lack any real depth or development but I never watched slasher films looking for the next Oscar performance anyways.I enjoyed the more severe look of Freddy and his darkly obsessive nature. The details about his crimes personally brought him back to where he was supposed to be from the original film as a ruthless and unsympathetic villain, not the pop icon that ate souls turned into meatballs off of pizza (Nightmare on elm street 4 : The Dream Master). There could have been a higher body count for my liking but I was satisfied with the carnage. It wasn't as creative as where the Nightmare series left off but that also reduced the need for stupid humor being injected into a situation that was supposed to be brutal and uncomfortable (almost like a dead child molester is back as a supernatural being killing people, not like Bozo the clown is coming for you to make people laugh at the humorous way in which you will be dispatched). One of the reasons why I always liked Jason from Friday the 13th a little more: he always seemed straight to the point and murdered with whatever happened to be on-hand.Haley played it very well in my opinion; dark, disturbing and motivated. It re-invigorated my love for the concept, which was always fascinating and terrifying, while returning it to the creepier tone that made me fall in love with it in the first place.With a better depth of acting from the supporting cast I hope they make more with Haley. This made me a fan again and I would recommend it to those people who have a true love for the classic, pre-icon Freddy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

It does seem to be the same. If Rob played freddy then the movie would be better. He don't look the same or sound similar to Rob. It just ain't the same with out rob.

It's full with suspense and a hint of romance, and it's one of the best horror movies I've seen.It's certainly not the original, which I guess is why many people don't like it. I think that a lot of people get so attached to the first one that they hate the original because it's so different. But wake up: It's a remake and it's supposed to be different. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the fact they included a Twilight actor in it (Kellan Lutz) for a small part.

In this film teenagers that live on the same street are haunted by their dreams. The five teenagers seem to have nothing in common other than their ages and their dreams. The man in their dreams Freddy (Jackie Haley) is fueled by their fear. Quentin (Kyle Gallner) and Nancy (Rooney Mara), together find that they all may have more in common than they thought. And together they should fight this horrible dream walker to keep him from killing anyone else. Nightmare on Elm Street is structured around fear and horror. This specialized emotional effect that the film creates will keep you on the edge of your seat with your feet up and tucked away. A Nightmare on Elm Street will also have you afraid to close your eyes. Nancy's mother Gwen (Connie Britton) knows more than she wants to admit but finally breaks down and tells Nancy and Quentin of the gardener at the preschool that they had attended together. The gardener Fred Krueger hurt the children of the preschool after gaining the confidence of the children and parents. Nancy and Quentin set out to find more about Fred and what really happened to him. They find that he did horrible things to them and the other children of the preschool and their parents took matters into their own hands. During their explorations they fall in and out of consciousness a result of not sleeping. And find that they have the ability to pull Freddy into their world. So together Nancy and Quentin form a plan to pull Freddy through and kill him in reality so he can not hurt anyone ever again. But as we see in many horror movies such as Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees the Hockey mask wearing, machete toting slasher, sometimes we may think their dead but they keep coming back for more blood. In this version of Nightmare on Elm Street Freddy Krueger's make-up is more realistic than is predecessors. The setting of this film is good the street is dimly lit at appropriate times. The scenes that take place in the furnace room where Freddy met his demise is just right the lighting is neutral and the fire is brutal. It gives you the sense of really being there in his hell.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
721,jwilliamholmes,Disappointing Attempt at Reinvisioning,3,1 May 2011,"I was severely disappointed by this attempt at Nightmare on Elm Street.Acting: Look at the actors. None of them show any depth or development. They remain static throughout the movie. They switch between three emotions: Tired, Sad, Scared. And that's it. Haley does a decent job at Freddy, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the cast.Plot: It follows a horrendously overused plot line in horror movies. Introductory murder, funeral at which all of the friends of the dead are present (where you can easily pick out who is and isn't going to be murdered), and then the characters begin to get picked off one by one, the survivors try searching for the motive of the killer/how to defeat him, and they do. Supposedly.Effects: I expected better special effects from this movie. Remember back to the death of Glen from the original. That was an astounding death scene, especially since it was made in 1984 and didn't have all of what we have today. But the death scenes in this movie were lacking in spectacle I came to expect from the series. You have to realize that the deaths are happening in dreams, so essentially, anything was possible. Wes Craven realized this in his directing and it was apparent. The death with the most spectacle was Jesse's and even that was lacking.Scares: This is where the movie really fell off for me. They didn't make any effort to make the scares feel fresh. After seeing Freddy appear next to his victim after a period of silence too many times in an hour and forty-five minutes desensitized me from the scare factor. Quickly. Honestly, I find a scary soundtrack to be more effective than dead silence.Overall, I was really disappointed by this movie. I knew that it wasn't going to be as good as the original, but I expected more than I got.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

Of the reviews I've read on this movie I haven't seen one that likes the changes and I have to say that I agree completely with them. This is the first time I've seen a Freddy Krueger that seemed to have downs syndrome. The live Freddy was scarier than the dead one. When they decided to change actors they killed this movie. No one will ever replace Robert Englund.I do think there were a few things about this movie that made for an improvement but they are overshadowed by the bad. I don't mind cgi but even with cgi the kills seemed pretty lame. When I saw the original at the age of 8 i couldn't sleep that night. When i saw this one i could hardly stay awake. I didn't love every Freddy movie but they were at least entertaining. This one was just frustrating. From the bad makeup to the new ""scary"" voice and lets not forget about the lack of personality in the new Krueger. This movie was a bust.

Freddy Krueger is like Santa Claus, everyone knows about him. In the new NOES we see a lot of blood, an attempt at cool one-liners (end up being cheesy one-liners), and poor CGI. In some of the movie, you can see little green dots on the side of the burnt weasel's face. The old NOES were a ton better, the old Freddy looked cooler, sounded cooler, and was certainly more bad to the bone as compared to this Freddy, who just kills his victims and gets it over with instead of the normal Freddy Krueger who plays with and teases his victims. The characters name's are the same as the 1984 NOES and the same basic events happen as well. In fact, when Kris gets flung about in the bedroom, it is almost exactly the same as the old NOES - the only difference is, the old NOES was actually bloodier. So sure, if you want to buy this movie and BD or DVD and already have the old one, you are wasting your money, because in little letters on the back of the case of the new NOES DVD, they should have ""1984 NOES Copy Cat"".

I liked it, wasn't expecting to either. There was only accouple things that they coulda changed to make me like it more. Like get someone else to play Freddy and change the way he looks (face). Omg his voice was so annoying, and the fact that they changed the noise that his knives made when scraping it on metal. But the BIG thing that almost ruined it for me was that they made Freddy go from a feared killer for the thrill to a PERVERT!!! wut the h*ll!!! that made me mad! Also it wasn't as suspenseful and creepy as the originals. But other then that it was worth the watch, the graphics and stuff was good. so ya its worth the watch but don't expect to love it... specially if your a big fan of the originals.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
729,harrit10,Nightmare on Elm Street Review,3,6 February 2011,"This movie was not like the original Nightmare on Elm Steet. My expectations for this movie were set very high, and yet I was let down. In the original movie Freddy Kruger was set free from a judge after murdering children with a gloved hand that had knives in it (A Nightmare on Elm Street, 1984). In the new movie Freddie is killing the kids that went to the daycare that he worked at. The reason for the killings is because they told on him for the horrible things that he did to them. If your going to re-make a movie, them it needs to stay like the original. While Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the best movies, this re-make is not the best. Plus how can the movie be great when the original Freddie (Robert Englund) isn't even in the movie. He is the actor who made the movies what they are.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
730,wilsoa13,Remake of the classic horror movie.,4,29 April 2011,"The Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) Freddy Krueger is revamped in this 2010 horror movie starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger. Rooney Mara plays Nancy Holbrook, Quentin Smith played by Kyle Gallner. Together Nancy and Quentin must stay awake long enough to find a way to destroy Freddy.Several teens in a small Mid Eastern town are being killed in their dreams. The attacker is a man with a four –bladed, glove hand. When they fall asleep Freddy is waiting to torment the teens. If the teens die in their sleep they die for real.This movie shows the traumatic experience of adolescence in connection with a threatening sexual event. Freddy Krueger is a child molester in this film before he is killed by the parents of the molested children.Nancy and Quentin's friends have been killed in their sleep. They are having the same dream about Freddy. They are trying to stay awake to find a way to destroy Freddy before he kills them. In their pursuit to stay awake they research the cause of Freddy's continuing torment of the teens. They find out that he is killing them for revenge. They had told the truth about his acts of molesting them. Nancy and Quentin, while trying to deal with the memories of what Freddy did to them, are running from him and the truth of what he did. It's not till they are completely exhausted and shown proof of his deeds that Nancy decided to confront Freddy in his world. She brings him into the real world to kill him. By seeing the proof of what Freddy did to them they now must deal with the situation.The editor did a great job with the flow of this film. The transition from the waking world to the dream world in this film was flawless. The use of micro-naps allowed the filmmakers to blur the line between reality and the dream world. There's a scene where Nancy and Quentin confronted Quentin's dad at the high school, about how they killed Freddy. They leave his office and are walking down the hallway when Nancy hears Freddy's voice. Nancy stops and looks down the hall way and see's the bloody body of her friend that was killed. It appears as if Nancy is awake but she's half asleep, she's pulled out of this micro-nap by Quentin. This use of micro-naps blurs the line of waking and dreaming. There was one other scene where the use of micro-naps was utilized well to bring Freddy in. It was when Nancy is in the convenient store looking for Quentin and she sees Freddy at the entrance. Nancy grabs Freddy's sweater and at the same time, Quentin pulls her out of the mini nap; thus Nancy is able to pull a piece of his sweater into the waking world. The actors were cast appropriately. Rooney Mara does an excellent job portraying Nancy as a socially awkward girl, who is distant from her parents and other students. Jackie did a great job showing Freddy's incredible malevolence and anger with a hint of vulnerability. It was terrific to watch Kyle ability to show Quentin as a mess and more jittery then Nancy due to all the pharmaceuticals he was taking to stay awake.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

732,dinosaur-holocaust,Who's going to kill Michael Bay already?,1,1 December 2011,"As you can see by reading any of the other reviews for A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) was a terrible film. The issue that nobody's addressed, however, is that there was no way that this could possibly be good. The deck was stacked against it from the beginning.First off, it is a remake of an American horror film, which already paints it into a pretty ugly corner, where the Maverick Auteur of the genre is Rob Zombie. It follows the tried and true formula of the American Horror Remake, pioneered by Michael Bay: Music video director, no- name cast (except the guy who played Freddy in this case), big budget (but not huge enough to do anything really interesting), new ""darker"" (not scarier) look, lots of jump scares, and a script that sticks very close to the original, bringing nothing new to the table except more exposition. Some aspects of this formula should work fine, in fact many of the best horror films are first features with no-name casts (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead). The other aspects of the formula are much less forgiving. The overly dark atmosphere of these films seldom plays to their advantage, as most of the originals had scenes with comedic relief, and in the case of the original Nightmare, took place in a very bright, colourful, idyllic suburb, which made both a bigger contrast between the dark nightmares, and created more realistic and dynamic characters. A good horror movie shouldn't just take something scary and run with it (ie. Nightmares), but take something normal (ie. going to sleep, suburbia) and make it terrifying. The other reason the ""darker re-imagining"" doesn't work is the same reason the other Freddy films became campy. What makes a horror flick work is the fear of the unknown, and once the character becomes as well known as Freddy Kruger people know what to expect. If almost any of the sequels had been the first film in the series they would have been much scarier than they were as sequels because it would have been a new concept. As a child I saw the Simpsons parody of nightmare on elm street before I saw the original, and was terrified of that because it was still a scary idea, and I had never seen it before. With horror sequels it is almost inevitable that they descend into camp when they reuse a pre-established idea, and they can either roll with it, trying to up the ante with increasingly extreme variations on the original (like the Nightmare sequels), or resist it, and try to scare you again with the same old stuff (the remake).As far as the much maligned reliance on jump scares goes, they can work effectively if they're used sparingly, but they become monotonous after a while, and at the end of the day, nobody gets scared of somebody jumping out of nowhere with loud music suddenly coming on after they leave the theatre.The most puzzling part of all of these remakes, is the amount of time devoted to exposition. It should be assumed that even people who've never seen a nightmare on elm street film should know what it's about walking into it, but for some reason they always find it necessary to spend the entire first half of the movie explaining what's happening. The only way to keep a remake like this interesting while sticking so closely to the plot, is to play on what the audience already knows and expects (ie, the 90s night of the living dead remake), not explain it to them.On a positive note, this is the last truly classic horror film left to be remade, unless someone has the balls to redo The Shining, or out of formality makes an official Exorcist remake, instead of just ripping it off and using a different title.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
733,nativefl75,Very very poor remake,1,23 September 2011,"I first off have to say being a kid in the early 80's I loved all the great horror films of that time. Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Hellraiser, etc. The Nightmare on Elm Street was a scary movie for kids and Robert Englund was definitely on top of his game in the day. This remake of that wonderful horror has in my opinion failed to capture the true storyline that was Nightmare on Elm Street. Of course there are many faults to the original film as in the 80's, limitations for technology, hand made sets and no computer graphics to aid in development. With all of this being said it is a shame that in today's computer generated films the makers could not deliver on more graphics and story line. I was confused as the movie seemed out of sequence from the original and the characters seemed to have had a different past with Freddy having a different motive also. In my opinion the re creators of this film should not try to remake any more already once great films. As it stands in my opinion the only one to successfully pull off a remake is Rob Zombie's Halloween. I suspect if he had gotten the chance to remake this one, it would have been one that would have been bragged about. In all, this is poorly redone and I hope to never witness such a tragedy again!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
734,chefangela03,A good Solid Remake,7,29 April 2010,"OK, so everyone wants to hate this movie. I know for me, a lover of the 1984 Original, I wanted to be scared, impressed and hopefully a little nauseated. I knew plenty about the actors, and was especially interested in seeing Jakie Earl Hayley parlay his Watchmen clout to this awesome story. I thought he did an amazing job. I would definitely say his performance was the best in the film. I think the thing people forget is that Freddy was not this campy, one-liner character until movies 3-7, or however many there are. Wes Craven's original character was frightening, powerful and a little gross. The remake captured this perfectly! People are complaining about Freddy's back story. Hey guys, if anyone has seen interview's with Wes Craven, they know that he had intended for Freddy to be THIS kind of monster. Agreeably today's censors are more liberal than those from the 80's, but yes, Craven intended him to be a monster of the most disturbing order. I had the unique experience to be attendance at the Hollywood Premiere...it was awesome and there was a lot of screaming and very little if any groans...do yourself a favor, see this movie and get the wind scared out of you!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

For it to be a remake I believe this movie is decent and has great acting and effects. Do not get me wrong Robert Englund will always be Freddy Krueger. He did a fantastic job, I have seen it for myself when Freddy vs. Jason was released. This movie worked for me as horror fan. Jackie did a great job as the iconic horror villain. The storyline made sense as well, and I am still questioning why this movie received negative reviews. The ending was cool how Freddy was pulled back into reality to be killed. It goes to show his immortality in the dream world and his vulnerability in the real world of the living. They did that in Freddy vs. Jason as well, but somehow Freddy tends to stay alive as we see in the end.",A Nightmare on Elm Street

740,nautilus1186,A Solid Re-Imagining,6,3 May 2010,"I had a strong feeling this film was going to be the stand-out ""remake"" of all the horror remakes so far, and I was right. I think the main reason was the cast - assembled here are some very talented, if ""lesser-known"" actors, all of whom have established themselves in great works so far (except Mara, who I swear I've seen before, but I can't find out where). I think the casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy was a genius move, and his role as Freddy, both dead and alive, is near perfect. I loved his mix of terrifying and sadistically comedic (admittedly, some of the one-liners did seem a bit out-of-place). Katie Cassidy proved herself to me in the mini-series ""Harper's Island"", which was fantastic. Thomas Dekker did very well in multiple previous roles, including the short-lived Sarah Connor Chronicles. Kyle Gallner outshines in everything he does, and really does look like he belongs in the horror/suspense genre based on his performances. Overall, the movie does rely on a lot of ""JUMPS"" and startles (some of which I thought were unnecessary), than it does with psychological, disturbing scenes of horror, which I would imagine a ""dream-killer"" would be...but I'm going to say that had something to do with Michael Bay producing. Sam Bayer, the director, has done some pretty good stuff with his music videos, and I like him, and his vision, a lot. I could definitely feel his touch on this film, but I felt like he could have done a lot more of a visionary, personalized film...especially with someone as ethereal as Freddy Krueger. I struggled with the rating of this a lot, but decided against the extra star because of this reason: I felt Bayer's touch could have shown through a lot more. I did really enjoy this movie, don't get me wrong, it still was the best of the classic horror re-imaginings thus far. I wish the characters of the kids were developed a bit more. The pace felt a bit rushed and the kids could have been fleshed out more completely before they were LITERALLY fleshed-out by Freddy. That is why this film receives a solid six stars from me.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
741,rubidoo,The Crispy Muppet Show 2010,1,8 June 2010,"It's a travesty. The disgustingly brilliant franchise, kiddie killer and nightmare slasher, that is Fred Krueger, has been resurrected as a rubbish sock face, a melted gimp, a burnt puppet. They used CGI to do the groping, stretching wall shot, I mean, the 80's latex looked nasty, but the CGI looked silly, like something out of a Disney movie.Why, when the opportunity came to remake a dark, near humourless film, they chose a non-horror director to do it? Samuel Bayer does pop videos. It shows. In the 1984 original , Nancy's mother takes her down to the cellar and tells her gently and chillingly, what the parents had to do to Fred Krueger, how they chased him to a deserted warehouse and set fire to him; it's a sick and awesomely dark scene, and scarier than the actual killing they show in 2010. In 2010, we find out how thick the Elm Street parents really are, that when they chase and kill him, they are not drive by grief and revulsion as the '84 film suggests, but almost as if there ain't much to do of an evening than set fire to someone who has niggled them a bit. Nancy's mum in 2010 describes the discovery of Krueger's violence to their young children as, 'things started to happen' and we see a flash-back of a little kid's back with razor marks across it - 'things'you say? In the remake, the dads and mums stand outside the warehouse looking at the petrol cans, humming and hawing, as if they are deciding whether to pack the fried chicken or pepperoni pizza, which is just what new Freddie resembles, for a picnic. There's no chills, no horror, no sense that something sick is about to happen. When Freddie is trapped in the warehouse and it starts to burn, he tears open his jacket, and thrusts out his chest like Superman, revealing the red and green sweater. A monster is born! More like Kermit the Frog with a claw, or a chewed up Fraggle in a stripy top.I was bellowing with laughter in the cinema, while a few seats along a man was watching You Tube clips on his phone, and a few seats back, someone had killed them self. I know in the '84 original there were a few goofs and there's that bit at the end, where Nancy's mum gets yanked through a tiny window, and they use a dummy for that brief shot of her being pulled in, but it was still a chilling film. The actors were all remote and slightly heroic, in the remake they remind you of every teenage brat in every teenage movie, and you want them to die. '84 Fred had a nasty, sharp shaped face, new Fred has no chin in all senses of the phrase, he looks like something of C-Beebies, in fact, I'd have more jumps watching Sesame Street. I don't know why the makers of 2010 didn't just get the Cookie Monster and stick some razors on his fingers, and puppeteer him around a few boiler rooms after screaming teen-brats. The original Fred was pure evil, but you know you can kick 2010's head in, and take his razor glove and jam it up his deep fried crack.

All of those 90's grunge/post-grunge bands owe him a debt of gratitude for making them all look cool. He does the same here with the Freddie character.

746,ChrisBG,Another lifeless film from Platinum Dunes filled with jump scares and not much else.,5,14 May 2010,"Extremely average film.Hard to believe this film shares the same title as a classic horror film. This is a truly average film. Before you jump at me for being a Freddy fanboy, I am not. Let's get this out of the way first - the fact that Robert Englund isn't in this movie is not the reason why this film sucks. Robert is great, of course, and he plays a much, much better Freddy than in this film. But that really is the least of this films problems.Listening to Director Samuel Bayer in a few interviews, I had to cringe. The guy obviously has no idea about what makes a good film, and this has to be perhaps one of the most poorly directed major studio films in a while. It is obvious Samuel Bayer comes from a background in music videos. So obvious that in fact this film is basically shot and cut like one...or a TV series/drama.There is no on going tension. No scene dynamics. So whenever it looks like something good might happen - it just falls to pieces. This is how they shot this film - basic coverage, nothing more-- and then time in the editing room cutting it together. Most of the scenes go like this: Establishing shot. Cut to medium. Cut to close ups. Very occasional extra shot. No motivated shots. Cut. End scene. A few wasted tracking shots here and there but seriously nothing dramatically motivated. This is poor directing 101.Poor Samuel basically got raped by the studios in this future coffee holder. They needed someone to push around so who better to get than someone who's never made a film before! YAY! As soon as I heard him say ""I'm a fan of Michael Bay"" I knew this was going to be terrible. It's sad too, because Wes Craven is so passionate about his original film, that by the way, was made for under 2 million.Platinum Dunes just came in, spat all over it. Disregarded most of the subtext of the original film. No drama whatsoever. One jump scare after another. Here's how the film goes: Jump scare. Some plot. Jump scare. Some plot. Jump Scare. Some plot. Some plot. Jump Scare. Some plot. Falling asleep now...Jump scare. Oh, back awake. Third act, jump scare, some plot.This film tried to bring in some of the original ideas and scares of the original, unfortunately it was embarrassing how bad they failed at this. The thing is - you can't just bring in ideas and expect them to work in any context. For example, the bathtub scene in this film (as seen in the trailer) is horrible. Just awful. No tension whatsoever. Again, Samuel Bayer has no idea how scene dynamics work.The acting was bland for the most part. Kris was extremely boring, and the guys in the diner were too, I was waiting for them to die. Kris' character seemed thirty years old. It doesn't matter that she's only 23, or whatever, she didn't LOOK like a High School student. And that's what is important. Nancy and Quentin's actors delivered decent performances, but it was just that -- decent. They're talented actors but in the hands of Samuel Bayer, they're just mediocre.You can't expect someone who's biggest direction to date would have been ""look hotter"" to suddenly be able to direct decent performances. But whatever.Jackie Earle Haley was pretty good considering what he had to work with - basically nothing. The times he was on screen, he was masked in Close ups, I think they were conscious of giving him wide shots due to his height, but unfortunately it made him seem like he was doing absolutely nothing but walking from one mark to the next. Absolutely terrible for this character who in the original moved around with such drama.Score was average. Extremely forgettable. They chucked in a tiny hint of Charles Bernsteins original theme but only a little tiny bit. The rest is generic BS, a few chord progressions with some strings, some high strings, some booming percussion, but nothing clever or even emotive, minus the opening track which was nice. In the composers defence, the film was poorly shot and cut dynamically, so there wasn't a lot of room to work with, even though this IS a feature film.Script was alright. Just your average Hollywood blockbuster script, that's had one too many suggestions by the studio and producers. Not terrible, not great. Just meh. I think it's just sad that they turned a film about dreams, the subconscious, the blur between dreams and reality...into a film about a burnt cat walking around slashing people. This is how the dream sequences go, literally: ""We're in a dream, we're in a dream, oh cut, back to reality!"". No blurring. No exploring the concept any further than ""Dream, cut, dream, cut"".The original as I said was made for less than 2 million, and most of the effects held up fine then. It's actually shocking how this new version did not really improve on anything other than making the dialogue and ""mood"" a little more realistic to the present time.Is it scarier? No. Is it scary at all? No. All they did here was make parts of the film quiet, and then basically just play loud, ultra compressed noises and score in the jumpy bits. And sometimes you jump, 'cause it's so damn loud. But it's not freaky. And again it comes down to the directors lack of understanding of how horror films work - how scene dynamics play, how audiences respond. What subtext is. What dreams are all about. Everything. It's embarrassing how average this film is. Nightmare on Elm St doesn't deserve to be spat on like this.As far as I'm concerned, the only molesters around here are the guys in Platinum Dunes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
747,mstanek-826-155137,A Nightmare on Elm Street is just another tasteless slasher film.,2,24 October 2013,"WARNING: mild spoilers. I love Halloween and the films that build up to it. The barrage of gruesome monsters and killers combined with the nippy weather makes for a unique combination that no other season can follow up. I had wanted to see ""A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)"" for a while so last weekend I sat down and gave it a whirl and I must say it ruined my night. First off the acting is awful. I have literally seen better acting on the Disney channel (yes I occasionally watch The Disney Channel, back off). A decent actor in films like ""The Watchmen"" and ""Shutter Island"" Jacky Earl Haley (Freddy Krueger) gives a performance that is way over the top. Not once did I cringe when he was on the screen because he was achingly predictable. I won't even go into detail about the rest of the cast because the characters are paper thin. Even if they put up decent performances it wouldn't have shown.The plot is not exciting. Literally it is a giant setup for killing people (because that's what horror is about now). There is no hope for anybody, Freddy is unstoppable. Every death in the film is predictable if not relieving. I know it's messed up but I felt the film got stronger with every death (the less unnecessary characters the better right?). There is way too much blood and not enough substance; substance being good character development, meaty dialogue, and class. As far as directing goes Samuel Bayer does nothing special. There is not a single shot in this film that draws the viewer in. As I watched, I simply felt that all Bayer did was try to scare me with extremely predictable Freddy pop-out sequences. Combine this with shaky camera-work, extremely basic establishing shots, and a: ""I just want you to follow the story"" mentality and you have a film experience that is neither exciting nor redeeming in any way. If you want to see a slash movie that wastes about an hour of your life, go see ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" If you want to see a good horror movie that actually has creativity, purpose, and genuine frights look elsewhere. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" fails on all levels, also failing to live up to the original of the 1980's. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is just another horror film that lacks that certain EVERYTHING.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
748,Raziel101326198,"New Nightmare for a new generation, which for the most part is a good one",8,30 April 2010,"I know this seems out of the realm of conception for most Freddy fans, but this remake does not suck and does not tarnish the sanctity of the original series.What we get is a different history for the the teenagers, a different Freddy, an extra teenager we didn't have in the original, and a different Nancy with a different last name. Honestly, she seems to be a combination of Nancy from the original and Alice from the later sequels.I'm actually glad they decided to upgrade Freddy to the extreme that he is in this movie, since it gives him a closer attachment to the teenagers and now they don't just seems like teens that just got the bad luck of growing up in this town that Freddy lived in, and at the start of the movie he just chooses to go after them just because they live there and are still just teens.The actors and actresses all do a good job with what they are given, with Haley as Freddy really the only standout portrayal. Mara as Nancy, while not as good with her role as Haley is with his, is still good and gives some substance as a outsider who still has friends. All the others play their roles with at least some effort and don't appear to be just going through the motions. As always, its nice to see Clancy Brown perform in his role.The visuals are a treat. The constant switching between environments during the ""micro naps"" looked awesome and was a nice addition to pump up the notion that escaping from Freddy is impossible. The lighting changes between reality and dreams where also nice to see.So, given a chance, this new Nightmare (Call me crazy but this one is better than Wes Craven's previous pre-Scream New Nightmare) is a good movie. It may not be better than the original, which given the history of horror remakes seems to be a very difficult task to perform, but its still better than some of the sequels in the original series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
749,frankiegallacher_96,Don't hate the remake because the original was great!!!,8,26 July 2015,"This movie should be given more credit, its been harshly judged because it didn't meet the high standards set by the original. It sheds new light on the nightmare on elm street saga and refreshes the franchise which has been vastly overused by giving it a new Gothic twist. Watch this movie like its the first time you've ever been introduced to the series. Not as someone who's expecting it to be as good as Wes Craven's 1984 classic because by doing that you'll not get the full benefit of it. Remakes rarely ever come close to the original and this is no different but it doesn't change the fact that this is still a very enjoyable movie with enjoyable character and a good storyline to go alongside it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
750,babemagnet101,"A great entry for the Elm St franchise, but not as good as the original.",10,30 April 2010,"It was definitely Platinum Dunes' best movie. The first 30-45 minutes were very powerful, and then it kind of slacked, but came back at the end. Nevertheless, I surprisingly never lost interest, something I was kind of expecting, because I've been keeping up with this movie for almost a year now. It held me to the very end, and I never got bored with it.Putting the movie up against the original, it failed. But putting it up against the entire Nightmare franchise, I'd say it was better than all the sequels. A very worthy entry, a great popcorn movie, and a great comeback to an icon who hasn't had a movie completely to himself in 16 years. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out.Putting it in the context of remakes/reboots, I'd say it was above RZ's Halloween II, Stepfather, Friday The 13th, Texas Chainsaw, and The Wolfman, but lower than Hills Have Eyes and Last House On The Left.7.5/10 (Leaning towards an 8)",A Nightmare on Elm Street
751,maseyuk,Story is rushed and basic,5,28 October 2021,"The story felt rushed, like they assume everyone knows the premise so there's no point explains or building up to it. The actor playing Freddie is very dull compared to the original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
752,spikeymikey1981,Far better than I expected.,7,22 September 2017,"This comes with a caveat: I've never seen any of the original Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I've never been a huge fan of the horror genre. I'm not opposed to the occasional horror movie, I'm just not a fanatic like some people are.Viewing it through that lens - as someone who had no preconceived notions of what it should be and who doesn't watch a ton of horror to begin with - I thought it was great. The action was nicely spaced throughout the movie, keeping the tension up without the deaths feeling too forced. It was not B movie buckets o' blood, but it didn't shy away from gore either. All in all, it looked very well produced. It was polished, entertaining and several times I found myself annoyed or sad because of what was going on in the movie. If you can draw me in enough for me to start feeling emotions for the characters, I think you've succeeded in making a good movie.I give it a 7/10 because it's not one of my favorite movies ever, but I'd certainly watch it again and recommend it to friends.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
753,kingofpersia1,Finally A Good Horror Remake,9,30 April 2010,"With the popularity of remakes (oops I mean ""reimaginings"") it was only a matter of time before they brought the Nightmare series into modern day, and for the most part this remake succeeds where others fail - it's actually scary. The brilliant Jackie Earle Haley brings Freddy back to his dark roots and wisely stays away from the stupid one-liners and bullshit ""comedic"" moments that dragged Freddy down after the original. Haley is vicious, cold and downright disturbing at times. Though not quite as charismatic as Englund was, Haley is a worthy successor and I definitely want to see more of him in this role. Haley may have been my favorite part of the movie but everything else was nearly as good.The plot follows the same basic elements of the original but a lot of the details of it all have changed. Freddy's back story is fleshed out a bit more and at one point it's suggested that he may have been innocent *SPOILER ALERT* he wasn't. There are homages to the original thrown in, some of the most iconic shots, and they work well. Two changes that bugged me were; in this movie Freddy wasn't a serial killer before he was murdered, only a pedophile, so why he would come back to kill the kids is a little confusing. Also, because he wasn't a killer the explanation for his glove is never given, he just simply has it.The cast all perform ably and the characters act like real teenagers as opposed to clichés like in most horror movies. The parent characters also act as real parents who are concerned for their children's well being instead of just existing to set up the plot. Overall it makes the characters feel more organic and easier to relate too.The director, first timer Samuel Bayer, brings his music video experience to the table and sets up shots that are stylized and completely effective. He builds tension well making the jump scares just that, scary, instead of feeling cheap. Whether his style would translate to a different genre is a different story but he seems to be a natural at horror.As a whole this reboot of the series feels fresh and exciting while still doing justice to the original. It's genuinely scary and keeps you entertained the entire way through, which is more than can be said about 98% of horror movies these days. If, and when, a sequel is made I will be at the midnight showing on the edge of my seat just like I was last night.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
754,klamb-1,Why Why Why,1,30 October 2010,"What can I say about this film? well it is not a patch on the original, Jackie Earle Haley may be a good actor but he is no substitute for Robert Englund, the character of Freddy was not as menacing as the original, the plot and screen direction was terrible.Considering that the original was produced over 20 years ago before all the new CGI technology I was hoping that the kill scenes would have been enhanced but alas this was not to be.Any Freddy fan will be very disappointed with this interpretation of the screenplay, please please please do not make sequel to this movie, as they say you cannot improve on perfection so don't try",A Nightmare on Elm Street
755,rjrichypoos,The first remake I've seen that is better than the original.,7,28 August 2015,"I think a lot of people just go by the premise that all remakes are worse than the original. Even those who know a lot about film seem to go by that no questions asked. As well as the idea that just because there's a classic horror that a lot of people say is great, it surely must be. That is probably why this film has never gained the recognition it deserves. There were many times that I thought could have been better in the original, especially the acting (Understandable from an 80's film). However, every single one of those moments were improved in this film. I also like how they went so much deeper into the back story. I must say the original did beat my expectations, it was good, but I wasn't expecting much from this either (being a remake and being produced by Michael Bay) and this has exceeded my expectations even further than the original. So much so that I'm inclined to say that it's better. I would say that I did prefer the original Freddy though, he was much less human like than this one. Part way through I began to feel sorry for him which is something that you really don't need for a slasher villain. But from the film itself, I'm happy to say that it was the first horror film that actually interested and frightened me in a long time which is a breath of fresh air and t top it all of it is the first remake I have ever seen t surpass the original in my opinion.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
756,sarahl20001,Ignore all these harsh reviews! This movie was great reimagining of Freddy!,7,8 May 2010,"I came here a few days ago to see these reviews, trying to get an idea of how good/bad this movie was going to be. I'm a horror movie nut, not extremely hard to please but I know a not so great movie when I see one. If you've noticed all the 3/10 ratings and below, take them with a 10 pound bag of salt!!!! Especially if you are just excited to see a GOOD horror movie or retelling of a classic horror movie character! In my opinion there's NOTHING awful or even mediocre about this movie! I think people just didn't like seeing a different side of Krueger, less comical/amused with his life and more sinister/not happy with his situation. No sexual violence is portrayed only vaguely insinuated so it's not disturbing in a BAD way, same as the originals. The movie is still strange, scary, interesting and entertaining to watch! There's also a lot of Freddy on camera which was a pleasant surprise.The most important point to make: Jackie Earle Haley has truly impressed me as the revamped Freddy, which is something quite special considering I had absolutely ZERO faith in this new guy attempting to fill in the awesomely huge shoes of Robert Englund! ..... He did it, just in a new and different, yet familiar kind of way.I don't know what people expected but I thought it was a great horror movie with A LOT of TENSE moments and it delivered what any Nightmare on Elm Street promises: Strange, gory nightmares, Plenty of Freddy and Imaginative Deaths! This movie IS worth seeing in the theater, I'm SO happy I didn't look at those reviews and decide not to go see it( I was close!). I talked about the movie for days after, like I said I'm a horror movie nut but even the impartial movie goer should enjoy this creepy and imaginative horror flick!Solid 7.5/10!",A Nightmare on Elm Street
757,brc-7,Terrible Casting,1,1 May 2010,The three things that really made this movie stink!! Freddy was badly cast!! He was so boring and had not personality and the make up was terrible!! He looked like a dried out old tree stump!! The second was Nancy was as boring as they come!! Could she not use some expression in her scenes!! She was awful! I think that Katie Cassidy should have been Nancy and Kellan Lutz should have been Quentin!! They used all the same tricks that have been done nothing new. The first one does seem cheesy now but considering when it was made it is pretty entertaining with a good concept. Bottom line this new movie was awful!! I hope they do not make anymore.,A Nightmare on Elm Street
758,rayme15,Freddy is BACK!,7,2 May 2010,"I have seen every Nightmare on Elm Street it's what I grew up with them, scary Hun? This Michael Bay remake is dead on, it a has everything a remake should, from classic scenes from the first Nightmare , to different dream sequences, to the new Freddy Kruger, Jack E Haley. Jack's portrayal of the new Freddy Kruger was ""On"" I won't say dead ""On"", but I believe it can only get better from here. That's something I like about this remake it was so well done and being a fan of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" Series knew exactly what I was getting in for and I would recommend anyone who is a true fan of this series to go and see the movie, I am already very eager to see the sequel, maybe even another Freddy vs. Jason who knows. I hope this review was helpful. .",A Nightmare on Elm Street
759,kmg15-1,"one Huge plot hole, and bad acting later....",1,3 May 2010,"*********may contain spoilers*********OK, lets start with the plot hole. In the original, Freddy was a child killer who was killing the children of Elm street. To expedite this craft, he created a fun glove with razor knives on each finger. The parents band together and trap him, and burn him alive. In the remake he, Rorschach, is a child molester who is also trapped and burnt alive like Freddy was. There is absolutely no reason for him to make a glove, but in the remake he does. It is never explained why Rorschach is dressing up like Fred Krueger, and becomes a terrible plot hole. The film revolves around this goofy blonde girl named Kris who seems to bumble along in life, shortly after her boyfriend commits suicide. She breaks every rule you are not supposed to do in a horror movie, and i am pretty sure she skips when she runs.But wait, BAM an hour and 15m into the movie she is dead, and the story starts to follow some weird outcast girl named Nancy, and some EMO kid who is annoying. The film introduces micro naps so that Fredd err Rorschach can invade the kids dreams and kill them, the way Freddy might. Rorschach sounded a lot like Billy Bob Thorntons Slingblade character giving a Freddy impression.I chalk up this steaming pile of dogshiet to Platinum Dunes, and Michael Bay ruining another movie. He has put out nothing but garbage over the last decade, and has ruined many movies. The lesson learned here: Leave our Classics alone!!",A Nightmare on Elm Street

762,cmunchhof,One of my favorite Nightmare movies,9,21 October 2018,"I've been a huge fan of the franchise forever. Own all of them and even was an extra on part 4 where I met Robert England while he was having his makeup done.With that said, this is one of my favorites in the series. I think it presses further into the psychological thriller category than any other in the franchise.This is a loose remake of the original and includes about half a dozen remade scenes from the first movie. However, there is much more focus on Freddy's backstory.A lot of people have given it bad reviews because it's not exactly like the other franchise films, but that's the best part. This movie takes the franchise out of the campy slasher movie genre(not that there's anything wrong with that)and into a much creepier and more sophisticated field.",A Nightmare on Elm Street
763,nflfreak,Honest review from an average guy ***minor spoilers***,5,30 April 2010,"First off, I am a huge fan of the Elm St.'s in general, one trick or treat I even went as the one and only Freddy. I've heard many people my age (early 30's) judge the 2010 version before even seeing it, I however kept a very open mind and was hopeful this would be a very good movie. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed.I rate the movie a very average 5/10 and the only reasons it even gets that ""high"" of a score from me is that I thought Jackie Earle Haley, although no Englund, did a very good job as Krueger and I liked how they used some of the stuff from the original in a new way e.g. ""I'm your boyfriend now"", etc.However, that doesn't make up for the below average character development (sans Freddy), the somewhat rushed pacing, the lack of scares (or even tension), and other faults.Bottom line: An average re-imagining/remake, nothing more.""Leave the gun, take the cannoli.""",A Nightmare on Elm Street
