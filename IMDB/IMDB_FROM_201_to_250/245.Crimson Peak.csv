0,MartinHafer,A terrific film...scary and with a wonderful Gothic atmosphere.,9,7 May 2016,"I don't understand ""Crimson Peak"". It's a terrific horror film from Guillermo del Toro...yet it flopped at the box office and there are a lot of rather nasty (possibly hateful) reviews here on IMDb. I just don't get it.When the film begins, Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), a charming but creepy guy, arrives in the States to try to get money for a bizarro project (the weakest aspect of an otherwise great film). However, there is definitely much more to this weirdo and the audience is definitely on to him...but the industrialist he's come to see has a young daughter and Mia (Mia Wasikowska) is very taken by Sharpe and his attentions. The father definitely is NOT pleased and learns something damning about Sharpe but before he can act he's brutally murdered. Next, the sweet young Mia is married and heading to Britain with her new husband, Sharpe.Sharpe's home is a creepy old mansion--definitely the stuff of nightmare fodder. There Sharpe and his creepier sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), live...and Mia immediately starts getting creepy vibes. It seems that Mia has supernatural abilities and can see the dead on occasion. While very scary, she is able to communicate with these spirits...and one of them is trying to get her to leave this awful house. Why and what's next? You'll just have to see this film.This film is pretty typical of some of del Toro's other films, such as ""The Devil's Backbone"". The dead, while scary and menacing, are not necessarily malevolent. And, like a typical del Toro film is it NOT for the faint of heart...it is very bloody, visceral and kind of gross. Do not, for the love of God, let kids watch this film!!!! But if you can handle the gore, it's a wonderfully surprising film with many original story elements. Well worth seeing and a surprisingly good film.",Crimson Peak
1,TheLittleSongbird,Frustratingly uneven despite the gorgeous visuals,5,12 June 2016,"'Crimson Peak' had a lot going for it, with a talented director and, while this reviewer is not a huge fan of Mia Wasikowska, two talented actors in Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain, plus the story had great potential.Unfortunately, this great potential is not entirely lived up to. 'Crimson Peak' is not an awful film, it's just that it is frustratingly uneven considering the talent in front of and behind the camera and how with the right execution the story and the combination of supernatural horror and Gothic melodrama/romance (the latter of which the film essentially is, despite being advertised misleadingly) could have been really intriguing.The best thing about 'Crimson Peak' are the production values, which are just gorgeous (a vast majority of them anyhow). Not only are the costumes and sets lavishly colourful, sumptuously elegant and splendidly Gothic but they have a real atmosphere and depth to them. It's atmospherically and evocatively lit too, and beautifully shot. The music score is resolutely haunting, giving the right amount of chills and nuance. Guillermo Del Toro's mastery of visual style does come through, as does for the first third at least his knack of combining more than one mood all at once. The first third is entertaining and rich in atmosphere.'Crimson Peak' benefits too from the performances of Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain. While he may seem a little subdued in places, Hiddleston is superbly brooding and very believably flips from charming to chilling in a short space of time when needed, his very eloquent way of speaking makes one want to listen to him for hours. Chastain comes close to stealing the film, playing with verve, mysterious allure and quite scary intensity. Their chemistry is magnetic.However, Mia Wasikowska doesn't fare so well. In all fairness she does have a very passive and indecisively written character, but while Wasikowska has come on a lot since 'Alice in Wonderland' (for example she is good in 'Jane Eyre') her performance here is devoid of emotion. Her chemistry with Hiddleston is rather dull and cold too. Charlie Hunnam, while not as annoying as in 'Pacific Rim', is similarly very bland. The ghost characters, as well as looking very fake (the one sore spot visually was the crude-looking effects), were not needed (likewise with the supernatural horror elements, which were executed to very predictable and lazy effect generally here, the film would have been far better just as a Gothic romance), don't inject much personality let alone thrills or scares and they felt like they were shoe-horned into the story.Where 'Crimson Peak' particularly disappoints is in the script and story. The script is quite threadbare and often sounds very awkward. The story started off with so much promise, had some good moments in the middle act atmospherically despite starting to meander pace-wise (parts quite badly drag in fact) and tire narratively before falling apart completely in the last act, which was implausible, lost momentum and became silly and anti-climactic. A good case of Del Toro taking on more than he could chew.In conclusion, looks gorgeous but is frustratingly uneven. Starts strongly before finishing with a thud. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Crimson Peak
2,SnoopyStyle,beautiful Gothic horror lacks mystery or thrills,6,5 February 2017,"Ghosts are real. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) has known this since childhood when her mother died and her spirit warned her, ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" As a young woman, she's trying to publish her ghost story only to face sexism. English baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) has come to America seeking investments from Edith's father Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) for a clay-mining machine invention. Carter distrusts the failing aristocrat and his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain). His investigator Holly finds something damning and he pays Thomas to leave his lovesick daughter Edith. Carter is murdered and Edith marries Thomas. They go back to England but Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) is suspicious as the Cushing fortune is liquidated to the Sharpes in England.This is a beautiful Gothic horror from Guillermo del Toro. It is simply gorgeous. On the other hand, the story lacks thrills or scares. There is no real mystery since the Sharpe siblings lay out their cards early on. It's also unlikely that Carter wouldn't reveal the secret to his daughter. All of it takes away the tension. The Sharpe mansion looks beautiful in a haunted manner. The story needs some reworking to inject more thrilling tension.",Crimson Peak
3,Prismark10,Crimson Peak,5,7 October 2019,"Guillermo del Toro has made a Victorian gothic horror with shades of Rebecca and Jane Eyre.Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) has seen spectres since childhood who have brought a warning to her.Edith falls in love with an inventor from England. Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) has come to America looking for finance for his clay mining machine. Edith's wealthy father is unimpressed but Thomas woos Edith as his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) looks on.Edith's father calls an investigator to look into the Sharpe's history and he is then brutally killed. Edith marries Thomas and goes to live in his dilapidated and sinking mansion known by the locals as Crimson Peak as the warm red clay seeps through the snow.Edith finds that Lucille is cold towards her like she is not welcome in the house. Edith suddenly starts to cough up blood and she sees ghosts. Edith finds clues about her new husband's past and sibling secrets.del Toro's film has great visuals, it looks like a stylistic fantasy based on a haunted house setting. Somehow the story is humdrum as I expected more from it. You sense all the things that inspired this film and yet it is inert. There is no substance just like the foundations of the mansion.",Crimson Peak
4,claudio_carvalho,Beware of Crimson Peak,7,14 January 2017,"In the turn of the Twentieth Century in Buffalo, New York, the aspiring writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of the wealthy entrepreneur Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Edith saw the ghost of her mother that warned her to beware of Crimson Peak when she was a child and presently she is writing a ghost story. Now she is visiting a publisher that is friend of her father and she stumbles upon her childhood friend, the ophthalmologist Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), who has returned from overseas and is opening an office in the same building. Out of the blue, she meets the English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who has come to Buffalo with his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) to seek investors to his machine that operates with clay. He has a meeting with Carter Crushing and other businessmen, but Carter refuses to invest in his invention. During the night, the ghost of Edith's mother visits her and warns Edith again to beware of Crimson Peak. Soon Thomas seduces Edith and Carter hires a private detective to investigate the lives of Thomas and Lucille. A couple of days later, the detective brings a report to Carter disclosing dark secrets from the past of the siblings. Carter pays a large amount to Thomas to end his relationship with Edith but he is brutally murdered. Thomas explains to Edith his attitude and they get married and travel to England to live in his derelict mansion over a red clay mine at Allerdale Hall with Lucille. Edith starts to see a red ghost and discovers that an Italian woman has sent a letter to him. Then she becomes weak and coughs blood. What is happening to Edith and what is the mystery of Allerdale Hall and the siblings Sharpe?""Crimson Peak"" is a combination of drama and ghost story by Guillermo del Toro. The performances, direction, locations, cinematography and costumes are magnificent. The conclusion is predictable and the plot uses many clichés, but the film is highly entertaining even for those that are not fans of horror. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Colina Escarlate"" (""The Crimson Hill"")",Crimson Peak
5,nogodnomasters,THE GHOST IS A METAPHOR FOR THE PAST,7,22 April 2018,"Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) loses her mother as a child. She has a haunting image and is told to beware of Crimson Peak. Years later she is swept off of her feet by Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Her father doesn't approve of Thomas or his sister (Jessica Chastain). They leave for England and his falling apart manor, which is called...wait for it....Crimson Peak! It has ""secrets everywhere"" and a plot with tired twists that will give you a strong feeling of Deja Vu.Chastain did a wicked job as Lucille, and wicked in a good way. Hiddleston was underwhelming and the weak link in the film. It is billed as a Gothic Romantic Horror. I thought the romance was forced and not well constructed. I imagine if you have an old run down place, it qualifies as ""Gothic."" The horror felt forced also. The cinematography and costume was done well, in spite of the fact of opening the film in Buffalo. It gets points for style, and spends more effect of style than substance utilizing twists that are far too common. Who didn't have Lucille pegged the first time we saw her? Guide: F-bomb. Sex. male butt nudity. Warning IMDB parents guide contains plot spoilers that are not hidden.",Crimson Peak
6,kosmasp,Fantasy,8,28 October 2016,"Maybe some countries (or all?) had the wrong promotion for this. Because while I can see that some would put this in the horror genre, it's more like a fairy tale. It's a fantasy movie and the setting plus everything in it (acting, costumes, set design) actually emphasize that more than enough for everyone to see.Still, if you get into this expecting some kind of ""Devils Backbone"" (something I read from another reviewer), than you will be severely disappointed of course. Acting may seem a bit over the top at times, but this too is meant to be. It fits the overall tone, that you either have started to cherish from the start or at some point or just find annoying. Depending on your view and mood this will either make your day or ""break"" it.",Crimson Peak
7,Sleepin_Dragon,This came as a surprise.,8,23 August 2020,"Crimson Peak was recommended as a horror, and whilst there are a few horror tones throughout, I would say this is more in the psychological thriller bracket.It is a wonderfully lavish film, it looks fantastic, gorgeous costumes, sets and of course that exquisite building. The story is gripping, and will have you enthralled, you have no way which way it's going to turn out. Some decent special effects for the time.Hiddleston and cast are terrific, the acting is of the highest order, and elevates the story.Very gothic, very good, 8/10.",Crimson Peak
8,classicsoncall,"""You have nowhere else to go.""",7,3 November 2020,"For students of cinematography, this is a stunningly filmed movie. The sets and costuming are gorgeous with a Gothic vibe, but it gets a bit surreal when the story moves to England with the marriage of Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). The open air roof of Allerdale Hall and the rotting floorboards would have been a pretty good indicator that the new bride just might have made a mistake. There's also more than just a bit of creepiness to the relationship between Thomas and sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain), and it wouldn't have surprised me if the story went in the direction of them being a married couple luring Edith into their web of deceit.The title of the picture derives from the red clay that Thomas is mining right outside his ancestral home, which turns winter snow a bright red that complements the horror inside the huge mansion. While the opening of the picture quickly reveals that it's going to be a ghost story, there's a bit more going on with the victims of the Sharpe's earlier conquests. I have to say though, the freakish looking creature that emanated from the floor of Allerdale would have sent the average person into a fit of hysterical screaming, but Edith took it in reasonable stride as one of the oddities of her new home. To me, she didn't seem to be all that panicked about it.The violence in the film picks up a considerable notch when Lucille pushes Edith over a second story balcony railing onto the snow covered living room floor (not a typo!), and from there, it becomes a knife fest to see who gets to be the last person standing. Lucille stabs the visiting Doctor Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam), Edith stabs Lucille, Lucille in turn stabs her brother right in the face!, as Edith grabs a knife of her own, a little souvenir from ghost mom. Interestingly, Thomas winds up actually falling in love with his wife throughout the ordeal, and helps Edith kill his sister from the great beyond. All complemented by various shades of red as the story reaches it's ultimate bloody conclusion.",Crimson Peak
9,gavin6942,Beautiful Film With Great Atmosphere,8,9 February 2016,"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider. Trying to escape the ghosts of her past, she is swept away to a house that breathes, bleeds -- and remembers.I had the privilege of not seeing this film until it was released on DVD. The rumors were that people went to see it in theaters and were disappointed. Then a new rumor came about that it was poorly marketed, with people wanting a horror story, but getting a Gothic romance and not knowing how to react.Whatever the case may be, I went in expecting nothing but knowing not to be waiting for the horror. And, really, it is more horror than del Toro lets us. Plenty of blood, ghosts and murder. There is also romance (in the traditional sense), and a house that serves as a main character. But to say it is not horror would be wrong. There are clear allusions to ""Fall of the House of Usher"" and ""The Changeling"", not just to the world of Jane Austen or ""Jane Eyre"".Del Toro says this is ""the most beautiful film I've done"" and ""one of the top three films I've made"". What the other two are he does not say, but this was a personal film for him, coming out of the story that his mother was visited by the ghost of her grandmother. He is often described as ""visionary"", and his vision has never been stronger, as this is a world where all colors are intentional, with images of America being draped in gold, and with Edith being the only ""dollop of sunshine"" in Europe. If I had any complaint, it would not be about the horror or the acting (which is good) or the atmosphere (which is excellent). It would be on the CGI. The ghost effects were a bit disappointing, especially knowing from ""Pan's Labyrinth"" what these fine folks are capable of. Any time Doug Jones gets to be a ghost or demon is great, but why not a more practical effect rather than what amounts to a cartoon? Del Toro says the ghosts are not CGI, but ""physical"". He would know, but the resulting effect is unfortunately disappointing just the same.Special praise must be given to Jessica Chastain. She is easily one of the best actresses working today, and it is roles like this that really proves it. She excels at mainstream, Oscar-nominated fare, but she can also be moody, devious and evil. Del Toro knew this from ""Mama"", and it is great to see her come back in a bigger way. The horror genre needs more talented folks like Chastain.The blu-ray release is packed full of special features, not the least of which is an audio commentary from Guillermo del Toro. He talks for two hours straight, explaining tiny clues of colors, shapes and even names that may be overlooked on first viewings, or maybe even multiple viewings. Would anyone notice the props getting 30% larger towards the end to make the actors look smaller? Or how about Enola being the word ""alone"" in reverse?",Crimson Peak
10,Tweekums,A stylish gothic horror,8,28 April 2018,"As this gothic horror opens protagonist Edith Cushing tells us that ghosts are real; we see how the ghost of her mother warned her to 'beware of Crimson Peak'. Years pass and Edith meets Sir Thomas Sharpe, a baronet hoping her father will invest in his mining machinery. He soon starts to court Edith but breaks it off when her father confronts him with certain information that has come into his possession. Shortly afterwards her father is brutally murdered and Sir Thomas marries Edith. They leave America and return to Allerdale Hall, his home in England, along with his sister Lucille. Allerdale Hall was once impressive but now it is somewhat dilapidated; Lucille tells Edith that certain areas of house are too dangerous as she refuses to give her the house keys. Edith soon starts seeing more ghosts; clearly something very bad in the house once. Back in America the truth about Sir Thomas is learnt and family friend Dr Alan McMichael heads to England to save Edith; the question is whether or not he will get there in time.Coming from writer/director Guillermo del Toro it is hardly surprising that this is very stylish with chills taking priority over more obvious scary moments. Early on it is hard to tell whether Sir Thomas is charming or just a charmer and once the action moves to England it soon looks as though Edith has made a terrible mistake. There is a constant sense that something is wrong; not just when Edith sees some impressively grotesque ghosts... no slightly see-through people here! Everything looks very stylish; from Edith's vivid yellow dress to the deep red of the clay Allerdale Hall is built on. The cast does a fine job; Mia Wasikowska really impresses as Edith, a character who is both strong and vulnerable; Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain also impress as Sit Thomas and Lucille; keeping their characters ambiguous for much of the film. For the most part it is chilling rather than scary but there are shocking moments that are very violent and quite gory. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of gothic horror.",Crimson Peak

12,blanche-2,Kind of a Gothic-ghost-horror movie,7,17 March 2017,"I don't usually watch this type of film, so I don't come at this with the knowledge of some people who reviewed this on IMDb.Crimson Peak stars Mia Wasikowska as aspiring writer Edith Cushing in Buffalo, NY. She believes she sees the ghost of her mother at times - her mother died when she was quite young.She meets a handsome, romantic inventor, Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who has come to the states to find investors for his harvest machine. He wants to marry her, but her father, who has hired a detective to investigate Thomas and his sister, the lovely Lucille (Jessica Chastain), objects. Then he is killed. Edith marries Thomas and goes to England to live in the family home. Think Grand Guignol on acid. The place is a disaster with part of the roof gone and water coming in. So comfy. Then she starts running into this red skeleton telling her to leave. Yes, this film is pretty predictable, with some wonderful production values and a great cast. I just saw Mia in the show In Treatment, as a teenaged gymnast, and she was fabulous. I haven't seen her in her adult years in anything but this. Her role isn't straightforward - she is supposed to be emancipated and yet she's frail.Directed by Guillermo del Toro, there were hints of ""Notorious"" toward the end.It's a good rental.",Crimson Peak

14,CinemaSerf,Stunning imagery let down by poor talent...,6,20 April 2020,"This is a gorgeous looking film with some superb Gothic-style settings and detail. The premiss is that of a scheming inventor (Tom Hiddleston) who approaches a wealthy American industrialist for funds to develop his mining machine. To no avail, but in the process the daughter (Mia Wasikowska) falls for him and when her father is brutally murdered she marries him and returns to his home complete with his own version of ""Mrs. Danvers"" (Jessica Chastain). Once there she discovers his manor house - complete with a huge great hole in the roof - is full of it's own grisly secrets. Is that really just the iron content in the water?? The suspense is much more subtle and cumulative; it isn't about banging doors or dodgy sound effects; the pace of the thing is compelling. The acting, however, is not. None of the three principals seem to gel; Charlie Hunnam appears totally uncomfortable as the doctor; the dialogue doesn't work anywhere near as well as the visuals and the Velázquez score underperforms disappointingly. Perhaps del Toro had to cast for box office rather than suitability for the roles - which is a shame; the whole thing could have been much better with a more talented trio in the leads.",Crimson Peak
15,writers_reign,Poe-Faced,4,17 October 2015,"I'm only guessing but it seems that movie critics are getting 1) younger and 2)less well educated than earlier generations. Certainly the hack writing in the London Evening Standard seems to qualify on both counts and reinforced my theory when she stated categorically that Crimson Peak is not based on a classic novel. Maybe not but it is definitely a rip-off of Edgar Allan Poe's The Fall Of The House Of Usher, albeit del Toro allows the house itself to remain standing but does mimic Poe's classic in featuring a crumbling mansion inhabited by a brother and sister who enjoy an incestuous relationship. Even the period is close - within sixty or seventy years of Poe - so it might have been titled The Serious Tilt Of The House of Usher. Apparently it's had mixed reviews which means more or less than a percentage of critics are happy to swallow del Toro's bulls**t.",Crimson Peak
16,grantss,Flatters to deceive,5,3 September 2016,"Buffalo, New York, 1880s. Edith Cushing (played by Mia Wasikowska) is haunted (in some cases, literally) by the death of her mother - she died when Edith was young. Then she meets an English entrepreneur, Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddlestone), the relationship develops and life seems to be improving. However, her father, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), disapproves of Sir Thomas and tries to have Sir Thomas and his scheming sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), sent back to England. Mr Cushing then dies in mysterious circumstances, leaving Edith and Sir Thomas free to wed, which they do. The married couple and Lucille move into the Sharpe ancestral home in England, the run-down Allerdale Hall. Hardly has she moved in than Edith's nightmares become quite vividly real, being haunted by ghoulish apparitions. It's as if the house doesn't want her there...Good start, but fizzles out from about half way in. The set up was good - good back story and plot progression and a large dose of malice and intrigue. The best ""horror"" movies have plausible explanations for all the ghosts and horror scenes and have a good twist or two in store. Crimson Peak seemed to be shaping up for that: solid plot to the non-horror part and a decent cast, a cast you wouldn't expect to find in a common-or-garden horror movie. Surely this was going to have a profound ending and a plausible explanation for everything?Sadly, no. In the end it is just a horror movie. The great revelation is hardly surprising and the ghosts were just ghosts. Only stands out from your average horror movie due to the initial build up, the good production values and A-list cast.

America cannot remember what we ever saw in Guillermo Del Toro. Now that he's patronizing us with such utter tripe as CRIMSON PEAK, and stealing an apparently script-blind Jessica Chastain away from the far worthier films she could have been making, Del Toro threatens to become a Real Life Black Hole, sucking formerly bright stars into his dim-witted dark void!",Crimson Peak

20,neil-476,"Absolutely gorgeous, and dumb as a fence post",7,19 October 2015,"Would-be authoress of ghost stories (because she can actually see ghosts), Edith falls for the mysterious Sir Thomas Sharpe and, following the violent murder of her industrialist father, marries Sir Thomas and moves with him to his decaying family home, Allerdale Hall, on the Cumbrian Moors. She proposes to invest her inheritance in equipment for mining the liquid red clay on which Allerdale Hall stands, and which is responsible for it being named Crimson Peak. But also living in Allerdale Hall is Sir Thomas's sister Lucille, and she is even more mysterious than he is.Directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro, Crimson Peak is chock full of Gothic romance, decor, foreboding and horror – it is essentially Jane Eyre reimagined as a horror story.. And that is just as well, because it is a complete load of old tosh in every other respect. Mia Wasikowska is fine as Edith, a Jane Austen heroine with feistiness, and Tom Hiddleston does well as tall dark and mysterious, with a dark secret in the attic, except it's not that dark, and it's not in the attic, because it's Jessica Chastain's Lucille, who pervades the first two thirds of the film looking as if someone is constantly farting just below her nostrils.The opening sequence, where Edith starts falling for Thomas while Lucille is being mysterious and ever-so-slightly objectionable, is fine. It's when they get to the Cumbrian moors, and Allerdale Hall, that I started losing it. Bear with me – this crumbling stately heap is literally in the middle of nowhere. There is a hole in the roof through which leaves constantly rain down into the main hall, and this is despite the fact there are only a handful of trees in the immediate vicinity, and none of them have any leaves. There are – necessarily – roaring fires in every room (where does the fuel come from?), most of the doors are left open most of the time, and all the heat presumably then rushes out into the central hall and then straight out of the hole in the roof. The house stands on this bed of liquid red clay which oozes up through the floor – we are told several times that the house is actually sinking into it. Not only does this pose construction questions (not to mention how come I have never heard of this invaluable brick-building liquid red clay before), it makes me wonder how come the clay has remained at the top of the moor on which the house stands, what with liquid having a tendency to roll downhill. But don't loose sleep over that, because there is the conundrum of the incriminating wax cylinders and locked chest – given how incriminating these are, why were they kept? Incidentally, the red clay and Edith's ability to see ghosts are both largely irrelevant in terms of plot dynamics.The story, frankly, is profoundly daft, has more holes in it than a lace doily, and exists only so that the film can exist, and the film only exists Because Gothic.I like del Toro's work, and I loved the visuals and atmosphere of this movie. But more effort should have been put into the script in order to avoid so much Because Stupid.",Crimson Peak
21,ferguson-6,A Story with Ghosts,7,19 October 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""It's not a ghost story. It's a story with ghosts."" Leave it to writer/director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, 2006) to make this distinction. The line is spoken by our lead character Edith, who is striving to write like her literary idol, Mary Shelley. She is explaining her most recent writing effort to a publisher, but the line also represents the movie we are watching  ghosts appear (some grisly ones at that), but they certainly aren't the focus.The story begins around the turn of the 20th century as young Edith has just experienced her first family tragedy, the passing of her mother. She grows into an independent young woman (played by Mia Wasikowska) being raised by her successful self-made-man father Curtis Cushing (played by Jim Beaver, ""Justified""). Tip of the cap to del Toro for his tip of the cap to the horror film great Peter Cushing. Edith has remained steadfast in her independence despite the advances of her lifelong friend, the handsome Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam, ""Sons of Anarchy""). Things change when a mysterious stranger sweeps into town. Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) seeks investors for his ""clay harvester"", a machine he designed to automate what now takes many men and much hard labor. The elder Cushing senses something is ""off"" about Sharpe and his sister and traveling companion, Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), but the strong-minded Edith soon finds herself waltzing and blushing with Sir Thomas.It would be pretty easy to recap the balance of the story, but that is actually the film's weakness. It plays like a re-imagined script from one of those old 1940's or 50's movies that I watched on Friday nights as a kid. In other words, it's not very frightening and the viewer's enjoyment is totally based on the atmosphere. Fortunately, that's where del Toro and his team excel. The set design (Tom Sanders) and costumes (Kate Hawley) are truly spectacular and among the best ever seen, especially for a horror movie. Dilapidated Allendale Manor features a hole in its roof allowing the elements to freely enter the colossal entry foyer. The furnishings and fixtures, as well as the layout of the house are perfection as a setting. The costumes for all characters are superb, but pay special attention to the fabrics and frills of Edith and Lucille. Camera work from Cinematographer Dan Lausten ties it all together for the eerie feel.The film is so stunning and interesting to look at that it's actually quite easy to forgive a story that has little to offer, and often  and I do mean often  relies on horror film clichés in what should be moments of difference-making. Having five such talented lead actors, who each go ""all in"" for their characters, help us overlook the script weakness, and it's really the look and atmosphere of the film that make it worth watching  not words I have written many times over the years. For del Toro fans, you should know that Doug Jones does play the creepy ghost that inspires Edith's first words (as narrator)  ""Ghosts are real, that much I know"".",Crimson Peak
22,anaconda-40658,Colorful Disaster.,8,16 December 2015,"Crimson Peak (2015): Dir: Guillermo del Toro / Cast: Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, Charlie Hunnam, Jim Beaver: Visually charged chiller about the height of tension. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith, a young writer of ghost stories who is haunted by images of a demonic female who warns her to stay away from Crimson Peak. Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain play Thomas and Lucille Sharp, a mysterious couple poising as siblings. Thomas has affection for Edith but her father disapproves. When he ends up murdered she marries Thomas and they, along with Lucille move into a massive rundown mansion where red clay slowly emerges from the ground and scarcely concealed by the snow. Wasikowska as Edith slowly pieces clues together and begins to investigate around the terrifying images and discovers startling facts. Hiddleston as Thomas is a question of trust until his feelings for Edith win out. Chastain as Lucille is more sinister telling of her sadistic mother. She brings Edith tea which is laced with poison and eventually has Edith spewing blood. Charlie Hunnam plays Alan McMichael who quests out to find and rescue Edith when he learns of the nature of her father's death and clues furthermore. Jim Beaver plays Edith protective father who refuses Thomas and Lucille. Director Guillermo del Toro highlights the film with exquisite ghostly images that creep out the atmosphere. The result is pointless yet visually festive horror film with many references to other films. This one is done in with graphic violence but an unapologetic approach by its director and cast who rise above it. Score: 8 / 10",Crimson Peak
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Slow-burning and barely there horror effort,5,4 October 2016,"Following her father's death, a woman goes to live with a new suitor in his large mansion in England only to come across a series of ghostly hauntings that convince her of their true intentions toward her and forces her to try to get away alive in order to stop their plans.This one was quite the troubling if still somewhat enjoyable effort. Most of what makes this one work is the fact that there's some utterly gorgeous and beautiful-looking setting which gives this one such a visually appealing style here. The house itself is a truly breathtaking creation as the elaborate, ornate setting with it's winding hallways, fully-decorated furniture, spiraling supports and enclosed yet still expressive settings create a vast, multicolored feast of scrumptious Gothic imagery that's perfectly suited to the kind of old-school horror effort. Since the ghost continually appears in several different rooms instead of being involved with showing itself in just one place, this lets the film really explore the location to it's fullest and generates plenty of mileage out of this particular location. That makes for quite a fun time here with the ghostly appearances being highly enjoyable with the appearance in her bedroom as a kid, the first appearance at the house where she appears during the bath-time playing with her dog and the later scene where she emerges from the bath and chases her out into the hallways all being quite decent ghost sequences. Likewise, the film's final half is quite fun with plenty of stalking, chasing and bloodletting going along quite nicely with the changes in the storyline which does give this one a boost during this section. Still, even with these efforts there's still a few flaws here. The main element at hand here is the fact that there's just not a whole lot of weight to this one beyond how it looks as there's just nothing much going on here. Far too much of the film's first half rests on it simply going around through the bland upper-half of society without really being interesting, as the series of scenes depicting her writing ambitions interspersed with the burgeoning romance that plays with all the usual regaling of being involved in numerous amounts of partying and strict social upstandings that are just so utterly bland and banal that it goes against the type of film this truly should be. This material is so utterly lifeless that there's little to enjoy here as this goes off on superfluous elements to elongate the film's running time on issues that aren't all that important to what's going on here. That doesn't really affect it much once they make it to their new surroundings either as the film's Gothic-infused drama set-up leaves this one with such a small amount of ghostly action here that it doesn't really feel close at all to a traditional horror effort. They're so barely glimpsed in the film and play utterly no part in what's going on that there's very little about it that feels this way and really makes for an overlong and mostly bland offering. These here really lower this one significantly as it's much more prominent here rather than the ghostly actions.Rated R: Violence, Language, Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene.",Crimson Peak
24,phd_travel,Stunningly filmed - a captivating tale of terror,10,29 October 2015,"This is a perfect blend of 21st century film making with an early 20th century setting. The story is romantic and passionate and draws you in like a tale from Bronte and Du Maurier. There are subtle homages to both. Although the Jane Eyre / Rebecca thing has been done a lot before, here things are fresh and involving and soon with the supernatural aspect things do have on a different feel. Also some tongue in cheek humor with the portrait of Mother. The filming and sets quite 'Woman in Black', especially the mansion are quite stunning and worth seeing on the big screen. The details will be lost on a small screen. It isn't often that a written for screen story is so good.The cast is perfect. Mia was already a terrific Jane Eyre is the only one I could think of in the role of naïve American heiress Edith. Tom Hiddleston as the Thomas the English baronet who sweeps her off her feet is as creepy as a vampire. Jessica Chastain is beautiful and owns the screen as his sister Lucille - what a terrific role for her. Charlie Hunnam is a little lacking in expressiveness as a doctor friend who cares for Edith.Good use of music both piano and score. I haven't been a huge fan of Guillermo del Toro's more child oriented monster and children movies but this movie is enjoyable for grown ups. Be warned the climax is more scary than I expected and that's the modern touch to this movie.Worth watching!",Crimson Peak
25,Aaron1375,"Great visuals, superb acting...kind of a predictable plot",8,26 October 2017,"I enjoyed this film as it has that Guillermo Del Toro style to it which means some very good visuals. He crafted a very lovely period piece that injects us into a world where things are not as they seem and where one wonders who to trust. That being said, when revelations were made, there was not anything all that surprising and I honestly thought the ending would entail something cooler. Still, it was a pretty good story, just nothing that is really going to be making you gasp in surprise. The house within the film looks incredible and is a house that I would love to explore and they actually apparently made the entire house; unfortunately, they promptly tore it down after filming to make room in the studio.The story has a young woman recount the first time she had seen a ghost. It happened to be her mother and the apparition carried with it a warning to stay away from Crimson Peak. Years later the young woman meets a strange man from Europe. He is trying to garner funds so that he may create a device to get the red clay that resides on his land out of the earth so that it may be processed and used. The young woman's father scoffs at the idea and is immediately suspicious of the stranger from another land. This stranger soon begins to warm up to the daughter which makes the father more suspicious. Well, in the end the young woman ends up married to the stranger and they head off to he and his sister's very dilapidated mansion. During her stay there she sees things within the walls as the very house seems to have a life of its own, but the true terror may reside in the heart of her husband! The acting is really good. I liked the guy who played the father as I liked how he was immediately suspicious. Tom Hiddlestone was great as the mysterious stranger too. The true star though was that really warped house they created as it looked incredibly creepy. A house that seems ready to collapse at any time. Honestly, I am surprised the character of Edith did not just turn around once she set foot inside that thing. Looks like it would be cool to explore, but there is a freaking hole in the ceiling where it constantly is raining debris down below! So I enjoyed the film, would have been better with a bit more supernatural flair to it. It does have supernatural elements to it, but I was expecting it to be more supernatural than it turned out to be. It is Guillermo though so his movies generally have a look to them that can make up for the fact that sometimes the story is lacking. This one's look does that as does the acting in it. I am pretty sure most figured out what was going on fairly quickly, but it is just a matter of how it plays out.",Crimson Peak
26,Wuchakk,Jane Eyre meets House of Usher with ghosts of the past,7,12 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak"" is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, ""Crimson Peak"" has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""The Others"" (2001) and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994), but it's thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein,"" which is why I cite ""The Others."" Psychological Gothic horror like ""Demons of the Mind"" (1972) and ""The Eternal"" (1998) are other comparisons. If you're in the mood for a movie like these, you'll probably appreciate ""Crimson Peak.""Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies I've ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.Some people think the story is meh, but it's no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critic's list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 59 minutes and was shot in Hamilton, Kingston and Toronto, Canada.

I was told and tricked by the trailer to see a Gothic horror or even an ode towards the Hammer flicks. And having nothing against Del Toro I went for it. But what a failure it was for me.What has this to do with Gothic or Hammer, nothing at all. This is a maybe a Gothic romance as they call it 'cause romance it is what it's all about. Was it all that bad, no, the effects were stunning and the ghost looked, euh, ghostly. That was well done indeed but was I scared, no I never was, did I see any horror element, sad to say but I didn't see any.

28,mm-39,Not a horror movie.,7,18 October 2015,"Crimson Peak is not a horror movie but more a romantic thriller! My low down of Crimson Peak. What did not work: Crimson Peak's misleading trailer is a ghost/horror story. Crimson Peak's is neither the Exorcist and/or Friday the 13th story lines. A Victorian era movie with themes of lost love, honor, and sick twisted secrets. A female audience genre similar to the Flowers in the Attic thriller. One more point, which bothers me most is too much C G I, which creates a comic book movie. What worked: The love triangle between Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska Charlie Hunnam is executed perfectly. Each character separately adds to the storyline creating romantic and story tension. Who and what will happen next is divulged as the story unfolds, and more details of the characters develop. Jessica Chastain, of Zero Dark Thirty fame, plays the crazy/evil sister perfectly. Jim Beaver is the common sense, hard working, feel by the gut protective father. The supporting cast provides to the main storyline. Well acted, directed film, which gives the viewers what they expect.

29,deloudelouvain,Nice Gothic fantasy drama,7,18 January 2016,Crimson Peak isn't really horror even though there are some horror scenes but it is a nice mixture of Gothic drama and fantasy. Maybe not Guillermo del Toro's best movie but certainly worth a watch. Guillermo del Toro proves us again that he has a unique creative mind and just for that I like to watch his movies. Even if there are not much surprises in Crimson Peak the story is pleasant to follow. The whole cast did a good job with their respective roles. The ghosts add a nice creepy touch to the movie even though there are not overwhelming. I had fun watching Crimson Peak and I'm sure the vast majority will enjoy it as well.,Crimson Peak
30,siderite,"Gothic, ghosty, mediocre",7,12 September 2018,"The beginning of the story bears almost no relevance to the rest. Then the villains are revealed and all is left is a slow painful crawl to the predictable ending. It didn't help that Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston played very well, it didn't help that the sets and the mood of the film were perfect, all because the story was weak and predictable. If this would have been written by Edgar Allan Poe, it would have been a classic. As it is, it's just something I've seen before many times.It took me three years to gather the time and courage to see this film, in the end I've watched it at 2x speed and still felt the need to fast forward.

31,KineticSeoul,Nice atmosphere but that is about it,6,6 January 2016,"This is a film that is driven more by it's atmosphere, style and design of it all over the plot. Because when it comes to the plot it has been done before, maybe not exactly but close enough. But the visuals and the set design and costume is remarkable. Watching this movie was like watching a mix between ""Cronos"" and ""Stoker"". And it goes in a more Gothic horror direction and I will say the design of the ghosts is pretty cool in this one, it's really eerie. Not really scary but eerie. Most of the screen-time is taken up by a vulnerable girl watering around a vibrant, mysterious and spooky setting. This would probably worked better as a survival horror video game over a movie. Because the movie felt like it was dragging most of the way through. I can see girls liking this because it can come across as a Gothic romance. But it's not really a haunting movie nor was it really scary either. Overall, this is a atmospheric movie that is worth a watch but it's nothing special.6.8/10",Crimson Peak
32,Hellmant,Visually stunning!,8,19 October 2015,"'CRIMSON PEAK': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Guillermo del Toro's new epic Gothic romance/ghost story; starring Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam (who also starred in del Toro's last film, 'PACIFIC RIM'). It tells the story of a young author, on the run from a tragic family past, who marries a stranger. She then moves in with him, and his sister, in a house that appears to be haunted. The film was written by del Toro and Matthew Robbins (who also co-wrote the popular 90s horror flick 'MIMIC', with del Toro). It's been praised by critics and moviegoers alike; including beloved horror author Stephen King, and his son Joe Hill (who called the movie ""del Toro's blood-soaked 'AGE OF INNOCENCE'""!). I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and especially found it to be visually stunning!The story takes place at the end of the 19th century; in Cumbria, England. Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) is a young author, with a dark family past. She meets Sir Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston), and immediately falls for him. The two are married, and Edith moves in with him and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Chastain). There's something not right about the Sharpe siblings though, and there's definitely something not right about their home; which appears to be inhabited by ghosts.The movie has some awesome atmosphere, and extremely cool looking ghosts; the CGI is so well done though, that it does make the film feel a little less creepy (than it probably could have been). The story isn't that interest-ing and it's also really slow-paced; until the end. The climax makes the whole movie worthwhile though, in my opinion; so if you have the patience to wait for it, it's definitely worth it. Chastain gives an awesome domineering femme fatale performance and Hiddleston is good too. Wasikowska isn't one of my favorite actresses; but she does make a good, innocent and naive type, heroine. Del Toro is definitely the reason to see the movie though; it's not one of his best, but he also definitely doesn't disappoint. It kind of feels like a Tim Burton movie, to me; just with a slightly different visual style, and mood.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE",Crimson Peak
33,bensonmum2,"""Ghosts are real, this much I know.""",6,12 July 2018,"I hate skipping plot summaries when I write one of these, but I think it's probably best when discussing Crimson Peak. The plot here isn't all that important. Crimson Peak is one of those ""style over substance"" movies. The plot takes a backseat to the cinematography, lighting, costumes, sets, special effects, and just about anything else you can list that makes a movie look good. And what plot there is in Crimson Peak is so filled with holes, I fear that dwelling on it will only make me like the movie less. I'll just say that the plot left me with more questions than it answered.If films are art, Crimson Peak belongs next to the Mona Lisa. It is one of the most stunning pieces of film I've ever seen. Every frame looks like a painting. I'm not sure I've seen a film this beautiful since I watched House of Flying Daggers over ten years ago. The colors, the shadows, the lights - gorgeous. My absolute favorite image (and I'm not alone based on what I've read across the internet) is the ceiling-less grand hall in the rotting great house. It's amazing. Another element that really helps the images come alive is the atmosphere. I may not care for Guillermo del Toro's plot, but there's not denying his skill as a director. He mastfully fills the film with atmosphere so thick, you could cut it with a knife. Combine the atmosphere with the visuals and you end up with a movie I'm going to enjoy on some level despite its other flaws. The acting in Crimson Peak is hit or miss. Normally, I feel that Tom Hiddleston outshines his co-stars, Here, however, he's completely over-shadowed by Jessica Chastain. She acts circles around everyone else in the film. Her role is the smallest of the three main characters, but she dominates everything - even the scenes she's not in. Overall, if you're a fan of gothic romance/horror/mystery (although the horror elements don't come to much and the solution to the mystery is all too obvious) you owe it to yourself to check out his gorgeous film.",Crimson Peak

35,Robert_duder,Del Toro's best in years and a visually stunning Gothic horror,9,26 October 2015,"This just might be director and producer's Guillermo del Toro's best work since Pan's Labrynth. Of course, the film isn't doing well but that doesn't speak to quality. I don't recall seeing a lot of Gothic horror but I've seen enough and this was one of the best. It definitely sets its own pace, finding its stride somewhere around the halfway mark and then drawing you into the story which ends up being far more simplistic than the scenarios going through my mind. A lot of reviewers said they thought the story was weak but I didn't think that at all. Simple, yes but its character driven and Del Toro gives it a visual style that even someone without an artistic eye will look twice at. There are just some astonishing visuals in this movie. It is a classic ghost story, a twisted romance and has the irony of a story within a story as our heroine's novel represents her life. It has a terrific performance from a female lead and Crimson Peak just might be one of the best settings in a thriller/horror I've ever seen. It is dark and isolated and absolutely stunning in its own right. It has enough mystery to keep you guessing but not frustratingly so and you might think you're in for a giant twist but it isn't about that.I admit I didn't recognize two of the lead females and in one case that might be better. Mia Wasikowska plays a brilliant role as a strong, ferociously smart woman caught up in a traumatic experience and a romance. I didn't realize it was her at all because she seemed so much older since the last time I saw her. As far as strong female heroes or ""scream queens"" go she really nails this part and is impressive. The other person I didn't recognize was Jessica Chastain, one of my least favourite actresses in Hollywood. I think she is so over-hyped and her lacklustre performances drive my nuts and yet I didn't even realize this was her and guess what...I didn't mind her one bit. In fact, she makes a terrific villain with a lot of bite and a serious weird aura about her character. Her chemistry with Wasikowska is perfect bizarre and she definitely adds to the mystery of the story. In my opinion Tom Hiddleston is brilliant in his role as the mysterious and romantic Thomas Sharpe. This is a great role for Hiddleston to show mainstream fans he is far more than just a Marvel villain. I found him charismatic and captivating on screen. After a hilarious terrible performance in Pacific Rim (a complete joke of a movie in my book) I thought Charlie Hunman should have stuck to Sons of Anarchy. He was rotten in Pacific Rim. While I'm glad to say that he can act! His supporting role in this film is very good and he actually shows some talent and is a worthy hero in a small role so I am back to giving him a chance again. Jim Beaver is also very good in a supporting role as Wasikowska's father. (Loved him in Supernatural and good to see him getting film roles.)Some would say that Guillermo del Toro is a master of Gothic style. He definitely has his own style and loves outlandish monsters or creatures and this has worked and it hasn't. It has worked in huge amazing astonishing ways (Pan's Labyrinth) and it has crashed and burned (Pacific Rim - don't argue, the movie was god awful.) Crimson Peak is a much more subtle nod to his style. Its like a dream world and you see things that really stand out and are so memorable. At first, I even thought the film was very slow and I wasn't sure where it was going and then all the pieces start to fall into place and the mystery unravels and the gore rears its head and by the end I was completely astonished. Short of the film being just a tad clumsy in the story department this could have been a solid ten. I thought the performances were very good but as many reviewers have said this movie's bread and butter is in its visuals. I'm not someone that usually raves about artistic merit unless it really impresses and this certainly does. Horror fans must see this. 9/10",Crimson Peak
36,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A story with ghosts in it.,8,4 May 2020,"Guillermo Del Toro is the master of making movie violence feel shocking and painful, often pushing the boundaries of genre (and rating) to deliver moments that genuinely make you wince. 'Crimson Peak (2015)', a lavish ode to gothic horror that owes a huge debt to films such as 'The Haunting (1963)' and 'The Innocents (1961)', is peppered with such moments. Though it plays with themes often seen in the famous director's work, the piece puts its self together as a competent, confident and compelling story about love and monsters. Of course, the thing isn't about ghosts, even though it has plenty of ghosts in it. Perhaps this abundance is its weakest aspect, actually; the hellishly red spectres that haunt its eponymous family home are almost too overt for their own good, juxtaposing the otherwise restrained vibe of the horror and creeping incredibly closely to the realm of 'cartoon'. Nevertheless, the narrative is effective and the scare sequences are well-crafted. An unconventional pacing lets you know immediately that the plot revolves around its protagonist, not just the ghostly goings-on she unwittingly gets involved with. The performances are all great, even when they aren't all that spectacular. Hiddleston, especially, is impressive in his surprisingly layered role, carrying the weight of a lot of the affair's late-game twists and their nuances. The twists themselves all feel natural and a few are actually surprising. There's a good amount of foreshadowing and a back-and-forth dynamic that keeps you on your toes. Overall, the flick is great. Amidst its beautifully desolate set-design is an intriguing, almost atypical story that feels decidedly - and delightfully - old school. 8/10",Crimson Peak
37,dromasca,a story with ghosts,7,10 July 2020,"Any film made by Guillermo del Toro has a visual style that makes it recognizable at a glance, whether it's a sequence or a 'still' photo taken from the film. 'Crimson Peak ' made in 2015 is an excellent example, being perhaps the most 'del Toro' of del Toro's films. From the point of view of fantasy and visual imagination, the film is excellently designed, which makes it far exceed the average level of vintage horror films. In del Toro's filmography, however, this film is not one of his top films. The reason may be that by placing the story in the genre of movies in which ghosts and their relationships with humans play a key role in the action, the director (also a co-author of the script) seems to have borrowed and made the most of all the set effects, but works too little to the supernatural element. Those who see the film will find that the ghosts show up in copious quantities and in impressive appearances, but do not play an important role in the action. To paraphrase a dialogue in the film, it is a story with ghosts, but not a ghost story.The story begins in the New England of the first years of the 20th century where young heiress and socialite Lucille Sharp (Mia Wasikowska) falls in love with a young Brit inventor Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) which his father believes to be the wrong man for her. When his father dies a violent death nothing can prevent any longer Lucille to Marry Thomas and move with him and his piano playing sister (Jessica Chastain) to England. Their location is a remote mansion which seems to have witnessed plenty of atrocities that may not be over actually, a fact that the which the ghost-communicating American young woman (did I mention that she has the talent to speak with ghosts?) will face soon. Soon we will be together with the heroes in the middle of a Gothic horror movie.I have already written about the visual qualities of the film. Guillermo del Toro invented a cinematic world in his films in which people coexist with ghost, spirits and strabfe life forms, in which water and retro technologies play a significant role, in which red is a counterpoint to white, and black and shadows have thousands of different shades. The director directs his actors with professionalism and controls them with precision, completely erasing almost any trace of their personality, melting them into masterfully designed costumes and the extreme feelings of the heroes. We were in a gloomy and violent fairy tale, with a somewhat predictable outcome. With an extra touch of inventiveness and creativity, 'Crimson Peak ' could have been a memorable film.",Crimson Peak
38,ThomasDrufke,Bloody Visual Spectacle,6,17 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro is that kind of superstar director that brings audiences to the seats no matter the genre of film. Much like Nolan, Spielberg, and Tarantino, Del Toro draws fans to see the next visual spectacle he brings to the screen. Make no mistake about it, Crimson Peak is an awe to see on the big screen, especially in IMAX. Unfortunately I think the marketing team hurt Del Toro's film this time around. The trailers were centered around this house and the ghosts that supposedly haunted it. While I loved the trailers for what they were, they didn't properly represent the movie as it actually is, which is most definitely a Gothic romance.The film stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, and Charlie Hunnam. We focus on Edith, played by Wasikowska as she deals with a recent family tragedy without anywhere to go and no one to stay with. Enter Hiddleston and Chastain, playing Thomas and Lucille respectively, who seem to target Edith specifically. As Thomas and Edith grow closer to each other, he brings her to his childhood house, which is conveniently miles away from the next home or any part of civilization. It also happens to have an issue with the red clay that stains the snow around the house and floods underneath during the winter. This gives the whole feel of the movie a bloody undertone. While the film isn't really a horror film, it certainly has frightening elements. Edith is constantly haunted by not only the ghosts of Crimson Peak but her mother's for whom she basing a book around. The strongest aspect of Crimson Peak is the visual spectacle you're given. Whether it's the costume design, special effects, or the sets themselves, this film is gorgeous. So there's no denying that seeing it in theaters is the way to go. The problem is that the film itself isn't all that original, and the characters aren't all that interesting. The first act is rather slow but the climax most definitely makes the film worth seeing. The performances are all great, in particular Wasikowska and Chastain, which in some way make up for the lack of character development. Go see the movie if you want to see a visual spectacle, but not if you want a horror-ghost centered film.+Visually stunning+Performances all around+Climax-Not all that scary-Starts slow6.8/10",Crimson Peak

This movie is visually mesmerizing. The sets, the costumes and the visual effects are hauntingly memorable. However, the pacing is dreadfully slow and the plot is not as engaging as I hoped it would be. I liked this movie, but I wanted to like it more.",Crimson Peak

Edith (Wasikowska) has been haunted by the death of her mother since a young age. She still sees her every once in a while as well as other ghostly images. Wanting to be more than just a woman waiting to get married she attempts to write and catches the eye of Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston). After the death of her father she marries Thomas and returns with him to a mysterious house that holds secrets of the past. I am not a huge horror movie fan, but I was looking forward to this one because I do like Guillermo del Toro movies. That said, I was a little disappointed in this one. The movie was just a little too slow moving for me. I loved Pan's Labyrinth and the horror movies he has produced like Mama and Splice but I really just couldn't get into this one. I'm not saying this was a bad movie because it was good and the acting was great. The movie relied on psychological horror rather than jump scares or gore, but there was just something missing for me to be able to get fully involved in. Overall, not a bad movie at all, but disappointing after my high expectations based on the directors previous work. I give this a B-.",Crimson Peak
41,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,7,11 February 2016,"Crimson PeakTo really make it as a female novelist in the nineteenth-century one had to adopt a penname ending in Brontë.Instead, the fledging author in this thriller accepts the surname of a baronet.Following her father's funeral, horror-fiction fan Edith (Mia Wasikowska) weds a British industrialist (Tom Hiddleston) who transports her across the pond to his Gothic estate, where he works and resides alongside his sister (Jessica Chastain).But buried beneath the red clay of the country manor are restless spirits that haunt Edith, warning her of her hosts' iniquity.From director Guillermo del Toro and featuring a bevy of sinister performances, Crimson Peak is a stunningly shot Victorian ghost story with atmospheric set design and a palpable sense of dread. All of which, help to elevate it past the gratuitous gross-out of standard horror schlock.However, lesser minds are going to assume that everyone at Crimson Peak is menstruating.

42,851222,Good production values and a paper thin story,7,20 February 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Crimson Peak"" (2015) is kinda disappointing movie in my opinion. While it looks very good, and very good actors did a uniformly nice job, the story here is what makes this movie quickly forgettable. When movie progresses and the story starts to make clear you will see everything coming from a mile. Story is very predictable. And while there are really scary moments in this story, this makes sometimes for a dull viewing. The ending kinda was laughable, slasher type flick with many sharp objectives are being used in a ""battles"". Overall, ""Crimson Peak"" has good overall movie craftsmanship, but it lacks fresh or more original story. By the end it was just so boring and predictable - director has already used this very similar story in previous movies. It is not a bad movie for one viewing, but it isn't scary nor it is visionary, it's just a very mediocre movie with good costumes, actors, set design and directing. Good script and overall story - that is what this movie lacks.",Crimson Peak

44,clanciai,Ghost hunting in a maze of a family of heavy traumas,9,4 January 2021,"This is not bad for being an ordinary horror and ghost story, but there is actually an interesting point in it. Mia Wasikowska is a young beautiful daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur in America, but she has lost her mother and wants to get along in life by writing ghost stories. She has no success until a young handsome aristocrat comes across from England and seemingly falls in love with her, so he takes her along to his family estate in Cumberland, north England, a rather scary place suitable to Poe stories. here she gradually gets more and more like imprisoned at the mercy of Ton Middleston, her lawful wedded husband, baronet, and his sister, who is a cool piano player. However, they have some awful family secrets, and thus an endless horror nightmare begins with all kinds of atrocities, murders and bloodsheds and so forth, until an American doctor friend comes across who has suspected some nasty business, and he gets dragged into the mess of a horribly afflicted family. The film is marvellously well made, like all del Toro's films,. and a wonder to look at from beginning to end, the splendour constantly towering new visual wonders on top of all the previous ones, building up almost architecturally to a most impressive spectacle, while the sum of it all actually turns out to give her palpable evidence of that ghosts do exist in reality, which was her main object to prove from the start. But who will believe it?",Crimson Peak
45,Reno-Rangan,"Ghosts are real, that much she knows!",6,14 April 2016,"Seen all the Del Toro films, but this one was not any good compared to his recent year's class. The film has his signature mark, the Gothic style atmosphere, visually spectacular, but the story did not strike as expected. Definitely my blame is on the writing department. Though the actors were so much better in their character exhibition, especially the lead trio.The opening convinced it will going to be a terrifying horror. Seriously? The writer brought ghosts for a concept, but ended penning a fantasy-thriller. In the middle of the narration there was too much drama that dragged the story. And in the third act it turned totally into a killer-thriller. It should have been more frightening, they wanted it to be a faulty human nature kind of twist than supernatural things. Well, they gave what they wanted, not what we the audience looking for.I did not completely disliked the movie, I enjoyed it other than its plot. The costumes were very nice, the music well blended with the screenplay, but I was disappointed with the reason given as the motivation for all the trouble faced by character Edith. After all the hype, what it revealed was too little and too sudden with guessable stuffs. You can try it for the visuals alone than anticipating another Del Toro's masterpiece.6/10",Crimson Peak

This is a very classy horror fantasy and I enjoyed every moment.",Crimson Peak
47,tomgillespie2002,A very mixed bag,6,4 November 2018,"If you were to task both critics and general audiences with naming their favourite active directors, I would place a bet on Guillermo del Toro being the first name on the lips of many. The Mexican monster-lover has the unique ability to juggle both passion projects that clearly mean a lot to the filmmaker, and large-scale blockbusters to appease the studios, and this one-for-me, one-for-you approach has allowed to him to bring to the screen some incredibly personal stories which would have otherwise been left to linger in the director's imagination. So for every The Devil's Backbone, we got a Hellboy, and for every Pan's Labyrinth, we got a Pacific Rim. 2015's Crimson Peak was del Toro's first attempt at blending these two styles. Movie lovers could admire the breathtaking visuals and attention to detail, while the general audience could enjoy a juicy gothic mystery featuring some of the industry's most attractive stars. The result is a very mixed bag.In turn-of-the-century New York, heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) dreams of becoming an author, but finds herself dissuaded at every turn by the men holding the power. Her father, wealthy businessman Carter (Jim Beaver), is visited by English travelling salesman Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who is seeking investment for his clay-mining machinery. The dashing bachelor is shut down by Carter, but catches the eye of Edith, and two begin a romantic affair. When Carter dies, Edith marries Thomas and travels to his home Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, a decaying mansion dubbed 'Crimson Peak' due to the red clay oozing up from the ground. Joining them will be Thomas' ice-cold sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain), who seems to harbour a resentment for her brother's new wife. But Crimson Peak has stories to tell, and Edith's unexplained connection to the spirit world means that she is frequently visited by hideous tormented ghosts carrying warnings. Back in the U.S., former suitor Dr. McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) is conducting his own research into the Sharpes and their shady history.Del Toro has always excelled at building tangible worlds which seem to live and breath alongside the characters, and the rotting interiors of Allerdale Hall is one of the director's greatest achievements. Lush with exquisite detail, the house pulses with menace, tormenting Edith with locked doors and taps that spurt red before running clear. There's even a hole in the ceiling that allows snow to gather at the bottom of the main staircase, and the splashes of bold colour evoke the likes of Mario Bava, Dario Argento and Hammer. It's a feast for the senses, and it's just enough to distract from the mediocrity of the main story and the inclusion of CGI spectres. The mystery unravels quite beautifully, but the problem is that you'll already be two or three steps ahead. Nothing that happens in Crimson Peak will come as a surprise, especially after you've quickly realised that anyone with an English accent can't be trusted. The film loses its physicality somewhat when attempting to deliver the scares, as twisted ghosts crawl and squeal their way towards Edith. Computer-generated apparitions will never be scary, and Crimson Peak packs way more impact when catching you off guard with moments of extreme violence that will make you wince and cry out without averting your gaze. Rank this somewhere above Pacific Rim and below Hellboy II.",Crimson Peak
48,filipemanuelneto,A good psychological horror film.,8,30 December 2018,"This movie is really good. Set in the late 19th century, the psychological horror film bet heavily on building a scary environment. The time chosen helps: it is the time of long dresses, Victorian superstitions, neo-Gothic houses full of shadows and sullen, gloomy appearance. All thought to detail, as usually happens when we have Guillermo del Toro at the helm.The story is simple: a young American, daughter of a wealthy capitalist, engages with a poor but stout British aristocrat in search of funding to revive his family's centuries-old clay mines. However, her father is against and decides to scare away the Englishman and his dark sister, dying soon after, very conveniently for them. Thus, a few months later, the young woman is on English soil, married and living in a dark and shattered house. There are hidden dark secrets that she will gradually discover ... and that will reveal the true face of her new husband.Okay, let's first look at the problems: the script is pretty solid but it has a blazing hole: the stupid idea of making a very expensive machine to extract clay which, it seems, is so surface that it even threatens the structural stability of the house built in top. It is something that even during the film leaves anyone to think and I do not know how del Toro, a usually detailing director, let this fault escape. On the other hand, the scares are quite predictable and, at least I did not feel so scared. I like it, the movie shudders, it causes chills, and there's enough blood and gore for audiences who are looking for this sort of thing, which is not really my case, but it was not that movie that made me afraid to turn out the light in the room .Mia Wasikowska was perfect for her character. She knew how to be sweet and fragile while being brave and reacting to danger. At times, she knew how to look like a damsel in distress, but in others she was stronger than any man in the cast. Tom Hiddleston did his part quite well, revealing doubts about his own feelings. In the background, his character is quite fragile psychologically. More powerful and dominant is Jessica Chastain, an actress full of strength who has mastered the film.Technically, the film surprises by the highly elaborate scenarios and by the decadent and grandiose mansion, where everything happens. The blood-red color of that substance that in the film is clay also helps, along with snow white, to make the film visually more impressive. The good construction of the scenes combines harmoniously with a somber cinematography, but not enough to remove color brilliance.",Crimson Peak
49,leonblackwood,Expected better from del Toro! 4/10,4,6 March 2016,"Review: I was expecting this movie to be about sophisticated, blood sucking vampires but it just turned out to be about a twisted brother and sister, who would do anything to get money to save there mansion and family business. Personally I found the pace of the movie quite slow and the gullible young woman, Edith (Mia Wasikowska) was extremely easy pickings for the creepy but seductive Thomas (Tom Hiddleston). His weird sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), was weird from the beginning of the film, so I wasn't surprised when she turned out to be a total psycho but the reoccurring ghosts that were popping in and out of the film, didn't really lead to anything. Also, what was going on with the dog? I thought that it was going to play an important part, when the story unfolds but that didn't go anywhere either. You can work out where the film is going, right from the beginning but with that aside, the performances from Hiddleston and Chastain were great. Wasikowska's performance was pretty average, mainly because she didn't think that anything suspect was happening until she opened the letters and listened to the records but Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) and her father Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), could smell trouble as soon as Thomas entered the room. Anyway, it's not a bad movie, for a period drama but I personally was expecting more. Average!Round-Up: Tom Hiddleston, 35, has become a bit of a screen icon since his great performance in Thor and the Avengers franchise, so I'm not surprised that this movie made a healthy profit at the box office. He's rumoured to star in the next Thor movie, Thor: Ragnarok, as Loki, and he's currently starring in the hit series, the Night Manager which has been getting some great reviews. He is definitely a unique actor who can tell a story through his eyes and emotions, so he was the perfect choice for this movie. When I saw that this movie was being directed by Guillermo del Toro, 51, my expectations were very high, because of his enormous attention to detail and unique storytelling methods. I wasn't that impressed with Pacific Rim but I really enjoyed the Hellboy franchise, Mimic and Pan's Labyrinth. After departing from the Hobbit project, even though he spent month's working on pre-production and created a whole story board, he sadly had to hand the project back to Peter Jackson because MGM went bankrupt. Anyway, although this is a watchable movie it's not one that I can watch time and time again. Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $75millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/fantasy/horrors starring Tom Hiddleston, Mia Wasikowska, Charlie Hunnam, Jessica Chastain, Jim Beaver, Burn Gorman and Leslie Hope. 4/10",Crimson Peak

51,Fella_shibby,Definitely stay away from crimson peak.,5,13 March 2016,"The movie starts reasonably well, albeit predictably, but then descends very badly. It was very predictable, boring, slow, in no way original and way too long. This movie was not scary nor suspenseful. Its not creepy. I mean, this is supposed to be a horror movie, I thought. But it doesn't manage to build up creep or shock effects. The writing was terrible, the screenplay hardly makes sense. The explanation was forced and the movie ended very badly. The ghosts? What was the point of them?? They had nothing to do with the plot and the cgi was terrible. The ghosts were laughable rather than scary. The crawling ghost looked like the demon from hellraiser. The big old house with a preposterous hole in its roof had an eerie n mysterious feel but that couldn't save the film.Not a single original idea (other than perhaps the setting). Anyone who has seen a previous horror movie directed/produced/written by Del Toro, here's a caveat:Don't expect to be scared. It has none of the tension or shocks of ANY of his previous horror endeavors. The first thing to realize is that Crimson Peak is not your typical horror film. It's exactly what del Toro had said during promotions that this movie was a Gothic romance and not necessarily a horror movie. Fair enough but too predictable n lame. So in the end, this film will definitely turn off anyone wanting loads of jump-scares and a very horror focused film. Cinematography by Dan Laustsen was good. Editing by Bernat Vilaplana was lousy. Mia Wasikowska acting was wooden n her character was too naive n immature n unbelievable. Jessica Chastain looked as if she was forced to do this film. Tom Hiddleston, the only saving grace of this movie. He acted his part well. I was wondering y the mother of the Sharpe siblings looked so horrible. Even Mia's character tells to Lucille that their mother was dreadful. Later when I read the credits, I came to know that it was the male actor Doug Jones who portrayed as Lady Sharpe in the portrait. Interestingly he portrayed as Edith's (Mia's) mother too.",Crimson Peak
52,matthewssilverhammer,Beautifully Dark Visuals Overshadowed by Graceles Narrative & Clunky Themes,5,23 October 2015,"Director del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy) creates beautifully lush, twisted and horrific imagery in his films, skillfully highlighting his nightmarish designs when appropriate yet allowing them to just exist subtly at times. Crimson Peak is no different; there are frames here that would fit snuggly within any Gothic art gallery. With bright cartoon-like colors on top of superbly stylized darkness, we're transported into this world with ease. Unfortunately, del Toro seems to have become less interested in effective storytelling than style. Behind CP's layers of dark beauty is a graceless narrative with clunky themes. It's an ambitious tale, no question. Without giving too much away, we follow Wasikowska's character, a young heir haunted by ghosts, as she moves to an eerie old mansion with her new husband (Hiddleston) and his withdrawn sister (Chastain). Along the way, it confuses quantity of thought with quality. It's individually competent as a haunted house / costume drama / tragic romance / Gothic mystery, yet juggles them clumsily. It deals with interesting ideas about misplaced fear and the danger of mindless attraction, but with much too heavy a hand (literal moths flying towards light). It's delivers unendingly strange characters through powerhouse performances, but blunt symbolism and overly flowery dialogue cloud them from truly shining. These dichotomies are frustrating, especially when it's all set within one of the greatest creepy houses in cinema history; it's dark, charactered, and fully alive abode that is like a ghost itself. It's much more intriguing than the journey of our protagonist, which never allows for mystery or surprise of any kind. All of this adds up to an oddly inconsequential outing for one of our modern visual masters.",Crimson Peak
53,Vartiainen,Mediocre Gothic horror,5,11 September 2016,"This film reinforces my belief that Guillermo del Toro is a much better geek director than he is a horror one. All of his geek movies are great, from Hellboy to Pacific Rim, but I've never really liked any of his horror films. Well, Pan's Labyrinth is good, but that has heavy fantasy elements in it, so it kind of straddles the fence.So, what's good about Crimson Peak? Well, it looks great. Del Toro is such a huge name that he certainly has the budget – and the vision – to pull off some amazing visuals. The costumes, the sets, the monsters. All them look amazing and distinct. Plus, he has pulled in some really top notch actors, most notably Tom Hiddleston, who's easily the best part of the entire flick. Not to say that Mia Wasikowska, playing the main character Edith, isn't talented, but Tom is Tom. He steals every scene he's in.Then the problem. And there's really only a single one. It's so clichéd. And I get it, del Toro wanted to make a classic horror film. But when I can tell exactly how it's going to go, scene by scene, after having watched five minutes, it's not going to be enjoyable to watch. And I'm not saying that every single movie has to be an unique snowflake of specialness, but even a classic plot needs something to separate it from the others. And Crimson Peak has none of that, aside from its bigger than average budget. The story is boring and predictable, plain and simple.Still, it has del Toro's signature touches all over it and its production values are top notch. Fans of Gothic horror could do a lot worse. Though they could do a lot better equally as well.",Crimson Peak

Maybe I'm too open minded. There is some sexual content and the spirits in the film were quite grotesque, but I feel I've seen far more in a PG-13 film. Crimson Peak is a tale of a young writer who was warned by her mother's ghost of a great disturbance that would come to her life many years later when a tall dark and handsome stranger, played by Tom Hiddleston, sweeps her off her feet and entangles her in his secrets on top of secrets. All the actors were great in this film but the most noteworthy performance comes from Jessica Chastain who plays Lady Lucille Sharpe, a woman who comes on the screen from the get go haunting and frightening. It was fantastic.Guillermo del Toro is a true artist, and master of the craft of film making.

That is what one of the characters in the movie says about a story that she wrote and tried to get published and that line applies to this movie, too. It's directed by Guillermo del Torro-Pacific Rim, the Hellboy movies, Pan's Labyrinth-and is chock full of good Gothic mood. Mia is the afore mentioned girl that wants to be a writer. She meets Tom, a mysterious young man that woos her off her feet and she is soon married to him. Only problem is that Tom has a weird sister, Jessica, that comes along and lives with the newlyweds at his house way out in the countryside, far away from anyone. The house is built on red clay, which has a tendency to ooze up from the ground every once in a while-that is where the title of the movie Crimson Peak comes from, it's a nickname for the homestead. After getting settled in to the house, Mia starts seeing ghosts and before we go any further, this is not her first ghost spotting. That first time was when she was about 10 years old, right after her mother died-it was her mother's ghost that came to tuck her into bed late one night. Charlie plays Mia's family doctor that also used to like Mia, back before she got married to Tom, and suspects that things are not all rosy with the marriage.

The answer isn't a simple one.This isn't a movie for everyone--It certainly wasn't for me.--but it's a movie that I can appreciate, if not exactly like, for its technical craftsmanship. As with all of del Toro's films, it's a visual feast, and can be appreciated on the strength of that alone. The cast is filled with wonderful actors sincerely and earnestly sinking their teeth into the soppy melodrama, making it work better than it probably should.My gut tells me this is probably a bit of a polarizing film. If it's in your wheelhouse, you'll probably love it. If not, the two hour runtime is likely to be more painful than the corsets the ladies are wearing.",Crimson Peak
58,kirbylee70-599-526179,THE ULTIMATE VERSION,9,17 January 2019,"I've been a fan of Guillermo del Toro for some time. I enjoyed MIMIC when some slammed it. I loved his following films like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, BLADE II, HELLBOY, PAN'S LABYRINTH and PACIFIC RIM. So when I heard he was going to turn his attentions to a ghost story I was primed. How could he fail? The fact is he couldn't and didn't. CRIMSON PEAK is one of the best ghost/haunted house films ever made and among my top 4 in the category.In 1887 Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), daughter of wealthy businessman Carter, is warned by the ghost of her mother to ""Beware of Crimson Peak"". Time passes and in 1901 she finds herself looking for work. At the same time she meets Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who has come to seek backers for his invention, a clay mining device. Along with Thomas is his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Edith soon falls for Thomas to the disapproval of both her father and her childhood friend Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam). So much so that he bribes Thomas to leave his daughter.But Thomas writes her a letter and the two marry. Before her father can disinherit her, he is brutally murdered. Grieving Edith accompanies her husband and sister-in-law to their home in England, Allerdale Hall. The mansion is falling to pieces, due in large part to the fact it is built on a huge deposit of red clay.As time passes Edith begins to see apparitions of various ghosts in the Hall. Lucille is cold to her and not the least bit welcoming. And Thomas has yet to consummate their marriage, too preoccupied with his invention. That changes on a night when they are snowed in and afterward Lucille flies into a rage. Edith begins to become ill shortly thereafter and as the snow falls she notices the entire location of the Hall has turned red outside. Thomas tells her that this is why some call the location ""Crimson Peak"", the red clay permeating the ground as it rises up and colors the snow red.The ghosts continue to plague Edith and more mysterious circumstances take place. Fearing for her safety Dr. McMichael has arrived in England to come to her aid. But will he arrive in time to save her from the various dangers the apparitions have warned her of? And just what is actually taking place in Allerdale Hall?The movie combines the best of ghost stories and haunted house tales to make a completely affecting film. Those involve not just the scary apparitions that appear to Edith but the entire make up of Allerdale Hall. Del Toro has given life not just to the participants of the story but to the entire location as well. The dilapidated state of the Hall, the crimson snow, the shadow filled hallways and twisting passages all work together to create and effective atmosphere that primes the viewer for what is taking place there.But the ghosts themselves are splendid as well. Once more del Toro uses actor Doug Jones to the best of his abilities to bring these manifestations of the undead to life. The combination of make-up and acting by Jones makes each of these creations believable and terribly frightening. When mixed with the location itself the movie provides the most effective ghost tale done in years.The entire cast deserves major credit for their performances here. Del Toro has brought out the best of each of them. Not one can be singled out among the rest. Each and every one of them does an amazing job. That they can come from the previous items they are known for and not once do you feel those past incarnations is a testament to their skills.But the movie came out in 2015 and the blu-ray has already been on the market since that time. So what reason would anyone have to buy a new copy of this? Well the obvious answer is that it's getting the Arrow Video treatment. If you don't know Arrow Video by now you're not aware of one of the best disc companies out there. Their releases provide the best version of any film they've released with plenty of extras on hand for those who enjoys them as well.Their version presents the film in hi-def blu-ray format. But it is the overabundance of extras that make this one special. Rarely do companies provide this much background on a release. The extras here include an audio commentary by co-writer/director del Toro, ""The House is Alive: Constructing Crimson Peak"" a feature length documentary on the making of the film, a previously unseen Spanish language interview with del Toro, ""The Gothic Corridor, The Scullery, The Red Clay Mines, The Limbo Fog Set"" four featurettes on the different aspects of Allerdale Hall, ""A Primer on Gothic Romance"" where the director talks about the specifics of Gothic romance, ""The Light and Dark of Crimson Peak"" in which the cast and crew discuss the use of color in the film, ""Hand Tailored Gothic"" a featurette on the costumes in the film. But we're just getting started. There is also ""A Living Thing"" a look at the design, modelling and construction of the Allerdale Hall sets, ""Beware of Crimson Peak"" a walking tour of Allerdale Hall with Tom Hiddleston, a look at CRIMSON PEAK and the tradition of Gothic romance by author and critic Kim Newman, ""Violence and Beauty in Guillermo del Toro's Gothic Fairy Tale Films"" a video essay by writer Kat Ellinger, deleted scenes, original trailers and TV spots, a double sided fold-out poster, four double-sided postcard sized lobby card reproductions, limited edition packaging with newly designed artwork by Guy Davis and a limited edition 80 page hard bound book featuring writing by David Jenkins and Simon Abrams, an archival interview with del Toro and original concept design illustrations by artists Guy Davis and Oscar Chichoni. It's almost as if watching this entire offering from Arrow will turn into less a movie viewing and more a binge watching weekend.I can tell you now if you hadn't already realized that I loved this movie. I watched it again about 2 months ago but when this version arrived I didn't feel obligated to watch it again I wanted to watch it again. And it was well worth it. And there is no doubt in my mind that I will revisit it again and again. If you've not seen it then by all means make a point of doing so.

59,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Breathtaking,9,27 October 2015,"31 Days Of Horror: Day 22Guillermo Del Toro's Crimson Peak is the most visually arresting film of his career, and one of the most ravishingly beautiful Gothic horror movies I've ever seen (I'm in love with the sub genre). It's been a few years since his last film, the also visually excellent but somehow hollow Pacific Rim, and here he pulls out all that stops and returns to his world of consistently entertaining, emotionally rewarding fantasy horror, back on his game with the best work since Pan's Labyrinth. It's got a Hammer horror studios vibe, drenched in lurid, Mary Shelley-esque atmosphere and starring one of the most haunted houses I can think of in recent cinematic memory. Mia Wasikowska keeps doing star making turns, and she's both vulnerable and gutsy here in a very well written role as aristocratic Edith Cushing, an aspiring horror novelist and daughter of a plucky New York industrialist (Jim Beaver). She is smitten by darkly mysterious Brit nobleman Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who is visiting Buffalo. He is accompanied by his strange sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain in full demented mode) who bristles at the sight of Edith. After a family tragedy she is married to Sharpe and whisked off to his mansion in the barren moors of Northern England. The house, called Allerdale Hall, is a craggy, crumbling wonder of edifices, flying buttresses, fanged corridors, and lurching ghosts that wail horribly and follow Edith around. The wind shivers down the various chimneys, giving the illusion of breathing (well, moaning really) and the walls ooze (bleed) syrupy red sludge from the Crimson clay the house rests upon. It's such an evocative set, so much imagination and spectacle poured into it that as soon as they arrive the film takes on a whole new unique life. Edith uncovers ghastly secrets within the house, the origin of its ghosts, and the surprisingly dark past of Thomas and Lucille, which comes back to haunt all three of them. Hiddleston nicely balances the dashing yet creepy qualities of Sharpe quite well, his kind and conflicted actions desperately trying to mask the twisted nature beneath, which we see brief glimpses of in his unnerving gazes at Edith. Chastain steals the show when she cuts loose in a highlight sequence near the end, and she gets to really go for it, her trademark subtlety substituted by a frenzy of murderous emotion and bug eyed insanity, a startling treat to watch. Bland Charlie Hunnam is out of place as a doctor from back home, in love and searching for Edith. Del Toro once again sets his imagination loose, and has claimed he like to make not eye candy, but 'eye protein'. He wasn't kidding. He nicely balances a freaky first act of classic haunted house histrionics with a shockingly blood soaked finale of operatic violence that more than earns its R rating.",Crimson Peak
60,drownnnsoda,Dressed to impress,6,17 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro's long-anticipated ""Crimson Peak"" follows a young, aspiring writer, Edith (Mia Wasikowska) who, at the turn of the 20th century relocates from Buffalo, New York to a dilapidated estate in rural England with her newfound husband, Thomas (Tom Hiddleston), and his ice queen sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Edith's clairvoyant abilities quickly tip her off that something isn't quite right in the house, and it's not before long that she is being tormented by the dead who bear warnings tailored specifically for her.If you're at all familiar with Guillermo del Toro, you know what to expect in the visuals department. The trailer for this film alone is a testament to how beautiful it is, so I'm hesitant to weight my review of the film with too much about the aesthetics, because it's obvious— this film is gorgeous. It is Del Toro's take on Victorian Gothic, and every visual component is meticulously attended to. The elaborate sets of the mansion recall the big-budget, hyper-Gothic sets of Jan de Bont's 1999 ""The Haunting"" remake, a comparison that's being made often, not because it's an easy one, but because it's apt. There are also shades of late Mario Bava-esque visuals in the color palettes and framing (some have claimed there's an Argento undercurrent, which I personally didn't see). In any case, this is a visually phenomenal film. Unfortunately, that's where the phenomenal ends.Some audiences have taken issue with the film's genre-straddling, criticizing the fact that it has been marketed as a horror film when it is really more of a Gothic romance. That's an asinine argument for multiple reasons, chiefly because Gothic fiction gave birth to horror as we know it, but even aside from that, this is a non-issue. The real problem with ""Crimson Peak"" is that its characterization is weak— little more, little less. We have a cast of capable performers here filling the shoes of these roles, and you'd expect there to be some vitality in the characters, but—well, there's not.It is difficult to pinpoint the root of the film's poor characterization; I think it's an amalgamation of things, including the dialogue, the editing, and, in some instances, the performances themselves, though I feel like the problem is less about the actors and more about the script. There is a pronounced feeling of artifice when it comes to the characters in ""Crimson Peak."" In some ways, they seem like caricatures of Victorian literature, but more than anything, there is a lack of dimension to them that is distracting. The establishment of Thomas and Lucille is haphazardly done, and Edith feels like a sloppy riff on Jane Austen. The fourth leg of the film, Dr. Alan, is hardly inaugurated into the story and feels almost disposable. The performances themselves are not bad, though I've always found Mia Wasikowska to be tedious on screen, and she does little here to sway my consensus on that. Hiddleston is menacing at times, while Jessica Chastain is perhaps the most present in her role, but even her air of mystery feels forced; this is, however redeemed later on in the film when she takes a Lady Macbeth turn that is fantastic to watch.Aside from this, there are other idiosyncrasies in terms of editing and technicality that are odd and distracting. There is a consistent, apparent use of bad dubbing in the film that is almost unacceptable. The film appears to have been heavily edited in the cutting room, and the dubbing is no doubt a result of that, but the pacing is also strange at times, and the film's climax, which actually has a very nice buildup, falls flat in the end. The film is surprisingly violent, and the special effects are appropriately visceral and effective, which is a plus.All in all, ""Crimson Peak"" is problematic. There is a classic Gothic story at the film's core that is cogent and engaging in spite of being imitative, and that will be an attraction for a portion of its audience; others will see the film because it is del Toro. The real issue I have with ""Crimson Peak"" is that its characters lack vitality, and that's a problem, especially with such a small cast. They are either overstated or understated but never in-between, which makes them difficult to engage with and leaves the film with a hollow knell. Of course it is visually breathtaking and exceptionally well shot, but you didn't need me to tell you that. 6/10.",Crimson Peak

62,kluseba,This year's best choice to celebrate Halloween in a Gothic way,7,29 October 2015,"''Crimson Peak'' is an entertaining and enjoyable Gothic movie with elements of supernatural horror, period crime and tragic romantic genres. The greatest parts of the movie are the settings and costumes. Some of it may not always be historically accurate but these elements sure add to the enchantingly creepy atmosphere of the film. They make both the growing metropolises in the North-Eastern part of the United States of America and the wild, rural and lonely landscapes of the United Kingdom and their respective societies come to life in an impressive way. The greatest element is the dilapidated mansion that almost feels like an additional character to the story due to its vast and rotten spaces, pale vestiges of old aristocracy and complex mysteries hidden in the numerous rooms and walls.The story itself is rather predictable but nicely narrated. The generic plot still works thanks to a solid acting performance by the feminist yet fragile character portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, the elegant yet sinister character played by Tom Hiddleston and the cold and evil character incarnated by Jessica Chastain. The relationship between the three is very ambiguous, engaging and tense.Even though this might neither be the movie of the year nor one of director Guillermo del Toro's best works, ''Crimson Peak'' is a spine-chilling Gothic movie that convinces with atmospheric settings and solid acting. If you're looking for a more classic, elegant and intellectual horror movie around Halloween this year, ''Crimson Peak'' should be your first choice.",Crimson Peak
63,davispittman,Well put together creepy film,8,4 January 2018,"Crimson Peak (2015) is a Guillermo Del Toro film, which means it has a good chance of being high quality. Del Toro is famous for his acclaimed film, Pans Labrynth. There are good things this had going for it, the director of course, and also the very talented cast. The cast includes Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston and more. They all played their roles well, special mention for Chastain, who gives a deliciously creepy, spot on performance as the suspicious sister in law. The plot is very intriguing and the advertisements really drew me in to watching it. I like how they executed the plot, for the most part at least. It has a nice build up, gives the characters some depth before just jumping straight into the scary/creepy stuff. But when the creepy stuff comes, it works. I liked that everything had a backstory, throughout most of the film you aren't really sure what all is happening, which is good, it builds suspense. Another big positive here are the visuals, they are just immaculate. The mansion, the snow, the ghosts.... I just really loved both the beautifully done production design and the creepy atmosphere that set the mood. The movie isn't a 10, but it is well done and it is one that I suggest. 8/10 for Crimson Peak.",Crimson Peak

The reason is simple. A horror movie is supposed to induce a feeling of fear, but here everything is so familiar the viewer can predict the next development or the next twist from the comfort of his chair. Indeed, ""familiar"" is an understatement, since we're talking about a series of tropes and conventions a Jane Austen would have recognized. Consequently the movie becomes about as scare-inducing or disquieting as the menu of a Chinese takeaway restaurant. You KNOW the menu is going to list spring rolls, Peking duck and egg fried rice ; and yes, those are the exact same items printed on the piece of paper in front of you.I'm awarding the movie three stars, for its superb art direction, its magnificent effects, its outstanding props and locations and its dazzling costumes.

66,ferbs54,One Of The Most Beautiful-Looking Horror Movies Ever Made,10,26 April 2017,"Just had the pleasure of seeing a Guillermo del Toro film that I had greatly wanted to see when it opened around 18 months ago, the Gothic masterpiece ""Crimson Peak."" The film stars Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston (whom most viewers, including myself, probably know best as Loki in Marvel's Thor and Avengers movies) and Jessica Chastain. In the film, which initially transpires in the Buffalo, NY region of the very early 20th century, Mia marries a destitute baronet, Hiddleston, and returns to his decrepit English mansion, Crimson Peak, along with his sister (Chastain). Her mother's ghost had twice warned her away from any place with that name, but off she goes, to her eventual regret. Soon enough, other ghosts arise to warn and frighten her, and she soon learns the terrible secrets of the place, and of her new husband and sister-in-law. The look of the film is absolutely spectacular, and how the costumers, cinematographers, set designers and set decorators for the film did not win Oscars is beyond me. This might be one of the most gorgeous-to-look-at horror films ever made! And yes, despite the love story at its core, this is most decidedly a horror film, and a pretty darn violent and bloody one as well. All three leads give superb performances, and practically every shot demands to be frozen on the screen and examined. The film grows wilder and crazier as it proceeds, and the finale is one not for the squeamish. This will surely go down for me as a nominee for Top 10 status come year's end, I have a feeling. I really did love this one. It's currently showing on many of the HBO channels, for those who get them....",Crimson Peak
67,s3276169,If Edgar Allen Poe had directed a film it would have been Crimson Peak,7,20 December 2015,"If Edgar Allen Poe had directed a film it would have been Crimson Peak. This film is a period piece firmly planted in the 19th century that oozes supernatural charm reminiscent of this period. Wraiths and specters of the kind writers like Poe envisioned, populate this world of the macabre. Underlying the supernatural theme, is a thriller, which mixes in elements of love and betrayal. The latter is somewhat predictable fair. Its fairly transparent where this story is going to take us. I think, that said, for a film of this kind, its hard for that not to be the case. The acting is above average but really its the gorgeous sets, costumes and really creepy creatures effects that bring this film to life. So does it matter if Crimson Peaks is not that original and somewhat predictable?. I'd argue that given this film pays homage to an earlier, less sophisticated, age of Gothic horror, no it does not. Of course, you may not agree and that's not unreasonable, either. This film is beautiful but not perfect. That said, I did enjoy it. I give Crimson Peak a seven out of ten.",Crimson Peak
68,aharmas,The Mystery of the Moving Picture?,4,17 October 2015,"Del Toro knows how to hire people who can build pretty sets and accurate costumes, but does he run out of money when hiring writers? His recreation of the last days of the 19th century are enough to keep you admiring until the last frame. The Gothic decor of the decaying mansion, the sumptouos dresses,the use of filters to bring nostalgia and supposedly other emotions to the forefront. Somewhere in here, we know there was a storyboard because this film seems be put together by the numbers and with the use of a checklist. Sadly, acting talent was wasted, and Del Toro must have been using a lot of his time ""writing"" this movie instead of paying attention to his directing duties.A mysterious couple appears in America to snare a young woman, whose goods they need in order to complete their project and satisfy their needs. A dashing gentleman, with the right credentials but lacking monetary means immediately raises a red flag, and the young lady's father is ready to prevent any tragedies. The father is soon literally removed from the picture, and the action moves on to the haunted mansion.This new setting proves to be too much for our heroine. She's now the target of supernatural beings' interests, the sacrificial lamb to the god of Greed, and another example of how this is the stillborn child of a team that aimed for what might have been a tribute but turned out to be a chaotic mess.We can help but thinking about much better films that might have been ""inspiration"" for this one. Del Toro and his partner give us references to everything from ""The Sixth Sense"" to ""Suspicion"" to ""Aliens"". Yet nothing works. Recently, much better suspense/horror cinema from both Japan and Spain have proved that imagination is not dead, and that it is not impossible to conjure a good scare. If you want haunted mansions, see ""The Orphanage"" or ""The Others"" with their surreal nightmares where just about everything could be just someone's imagination or a really twisted trick by the powers that be. A door slams and your heart stops. No need for graphic deluges or blood bath, or worse: bad CGI. The scarier thing here is how much money and talent was wasted behind, in front, and the attack on my pocket.The three leads have been amazing in other films, but they're are LOST here. Even the incredible Chastain can't handle the ludicrous lines and situation. Her incestuous relationship never shocks anyone because by the time we get there we're almost in a state of emotional catatonia. The romantic leads have very little chemistry, and we couldn't care less if they survive. I kept thinking about Mia in other films where she was a tortured soul, keeping us wondering if she would be able to survive the damage. I definitely missed the duplicity of Loki and wondered why this actor took on this role.Walls crumble, pipes rattle, snow turns red, critters crawl, ghosts evaporate and materialize in front of our heroine. People are violently killed, deviants attempt to destroy people's bodies and souls, but we might as well be watching a documentary, the filming of rehearsals, a casting audition in a very fancy and beautiful set. What is terribly sad is just how soulless this movie is. Somehow its heart was killed in the first frame. There's a reference to horrible a portrait is in the film. It's not even close to how horrible the experience of seeing this film is.",Crimson Peak
69,peterp-450-298716,Magnificent Gothic suspense but beware ... it's not horror (not for me anyway),6,15 January 2016,"""Ghosts are real. This I know."" ""Crimson Peak"" is visually overwhelming and ingeniously devised. Although it was a bit of a disappointment for me, it made a crushing, lasting impression on me on the other hand. Not because of the story itself or the cautious use of special effects, but the overall atmosphere and detailed decoration of this Gothic love drama. I assumed that this would be an excellent horror. And that because of the trailer. Normally I try to avoid trailers. But avoiding trailers in a theater is rather difficult. Eagerly I saw that it was about a house that comes to life. I was expecting a baroque-looking Amityville House. The house wasn't disappointing. A Victorian, ghostly ruin full of dark corridors, murky caverns and sinister secrets. The Adams family would be jealous. But apart from some ghostly apparitions it was no more than a obscure drama in which a romance and a diabolical fraud scenario occurred.Del Toro succeeded in surprising me with ""Splice"" and especially ""Mama"". After his intermezzo with ""Pacific Rim"", he returns to the darker and creepier genre. ""Mama"" was more frightening as a paranormal horror story than this movie. There are some great horror moments that will give you the chills. The scarce ghostly presences look pretty decent and occasionally it made me think of how the creature in ""Mama"" was moving around. But this movie's darkness is mainly achieved by the overall Gothic decorations. Both the sets and the costumes contributed to that. A house like a morgue. Deathlike, chilly with those blacks shades and rotting walls full of secrets, while standing on a blood-red surface.The characters of this Victorian era also look eerily deathlike. An appearance as if an undertaker took care of their makeup. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, the fragile daughter of a wealthy entrepreneur who wants to become a writer. Her literary work deals with ghosts. Since her childhood, she has the ability to see ghosts. Her mother, who died of cholera, visited her when she was only 10 years old and warned her for a place called ""Crimson Peak"". This particular moment is subtly visualized. A chilling moment that contrasts with the other appearances. And then she meets the likable, sophisticated English landowner Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) when he knocks at her father's door with the demand to help financing a modern clay machine. What follows is the predictable romantic development, a sudden tragedy and Edith deliberately seeking solace in the arms of Thomas. And before she knows it she's on her way to England to move into ""Allerdale Hall,"" the family patrimony which is sinking into the red clay, along with her husband Thomas and his sinister sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain).""Crimson Peak"" has its pros and cons. First there's the atmospheric cinematography. There's a huge Edgar Allan Poe feeling about it. Furthermore there are the beautiful costumes and the detailed decorations. And finally the solid acting and performances. Hiddleston, who reminded me of Coppola's Dracula at a certain moment, and Wasikowska act impressively. But Chastain rises above everyone as the crazy sister. The whole resembles a ride in a haunted house at the fair. Through the pitch-black darkness interspersed with deep colors, where you expect heart crippling shock effects anytime. And just like this haunted house at the fancy fair, the conclusion afterwards is that it wasn't so bad as expected. It wasn't boring, but it wasn't very scary either. The biggest mistake they made was having people believe ""Crimson Peak"" is a sort of horror. Ultimately, it's just a sentimental costume drama with a paranormal aspect. But believe me, it's masterfully portrayed! More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Crimson Peak
70,AudioFileZ,Imaginative Old-Style Horror Flick With A Fantastic Haunted House,7,8 November 2015,"I really did not think i would be too interested in Crimson Peak. I had heard it was set in Victorian Times and was a horror flick. But, this was from the creative mind of Guillermo del Toro who figured hugely into the Hellboy franchise and, recently, The Strain. With a talent like del Toro writing and directing chances were better than good this was worth a look. It definitely was and is.Crimson Peak wastes no time developing it's central character and her dilemma. Young Edith Cushing's mother has died causing a terrible hole in her life. While still a child she feels and sees a terrible apparition of her mother. Was it real or a dream? To Edith it seemed so real yet for years no more of these visits occur. Yet the fearful warning her quite ominous and scary looking mother left was about something to do with The Crimson Peak. It's brooding to be sure, but the words don't really make any sense to Edith. Keep in mind this is all set in a truly remarkable re-creation of a Victorian household in New York. This sets a very interesting stage which we immediately see the now mature Ms. Edith Cushing. We learn she's not only extremely articulate and well-educated, but an imaginative aspiring writer still living in her family's home with her important and successful father. Two men soon appear as if to both vie for her attention. One, her father's pick, young Dr. Alan McMichael and another more mysterious European young man. Sir Alan Sharpe, Baronet, seeking to gain a business relationship with Edith's father. We also meet Mr. Sharpe's sister Lucille and it seems almost immediate she will be a storm bringer of sorts. So mysterious and tasty and we're just past 15- minutes into the film. You gotta love del Toro's pace as much as his mysterious story. I think it is worth noting that del Toro's story has a few very odd pauses in which Edith while in the company of Thomas Sharpe is a bit of another world outside what is actually going on all around. For Edith it is on account of love and for Sir Alan it is due to his sister's brainwashing and otherwise strange upbringing. All this makes for a hook forging the viewer into Edith's obliviously dangerous situation.Yes, the real story is Edith and her ""situation"". I won't spoil del Toro's creepy yarn. Suffice to say it seems Edith is in way over her head and only has a vague unease until the secrets of his European estate come to light. And what a great haunted manor it is! Remember earlier it is well stated in her writing ambitions Edith believes in ghosts only as metaphorsshe is soon to see metaphors are sometimes as real as what they allude to. Crimson Peak is chock full of horror and great atmosphere. You just have to see it to see a fantastical creative mind at work in a genre that can be, for the most part, recycled. The cast is just as effective too. Recommended for all horror buffs and, perhaps mainstream audiences too. This is what I'd call a good old horror flick even if it's new.",Crimson Peak
71,Spondonman,Crimson Cheeks,7,14 February 2016,"With an atmospheric Gothic horror storyline and looking very stylish from the clips I'd seen, as a genre aficionado I considered it almost obligatory to see this effort. And I'm glad I've seen it – it was OK and brought back pleasant thoughts of Gaslight, Notorious and Ghost Breakers during the watching – but I also realise that del Toro has a violent cheek fetish. He portrayed one sliced open in Pan's Labyrinth, wrecked one and stabbed another to the bone in here. Whatever gets him through the night!Mysterious English Baronet and his sister inveigle themselves into American society in Buffalo and whisk away a rich young woman in search of romance and life; who finds only horror and death at her new husband's cold country home in Cumberland. There are expert jumps and gasps galore while their secret is being unravelled – but as usual with this director, he leaves many plot lines unfulfilled. What about the supposed body rising out of the vat of masala – nice thought, but they may have wanted something to show in the unused extras section of the DVD. The cgi cartoonery is generally superb, only the once reminding me of a Bugs Bunny cartoon when one ghost theatrically pulled himself out of a floor just begging for a hooting audience to tell him to Pull Himself Together.I enjoyed it – Tom Hiddleston always puts in a er top notch performance and this is worth watching at least once solely for him. Best seen in the cinema or with the lights off as even lively party scenes are set in the gloom for economy, sorry, atmosphere. However, as a modern Gothic horror movie it's almost faultless. It's only because of its occasionally childish undisciplined bestiality that means it won't live in my or even probably the collective memory fondly.

72,jadepietro,Bleak House,7,10 November 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: The house is stunningly bleak, but the screenplay is rather hopeless too.GRADE: BThings certainly go bump in the night in Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak, a Gothic romance tale that is so derivative of many other films before it. The visual showmanship is all up there on the big screen with its glorious set decor, eerie sound editing, and period costumes. And the director creates the perfect atmospheric mood and necessary tension with his customary style and pacing. In fact, this well-crafted film is so flamboyant and melodramatic in its excesses that it almost becomes a self-parody of the genre, but in a good way. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, our damsel-in-distress. After a rather long courtship in the form of a rich and handsome Mr. Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), which nearly takes up a third of the film, love brings her to the mansion named Allerdale Hall. ￼The house screams ""beware"" in every nook and cranny, but no one listens. In fact, there are so many crimson red flags obviously unfurled between Mr. Sharpe and his dour sister, Lucille, who watches over the place and tends to look oddly at her new sister-in-law whenever she enters the room. Any rational being would immediately question Edith's lack of common sense. Well, at least two other characters seem to think something is amok too: Edith's loving father (Jim Beaver, giving the most nuanced performance) and Charlie Hunnan as her spurned suitor.￼Experiencing Crimson Peak is a visual treat from the very first scene and the talented Guillermo del Toro still has that unique surrealistic viewpoint that defines his film work. Once again, the sumptuous settings he creates gives his film a distinct otherworldly style that enhances its threadbare plot. His directorial strength has always been in his strong images that overwhelm the narrative. And here, we get more of the same (yellow leaves that continually cascade downward inside a foyer, larger moths that flutter and land on VIctorian wallpaper, red-soaked winter landscapes that sharply contrast against ominous skies). Technically, it is a beautiful looking film.￼But the main fault, once again, lies in a barely adequate screenplay by Matthew Robbins and the director. Floors creak. Doors open. Corridors remain dark. Apparitions appear as quickly as they disappear...and there is the customary warning, ""Don't go into that dreaded basement!"" The clichés pile up and the story is all rote with the main problem being that there are no real twists or surprises. Characters are never fleshed out fully and remain two- dimensional, especially Lucille who should have been written more subtly. (There are no shocking revelations in this major character from the start and I'm not sure if the script or Ms. Chastain's odd interpretation is partially to blame.) ￼Crimson Peaks slowly turns into its own Frankenstein monster, with so many other movie parts stitched together to create this modern version. At times, the film seems more of a plagiarism of other film classics rather than an true homage. The filmmakers were surely inspired to make a creepy haunted house tale and they succeeded, at least visually. But one can sit here and count the many scenes and direct links to other horror films like Rebecca, Gaslight, The Innocents, The Haunting and The Shining, that only underscore the film's lack of originality. ￼ The actors try to add some depth to these sketchy characters but are not given much to do except register evil glances or horrified grimaces. They are mere props to their surroundings, no matter how ravishing it all is to behold. The scenery chews up the actors this time around, with Thomas E. Sanders' sumptuous production design, Bernat Vilaplana's concise editing, the fluid camera-work of Dan Laustsen, and of course, Mr. del Toro's working overtime.￼That said, it is still lots of fun and highly entertaining as the film builds to a bloody crescendo of Grand Guignol suspense. Crimson Peak is a creepy diversion. Ultimately, just like its ghosts, there's not much here except a lot of style and no real substance. But it is such a lovely way to die.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Crimson Peak

One night she gets a dream where her mother's ghost visits her, warning her to beware of Crimson Peak. Years later Edith is a writer on her early stories. She meets old friend Dr. Allan McMichael and her father's guest Englishman Sir Thomas Sharpe. Thomas comes to America in search of funding for his invention to work on red clay mining. Sensing something wrong with him Mr. Cushing denies Thomas the funding. Thomas and Edith grow closer especially after they dance at a party where his sister Lucille plays piano. Mr. Cushing investigates Thomas secretly. One evening Mr. Cushing, armed with a document about Thomas, forces him to break Edith's heart and leave, to which he does. But the next morning Mr. Cushing gets killed horribly. Lucille had left as requested but Thomas stayed on. Soon Thomas and Edith marry and Edith goes with him to England to his family house the Allerdale Hall.Edith starts to see things, mainly skeleton ghosts bathed in red. One night Edith gets awakened without Thomas on her bedside. She roams outside, and a ghost sighting leads her to the basement which houses crates and red clay ore storage. She finds a box with initials ES. Thomas casually informs Edith that when winter comes the liquid red clay seeps through snow turning it crimson; hence the name Crimson Peak, to Edith's shock. More ghost sightings frustrate Edith so Thomas decides to bring her to town. They spend the night in town due to a snowstorm, and Thomas consummates their marriage. As Lady Sharpe, Edith receives a few curious mails; one comes from Milan where she doesn't know anybody. Back home while Lucille left her keychain, Edith slips the key to the ES box. Reading her mail, she finds one from the Cushing family lawyer requesting her signature in transferring her assets to England. Before she signs, she reads the Milan mail, which is addressed to a woman named Enola and not her. She goes and opens the ES box and finds documents about three women including Enola, carrying her baby, all married to Thomas and died from poison. She tries leaving the house but the storm knocks her out. Thomas starts disagreeing Lucille in their plan, and Allan goes to England after learning about the Sharpes' past. Edith sees a ghost carrying a baby, so she addresses it as Enola. Ghost Enola points her to a room where she finds Thomas and Lucille making out. Lucile confronts Edith, throwing her from the balcony. Allan comes and patches Edith up. But when he tries to leave with Edith and reveals the Sharpes' lies, Lucille stabs him and tells Thomas to finish him. But Thomas whispers to Allan to fake his death in front of Lucille. Edith stabs Lucille and escapes. Thomas tells Edith about Allan and confronts Lucille. In her rage knowing Thomas loves Edith, Lucille stabs him repeatedly. Edith comes back for Thomas but instead finds Lucille enraged. Running from Lucille, Edith finally confronts her. She tells Lucille to look behind, much to Lucille's surprise as there stands Thomas, now a ghost. Edith strikes at the distracted Lucille, killing her. Though I seldom watch horror movies, I got say that this movie did a great job with the screenplay. It has many of the classic horror ingredients; that most horror movie must have perceived as mutually exclusive, mixed them all into one solid story. We can see elements of classic premonitions, ghosts, jump-scares, and even slasher movies, all packed into one semi Gothic horror thriller.For me it's quite bad that the movie didn't go all out in becoming either a horror or thriller; much like the director Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth didn't go all out in becoming either a horror or a children's movie. There's already hints that make the movie's twists and turns very predictable from early on. Also, aside from the main protagonist by Mia Wasikowska, the cast selection of Tom Huddleston, Jessica Chastain and even Charlie Hunnam easily reveals the dominant probability of how their roles will develop into.As a Guillermo del Toro work, this movie sure has his sense of imagination in terms of world building. Yes this movie doesn't boast crazy details like his previous works such as Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth, or even Pacific Rim, but Crimson Peak nicely uses the cinematography to portray the intended greatness of the settings. This is repeatedly done in shots of the Allerdale Hall's interior shots, and the moving camera in the ghost sightings.The acting overall feels very nice. Mia Wasikowska did great in depicting the innocent and gullible Edith, while Tom Huddleston played his parts convincingly in portraying the character depth as the spirited inventor and the guilt-worn accomplice. Jessica Chastain wrapped her character very well. Even though the story had been hinting from the earliest time her character comes in, the twist revelation still feels like punch. Charlie Hunnam did adequately in keeping his angle for the story quite believable.Crimson Peak (2015) gets a 7 out 10 score from me. A recommendation goes out as a so-so from me because despite the movie being quite good, it's not really a horror like many would anticipate it would be.",Crimson Peak
74,rgkarim,Mediocre Scares to Allow a Decent Plot,7,17 October 2015,"In the season of horror specials, I look for special gyms among the mediocre Halloween specials of today. So naturally I turn to the theater to provide me with the scare, creeps, and thrills to put me in the spooky mood. One movie that has shown promise is Crimson Peak, directed by Guillermo del Toro, the supposed master of horror. His work has provided such thrills in the past, but is the Peak capable of pushing one over the edge into a realm of nightmares and screams. As always read on to find out. With del Toro you never know what you are going to get, but in this film his direction seems to be story. Crimson Peak is certainly plot favored, actually focusing on the characters instead of just the scares. From the beginning we jump into Edith's (Mia Wasikowska) story, getting a look into her life and her relationships with our colorful cast. After a rather slow, detailed opening, there is a little ambiguity that lures you in to the second act. Once at the house, the true mystery begins, as you try to decipher the nuances of the obvious plot. I knew the general details, but piecing the motives, the drive, and deeper details was the real challenge in this movie. The few twists in the tale were decent, if disgusting, but this was a solid tale for a genre that is often lacking in the story department. In the acting department, del Toro's casting director did her homework incredibly well. Wasikowska performed very similar to her work in Alice, very primp, proper, and elegant without the awkward curiosity. I felt her responses to the CGI ghosts were kept in check and blended well with the more grounded moments of the film. Tom Hiddleston plays his old hat as the eclectic debonair blinded by ambitions and driven with a dark intensity to sting. He delivers his lines with poise, amplifying them with the right emotional edge to drive the dialogue home. Charlie Hunnam looks handsome (according to a few female audience members), and his acting isn't too shabby, though he takes a backburner to the rest of the cast. The best acting title of the movie though goes to Jessica Chastain who is like a chameleon changing tones, emotions, and parts at the drop of a hat. Chastain executes her part fantastically, capturing the dark environment and personifying it in her acting. By now I'm sure you're saying, ""Cut the crap, I want to know if it was scary!"" For this reviewer, Crimson Peak was not as scary as the trailers had made it to be. The scares are largely based on the surprising, jump out at you moments, but are so predictable (or obvious) that they lose their surprising sheen. In addition, the direction the film takes also dulls the edge of the scares, almost as if there is no threat to be had. The real ""scare"" factor is the design of the ghosts themselves. Rotten, decaying bodies drenched in crimson red and wraith black certainly establish a lovely picture. Their disjointed movements are also quite disturbing, the unnatural angles, the bone crunching and unholy screams mixing to form creatures that nightmares are made of. However, the house itself may play a big factor in upping the scare. A Victorian mansion filled with creaking floors, spacious halls, and dim lighting is a rather realistic stage to haunt. In fact, the creepiest aspect may be the manipulation of those shadows, to hide the visage of the dangers and steal the comfort of home away. Once more Del Toro allows your imagination to do the heavy lifting for making you squirm in your seat. Crimson Peak is one of the better horror stories, filled with mystery and character development. While not the scariest movies, the setting and use of shadows is a great tool to scare audiences. Del Toro just needed a little more honing and a slight change in plot to give you the scares that most of us wanted. Though there was a lack of screaming, it was a lot better than half of the mundane sequels and thrillers that come to the theater. I can't recommend this one for the theater, unless you are looking for a decent horror plot, so save this for watching home to maximize scares. My scores for Crimson Peak are:Drama/Fantasy/Horror: 7.5 (for drama) Movie Overall: 7",Crimson Peak
75,pc95,"Superficial, Style Over Substance",5,12 March 2016,"(spoilers) Director Guillermo Del Toro is too interested in look and style in his slick recent Ghost movie, ""Crimson Peak"" to spend time on glaring flaws with it. The acting involved is mixed with Mia Wasikowski turning in a substandard and poor performance. Other actors do better. But this is besides the main flaws of the movie: a poor story, cheap tricks, and inconsistent dialog. This all despite good set designs and costumes. As a ghost story, the movie fails. Ghosts are cgi-fest parlor tricks at best, lacking any creepiness. There's not nearly enough subtlety. If you're interested in a superior Ghost movie, check out ""The Others"" featuring Nicole Kidman. Can't really recommend this newer one movie. Mixed to poor 5.5/10",Crimson Peak
76,yoggwork,The atmosphere of terror is not so good,6,19 February 2019,"This film gives seven points, a little too much. The plot lays the groundwork and the transition are natural. The atmosphere of terror is not so good, and it belongs to the plot that knows who the bad guys are at a glance. I don't particularly want to understand, that rotten house, why do we have to go to live, will not feel cold?",Crimson Peak
77,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"""The nearest house is miles away, and the closest town is a half day's walk""",7,25 October 2015,"Well acted by its small primary cast, a woman, following the curious death of her father, marries and relocates to an isolated manor (known informally as Crimson Peak, due to the red clay underground, which seeps through the snow, and turns the white snow deep red) with her new husband, and his sister.All is not right, as his sister proves to be more chilling than the new fallen snow, and her obsession with serving her tea quickly becomes odd. Isolation further sets in, as the snowfall comes, and seals them in, ""The nearest house is miles away, and the closest town is a half day's walk"" we are told.Great looking sets, lighting, and costumes in this Gothic romance with horror undertones, which the trailer misleadingly made look like a supernatural horror. A few surprising burst of graphic violence seemed out of place, her father having her face struck against a sink three or four times, cracking a huge hole in his skull, causing his death was quite difficult to watch, but that was doubtlessly the intent.The CG ghosts were, I felt, out of place, and far too gory, clashing with the elegant story being told, and I thought it went on one scene too long. Still worth watching for its story, acting, and set design, especially in time for Halloween.",Crimson Peak
78,brando647,"Moody, Atmospheric and Visually Stunning Haunted Romance",8,16 October 2016,"I find that I enjoy Guillermo Del Toro's CRIMSON PEAK a little more with each time I watch it. I found myself a little disappointed upon first viewing because, to be fair, I had gone in with different expectations. I'd gotten the impression from the little bit of promotional material I'd seen that this was going to be a haunted house horror movie. This is not the case. CRIMSON PEAK is a romance/thriller that just so happens to feature a handful of ghosts. Once I'd course-corrected my expectations and watched it again, I found it far more enjoyable. I've seen it a few times now (including a viewing just for Del Toro's commentary track) and I almost wouldn't mind watching it again. CRIMSON PEAK is the tale of Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). Following the death of her mother from black cholera when she was very young, Edith believes she encountered her mother's ghost who bore a dire warning, ""When the time comes, beware of Crimson Peak."" Years later, Edith has grown into an intelligent woman who aspires to write but finds resistance from publishers who seem uncomfortable with a female writer turning in ghost stories instead of romance novels. She finds a man who happens to enjoy her writing in Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), a baronet from England who has come to America to seek financing for his red clay mining machine from Edith's father and his investment associates. Much to her father's chagrin, Edith and Thomas seem to hit it off and, following the unfortunate (and suspicious) death of her father, the two of them leave for England to live on Thomas's estate, Allerdale Hall. It's not an easy transition as the mansion is in disrepair, slowly sinking into the red clay on which it's built, and Thomas's sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) doesn't seem too keen on Edith. For the first time in years, Edith finds herself experiencing terrifying ghostly visions and learns that Allerdale Hall goes by another name in winter time: Crimson Peak.Anyone familiar with Del Toro's films knows what to expect here and, once again, he delivers in spades. The visual styling of CRIMSON PEAK is absolutely fantastic. The period costume design for late nineteenth century and the recreation of early Buffalo, New York are great, and the actual design of the estate on Crimson Peak is amazing. Not a single detail was spared in creating Del Toro's haunted mansion and a peek into the behind-the-scenes documentaries will attest to how much effort went into bringing the man's vision to life. The titular mansion is just as much a character in the film as Edith, Thomas, Lucille, and the ghosts. The ghosts in this movie are some of the coolest designs I've seen in a movie in years. A lot of modern ghost movies tend to have the same basic design tropes: paleness in color, spastic movements, and the use of jump scares, etc. For the most part, Del Toro avoids all of these and instead goes for a more traditional approach. Ghost float will float into frame, perhaps in the blurred background of a shot and coming into focus once the character becomes aware of their presence. They'll crawl up through the floor or just be hovering right there in the open air. The ghosts aren't just pale versions of their living counterparts with shaggy hair and pupil-less eyes or something; they're warped caricatures of their former selves, twisted and maimed with the injuries that led to their death. The ghosts in this movie come in two varieties: crimson red (for ghosts specific to Allerdale Hall) and black (for Edith's mother andone other). Del Toro used a combination of visual effects and practical costuming to accomplish his bizarre creations and the final product is one that stands out as unique in a sea of ghost movies where the dead often seem interchangeable between titles. For Del Toro's usual standard of visual style alone, CRIMSON PEAK is a solid recommend.The story is what I've seen referred to as ""Gothic horror"" but I don't know enough about the Gothic style to really comment on it. What I can vouch for is how engaging I found the tale of love, murder, hauntings, and a few disturbing surprises that arise once Edith finds herself in too deep. I'm really hesitant to go into too great of detail because I wouldn't want to spoil any plot developments. I mean, we can tell from early on that there is a side to Thomas and Lucille that we aren't seeing. There is some sort of plot afoot and Lucille appears to be the cold, calculating mastermind behind it. She's cold and unfriendly to just about everyone and, while she supports Thomas and Edith's marriage, she doesn't seem too thrilled about it. Jessica Chastain is wonderful per usual and it's cool to see her in a slimier, evil character. I'm so accustomed to seeing her as the no-nonsense, woman-in-charge sort (ZERO DARK THIRTY, THE MARTIAN, INTERSTELLAR, etc.) that I enjoyed watching her let loose with the certifiably insane Lucille. Tom Hiddleston also proves an effective leading man; the two of them steal the spotlight while Wasikowska's soft-spoken Edith isn't as intriguing a character to keep pace with them. Charlie Hunnam has a minor role as Edith's childhood friend and exists primarily for his interference in the end where Del Toro plays on the cinema trope of the dashing hero rushing in to rescue the damsel in distress. It makes for a fun twist on your expectations. Guillermo Del Toro is a masterful storyteller, and CRIMSON PEAK was a pleasant surprise that only gets better for me. It might not be what everyone is expecting (again, it's not specifically a horror film but a romance/drama with horror elements) but I encourage them to give it a shot.",Crimson Peak
79,bkrauser-81-311064,Del Toro has Become a Slave to His Own Style,6,20 October 2015,"Long gone are the days when the versatile Guillermo Del Toro reached the apex of his horror writing and directing. The Devil's Backbone (2001) and Cronos (1993) are completely out of the public consciousness, their fresh and economic twists on intelligent horror films a relic of their time. Yet Del Toro's public persona is one that still bores into our perception. The mere mentioning of his name conjures the spooky atmospherics of Pan's Labyrinth (2006) and the television phenomena The Strain (2014-Present). In short, to the masses, Del Toro equals horror. So why then is Crimson Peak, his newest directorial effort such an underwhelming disappointment? Well maybe it's because it's not a horror film.Crimson Peak opens with a young Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) staring into the middle distance. There's a bellowing blizzard, damp blood red clay penetrates through the snow and there's a deep cut on her cheek, the kind of cut we see on heroes who have seen heavy things yet the makeup artist still wants them to look good. After a brief prologue which flashes back to Edith's childhood, we arrive in Buffalo, New York. Edith is an aspiring writer who catches the eye of the handsome but mysterious Baron Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston). They marry hot on the heels of a family tragedy and she's transported to Crimson Peak, his estate in England where all is not as it seems. Also catering to the atmosphere is Lucille (Chastain), Thomas's cold and domineering sister.Starting with the good, the film is at many times a marvel to look at. The period detail bursts from the screen and the color schemes, especially during the haunted mansion scenes are jarringly beautiful. The film couples its filigree with the intensity of Dan Lausten's slick cinematography which cushions the film's slower moments with dynamic camera-work. Additionally there are nuggets of advertence signalling to better stories by Daphne du Maurier, Edgar Allan Poe, Anthony Berkeley Cox and Charlotte Bronte. Personally I found the parallels to be less of homages and more blatant rip-offs, but I suppose one man's imitation is another man's emulation. Based on images alone one can almost forgive the film's faults...almost.Years of subjecting himself to Hellboy fandom has probably made Del Toro comfortable with condescending to the audience. The screenplay isn't just cliché as it is aggressively banal with the creators tipping their hand and answering questions the audience hadn't yet asked. In case your mind was wondering too far from the screen to pick up less than subtle visual cues, all information is regurgitated by lesser characters like week old cud. Things made dull are shrouded in mystery while things meant to be mysterious simply aren't. The only mystery I was looking to solve was why would twice nominated Academy Award nominee Jessica Chastain pick such a project. Then again she did do Mama (2013), so maybe she has an affinity to trivial horror.In reality all stars will likely survive this film unscathed but at this point Del Toro has become a slave to his own style. Del Toro and Hiddleston both have been attending press junkets and doing late night interviews insisting Crimson Peak is less of a straight up haunted house film and more of a Gothic romance. Right; this is despite the studio's marketing strategy squeezing every jump scare and ghastly ghoul into the trailer. I suppose they have to recoup $30 million budget somehow. I personally knew I was in a long slog five minutes in when Edith explains to a would be publisher ""It's not really a ghost story, the ghost is more a metaphor."" It certainly was a metaphor. A metaphor for boredom and awkward fan service a la Tom Hiddleston necking.",Crimson Peak
80,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Crimson Peak""- Though perhaps a bit of a misstep for director Guillermo del Toro, it still satisfies overall thanks to its delightful melodrama and gorgeous visuals...",7,11 December 2016,"Perhaps the most tragically overlooked and criminally under- recognized artist living and working today, mastermind filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has long-been a favorite of mine, with a wonderfully poetic and visually arresting body of work that captures the imagination like few others. Whether it be with his delightful comic- book features like ""Hellboy"" or ""Blade II"", or for his more provocative fantasy-dramas like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Cronos"", del Toro proves over and over that he is a true cinematic genius.Unfortunately, even the most brilliant minds make missteps now and again, and while I do think that del Toro has never made a single ""bad"" film, his 2015 release ""Crimson Peak"" is definitely his largest stumble. A sort-of domestic period drama and thriller told within the confines of an old-fashioned ghost-story, ""Crimson Peak"" seems like an ideal piece of subject matter for its writer/director. Especially with its rampant echoes of his excellent prior film ""The Devil's Backbone"", to which this almost feels like a spiritual successor. However, a number cracks around the edges do derail it at times, making it a somewhat middling entry into his ever-growing filmography. Though thankfully, his continued keen use of poetic melodrama and his eye for stunning visuals do help it to excel and overcome many of its faults. It may objectively be del Toro's worst film... but it's still a Guillermo del Toro movie through-and- through.At the tail end of the 1800's, Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), a struggling author and daughter of a wealthy American businessman falls in love with English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), whom is seeking funding for a clay-mining invention of his own design. After a series of bizarre and disturbing events including the murder of her father, Edith marries Thomas and runs away with him, set to live with him at his massive home with he and his somewhat unhinged sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). However, it soon becomes clear that now all is well, as Edith is haunted by increasingly disturbing spectral figures during the night and comes under scrutiny and scorn from Lucille. And so, Edith sets out to learn the dark secrets of the manor and tries to piece together just what's happening...The performances are uniformly fantastic. Hiddleston and Chastain steal the show in absolutely fantastic roles as siblings who may have some dark secrets. Hiddleston plays his role to perfection, as you can never quite guess his true motivations or feelings, and Chastain is just deliciously vile as a perpetually slimy and troubling figure. Wasikowska is also a blast of grace and creates a very compelling and instantly likable protagonist for the audience to follow. Though she can be a bit too much of a blank slate at times, I found it worked, as she served not only as a lead, but also as an excellent surrogate for the audience to place themselves into. Supporting roles by the likes of Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver are also very well- played.Guillermo del Toro's wonderful sense of direction and fine melodramatic writing with co-scribe Matthew Robins is the other part of the puzzle to what makes the film work. This is just a gorgeous film and del Toro's trademark flowing camera-work, gorgeous stylized lighting and top-notch design sense make it a wonder to behold. You've never seen anything quite like it. It oozes a Gothic atmosphere and just drips of style. I particularly admired an ongoing motif that treats a deep red clay that's being mined like blood, as it literally oozes through the ground and stains the snow- covered fields a deep crimson hue. The script is also quite tight and well constructed, as tension builds with each passing moment. Robins and del Toro also inject plenty of the delightful and quirky melodrama that has come to define much of del Toro's work, and it compliments the story quite well. It almost feels more akin to an old-fashioned fable than a modern film with its wonderfully antiquated dialog and broad strokes of storytelling magic.However, there are some big faults at play- most notably the wonky pacing during the first half of the film and the inconsistent sense of tone and genre. The first half of the movie has an almost bipolar feeling... You'll be treated to some wonderfully moody sequences of fear and likable scenes of romance, but it doesn't have a strong flow. Some scenes rocket by, lopping on on-the-nose exposition dialog in a haphazard way, while others drag on perhaps a bit too long, bordering on the boring. It can be very jarring on your first viewing. I also really take some issues with the film's treatment of tone and genre. As I mentioned above, the film takes many cues from del Toro's prior work ""The Devil's Backbone""- a movie that used the supernatural elements in a more passive way that merely guided the audience along the journey. The ghosts in that movie were only a small but very integral part of the story. The issue I have here (and this is not spoiling anything) is that the supernatural elements are too passive. From the first act of the film, you get a sense that the spirits at play are not really all that necessary, and were merely added because del Toro wanted to make a movie with ghosts in it. So it can make the scenes played for straight horror a bit off-kilter.Still, thanks to likable performances, del Toro's trademark spellbinding direction and a fun enough script, ""Crimson Peak"" overcomes these issues and remains a fairly fun and compelling watch. It might not quite be the masterpiece of Gothic romance and devious supernatural horror we wanted, but it's a serviceable film and is still well worth-seeing for those who might be interested.I give it a pretty good 7 out of 10.",Crimson Peak
81,quincytheodore,"The bleeding snow and Gothic ambiance produce a good horror spectacle, but the haunting simply follows lady in creepy dress formula.",7,16 October 2015,"Comparison is bound to made with Pan's Labyrinth, since Crimson Peak has Del Toro's trademark twisted fairy tale feel and desolated last century setting. It is a peculiarly and aesthetically pleasing horror, but the clash between romance and thriller is neither as bold nor magical as previous incursion. The simplistic nature works more like The Woman in Black, although Del Toro's presentation does separate it from other entities.The plot revolves around Edith (Mia Wasikowska) who is charmed by Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) in the first act. After she's drawn to their lives, she discovers that Sharpe siblings might just hide some ominous secrets. It's a straightforward deceit and debauchery story with a few rather daunting apparitions thrown into the mix.The first noticeable edge Crimson Peak has is the flamboyant style of visual. Those who have watched Hellboy 2 or Pan's Labyrinth should be familiar with this graphical flair. The colors are splendidly painted, nearly every scenes have bleak backdrop yet glossy golden or scarlet undertone. Either it's from outlandish outfits or clever use of vista, the scenes where these characters interact appear nearly surreal.Tom Hiddleston creates a suave gentleman persona who also seems secretive and distant at times. Jessica Chastain as Lucille, the sister, is very unnerving. She's almost oozing sinister air, which is complimented well by her typical dark dress, and also a good contender for Disney lady villain. Compared to the two, Mia Wasikowska as the female lead is rather timid. She's not entirely bad, but some of her expressions don't convey the necessary dread.This also translates to the horror. Crimson Peak has one of the creepiest apparitions on romance themed movies, a couple of its scenes might just surpass full-fledged horror movies in recent times. However, the reaction from Edith is shockingly dull, almost seemingly lacking self-preservation instinct despite visited by constant nocturnal phantoms.I don't care how suave Tom Hiddleston can make excuses, the mansion has hole on the roof. While it's good for panoramic shots for falling leaves or snow, it's a clear sign of hazard. There are also patches of blood-stained dirt that seeps through the living room. Those anomalies coupled with strange occurrences and screams of night terror, Edith should realize the danger sooner, but in too many scenes she's too oblivious, partially for the sake of plot.Crimson Peak is a strange marriage of romance and horror. Both aspects have glimpses of brilliance, yet they never culminate in conclusion beyond what other ghost stories have told. Having benefit of classy presentation and eerie atmosphere, it's still a highly presentable horror flick. However, for those looking for another grand tale or magical journey from Del Toro, Crimson Peak might not reach such zenith.",Crimson Peak
82,sme_no_densetsu,Not what I expected but I've come to appreciate it,8,1 January 2019,"Guillermo del Toro's ""Crimson Peak"" is very much a throwback to a bygone era of horror fiction. At first glance, the movie appears to be a standard haunted house tale like countless others that we've seen through the years. However, upon closer inspection the story's true inspiration turns out to be the archetypal gothic romances that laid the foundation for much of the horror fiction that has since followed. Successful examples of this approach in Hollywood are few and far between, with the likes of ""Rebecca"" (1940) & ""Dragonwyck"" (1946) being among the few that spring to mind.To be sure, there are indeed horrific elements in ""Crimson Peak"" but I would hesitate to classify it as an out-and-out horror movie. del Toro is obviously familiar with the basic ingredients of a gothic romance and he wields them expertly in crafting his own story. While you might have a point in saying that that the formula is extremely derivative, it is nevertheless a formula that works. It basically wouldn't be gothic romance without a vulnerable heroine, a dashing but mysterious suitor and an ancestral home whose hauntings are both literal and figurative.Given the somewhat rigid guidelines of gothic romance, del Toro's script is actually more intricate than it might seem at first. The movie is full of metaphors, many of them visual. This imbues life into material whose presentation could have been routine in the hands of another director. In particular, the use of colour in the film is especially striking.Of course, a script like this needs actors/actresses who are up to the task of bringing it to life. Mia Wasikowska is suitably delicate for the role of the young lady who becomes ensnared in a perilous situation. Tom Hiddleston & Jessica Chastain have the juiciest roles and neither of them disappoint in supplying an air of subtle menace. Charlie Hunnam's performance is a bit below these three in my estimation but he still makes a serviceable counterpoint to Hiddleston. The supporting cast is similarly satisfactory but ultimately nothing to write home about.del Toro's direction is well handled, as always. The beautiful visuals do not come at the expense of generating & sustaining suspense. The visual effects are a bit too grotesque for my taste but others may feel differently. The sets & costumes are also exquisite. Overall, the movie shows meticulous attention to detail in virtually every area of the production.All of that being said, ""Crimson Peak"" definitely isn't a movie for everyone. If you're looking for horror then you might not find enough of it. If you're looking for romance then you might be turned off by the horrific trappings. To be honest, while I admired del Toro's craft the first time I watched this movie, the story felt a bit weak. It was only upon rewatching it that I was able to appreciate the intricacies of the presentation and appreciate it for what it is rather than what I initially expected it to be.",Crimson Peak
83,Troy_Campbell,Pedestrian story covered by stunning visuals.,6,20 October 2015,"As has become his modus operandi, Guillermo del Toro's latest offers a feast for the eyes whilst working within a pedestrian story. This Victorian-era Gothic horror is a visually sensational experience boasting gorgeous music-video-style imagery, painstakingly detailed production design and lush, immersive photography that trickles with creepiness. But del Toro missteps with narrative and tone; the former is too plodding and predictable, whilst the latter is neither scary enough to be a great horror nor twisty enough to be a great thriller. Thus Crimson Peak feels entirely inconsequential and must rely heavily on its visual flair, including splendidly designed CGI ghosts and blood-splattering gore, to keep the audience's attention. Nabbing such a talented group of actors doesn't hurt del Toro's cause either, Australia's own Mia Wasikowska heading up a cast that also features Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam and, with a show stealing turn, Jessica Chastain. Lovers of classical horror will find plenty to delight in and fans of del Toro (like me) will relish his usual quirky spark, everybody else may be a tad dissatisfied.",Crimson Peak
84,pyrocitor,"Quoth del Toro: ""Nevermore"" (please).",6,2 November 2015,"Poor Guillermo del Toro. No matter how many unique, visionary works he generates throughout his career, each subsequent project is still fated to, somewhat unfairly, receive the inevitable dismissal of ""well, it's no Pan's Labyrinth..."" Okay, so as problems go, struggling to live up to one of the most sublime pictures of modern cinema you've already made isn't so bad. Still, it's too tantalizing to resisting envisioning how transformative del Toro attacking a new filmic genre could be. But down that path lies madness. And, sure enough, just as Pacific Rim was fun but ultimately soulless (again, with the qualifier ""for del Toro""), Crimson Peak, despite ticking all the right genre boxes, is a visually rich but resonantly hollow and disappointingly under-thought Gothic melodrama pastiche. Although he's undeniably the main selling point, the trick might be to avoid viewing the film within the lens of 'a Guillermo del Toro' film, as his work here is sadly more akin to a filmmaker doing a Guillermo del Toro impression. And that's the film's biggest fright of all. First off: although the film's plodding script begins with the dull stinger ""ghosts are real"", it is important to note that Crimson Peak is not a horror film. It just isn't. Though occasional ghosts do rear their rattly, bloody heads, del Toro is slavish enough to Gothic romance tropes that such apparitions are largely part of the set dressing more than driving the plot in any significant way. Accurate? Yes. But in terms of spooky creature feature fun? Booooo. Still: genre fidelity is fair enough. So what's the point of Crimson Peak, then? Frankly, I'm not sure the film offers much more in-depth than 'gothic stuff is fun'. Pastiche for pastiche's sake never flies well though, and this gossamer-thin immateriality eats away at the film like its giant moths that flutter to and fro throughout (and if you think that metaphor was clumsy and crass, you'll certainly have no patience for the film as a whole). The story is a rote, overlong, fundamentally predictable cesspool of 'bad people doing bad things for bad reasons', all the more pallid by the lack of any supernatural motivations behind it, and poorly served by an infuriatingly obvious script ruining any sense of eerie mystery. Our protagonist, drably embodied by Mia Wasikowska, is a serviceably fragile but feisty Victorian ghost story author, but too bland to grow particularly attached to (but hey – at least her initial suitor, a goodhearted doctor played by the comically miscast Charlie Hunnam, only shares limited screen time with her). As she aimlessly wanders about, spouting meta clunkers like ""the ghosts are metaphors"" (d'oh), things don't look promising.Thankfully, when's she's whisked into a whirlwind romance, things become briefly more titillating. Here, thanks are due to Tom Hiddleston at his suave, seductive, waltzing best, sure to elicit swoons in the most chaste of audiences. He's given little to do but brood and gripe about clay mining in the film's second act, but his initial work is on-point, finally gifting the film with a pulse. Nonetheless, even this – through no fault of Hiddleston – quickly dries up into an artificial seductive montage so rushed and clumsily foreboding (with a dash of unnecessarily graphic violence) it verges on Twilight territory. Now that's spooky. Ah, so the point must be atmosphere, one muses, resisting the temptation to steal a fourth glance at one's watch. Unsurprisingly, del Toro tangibly breathes a sigh of relief when released from the cumbersome society sequences, and free to sink his teeth into his titular house of horrors. This creaking, crumbling labyrinth allows the set and sound designers to flex their muscles, and relinquishes a glut of much-needed customarily grimly beautiful images, finally rousing those of us who dozed off after Hiddleston's candlelit waltz. In a particularly inspired touch, the red clay underneath the house's foundation leaks up through the snow like blood stains. Cooooool. Film studies students will crow at the essay waiting to be written about the bold use of primary colours towards thematic ends, but the film finally getting creepy is enough to alleviate anyone's spirits. Still (uh oh), it's hard to banish the pesky wish that the oddly sanitized set showcased more of del Toro's inventively ramshackle spirit. Think of the delightfully clumsy whimsy of Hellboy II's Troll Market, for example, and try not to be disappointed at how conventionally Crimson Peak's manor looms by comparison. This is doubly apparent with the film's lumbering bloody spectres, whose lazy designs don't benefit from del Toro's 'show in plain sight' approach to visual frights, especially when trussed up with every 'what's-behind-that-door-aha-it's-a- screeching-musical-cue' cliché in the horror book. Increasingly, it's hard to suppress dark mumblings of del Toro's wings being clipped by Hollywood convention – all of the budgetary gleam with none of the heart. Finally, after an eternity of slow-burning tension (read: lots of brooding, tea, and moths), it's really only at the film's finale that sh*t gets real. This is largely thanks to Jessica Chastain, the film's greatest asset. After patiently biding her time through redundant scene after scene of ominously looming, expertly allowing terrifying surges of fury to crack through her glacial composure, Chastain is finally let off her chain enough to show the frenzied, Jack Torrance lunacy she's hinted at throughout. The scenery echoes her, belching up enough fog and clay to match the on screen blood, and hey – we're finally in a del Toro horror movie! Naturally, it doesn't last, as stupid deus-ex-machina clichés are thrown in our faces, spoiling the macabre fun. Finally, we're left chewing on the film's moral: you have to experience horror to write about horror. Well, if that's the case, after the spectre of an unimaginative – nay, boring – Guillermo del Toro ghost story, I'm about ready to pen my chilling masterpiece. -6/10",Crimson Peak
85,chrichtonsworld,Gothic Horror? NO! Chilling drama? NO! Boring soap? YES!,4,18 November 2015,"Usually it's a good thing if you can't define a movie by just one genre since that often gives the viewer more than they bargained for. Unfortunately Crimson Peak does not do anything convincing no matter the genre you favour, it just disappoints.Crimson Peak starts real well. It does not waste any time to draw the viewer in. Right from the start we are served one creepy scene that serves as bait and basically tricks you into believing that at least the film will be compelling. And the haunting setting and other visuals back this feeling up. However at one point it feels like details about the supposed mystery are prolonged and avoided so strongly that very soon I suspected that there is not that much of a mystery. Here I was waiting to be dazzled by some awesome twist only to be let down by the incredible poor storytelling. Whatever was build up suspense wise (mostly by visuals) was immediately gone and turned Crimson Peak into a real bore fest. Mind you it's never super bad but it's not good either. Seeing how Guillermo del Toro normally is a reliable director I can't help but feel that he is slipping. His show The Strain also is filled with incredible poor plot developments. Crimson Peak is so much worse since none of the characters are remotely interesting or compelling. I did not care about any of them. Much emphasis is put on the romantic relationship between Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). And I did not buy any second of it. Not that their acting was that bad but the plot failed to show us the sexual tension and love between them. Both Thomas and Edit act like idiots since there were many opportunities to take action. Nothing prevented them to do so. If the plot had given us some real reasons I could have accepted that. Surprise surprise the plot even fails to do such a simple task. Seriously at one point I just wanted Crimson Peak to be over with cause everything was so pointless and all for the sake of romance that was barely there.By the time things get revealed to you it does not really matter since you will have figured out what is going on long before that. It's safe to say that Crimson Peak is incredibly underwhelming and a total disappointment. I can't recommend this. Only good enough to watch very late at night or a rainy Sunday afternoon.",Crimson Peak

87,kevin c,Rebecca mess,4,10 April 2021,"I love Del Toro but this is massively ramped up to 11 ands in a highly camp mess. The early scenes work, dealing with class and snobbery with an air of Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence. There's swirling camerawork, extravagant production design; piano-playing and waltzing. And moments of excessive, extreme violence.In the second half, the action switches to the decaying English mansion house, and goes off the rails. It chucks everything into the mix, steals massively from Rebecca; the plot is clearly predictable and it collapses into absurdity.Del Toro is obviously enjoying himself, but i'm not sure the audience is. At least Chastain enjoys herself in a wonderfully flamboyant performance, part Mrs Danvers and part bride of Frankenstein.",Crimson Peak
88,Stephen_A_Abell,A Beautiful And Entertaining Guillermo Del Torro Masterpiece.,9,11 May 2017,"While watching this beautiful motion picture one thought kept flickering through my mind; this is what a modern Hammer film should look like - it so reminded me of the classic '60's and '70's films.Guillermo Del Torro has created another masterpiece filled with vivid and beautiful imagery and superb transitions between the light - happy - and dark -eerie - atmospheres, which work well on the emotions. Along with superb acting from the cast and a potent story, with the help of Matthew Robins, we are given the tale of twisted love and greed, which builds slowly with twists and turns throughout.What always surprises me most is that Del Torro takes some of the nastiest parts of the human psyche and the violent actions they include and shows them in such a gorgeous way while never glorifying or condoning them is amazing.This is the story of Edith Cushing, lovingly portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, a solitary and intelligent woman trying to make her way as an author in a man's world. She meets and falls in love with Thomas Sharpe, played elegantly by Tom Hiddleston, who is in town trying to raise funds for his mining machine from her father, Carter Cushing, who is admirably portrayed by Jim Beaver. However, her father doesn't like Thomas and does everything he can to stand in the way of their relationship. It's only after his death that Edith is free to wed Thomas and move out to Crimson Peak.As the days pass, Edith begins to realise that maybe her father was right, there's something not quite right with Thomas and his sister Lucille, strongly portrayed by Jessica Chastain... or the house they live in...I fell in love with this film right from the start. It's so stylish with its lighting, camera angles, and sound, that it fits perfectly with the era in which it's set. Even the End Credits are beautiful to watch. There are a lot of directors trying too hard to be stylish and here Del Torro makes it appear effortless. The special effects are really good, the one scene where the ghost is dragging itself up and along the floor is pretty creepy. I also liked the effect of the clay on the snow, turning it blood red, that was a nice touch.I would recommend this movie to everyone - it now resides at the top of my favourite Del Torro movies.",Crimson Peak
89,gedikreverdi,A very stylish gothic love story,7,3 February 2021,"A baronet from England arrived to their town with his sister Lucille and Edith fell in love with him while she was receiving warning from the ghost of her mother about crimson peak. Lucille killed her father and the scene was very brutal as she hit his head against the sink at the club's bathroom until it was cracked open. And then Thomas married her and take her to England with him. They started living in their dilapidated mansion with Thomas's machines for mining and red clay mine beneath the house. Butterflies in the attic, the hole in the roof, the basement with red clay and the lift and very gothic architecture of the house provided a strong atmosphere. Edith discovered some cylindrical phonographs and listened to them and found out they were the previous lovers of his husband and the Italian one was warning whoever listening to it about them trying to kill her by the poison in tea. She wanted to leave but they were snowed in. The eye doctor from her town in America arrived to the mansion because he was suspicious of Edith's fathers death and talked to the detective of the man and found out that Thomas is already married. Edith caught them making love in the attic and Lucille threw her off the rails. They were lovers and the girl killed her mother the one ghost that Edith saw with a cleaver in her head. He wanted to take her with him but Lucille stabbed him and Thomas faked finishing him and hid him in the basement because he was in love with Edith. Lucille couldn't accept his brother lover falling in love with someone else and stabbed him in the face. He died and she went after Edith. She took out the cleaver from the basement the one she killed her mother and they went out in the white snow and red clay capped garden. Edith could kill her when she was distracted with the ghost of Thomas and the doctor carried him away from the house as some people coming towards the house. It was a very stylish movie and I liked the mining machine of Thomas, the doctor's design to see ghosts, those cylindrical phonographs, gothic mansions and all but the script was a little bit weak and I expected a more surprising final as we already knew from the very beginning that Edith survives. But still it was definitely a nice gothic horror fairy tale about an aspiring young writer falling in love with a dangerous man and couldn't save herself from him despite his mother's ghost's warnings.",Crimson Peak

I expected a chilling supernatural horror, which this is definitely not.It is a story about family and betrayal set in Victorian times. Yes the walking dead are very prevalent but don't actually impact the story.The production and direction gives the film a 'classic' feel about it. Scenes are transitioned through dissolving black screens and the opening scene is closed with a zooming shot of an old leather bound book opening.I enjoyed this, the use of colour (especially in the red clay) and the attention of detail in the sets and scenery give the film a feeling of quality.Scares are very rare and don't expect a lot of action. Most of the drama takes place in parlours and ball room.A lot slower and less scary than I expected but very well crafted and enjoyable.",Crimson Peak
92,meddlecore,Twisted Romances,6,10 October 2016,"After receiving an ominous warning from the ghost of her dead Mother, Edith- the daughter of an American Industrialist- is seduced and lured to England by a charming young Baron and his sister- whose intentions are neither benevolent, nor transparent.Upon moving into the Baron's dilapidated, yet stately, home- after the suspicious death of her father- Edith is, again, visited by spirits of the dead, reminding her of her mother's warning: to be wary of something known as the ""Crimson Peak"".But this is not the only warning Edith received, she was also told never to wander into the lower levels of the mansion, by both her husband, and his sister.It's not long before she discovers what Crimson Peak means. It is a phenomenon that occurs when a bright red ore becomes liquefied and leeches into the snow, staining it a bright red. The ore being the resource her husband is trying to exploit with his invention.While it is evident from the very beginning, that the Baron and his sister have something to hide- it's not exactly clear what that is. Only after Edith is given a letter, does she start to suspect that she is not the first woman to be in this position...the Baron has been married before. And she further suspects that it is the spirits of these women whom have been haunting her, since taking up residence at the Hall.Eventually, she manages to uncover their plot: to lure in wealthy young women, so that they can kill them with poison, and cash in on their inheritance. But she is both horrified and flabbergasted when she discovers the reasons behind why they have been doing this...since first killing their mother at the ages of 12 & 14.Meanwhile, a childhood friend who adored her- and was suspicious about her Father's death- also managed to discover that brother-sister duo were essentially serial killers, preying on wealthy young women with no close heirs. So he traveled from America to England to get her back and bring her home.Inevitably leading to the film's wild conclusion.This is a really beautifully shot film, as you would expect from Guillermo Del Toro. The scenery, mise en scene, and cinematography are all top notch. But they really skimp on the ghosts, which are just cheap CGI renderings- and look terribly out of place. So that was highly disappointing, but it's to be expected, I guess.The story plods along pretty slowly throughout the majority of the film, but it really picks up in the end- so it's all building up to that. Basically, the whole thing is oriented around the series of romance angles, that are interwoven throughout the storyline...but I won't go into them here, as that would essentially act as a spoiler.So just watch it and see for yourself.6 out of 10.",Crimson Peak
93,adamscastlevania2,One of the finest examples of Gothic horror,9,5 November 2015,"(85%) A wonderfully handsome Gothic horror that may not be the most scary film ever made, but it is by far one of the most visually stunning. The cast is top notch with big names at every turn, but it's by far the look and atmosphere dripping down from nearly every shot that's the most captivating. Even with elements of Tim Burton and Poe, this is very much a Del Toro film with its sharp attention to detail, strong build-up and painful touches of ultra, almost exploitation levels of violence that always seem to shock, yet never spoil the general quality feel. His direction is impeccable as the film and its characters are allowed to breath and have room to move and everything is far from just being a long series of dumb jump scares. There wasn't a great deal of horror released around Halloween 2015 (thanks to Mr Bond) but this will likely be one of the best entries of the year. This level of superbly crafted minute detail is what big screen entertainment is all about.",Crimson Peak
94,RforFilm,Crimson Peak is a Gothic romance that's better at looking scary then being scary,6,2 November 2015,"As it is said in Crimson Peak, ""Ghosts are real"". I'm a believer in spirits that roam the earth, stuck in our world for one reason or another. Twice I've had a paranormal encounter. The first time I saw something was when I was about ten when my family was staying in a hotel in Riverside that was rumored to be haunted. My best friend Jason and I went exploring while my folks were out to dinner. We encountered a mirror that cracked right in front of us while a voice told us go back. The second was when again, Jason and I were going to an abandoned mill where we both saw a figure on the second floor and felt the cold chill of a hand touch our shoulders. Seeing ghosts in real life is one thing, but in cinema, the less you see the spirits the more frightening they are. It draws on the perception that the scariest thing is what ever you imagine it to be. The Haunting and The Shining are probably the best haunted house movies out there they play more on the psychology of spooks and how scary that can be. Crimson Peak attempts to bring on it's own frights.Taking place in the late 1800's, young woman Edith Cushing (played by Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of a wealthy industrialist and is an aspiring author who writes ghost stories with the hope of being Mary Shelly rather then Jane Austin. Her latest book is turned away for not having much romance. Visiting English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (played by Tom Hiddleston) takes an immediate liking to Edith as he tries to raise capital for an invention from her father. He and his sister Lucile (played by Jessica Chastain) are turned away and don't blend in well with the New York upper class.Her father is unexpectedly murdered, leaving Edith little to contemplate, so she marries Thomas and moves with him back to England. She she's the dilapidated mansion he's lived on since he was a boy, which is in bad condition and is sinking into the clay-like Earth that he's trying to harvest. As Edith settles in, Thomas becomes distant while Lucile becomes more cold towards her brothers wife. Each night comes as a shock as strange noises and floating spirits are spotted. They may be trying to tell Edith of the darker story behind the house and the brother and sister who live there. As with most works by Guillermo del Toro, Crimson Peak boasts with color and grand design. This is a movie that I loved looking at despite it's dark tale. It's clearly a tribute to the Hammer horror movies of the 1970s. The whole picture is like looking at a painting from that era that I'm sure will be honored with plenty of technical awards. It manages to add on to the spookiness of the atmosphere (even if the overall movie isn't really that scary) without making it too much to overwhelm the story.Speaking of which, Crimson Peak is a Gothic love story over a horror story. It seems evident of that given how much of the action relies on how much Edith trusts her husband and new sister in law. What's interesting though as much of a writer she is, it takes her a while to see that the house has a dark past, despite given some clues that aren't that hard to figure out. The story isn't bad, it's just missing a chance to be scary in favor of looking scary. Perhaps if Crimson Peak had done a better job covering some of it's plot holes, I would have liked it more.I'll give this six Victorian era ghost photos out of ten. Crimson Peak may not be as scary as it thinks it is, I enjoyed myself while I was looking at it. I doubt I'll remember these characters and their motivations, but I will remember the house.",Crimson Peak
95,Anurag-Shetty,"My second all time favorite horror film, yet it's not even that terrifying!",10,19 October 2015,"Crimson Peak tells the story of Edith Cushing(Mia Wasikowska). Edith loves writing stories & wants to become an author. She meets a man named, Thomas Sharpe(Tom Hiddleston). There is an instant connection between the two. Moreover, Thomas loves Edith's latest story, which she intends to publish soon. Soon, Edith also meets Thomas' sister, Lucille Sharpe(Jessica Chastain). Lucille doesn't really warm up to Edith. Edith's childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael(Charlie Hunnam) & her father Carter Cushing(Jim Beaver), advise her to tread lightly, when it comes to getting involved with Thomas & Lucille Sharpe. After a terrible family tragedy, Edith decides to commit to her relationship with Thomas & move to England with him & his sister. Here, she is whisked away to an old house in rural England. After Edith starts living in the house with Thomas & Lucille, she realizes that there is something intrinsically wrong with the house. She starts to see horrifying things, & this terrifies her to the core. Crimson Peak is an outstanding film. However, let me make one thing clear. Crimson Peak is not a traditional horror movie. There are not too many jump scares to freak you out while you are watching the film. So, don't go for the film expecting it to be really scary. This movie might not be terrifying but, it's still my second all time favorite horror movie. My all time favorite horror movie is, The Woman in Black(2012). The reason this film is flawless is, it has an impeccable story with various twists & turns that you will never see coming no matter how many horror or thriller films you've watched. Director Guillermo del Toro has masterfully maintained the suspense, right till the shocking climax of the film. More than being a horror film, Crimson Peak is more a hybrid of a horror film & a suspense thriller. There is a lot of gore in the film, so anyone who gets squeamish at the sight of blood should avoid this film. The sound design is one of the highlights of the film. Every minute sound, be it the treading of the boots on the snow, the subtle creaking of the door, or the burning of the candle, can be heard like as though you're with the characters in that creepy old manor. The cinematography by Dan Laustsen & the production design by Thomas E. Sanders are equally fantastic. This film becomes creepy as hell thanks to the superb camera angles & eerie sets. Allerdale Hall is a mansion that looks majestic yet, dingy & decrepit. So, the mansion is another highlight of the film. The performances by the all star cast is another highlight of the movie. Mia Wasikowska is great as Edith Cushing. The standout performances of the film are Jessica Chastain & Tom Hiddleston as Lucille Sharpe & Thomas Sharpe respectively. Chastain's ice cold portrayal of the mysterious Lucille, is flawless. Hiddleston's vulnerable portrayal of the conflicted Thomas, is spectacular as well. Charlie Hunnam is amazing as Dr. Alan McMichael. Jim Beaver is superb in his small yet substantial role, as Carter Cushing. Burn Gorman is good as Holly. Crimson Peak is a must watch due to its extremely unique & engaging story. It must be experienced on the big screen.",Crimson Peak

97,spookyrat1,A Red Herrings Classic!,7,3 November 2019,"As we've come to expect from a Guillermo del Toro film, Crimson Peak is nothing less than a visual feast. Luxuriant cinematography by Dan Laustsen, appropriate Gothic-inspired sets, sumptuous costumes and let it be said now, that del Toro knows how to light a set. In spite of the genre, with the setting largely confined to the traditional ""haunted mansion"" on the snowy moors of England, the audience is never expected to peer into expressionistic gloom and try and guess what's happening. Everything is seen with abundant character and clarity.The acting too is first class with especially great work from the two female leads in Mia Wasikowska as the heroine Edith, who is in close to 90% of the scenes and Jessica Chastain as her chief antagonist Lucille, who is required to play a progressively threatening and more domineering role as the storyline moves forward. Tom Hiddleston is more than competent as money-seeking British knight with secrets Sir Thomas, who is seen less in the second half of the film, as his sister Lucille grows in prominence. And Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver are not short-changed, when it comes to the writing of their support characters.Guillermo del Toro has not tried to hide the fact publicly that Crimson Peak tries to avoid the modern pattern of creating shocks and cheap thrills, by the use of multiple jump scares and sudden loud noises. This is clearly a film paying homage to classics such as The Innocents, whereby suspense is created through the development of a brooding, increasingly threatening atmosphere.However it's clearly not a spoiler to state that this is a ghost movie and therefore the vast majority of scares we encounter in the first two acts are created by the emergence of rather horrid, terrifying CGI spectral creations who appear to frequently intimidate and frighten poor Edith. But in a shaggy dog third act twist, it becomes bleedingly obvious that these ghosts are actually supposed to be ""good"" and sympathetic to Edith's forbidding plight. So then we are left wondering why earlier, they felt they had to scare the crap out of her to get their message across, when we see the white ghost of Tom, looking and behaving completely differently. It's just not a consistent approach and we are left feeling that we've been conned by the cinematic equivalent of a pea and thimble trick to maintain suspense levels.Crimson Peak is a worthwhile addition to the ghost movie genre, but would arguably have been far more memorable, had it adopted a more consistent, less contrived approach with the use of its supernatural elements. I give it a 6.5/10, which is exactly its IMDB rating at time of writing and virtually the same as its Meta-critic rating. I think that's a very apt number and kind of wish I didn't have to round it up to 7.",Crimson Peak
98,dave-mcclain,"""Crimson Peak"" is a great ""gothic romance"" and one of Guillermo del Toro's best films.",8,16 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro is a brilliant director and a fascinating man, but also a study in contradictions. Most of his films are categorized as fantasy and/or horror, but he sees his movies as basically ""political"" in nature. His films usually include monsters because he feels they represent great power, but his stories are often about defeating the power of individuals or institutions. He'll describe himself as an atheist, but in the next breath add, ""Once a Catholic, always Catholic, in a way"". He's also said that he views art as his religion in that his commitment to it is almost spiritual. He has alternated between small, Spanish-language fantasy films and huge, English-language science fiction movies. He's best known for his writing and directing, but he's more prolific as a producer of different kinds of films. In spite of these apparent contradictions, he's not a man who doesn't understand who he is or why he does what he does. Rather, he's a director of great vision and his work is remarkably consistent in style and tone. His 2015 release, ""Crimson Peak"" (R, 1:59) feels like a combination of all his contradictions – and strengths.""Ghosts are real, that much I know. I've seen them all my life."" So intones Edith Cushing as the film opens. She makes her statement without passion or fear, but as a simple matter of fact. As a young woman submitting a novel she wrote to a potential publisher who calls it a ghost story, she protests. She says that the story just happens to have a ghost in it – as a metaphor. She may accept the existence of ghosts as a fact of life, but they scare her as much as they would any of us. The first ghost she sees is that of her mother, who died when Edith was a little girl. The frightening wispy specter dressed in black warns her daughter to ""beware of Crimson Peak"", but doesn't explain what that means. Damn ghosts.Yes, she sees dead people, but they know they're dead, and they don't control her life. Edith (Mia Wasikowska) may see ghosts more readily than those around her, but she's far more focused on becoming a writer. It's tough for a female author to be taken seriously in early 20th century Buffalo. She decides to mail off her manuscript – after rewriting it on one of those new-fangled typewriters, so her handwriting won't betray her gender. Busy typing in the office of her father, industrialist Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), Edith meets Englishman Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). He's also having a hard time being taken seriously. He's looking for investors for his invention, a machine to remove clay from the ground. Carter, however, sees Thomas as a privileged aristocrat, rather than a serious entrepreneur.Edith sees something else. She's quite taken with the English gentleman, and he with her. Thomas' sister, Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), isn't so sure about Edith – and Edith's father isn't so sure about Thomas. Carter hires a private investigator to check into Thomas' background. What Carter learns is more than enough for Carter to want Thomas gone. Thomas leaves, but he convinces Edith to come with him – and be his bride. They marry and journey to his English estate, where a large, but dark and creepy-looking house sits, in an advancing state of decay, on a red clay hill that the locals call Crimson Peak.Edith doesn't yet know of her new home's nickname. In fact, there's a lot about the house and her new family that she doesn't know. Lucille, who also lives in the house, is as cold to Edith as that main hall with a gaping hole in its roof. Thomas ominously warns his new wife not to go below the house's main level. And then there are the ghosts. (Yes, ghosts – plural.) Edith's mom comes to call, but isn't any more forthcoming with her mysterious warnings than she was when Edith was a little girl. The other ghosts in the house are even less specific about what they want, or even who they are. Edith has suffered no harm in the house, but the secrets that she learns are terrifying and creepy – in more ways than one.This is an unusually accessible del Toro film. It's not as bizarre as ""Pan's Labyrinth"", as violent as the ""Hell Boy"" movies or as bloated as ""Pacific Rim"" (as good as those films are). But don't get scared. ""Crimson Peak"" is very much a Guillermo del Toro movie, in themes, tone and style. Built just for this film, the house is simultaneously beautiful and frightening. And you needn't go any further than the film's advertising to see indications of the director's preference for dark reddish hues. In fact, the posters make it very clear that this movie features creative and striking visuals. Besides that magnificent main set, the cinematography is gorgeous, the images of the ghosts are terrific and the costumes are incredible. At times, however, the movie feels like an expensive version of a television true crime mystery, complete with dips to black for commercial breaks, but those impressions are fleeting. This ""gothic romance"", as del Toro calls it, is much more than a ghost story. You could say it's a scary movie which happens to have ghosts in it. Edith would. I'd say that it's one of del Toro's best films to date. ""A-""",Crimson Peak
99,Vivekmaru45,Mediocre Gothic Horror Drama.,4,17 December 2016,"I have seen better stuff from Guillermo del Toro, namely Cronos(1993), Mimic(1997), Hellboy (2004), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), Pacific Rim (2013).These are all his films I have seen. I haven't yet seen The Devil's Backbone(2001), but I have heard that it is a good film. The key highlight of Del Toro's films are the special effects. Usually they are mind-blowing like Hellboy and Blade II. Also focus on intense action sequences like these above two films I mentioned.This film is a Gothic horror suspense-drama, with emphasis given on the background sets to generate an atmosphere of America in the period of 1887. The story is that of Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), the young daughter of wealthy American businessman Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver), is visited by her mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, ""Beware of Crimson Peak.""The story than forward to when she is a young woman in her twenties, where her ambition is to become a successful writer. She had finished her manuscript and then gone to visit her publisher where she meets the Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), an English baronet who has come to the United States with his sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. I shan't give any more of the story away, you will have to see it for yourselves. The problem I had with the film was the predictability. If you are an avid horror fan, this film will have little appeal to you. There is nothing new in this film that you haven't seen before. If you like suspense-thrillers you will also be disappointed. This film has an element of romance and intrigue(or should I say incest), but it is heavily watered down.The most well known actress is Jessica Chastain. The most well known actor is Jonathan Hyde, but he has a minuscule part on the film. Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam and Mia Wasikowska are all capable actors but I feel their prowess was overshadowed by a dull and predictable script. The cinematography by Dan Laustsen is brilliant, but the background music by Fernando Velázquez is inadequate. Del Toro's direction is flawless, but really he should have known that the script was inadequate by today's standards.More horror films to watch: Suspiria (1977), Dawn of the Dead(1978), The Shining(1980), The Changeling(1980), Poltergeist (1982), The Exorcist III(1990).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper.",Crimson Peak
100,swilliky,The Worst Movie of Guillermo Del Toro,4,16 October 2015,"I got to the late showing of Crimson Peak and it was pretty bad. I should've stayed home. At best, it's rental and if you miss altogether, you aren't missing much. The worst movie I've ever seen by Guillermo Del Toro. The first act takes too long to get going and basically shows most of the horror promised in the commercial. I did like the black ghost mother that showed up at the beginning, the best part of the film. The chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska was non-existent and when you might say this is intentional, none of the acting was very good for that matter. Jessica Chastain had the most interesting character but her motivations were ill-explained and it all sort of fell apart at the end. Charlie Hunnam was a handsome face but really served no purpose, as did the ghosts. Instead of going for the Gothic romance, they should've done as advertised and went for horror. The movie is only entertaining when Del Toro shows his skill with the effects and the ghostly specters creep out of the floor or the doorway. The writing was terrible, the screenplay hardly makes sense. The explanation was forced and characters talk to much at the end because no understands what is going on. Overall a bad movie, even by horror movie standards.",Crimson Peak
101,bryank-04844,"This Gothic-Romance-Ghost-Story is a home-run for Del Toro, and I'm sure 'Crimson Peak' will remain in people's minds for a while.",8,14 October 2015,"When Guillermo Del Toro makes a movie, you pay attention, but a ticket, strap yourself in the seat, and prepare your eye-holes for something that is guaranteed to thrill you, chill you, and fulfill you. With a resume that includes 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Hellboy I & II', 'Blade II', 'Pacific Rim', and 'The Devil's Backbone', you know for sure, you're in for something special when Del Toro is involved. That brings us to his latest masterpiece of cinema, 'Crimson Peak'. Now I know that the trailers for 'Crimson Peak' paint a picture that makes this look like a straight horror film, which is not the case here.Guillermo set out to make one of those rare Gothic-Romance stories, something that hasn't been done well in a long time. There are some frightening moments in the film of course, but there aren't a ton of ""jump at you"" scares, which is a breath of fresh air from all of the recent horror movies as of late. Instead, this is a slow burn of terror that follows a woman who falls in love with someone who is not who he appears to be. Guillermo and Matthew Robbins's script allows enough time to set up each character with good amount of back-story, so that we may connect with them.Even the villains. Set in the late 19th century, we center on a young female author named Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska), who lives with her wealthy father (Jim Beaver), and is mostly courted by a local doctor named Alan (Charlie Hunnam). One day, a man comes into town by the name of Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), and with his British accent, he charms Edith and tries to secure funding from Edith's father for a new invention back in England. The two fall for each other and after an accident, Edith moves to England with Sharpe and his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain).Once at the Sharpe estate, which is a run-down, creepy looking mansion, or something that would have suited Vincent Price and Edgar Allan Poe quite well, things take a turn for the worse. Edith begins hearing and seeing strange noises and frightening apparitions that seem to be after her, or at least trying to tell her something. All the things that go bump in the night come full force, and is executed flawlessly by Guillermo's eye. Sooner than later, Edith starts discovering who the Sharpes are and where they came from, which is not very pleasant to say the least.In between the scary moments, we get a look at the relationship between Thomas and Edith, which has a very 'Romeo and Juliet' vibe to it, but we also get the relationship angle from Lucille's angle as well. Lucille is an excellent character to watch through the entire film and see her past through stories that made her what she is today. Del Toro's camera-work has eerie similarities to Stanley Kubrick. Everything is perfectly famed and symmetrical with a ton of great tracking and slow moving shots. The pace is even on par with 'The Shining' from Kubrick, which lets all hell break loose in the finale.This Gothic-Romance-Ghost-Story is a home-run for Del Toro, and I'm sure 'Crimson Peak' will remain in people's minds for a while.Highly Recommended!",Crimson Peak
102,witster18,story is just incomplete and vague. very mild spoilers,5,18 March 2016,"The film looks great. It seemed to have loads of qualities that I usually like. Fantasy elements. Period piece. Mystery/horror. But, where the film dies is in it's bland, under-developed plot.There's some long story about murder.. multiple murders. And that story falls about as flat as a WAffle House menu. It's because of this that the characters emotions lack any substance, and the love- story aspects of the last 10-15 minutes were complete misses for me. At that point I think miss Wasikowski could have cared less about the guy.The film just doesn't work in any way EXCEPT visually. In that aspect it's fantastic, but there's so much more to making a good film.I did like the gore. Well done, and at times a bit shocking. THe film just isn't scary either which really leaves this in the blah blah territory. It's VERY similar to ""Stonehearst Asylum"". That film doesn't look as good as Crimson Peak, but the story is much better and far more developed than it is here, and I actually would recommend that movie BEFORE this one, although neither is very good.Dunno is Toro will ever surpass ""Pan's Labyrinth"".

103,Prichards12345,Crimson Weak,3,8 July 2018,"Guillermo Del Toro comes an awful cropper with this movie. Just about every horror film cliche is doped out in a gorgeous-looking, appallingly-scripted film. and the thing is so silly it becomes unintentionally funny.Tom Hiddlestone is okay, Jessica Chastain gives the sort of performance she might want to leave off her CV. Mia Wasiowsaka's character is so dumb it's hilarious.The script writers obviously realised how bad it was, as they up the gore content to ridiculous levels. The last 30 minutes is pretty much just bodily injury time as everyone gets stabbed, sliced, hacked and bashed. Mia, who has been suffering from slow posioning throughout the movie's second half, becomes a shovel-wielding battler at the end. Tom, of course, reforms all of a sudden when he really does fall in love - ah bless. It's a plot twist you can spot coming a mile off. The women will be happy that he displays his arse Kirk Douglas style.Thanks for all the exposition from phonograph cylinders, handily filling in the gaps for all those audience members who are a bit dim, while at the same time ripping off Dracula. Sorry - in this post-modernist era it's a smart reference, of course for all the psueds. There are plenty of others. I'm just suprised Tom didn't have a monster bubbling in the vat, as they might as well as ripped off Frankenstein as well.I suspect this may become a great guilty pleasure in years to come.

109,CANpatbuck3664,Solid Murder Mystery and Great Atmosphere Ruined by Telegraphed Plot,3,9 December 2015,"I heard mixed things going into Crimson Peak. It seemed to be a love it or hate it type of film but I tried to keep my mind open. I really had no expectations, I haven't seen a lot of Guillermo Del Toro's work but the movie looked like it could be fun from the trailers. I just hoped it would be entertaining but while I admit it might not be made for my demographic, I still found it disappointing as a whole*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A very basic introduction to the plot is that when Edith is a girl, her mother dies and the night after the funeral,she is visited by her mother's ghost who delivers a simple message ""beware of Crimson Peak."" Then the year is 1887 Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is an aspiring writer who wants to write content along the lines of Mary Shelley but she isn't taken seriously. She has attracted the attention of her childhood friend Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) who seems interested in her romantically and it is alluded that he would be the preferred choice of her father Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) but she is oblivious and insists that she does not need to marry. But then Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) seeking funding for his clay digging machine from Carter but he is met with hostility because of his background. Despite the disapproval, Edith and Tom meet up at a party that night and their relationship begins. Lucille (Jessica Chastain) is introduced at the party as well and even though she doesn't seem to initially approve, she eventually encourages the relationship. Carter is still suspicious of Tom and even pays him to embarrass himself and Edith to dissuade him and get him to leave. But the Thomas apologizes, begs for forgiveness and proposes which Edith accepts. Then Carter dies suspiciously and Edith is whisked away to the Sharp's manor in England with Thomas and Lucille.The beginning of the movie highlights one of the outright positives of Crimson Peak, the atmosphere, the costumes and the set design are very well done. This is a point of consistent praise for Del Toro's movies and he succeeds again in Crimson Peak. The window dressing is beautiful and while there might be minor quibbles, it all feels period accurate and really helps bring you into the world that is this movie. Even when they travel to the Cushing estate, while I found the mansion to be over-the-top, it is suitably creepy and I concede it is essential to whether you will enjoy the film or not.Another positive is that I found the design of the ghosts to be interesting and scary. The mix of the CGI and the practical effects does translate well and it's definitely an asset to the film. But on the other side of that, while the ghosts look scary, how the movie decides to use them totally cuts down how well they come across. They aren't so much a malevolent force as they are present to vaguely hint to Edith's character and how they decide to get their message across I found to be really frustrating because of how unclear they are when they do. The ghosts aren't as vital to the plot as the trailers make you think as well. You could pretty easily write them out and you wouldn't miss much.I found the acting to be inconsistent. All of the main cast all range from good actors to great actors but that did not come across here. Jessica Chastain is normally a great actress but I found her character's attitude and her performance as Lucille lacking in the subtlety it needed to cultivate the mystery and I don't know if that's her acting or how the character was written. Mia Wasikowska started out strong but as her character becomes physically weaker during the movie, I felt her performance got weaker as well. I felt the actor that was closest to the intended tone was Tom Hiddleston and while I thought he did a good job, it wasn't enough to help the movie. Jim Beaver and Charlie Hunnam were both solid but Beaver isn't around long and Hunnam's performance is undercut by how lousy his character's decisions are at the endingWhich leads to my two major problems with the film, the first is how predictable the plot is. If you have seen more than a couple of horror movies, you should be able to guess point for point what is going to happen after the first 15 minutes. There could have been a good murder mystery here but within minutes of meeting certain characters or being introduced to a new plot development, I found I was always 2 or 3 steps ahead of the movie. Crimson Peak gets more and more predictable as it goes along and unfortunately because of that, I found myself getting more and more bored during the running time.Secondly, I found the character motivations to be pretty unbelievable at times. Edith is presented as an intelligent and independent young writer in the beginning but after she leaves America, she becomes really slow on the uptake. She just takes way too much at face value and it was grating how imperceptive she was about her new home and the activities of her hosts. Also at the end I couldn't believe how Hunnam's character (Dr. Alan McMichael) acted as well. Knowing what had really gone on with Thomas and Lucille, his lack of situational awareness was groan inducing.Throughout most of the film, I wasn't particularity passionate about it either way, I recognized I probably wasn't the target audience for it and just hoped it would get better. But the more it dragged on the more frustrated I got and by the climax I gave up. I enjoyed aspects of it but as the saying goes it's definitely not equal to the talent behind it.",Crimson Peak
110,dfa120374,Not Too Bad But Not The Best Film Directed By Del Toro,5,28 April 2016,"From watching the trailers for Crimson Peak, I saw that it had all the elements that I usually really enjoy in a modern ""ghost film""...suspense, dark & atmospheric, a sense of uneasiness, and a decent story. It had these elements (to a degree) but it also had one other element that put a dampener on the overall enjoyment of the film for me - it was slow. Slow and on the verge of actually boring me at certain moments, which is a shame because I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I absolutely loved Mama (even though del Toro was only an executive producer for that) and Pan's Labyrinth was very enjoyable, but Crimson Peak doesn't live up to those two films.After watching it, Crimson Peak isn't really a ghost story per se but is more of a story that just happens to have ghosts in it. I know that may seem strange to say and may seem like the same thing, but it's not, and when you watch it for yourself then you'll see what I mean. In saying that, though, some of the scenes that contain the spirits are pretty eerie, especially the opening sequence and about ¾ of the way through the film with a bloody ghost coming up through the floor. I personally think that sequence was about the best one of the film. Other than that...there's not much else. I mean there's a nice sense of suspense and there is a nice atmosphere, but it's all too lacking for my taste.The whole look of the film, from the old Victorian style settings, to the cinematography & direction, were all enjoyable in their own right, but I think you can only go so far with things like that if there's nothing else to grasp your attention and keep it peaked.This IS a film worth watching, but if you're looking for - or maybe expecting - a sort of Victorian version of a modern ghost/paranormal film then you'll be sorely disappointed.Not the best del Toro film out there, but it's worth a shot.",Crimson Peak

112,SquigglyCrunch,Gets Better as it Progresses,6,15 June 2016,"Crimson Peak follows a young woman who falls in love with an inventor and moves away to live with him in his aging, breaking mansion. She eventually discovers ghosts inhabiting the house and begins to suspect her lover and his sister. This is one of those movies that gets better as it progresses. When the characters get to the mansion it's more interesting. It's not that tension is building or anything, nor was I ever on the edge of my seat when I watched this movie, but it's just better. It ends up amounting to, at best, an entertaining movie. However, that's all it amounts to. An entertaining movie. There really isn't a whole lot else. The horror aspects really aren't that scary or clever. It uses a lot of loud, sudden noises and relies on the creepiness of how the ghosts look too much. That not to say that there weren't at least somewhat creepy points, though. Like I said, the movie gets better as it progresses. The first half hour in particular stood out as particularly bad. It's extremely rushed, yet nothing really happens. The characters quickly fall in love, with little to no relationship development. On top of that, the two main love interests have little to no chemistry, which is what this movie seems to be relying on. The relationship wasn't developed, but if the chemistry is good then it's okay. And like I just said, they don't have much of that. By the time they moved to the mansion I simply accepted that this was their relationship and moved on, thus able to enjoy the movie more. Overall Crimson Peak is decent. It gets better as it progresses, but never amounts to anything more than entertaining. It's not exceptional or anything, just entertaining. In the end I would still recommend this movie, just don't expect another great Guillermo del Toro movie.",Crimson Peak

114,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Airing on slightness, the film is beautiful but without a genre, for del Toro perhaps it doesn't matter",7,1 November 2015,"One word serves as the by-line of Guillermo del Toro's next feature: Beware.Guillermo del Toro wants to sit you down and tell you a story. He is an eager host for your attention, enthusiastic in a way that is only possible for someone who truly believes his version of a tale is better than any you've heard before.Around the campfire, one imagines that Del Toro is vibrantly evocative–supplementing his narrative with gestures, shadow puppets, striking imagery—and you might start to forget that you've already heard this story a thousand times. His films breathe life into established tropes (like giant robot WWE or Spanish Alice in fascist wonderland) and they are always captivating, but rarely surprising. Crimson Peak is no different, for better or for worse.From the very start, the film's main characters feel instantly familiar. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is the lovely, bookish daughter of a wealthy businessman in early 20th century New York City. Burdened by the shackles of privilege and high society, Edith finds escape in a career writing ghost stories. She is everything we've come to expect of a heroine—smart, spunky, yet romantic—and it is no surprise when the mysterious Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) arrives at her father's doorstep to charm her off her feet. Along with his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain), Thomas is the last of a dying aristocratic lineage, and seeks investors for his mining invention in a desperate effort to avoid bankruptcy. After he is rebuffed by Edith's father, both as a business partner and as a suitor for Edith, he nevertheless encounters the right circumstances to wed Edith and bring her back to his ancestral English estate, Allerdale Hall.The story that unfolds is a hybrid of Gothic story elements, focused mostly on uncovering the dark secrets of the Sharpes. We follow along as Edith thumbs through old photos, explores forbidden rooms, and generally plays a puffy sleeved version of Nancy Drew with one tiny catch: she can see ghosts. The mangled apparitions are beautifully rendered and thrilling whenever they appear. Del Toro takes full advantage of the film's ""R"" rating, at times pushing the boundaries of the expected gore in an otherwise tame romance/horror film. However, though they are the visual highlights of the film, the ghosts almost feel like decorative veneer tacked onto the walls of the story, secondary to the main plot.It's an easy film to follow because everything you're supposed to feel and think is blatantly telegraphed. Mia Wasikowska is a competent lead, albeit as a character written as thinly as the rims on her gold- framed spectacles (subtext: this pretty girl also has brains!). Once she arrives in the decaying Allerdale Hall, she has little to do except settle in and warm up to Lucille, who seems inexplicably (or not..) jealous of Edith's relationship with her dear brother. Chastain as Lucille is the clear scene-stealer of the movie, a perfect ice queen who turns red-hot with every spiteful glance. She operates at a different level than her co-stars, who seem dull and clunky in comparison. The pieces are set and all we are left to do is wait for everything to come crashing down.Ignoring the numerous shortcomings in plot and dialogue, there is much to enjoy in Crimson Peak. The film occurs in visual peaks and valleys, as if Del Toro sketched out a dozen dramatic stills and then cobbled a film around those images. A flowing gown trails the distraught Edith as she glides down the stairs and bursts out the front door. A dark castle broods on a snow-covered peak, with red clay spewing from the earth like blood. The wispy silhouette of a woman in the hall appears and vanishes, shrouded in shadows and lurching like a robotic spider. The images are effective and moving, and the film is ultimately rewarding if appropriate expectations are first established.Crimson Peak is a slight but gorgeous movie without a genre. It doesn't quite have the scares of a horror movie or the emotion of a romance, but maybe that doesn't matter. Scoot closer to the fire and start making a s'more, Del Toro has another story to tell.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Crimson Peak
115,pfgpowell-1,Striking and engaging take on a standard horror story,6,8 January 2016,"After the delightful Pan's Labyrinth, I watched something like the first ten minutes of Hellboy before turning it off and then, on the strength of Pan's Labyrinth and knowing it was another Guillermo del Toro film sat through every excruciatingly bad minute of Pacific Rim. And I was baffled.How could a writer/director capable capable of producing the quite subtle and moving Pan's Labyrinth (which I recommend) be responsible for the - in my opinion - rubbish that was Hellboy and Pacific Rim (the latter being especially risible)? Answers on a postcard please, to be sent to where the hell you want to send it.I read several good reviews of Crimson Peak but, oddly, it wasn't until after I had seen the film that I discovered it was written and directed by del Toro. And although it doesn't quite reach the standard of Pan's Labyrinth, it most certainly leaves well behind the crassness of Hellboy and Pacific Rim.Del Toro let's himself down by being rather too unoriginal in his plot: where Pan's Labyrinth was original, most of us have seen the story at the base of Crimson Peak 1,000 times before. It is pretty much standard. But that is not necessarily a fatal flaw, because Crimson Peak stands out in other ways. It's cinematography is startlingly other-worldly and the set of Allerdale Hall which is the home of - well, I shan't spoil it - is magnificent in its gory Gothic horror.The actors do the business consummately well - I was especially impressed by Jessica Chastain's vivid performance and her, to my ears, impeccable British accents (she's American) and Mia Wasikowska and Brit Tom Hiddleston get right into the spirit of it all. It's just that at the end of the day all you've seen is a striking interpretation of a horror tale you are well-acquainted with. But don't let me put you off.

116,skybrick736,Crimson Peak (9/10),9,10 July 2016,"Guillermo Del Torro went full Gothic horror in his latest horror film about romance, crime and ghosts called Crimson Peak. The lavish colors in the set and costumes of Crimson Peak are astounding and something new Del Torro brought to the table, in contrast to his darker horror films such as Pan's Labyrinth, Devil's Backbone, Blade II, and Mimic. What really makes Crimson Peak special though is its brilliant writing from beginning to end. The story takes its time to develop, a slowly paced film, which leads to a terrific climax. The main characters evolve throughout the film nicely and are performed perfectly from the big trio of Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, and Tom Hiddleston.

Sometimes less lavishly, less melodramatic, less formulamatic, lesser-known cast, etc. The only ground this film breaks is the pink-ooze built into the setting and plot. The heroine is possibly the stupidest character ever to make it to screen; e.g., having seen monsters and apparitions in the morning wanders about in the afternoon as if she's on vacation. The leading male creep is as handsome and charismatic as a bathroom plunger. The dialogue gives new definition to contrived. What was del Toro thinking? ""I'll make the ultimate Gothic horror film!"".

I had been waiting to see the film for more than a year, so the final result? A fun film with some great, great elements that misses the mark in the storytelling aspect.I frequently talk about good looking movies and good production design and art direction, it is an aspect that I take much care about and when done right really pays off for me. Well this is the real deal. This is one of the most beautiful films to be released in recent years. Art direction and design are through the roof amazing and detailed, it is just a delight for the eyes from frame one. They are so good it is just engrossing to look at the screen even without anything interesting going on with the characters. They are definitely elevated even more by impeccable photography. Not only in the shot choice and camera movement, but the use of color, wow! The lighting is jaw dropping. The use of orange, green, red and white. Really it is so good that it manages to keep things interesting even when the actual film itself in its story and characters is slowing down.Speaking about that, this film really collapses in its third act. Throughout the first and second you are charmed and interested and many seeds are planted that you can't wait to see pay off. Unfortunately that pay off is really underwhelming. The characters aren't as interesting as you thought they were and from there it just looses importance throughout. The three performers are actually very good, especially Chastain, as always, who plays creepy wonderfully. The problem is that the tension is very high throughout the the first two acts and you truly enjoy it, but when it comes down to having the payoff it drops the ball and lessens the whole attachment you had with those first two acts.Yet, I really had fun with it when there was to be had, Del Toro charms us and we are happy to be charmed, even though we are kind of cheated with the third act.",Crimson Peak
119,scottshak_111,A great story that gets lost in its crimson muck.,6,21 October 2015,"Crimson Peak fails to cash in on its stellar cast. We have Hiddleston, Chastain, Wasikowska, and Del Toro's golden goose Hunnam, doing the honours through their brilliant acting. We have got the horror pro Toro in the vanguard running the reels. Still, what goes wrong?Twenty minutes into the movie and you are suddenly hit by a disgusting rock of indifference. You don't want to watch it any further, because things aren't exactly exciting or frantic for that to matter. The introduction of the characters to the tale is sour. The score hobbles from the mysterious violin to occasional piano notes without imparting it a proper depth. It struggles with its ghost without any explanations. Edith played by Mia sways expressionless and sometimes distant in her period attire. Thomas and Edith chemistry doesn't ignite sparks either, and you begin to wonder how mediocre love could be. The latter was supposed to be deliberate. However, it all looked too dramatic to be true which, I believe, Toro could have worked upon more.But then comes the first crime, and suddenly you are handed over a purpose in crimson gore. There is blood and a secret that Hiddleston eyes hide, and you begin doubting the Sharpes at once. Jessica Chastain is brilliant as Lucille Sharpe, but not good enough. She is shadowed mostly for a considerable amount of time before she shows her true colors. Hunnam is lost in a role that could have used some more gravity. But poor editing literally chops him off. Ghosts in the movie like Edith's manuscript's characters are metaphorical and were depicted nicely. It would be foolish for people to turn in to watch this flick assuming it to be of horror genre. It was more like crime. Some of the bits in the movie were great to watch. The story was holed up gorgeously, waiting quietly to unfold itself into a marvelous thriller, which it did halfway. The blood, the deaths and the stabbings were brutal but brilliantly depicted. Screenplay wasn't exactly great, but some of the lines used in the movie were really the alerting kind. Watch out for Lucille's lines on love in the end where she describes love to be twisted.What turned me off big time was how this movie could have become more. There was supposed to be poetry in the flick's crimson clay. The house that breathed of a dreadful past and bled tears of red every night. It all died down in a jiffy on a quick revelation, which was just sad. There wasn't much tension building in the flick that would compel you to bite your fingernails, which was also another crucial factor amiss.",Crimson Peak

Here you get the perfectly told Victorian/gothic fairy tale (gone wrong). The story might not be the most groundbreaking one, but that's fine. It's authentic, believable and most importantly, human. Love, hate, obsession, greed all this play a massive role in CP - the supernatural one is only a side note. Special call out to the Production design team. The overall vibe, buildings, costume, interior is nothing short of spectacular!",Crimson Peak
121,buckikris,Beware Of Crimson Peak,8,1 October 2019,"Crimson Peak is a Gothic tale from director Gullermo Del Toro. This movie is so much better than I thought, in fact I loved it. The story includes ghosts, murder, deceit, and incest, making it one of the best horror/suspense movies I have seen. So here is a little about the movie, and yes my reviews are detailed. So I hope this review is helpful to you?As a young child, Edith Cushing( Mia Wasikoloski) lost her mother to Black Coloria. Edith is raised by her father, Carter Cushing( Jim Beaver). He is a successful wealthy builder in New York. Looking back Edith would remember those nightly visits from her mother's spirit as a child. She would come into Edith's room waking her; and warn Edith about Crimson Peak. It is 1901, Edith is now a successful author in Buffalo; N.Y.. She visits her father and is still very close to her childhood friend; Dr. Alan Mc Michael. Alan is Carter's Physician and really likes Edith. One day Carter is hoping the two will marry. Edith is viewed differently from some of the other women, especially Alan's mother. One day while at work, Baronet Thomas Sharpe( Tom Hiddleston) has an appointment with Carter Cushing. At first, Edith is not impressed with him; because his title says it all. A Baronet is a rich sponge who lives off other people. Thomas has also bought along his sister Lucille Sharpe( Jessica Chastain). Lucille is a piece of work she is very cold to others, and very possessive of her brother. The two are both from Cumberland, England and have been left an estate at Allerdale Hall.When Thomas meets Carter for the first time, Carter doesn't like him one bit. Thomas has come to seeking money from Carter, for his production of clay that is produced on his property. Thomas explains that it is the richest and reddest ever on the planet, hence the name CRIMSON PEAK. In order to keep producing more he needs money for more clay harvesters. Now, Carter knows that Thomas has failed to raise capital in London, Scotland, and Italy. Now in New York, Carter is not buying the story; and asks Alan what he thinks about him? Alan believes he should get, Finlay, an investigator to find some more info on the two. Finlay comes back with the results a couple days later, and Carter knew the two were up to something. The results show the two are penniless sponges. Who prey on primarily on wealthy women.That night there's a ball at Carter's residence, and invites the two siblings. Afterwards he asks to see the two in his den. He tells them he had them checked out and knows there game. Then he pays them off and tells the two to leave Buffalo A.S.A.P.. He especially tells Thomas to have no further contact with with his daughter. The next day Carter is preparing for the day at his club. He hears someone in the bathroom and goes to look around. He can't find anyone, so he returns to finish up. All of a sudden he is blindsided; and beaten to death.After her father's death Thomas contacts her telling her what happened about the payoff and proposes marriage to her. When Edith decides this is best for her, she returns to Allerdale Hall as his wife. She has no idea that he is already married. When she sees this so called estate, she is floored. It's a wreck, the roof is in need of repair, the house sinks into the ground due to the clay; and the two really can't afford to keep it up. She walks around and the first thing she sees is an image of a woman, she tells Thomas; but he says it's Lucille.Thomas tells Lucille and the two start to worry. When it keeps happening, the images become darker; and more grotesque. She finally asks Thomas if anyone has died in the house. He brushes it off and explains to her sure the house is very old.When she meets Lucille and has a chance to really talk to her, she realizes Lucille is very cold towards her. When Edith asks for keys to the house, Lucille refuses. She explains the house is very old, and some places are too dangerous right now. Lucille has plans for Edith, she starts poisoning her tea, she is now their prisoner. She is only their so they can steal her money.Back in Buffalo, Allen talks with Carter's lawyer. He tells Allen Edith has transferred all her assets to Cumberland, England. Allan is shocked when he hears this, and talks to Finlay. Allen tells Finlay something isn't adding up, transferred assets, no communication, and the sudden marriage.When Alan meets with Finlay and gets the news. Finlay tells him that Thomas is already married to a Pamela Upton of Milan, Italy. When Alan hears this he knows Edith is in trouble, and goes to England to help her.While Edith is there, Lucille continues to be hateful to her; and Thomas is still his sister's puppet. Edith demands a key and will do anything to get one eventually stealing Lucille's one day. Even though Thomas is married he begins to fall in love with her. Edith continues to see these images of a ghost; and tells Thomas. Thomas and Lucille know she is seeing the image of their late mother, Lady Sharp(Dave Jones). The spirit seems to help Edith find clue's all over the house about the duo. When Edith wises up she begins to search the house and comes across this chest. It holds the secret of three women and their mother. These women who were wealthy were held captive until they signed over their assets to Thomas and Lucille Sharpe. It comes out they too were poisoned, robbed, and later killed-all for money.When Alan arrives at the Sharp's estate he tells Edith everything, even though she is suffering from being poisoned she does understand him. All their history,especially when the two were young and sent away. When Alan begins to take Edith home, Thomas inflicts a non-fatal wound to him. Then for the first time in his life Thomas stands up against his sister, confronts her, but she ends up killing him. Lucille then begins to track down Edith. The two fight to the death, when Edith hits her with a shovel, Thomas's ghost is there to help Edith. In the end, Edith and Allen escape from Crimson Peak. In Conclusion, this is a great tale that has it all even a great ending. An impressive piece of work with excellent visuals,plot, and acting was decent considering these actors were unknown to me.",Crimson Peak

Del Toro disappoints a bit and makes it clear what we already know, except for Pan's Labyrinth, his scripts are weak, poorly constructed and simple, Del Toro is aesthetically perfect, but needs to improve on the art script.

As is to be expected with del Toro, the directing, set design, and cinematography were fantastic. Acting was good, too. Story was the main negative: the plot never builds to anything that is worth investing two hours in.Everything feels like happening in rush. there's nothing proper shown the love development either. Also I have to mention the very first ghost appearing was really good, but then it all went down the slice CGI route. I am shocked that Hollywood can come up with such kind of movie. Also, initially i felt it was a horror movie as leading actress is writer and writes horror stories instead of love story and sees her mom very often. The only creative part about the movie was color-Red and white!! Crimson Peak may flop, but Alice 2 will save Mia's career.",Crimson Peak

125,jmbwithcats,Flowers in the Attic meets Fall of the House of Usher,8,8 November 2015,"Beautiful take on these stories. I shouldn't be surprised by all the hate, I really do think this movie is just over as lot of people's heads, when their arguments are not enough nude women, or it's too slow... when in fact it's a fantastic, and slow-burning Gothic ghost story... I have a feeling people are going to nitpick the movie to death, the way they are want to do... but i think there is too much thinking and not enough feeling sometimes when it comes to the beauty of folklore... Almost every problem I heard about are easily explained, such as why Sir Thomas looks fine as a ghost, but mother does not... it is because mother is coming from a place of panic and anxiety... and Alan is coming from a place of love. I am glad she finally got her book published, and it was the movie we watched.What's sad is that Thomas was coming around, he was waking up and wanting to change things, and his passion for his machine, and leaving the old house... I'm not saying he didn't get what he deserved... but he almost got out, and one must wonder what alternative ending could have been for he and Edith.",Crimson Peak
126,disinterested_spectator,Layers of Complications,6,17 March 2016,"How does a movie like ""Crimson Peak"" come to be produced? Well, I cannot say that I actually I have inside knowledge of this movie in particular, but over many years of watching movies, I have noticed that plots seem to be getting more complicated. A simple story that might have satisfied audiences in the early part of the twentieth century would have been regarded as too thin by mid-century, requiring additional elements and twists. But even these more complicated stories seemed to be boring and repetitious as the years wore on, requiring even more stuff to be added. This process of accretion, by which an originally simple plot acquires more and more elements until it is bloated with material, continues unabated to this day. And so, though I have no specific knowledge of how ""Crimson Peak"" came about, I suspect it might have happened something like this:Scriptwriter: ""I have an idea for a story. An American woman named Edith Cushing, who has a lot of money, marries Thomas Sharpe, a man from England with a title. But when she gets to England, she finds that Crimson Peak, the house he owns, is a ruin with a gaping hole in the ceiling that lets in the snow and the rain as well as lots of moths. There are certain parts of the house she has to avoid because of the danger of a collapse. Furthermore, her husband is a loser, a would-be inventor who spends his time fruitlessly trying to make a machine that will allow him to extract the red clay from the earth in hopes of making enough money to restore Crimson Peak to its former glory. In the meantime, she must struggle trying to live in a house that in America would have been condemned years ago.""Producer: ""Is that it? That would have been enough of a story back when they made silent films, but that's not enough for today's audience.""Scriptwriter: ""All right. The man has a sister named Lucille who lives there too, and she is overbearing and hostile to Edith.""Producer: ""Yawn.""Scriptwriter: ""How about this? Thomas and Lucille are not really brother and sister. Actually, they are married, and they have schemed to get their hands on Edith's money by way of a phony marriage to her.""Producer: ""That's better. But there is no need to get rid of the brother-sister relationship. That way the marriage between Thomas and Lucille will be incestuous. Juicy! Still, you can't just leave it at that. We need more.""Scriptwriter: ""I know. Their mother found out that Thomas and Lucille were having sex when they were children. When she tried to stop it, they murdered her.""Producer: ""Good. Matricide is a nice touch. But why stop there? Let's have a bunch more murders.""Scriptwriter: ""Uh, Lucille murdered Edith's father, who objected to the marriage. Moreover, Thomas has been married to several other rich women before, all of whom were murdered once he and Lucille got their hands on their money. And now they are planning to murder Edith by slowly poisoning her. And Edith's friend in America, Dr. Alan McMichael, has gotten wind of all this and has come to England to save her. He and Edith are almost killed, but they get the better of Thomas and Lucille, who are dead by the end of the movie. Edith and Alan live happily ever after.""Producer: ""Now we are getting somewhere. If this were still the late twentieth century, we would finally have enough for a movie. But something is missing. I can feel it. Maybe if we added a plot element that required some special effects, that would get this story on its feet.""Scriptwriter: ""I've got it! We'll put ghosts in this story. Edith's dead mother can warn her about Crimson Peak. And the ghosts of some of the other people that died along the way can be added in.""Producer: ""Ah. That's nice. But there is just one thing that still worries me. A lot of people don't believe in ghosts. They might regard that part of the movie as just so much silly superstition.""Scriptwriter: ""No problem. We'll have Edith be an aspiring author when the movie begins, in which she says that the ghost in her story is just a metaphor.""Producer: ""Not bad. But a metaphor for what?""Scriptwriter: ""Who cares? Just as long as it flatters the intelligence of the audience.""",Crimson Peak
127,msunando,A chill a minute,8,17 October 2019,"Crimson Peak - When Edith Cushing's (Mia Wasikowska) father dies under mysterious circumstances, the aspiring author of ghost stories doesn't have much to hold her back from surrendering to her love for the mysterious Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Now married to Thomas, Edith must leave behind her family estate in Buffalo and head to the Allerdale Hall in England, an age old and secluded mansion standing tall amid red soil. Much as Thomas and his sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastaine) have fancy titles, Edith soon discovers that the family is actually broke and is looking for money to fund a mining project in the estate. She will also discover that the three of them are not the only inhabitants of the mansion, but there are ghosts creeping out of hone woodwork, trying to tell her about a sinister and morbid past and a terrifying plot hatching. The movie is downright eerie and sends shivers down the spine in the beginning, but the horror doesn't hold for long as it transforms into a suspenseful narrative in due course. No love lost - the tale is gripping enough for the viewers to remain at the edge of the seat until the very end when the mystery falls in place. The frigid mansion, the snowstorm outside, the mysterious characters and a-chill-a-minute storytelling are worth every pence. Director Guillermo del Torro spins a masterful horror tale that is disturbing till the very end.

128,fil-nik09,Not bad,7,20 August 2016,"This movie is enjoyable. It is interesting and visually beautiful. I really liked the setting inside a Gothic ruined castle. The rooms inside the castle are beautifully decorated and everything about the enteriors of any place in the movie is pure 10! Also, the costumes are 10 too! I see that many see this movie as a horror. For me, it was a dark fairytale. Certainly not a horror film. There may be some scenes which may be close to horror, but, all in all, it is more fantasy / dark fairytale than real horror of any genre.Maybe I see it as a fairytale because I associate Mia with Alice in Wonderland - that was the 1st movie I saw her in. Jessica was great in this movie. But I must say that I do not remember her from other films though I did saw some with her. As for Tom - this is the 1st movie with him I see, but his liesson with Taylor Swift was in my mind the whole time. Anyways, the acting was on point with everyone. The music was fitting into the scenes. I really like the idea of snow turning into bloody red because of the soil.I give it a seven. To be precise, it would be: 7.49.

129,jackmeat,Visually beautiful horror romance.,7,1 November 2015,"My quick rating - 7,4/10. This was the movie for me to see on Halloween this year, that is for sure. As usual, Guillermo del Toro visually stuns the audience with every single scene. The locations that are presented are an absolute marvel. Granted a film cannot be just a national geographic on location shoot alone and this film delivers. The story itself is a mixture of two stories really, one that is ghost story and the other that is romance/thriller.The Gothic/romance part of this story follows a young American woman (Mia Wasikowska)who is born into wealth yet aspires for her own identity, writing. She falls head over heels for a ""Baronette"" (Tom Hiddleston) who seems to be mysteriously enamored with her.The ghost story part revolves around the spirits off those past hanging onto a particular place or feeling which del Toro typically incorporates into the story more then being the focus of it. That being said, the creatures when used look very creepy and startle with their appearance and on queue sound that makes the viewer jump on a few occasions. Not many directors understand how to blend CGI and practical effects in such a seamless way.Now the basis is set and fans of his previous work may complain since there are two totally different types of del Toro films, huge Hollywood blockbusters such as Pacific Rim and lesser known Spanish horror films such as Devils Backbone. There are more examples of each, but you get the point. This movie is more or less what happens when these worlds collide. Now we have both and I, for one as a fan, am grateful. The story itself may be a bit obvious at times but the way the supernatural helps the audience through is so brilliantly done, that you may have forgotten you guessed parts 10 minutes prior. This is also assisted by extremely good performances of which the show is stolen by Jessica Chastain, playing Lucille, as a dark and seductive character. Here she plays the sister of the Baronette Tom Sharpe. Without giving further away to this film, I will say that everything you would want from a film are all here (minus a complex plot). The scares that del Toro can so simply yet effectively extract from an audience is present along with all the vibrant use of color and sound to contrast the changing moods. Not heavy on the horror or the romance, just a perfect balance of the two making this a worthwhile film for any audience that appreciates quality film making.I applaud del Toro for coming back with such a film after his Pacific Rim undeservedly bombed in the theaters. Welcome to his world which he crafts so well and enjoy the ride.",Crimson Peak
130,Alanjackd,Gothic Romantic Drama...NOT a horror !,6,19 October 2015,"Was expecting a horror but this is not a horror...the trailers will have you believe it is but it isn't.Gothic Drama I suppose...like Dracula or Frankenstein..it's more about the lives of people and how they get complex.Very early on when Edith is explaining her novel,she says it's not a ghost story ..just a story with a ghost in it..which for me was the whole premise of the movie...I'm not too sure whether the ghosts really existed or whether they were a metaphor..but that didn't take away from things.For a start ,as with all GDT movies it was beautifully filmed with all hues of each color and the shots of the house in the dark were wonderful ( would have loved to see it in 3D) and all the crew placed themselves well in the action, especially the sister, who just ran away with the plot all by herself.It's not what you expect from the trailers ( which is a particular gripe of mine as they seem to try to change the idea of what the movie is all about)..As the film started it didn't have a GDT feel to it , but after a half hour I felt comfortable and settled in. The violence is graphic but is slotted in as it would be in real life...comes out of nowhere and then moves on.All in all a great Gothic and romantic drama with a few scares in and a welcome return to the great director..Pan's Labrynth it is not,,,but how can you improve on the best.",Crimson Peak

It's a run down labyrinth, bleeding from the clay underneath and eroding from a lack of affection.

132,jmoneyjohal,"Del Toro dabbles in many genres in Crimsons peak, horror, romance,gore, and successful does so. The film is a visual feast, but it has its flaws.",7,16 October 2015,"In the climax of the film Jessica Chastain's character says that she is doing this for her love, and it hit me, this film maybe a lot of things, a horror film, a gory film, a film that is very classical British in setting and theme, but behind all this Crimsons Peak is a dark love story. Director Guillermo del Toro has a resume of making superb films, that are off beat and Crimson Peak is exactly this. With Crimson Peak you enter the world Del Toro has made for audience, the film is very dark in its setting, but the sets, the houses are very classical and colorful.Del Toro smartly packages a classical drama, and horror film together. And in the climax he also adds the gore, and thats where the film is at its best. Its a classical film fusionend with modern sensibilities. But the film is not with out its blemishes but more on that later.Story wise the film is about a girl named Edith Cushing who since a young age is haunted by her moms ghost, and her ghost always tells her ""beware of Crimson Peak"", Edith does not know what Crimson Peak is. Edith therefore grows up believing in ghosts, and she also becomes a novelists who writes stories about ghosts. Her father Carter Cushing, is a big time builder, and one of his visitors Sir Thomas Sharp from England ends up falling in love with Edith. Edith's father despises Thomas, and finds out some secrets about Thomas and his sister. He then tells them to leave America and gives them cash to do so, he also tells Thomas that he will tell Edith all his secrets if he doesn't abide. Soon Carter is killed mysteriously, and Thomas marries Edith thereafter, and by this time we know his reasons for marrying Edith are not good. Thomas then takes Edith back to his house in England. What happens next is what forms the rest of main crux of the plot.Acting wise Tom Hiddleston is fabulous.Mia Wasikowska is excellent. Charlie Hunnman is exceptional. But Jessica Chastain steals the show, she is absolutely menacing in her role, and in the climax she is absolutely crazily good.Crimson Peak is a superb work of art, its a film which is beautiful to look at. The Thomas mansion in England for example is extremely scary looking and beautiful at the same time. The attention to detail is marvelous. The classical setting of the late 1800s is done superbly with the spectacular costumes, and cars etc. The film is a visual feast. The film also mixes horror,romance, a period drama, and gory film all together superbly. The climax was absolutely breathtaking, while many would not love the gory violence in the end, I am a huge fan. The films dark eerie undertone is exceptional. But the film has it flaws, the pace for example is snail like slow at times. And the films twists, and suspense could be guessed from miles away. The script, and edit needed to be more tight.Overall Crimson Peak is a film which would fully enjoyed by fans of Gothic/horror love stories, its a very niche film. I loved the film despite it flaws, but the film carries a beware tag of it might end up being to gory, and dark for the regular cinema going audience. But all withstanding Del Toro keep making films like this, its nice to see something so different from the regular cluster of films.3.5/5* or 7/10",Crimson Peak
133,patriciogl10,Stunning gothic-styled film. Signature del Toro.,9,17 September 2018,"What can I say? I was greatly impressed by everything in this movie, if I'm being honest. I was enamoured by the somber tone and the Gothic style of the story. The production design is really something to behold and admire. Visually it is a marvellous spectacle, it is truly one of Guillermo del Toro's undeniable strengths. The clever use of certain colours such as red and symbolism really fit with the horrific setting and back story. Even the costumes are amazing, specially those worn by Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). A huge plus I want to
give to this movie is the complete absence of cheap jumpscares; this film managed to be scary simply by introducing its scary elements slowly but always in frame; which made me contemplate the frightening figures
for a longer period of time, thus making its purpose much more effective.I'll leave the details of the plot to your viewing experience; I will just comment on the high quality performances by the main actors. Mia Kasikowska does a fantastic job, she reminded me of Joan Fontaine as Mrs. de Winter in Hitchcock's Rebecca in some moments. Both Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain fantastically deliver haunting performances, with their characters torn between good and evil at key points in the film. I was blown away by Chastain's performance, specially when her intentions are fully revealed.I was completely immersed in the viewing experience, almost as if I was omnipresent yet a part of the tale. That's what each and every single one of the elements I mentioned above do when they are exceptionally well-put
together by a competent filmmaker like Del Toro, who has his own particular style completely figured out and able to manage it with taste and stylistic artistic direction.If you're looking for a great gothic-styled movie, this is it. The visuals will astonish you, the horror elements will surprise you and its story will captivate you.

134,TheRedDeath30,"Gorgeous and Entertaining, but Feels a Little Too Familiar",8,26 March 2016,"Expectations always seem to temper opinions. This is a completely natural tendency in a viewer. We each bring our own pre-conceived notions of what we expect from a film and those can influence our ultimate opinion of that movie. I feel that this has had a lot of impact on the reviews that I see of this film from a lot of viewers, where I see the ratings tending to be much lower than those I see from film critics.For one, this is del Toro, one of the most visually gifted directors of our generation, a man who knows how to craft a modern fairy tale, but a director who's work seems to be pigeon-holed into the ""horror"" category much more than the actual work on film merits. I do not say that critically. I mean that many don't know what else to call his movies, so horror fits, but most are not fully horror films in any traditional sense and, as a result, the average mindless horror film will have expectations of a movie that are unfair. These expectations were probably propelled further by the trailers for this film, which focused a good deal on the ""ghostly"" aspects even though this is not really a horror movie. del Toro's reputation lends itself towards over-expectations, as well. When you've crafted genius films like PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, then fans naturally expect nothing but the best.Personally, I was probably in a neutral frame of mind going into this movie. While I am a fan of del Toro's previous work, I am usually not a fan of the sort of Gothic romance that this work is based upon, so perhaps walking into this thinking I could love it or hate it lent itself towards an open mind, but I have to say that I walked away very impressed by a movie that is beautifully stunning and kept my attention riveted for the entire two hour run time, making me crave another viewing, which few movies can truly do for me anymore.Do not expect a horror film in any modern sense because this movie is light years away from Hollywood dreck like INSIDIOUS or THE CONJURING. Yes, we get some ghost scenes that are creepy and unnerving. The ghost creations are memorable and frightening. These ghosts are not there to be the central plot point, though. They are background characters that propel and foreshadow the action. As our heroine states about her own ""work within the work"" (a novel she is writing), the ghosts serve as a symbol of the past.This movie is much more akin to the Gothic romance novels that dominated 19th century literature. For those unfamiliar, this is the precursor to what eventually becomes horror, starting with works like JANE EYRE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS, leading to the works of people like Hawthorne and eventually Poe. They were much more about mood and dark secrets than any attempt to frighten an audience outright. The movie also borrows heavily from 60s horror cinema. The color schemes and visual tones are reminiscent of Mario Bava's work. The costumes and sets remind me a great deal of Hammer Studios. The plot and themes pay homage to works like THE INNOCENTS and THE HAUNTING. It is here, in these influences, that I feel the movie is held back from being a true ""10"". It often feel like you have been down this dark hallway before and possibly crosses that thin line from homage to imitation. The finale, especially, left me thinking he was going to just blatantly ape the closing of THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, as the movie skewed so closely to that beloved work.The ultimate test of any move, though, should be its' entertainment factor and here the movie succeeded admirably for me. I was hypnotized by the stunning visual look of the movie and completely drawn in by the plot to the point where I accomplished the rare feat of watching the entire two hours without ever losing interest. That sounds it should be a natural thing for a movie, but ask yourself when was the last time you watched a whole movie without checking up on a few phone apps while you watched? The mystery of the movie is, perhaps, telegraphed and no real shock, but the journey to that destination unravels in a way that really draws the viewer.The sets and costumes are amazing. The fact that they actually built and shot the movie in this decaying mansion is incredible. It felt like a found home that had been left in neglect for a century. The movie does a great job of getting us familiar with the layout of the home in natural ways. This becomes vital in the movie's crescendo as the film winds its' way through the house layout. The acting is very well done. I have not been a big fan of Mia Wasikowski in much of what I've seen before, but she does a great job of playing both strong and independent, as well as frightened and vulnerable. The antithesis to her character is Jessica Chastain who is steely, cold and calculating and creates a perfect villain.I honestly didn't expect to like this movie nearly as much as I did. I get bored by ghost stories. I was a literature major in college who's read scores of the ""great classics"" but was never all that into the Gothic movement. I do love del Toro and 60s horror. As the closing credits rolled, I literally found myself thinking ""wow, that was good"". That's a feeling I don't get often enough.",Crimson Peak
135,pranayjalvi,Totally Disappointed,3,12 December 2015,After viewing the trailer I thought the movie has something to watch for as it is directed by Del Toro. I liked other movies of him and so was expecting this to be the same like his others. However the Gothic horror was totally dull and didn't have any scary moments to fear for. The cast were good enough but the plot of the movie not strong enough. Del toro came up with new Gothic horror concept but it was a downfall for him. The movie feels promising from where it starts but looses its plot and becomes same boring horror stuff without any horror in it. The visuals were good but the plot was strangled in itself. Don't waste your time to watch this movie. I would go with 3/10 for this movie and just because it is directed by Del Toro,Crimson Peak
136,songod-95003,Marvelous filming...,8,3 December 2019,"Cannot deny this was a wonderfully made film. The acting, direction, cinematography... all first rate.My only issue, and maybe it's cause I watch too many horror type movies is, won't Edith be blamed for the murders of Thomas and Lucille? Clearly she killed Lucille and making the jump to her killing Thomas won't be a big one seeing how police work was done in those days. Tho the wax recordings and papers she found (thankfully the house did not burn down) may save her from the noose. And if the doctor makes it (seems he will as a group of people appear to be coming at the end) he is a witness. So then it all ends well with she and he heading back to America.Or will the ghosts follow....??",Crimson Peak
137,Jerghal,A great film and welcome break from the jump scare flicks,8,26 December 2015,"I was getting pretty sick of those jump-scare-there's-something-lurking-in-a-dark-corner style movies like Insidious and the Conjuring. And Guillermo Del Toro must have thought the same thing because Crimson Peak is a gorgeous looking Gothic style movie with awesomely designed sets which have an incredible amount of detail to them. This adds a great dark and brooding atmosphere to the film and alleviates the need for these aforementioned jump scares. The story is well written and has great characters played by Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and other well cast actors. Unfortunately it got only moderate critical reviews and was also somewhat ignored by the audience in favor of Goosebumps no less. Damn kids, they ruin everything! wink emoticonBut it might get a second life in the video circuit as people might still discover this very enjoyable movie. Big thumbs up for me!",Crimson Peak
138,Aly200,"Creepy, Atmospheric and Well Acted",8,20 January 2017,"One of Guillermo Del Torro's most divisive movies as it was mostly reviled by critics and audiences. However the movie is better than most people are willing to give it credit for. The story of a wealthy woman who marries a mysterious and charming stranger, but butts heads with her new sister-in-law and soon discovers haunting secrets about her new home with deadly consequences in store. The film is well cast with Mia Wasikowska as heroine Edith Cushing, the naive and lovely heiress who aspires to be a successful novelist in late nineteenth century America (and London once she moves to her husband's ancestral home). Edith is prone to being haunted by ghosts as she regularly sees her mother's spectral form warning her of the titular ""Crimson Peak"". Playing the role of Edith's suitor is the devilishly charming Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas Sharpe. The English actor is perfectly suited for the role as he exudes charm and tenderness while harboring sinister secrets that attract us even more to Hiddleston's Thomas. And rounding out the big name leads is Jessica Chastain as Hiddleston's sinister sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe. Chastain plays her character with an out-right disdain for Wasikowska's Edith which leads us to mistrust her immediately. To counter her sinister nature, Chastain demonstrates an eerie control on Hiddleston's Thomas. Her motives for her behavior are kept secret from the viewer until the film's shocking climax when Edith finds out the horrible secrets of the Sharpes.The film keeps an utterly unsettling atmosphere as Del Torro utilizes soft color palettes for lighting and the sets. However the red clay is a garish shade of red to offset the green tones of the titular house. Admittedly the CGI in the film is cheap-looking compared to Del Torro's other films where he blended practical and digital effects much more seamlessly.Still give this film a chance even if you end up hating it.",Crimson Peak
139,rlaine,Stylish and bloody Gothic tale,8,28 November 2016,"Warning, spoilers within.Not 100 % sure of what to think of this. It's sets are gorgeous, acting good for the most part, visuals are amazing really except maybe for the ghosts. Ghost CGI is a bit too CGI and in the end the whole ghost part seems a bit redundant (ironic considering the book writing part of the script).The story is a bit strange. In a way it's quite straightforward, simple love story. But then there are a lot of wtf kind of things going on. The whole mining part was very strange, other than maybe place the story within the second industrial revolution. In a way there are no big payoffs, larger than life twists, or anything overly creative with the script, but then again there are themes of incest etc. These script parts just don't make you go ""aha"" or ""wow, wasn't expecting that"". I don't know if they left a lot of material on the cutting room floor or if the script is as loose as it is, but the story feels a bit uninspired by todays standards. It raises quite a few ""why's"". I never figured how the mother (ghost) knew about the crimson peak. It'd make some sense if the woman played by Mia Wasikowska had been revealed to be a sibling of the Sharpe's, but I didn't catch anything that would suggest so (it would've been fitting also considering the incest part).Acting is pretty good. So is the music. Too much blood and violence to my taste, imo they don't add anything to the story, only to lure gore hounds in. As a horror it's not really scary by todays standards, but I don't except this kind of Gothic tale to be any scarier. The mood is there and that's the strongest part of this movie.It's a good dark mood movie, may very well watch it again just for the sets and maybe to see if I catch something that I may have missed on the first go which might deepen the story a little.",Crimson Peak
140,FelipeCarrillo,"""Watching del Toro films is a pleasure""",10,22 October 2015,"Director Guillermo del Toro is the master in creating worlds of satured reality. With each film made by him, increasingly it shows professionalism and his love for the symbolism, the extravagant stories and strives to be the best at his job. Del Toro is the Stephen King of the suspense movies. Guillermo creates atmospheres totally absorbing , and Crimson Peak the spotlight are the dark secrets that live in the Allerdale Hall environment.In this film what most frightens aren't ghosts, what is more terrifying each of the images displayed on screen. It is simple, see a del Toro's work, is to see hell itself.All the movie is fantastic but in Allerdale Hall really begins ""Crimson Peak"", obviously the introduction to the life of Edith is important (especially the warnings of her mother).The colors are autumnal, mustards and oranges. Kate Hawley takes one of the aspects resaltables of the movie. Lucille slashes through that mellow golden landscape in fiery-crimson dresses or heavy all-black gowns. On the other hand, Allerdale Hall is a daunting ruin where there are spaces too large or too small giving us the perfect atmosphere to scare the entire planet, but the most gruesome of the mansion is the constant red clay that threatens to sink into the pleasure of the movie. Edith's trips all over the house and the warnings of her sister - in - law (that there are rooms she must not go into) .""Crimson Peak"" has a beautiful wardrobe, dark secrets, a husband who seems a stranger, a sister- in - law hiding something behind cups of tea, a pap , an ax and a strange obsession with her brother and her macabre secret with ""Mother"". As in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""Crimson Peak"" engenders an atmosphere of great proportions for great performance. The images themselves have tremendous power: A blonde woman sneaking through a dark house holding a candelabra. A black-haired woman stalking through an interior snowfall, carrying a tray of rattling tea cups. A man in his workshop creating toys that open their mouths to vomit silver balls. Edith sees horrors at night through doorways, down hallways. She must be brave enough to face these phantasms, to look them in the eye, to see what she is not supposed to see. On the opposite side, Thomas and Lucille must prevent Edith from seeing. Del Toro is of the old - school, and reminds us in ""Crimson Peak"" through totally extinct tricks nowadays, (as transitions from scene to scene or where a circular shape surrounded by blackness homes in on one small image) covering us mainly black in color (circles , hugs or transition ). The dance between Edith and Thomas is a piece of art, aesthetic , magical , elegant, perfect execution , one of the most beautiful moments of the film, Crimson Peak is a whole Gothic love , and that really showed .The Paranormal spectra are excellent, handled in an extraordinary way scares , and a simple appearance the viewer can experience the worst experience of your life. Guillermo has not cheap jump-scares , William shakes and shudders in the most disturbing way of all ( real fear )The soundtrack is delicious , delights us with terrifying pieces, and with a simple piano roll, the blood rises to my head , managing to close our eyes to the strongest .Mia Wasikowska as Edith Cushing is just perfect for this role, this is the work of her career, there is no one to surpass her ability to convey the terror on her face, Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas Sharpe plays with his character around the movie , playing as the protagonist or antagonist ( the style Miles Teller - Peter Hayes - in Divergent Series), Charlie Hunnam as el Dr. Alan McMichael is the undisputed hero and the best for last Jessica Chastain as Lady Lucille Sharpe begins with a minor character but as the film progresses Jessica performs one of the best characters in his successful career, She is the point of the movie surprise. Undoubtedly, Crimson Peak Guillermo del Toro will be one of the films of the year , for its history, for its execution , its effects and foremost by the Gothic romance. One of the best films of the decade . Guillermo always surprises but this time do more than that, we dismayed . And never forget:""The ghosts exist ""Edith Cushing",Crimson Peak

Crimson peak when I heard about it I knew it would be good especially considering Gulmedio Del Toro directing this,I saw this on October 27th my birthday and I went to see it because I was board if was unexpected and I had a bit of money left. When I went in and watched the like first 30 minutes I was so entertained,it was so interesting..I LOVED IT!

142,supermaggie,Clichés over clichés - pretty much a complete waste,1,6 March 2016,"I must admit, I am not a fan of Del Toro's movies, however, the images of Crimson Peak did look promising enough, so I was looking forward to watch it. It turned out to be a waste of time. The pictures are nice but wasted on an incredibly thin, dumb, boring, clichéd story, one has seen a million times and done far better than here. An incredibly sad waste of decent actors, and nice pictures - i.e. nice sets, since the ghosts are nothing special/nothing original either, fitting the lame story. If del Toto cannot do better than celebrate the millionth version of bad fascists or the millionth version of stale crime topics, why is he being supported/employed by the highly demanding movie producers while there is so much fresh/real talents waiting in the wings?? I was so relieved that he did not do the Hobbit, boy was I right!!",Crimson Peak
143,fung0,Lavish production of threadbare concept,6,1 June 2016,"As a long-time fan of Guillermo del Toro's films, I found Crimson Peak very disappointing. del Toro's trademark visuals are wasted on a painfully obvious and rather perfunctory story. Where films like Cronos and Mimic were memorably creepy, Crimson Peak is merely gory, gaudy and uninvolving.The film starts well, with aspiring American author Edith Cushing falling for ne'er-do-well English aristocrat Thomas Sharpe. The period atmosphere feels authentic, and the conflicts in 19th Century Buffalo, NY, have a nice Masterpiece Theater quality.Unfortunately, all this is abandoned about a third of the way into the film. The setting shifts to the ludicrously hokey-looking Allerdale Hall, ancestral home of the Sharpe family. And the story dissolves into a morass of tired plot elements, thrown into a blender and splattered randomly onto the screen. The obligatory jump-scares quickly become predictable, and eventually tedious.Along the way, the ghost-story sub-plot that we started out with becomes increasingly superfluous. Edith's background and literary ambitions similarly seem important at first, but end up playing no role whatsoever in the story. In fact, character plays almost no role at all, in what gradually devolves into a paint-by-numbers story, where we recognize the players mainly by their resemblance to characters in older and far better films.(Mild spoilers.) The ending is incongruously action-oriented, completely abandoning any pretense at Gothic atmosphere - or at real drama. Characters survive unbelievable violence, make inexplicable personality shifts, and eventually just hack away at each other more in the style of Hong Kong action films than of Victorian melodrama.(End spoilers.)I think I can dimly make out what Del Toro was reaching for. But it's not like it just slipped out of his grasp - it's pretty clear he never really had any handle on it at all. Crimson Peak is a lush and passably diverting film, but one of Del Toro's weakest efforts overall.",Crimson Peak
144,dakjets,Beautiful horror - could have worked better without the blood spell,7,30 October 2015,"At last, a new good traditional horror movie! And it has scary moments that will shake you.As a lover of horror movies, I found this film a well done horror story, that first of all is beautiful and thoroughly made. The acting is good, and the filming is breathtaking. Personally I prefer the first half of the film, when the story takes place in England, and we get to know the main character, who falls in love with the wrong guy. In this part, the plot is exciting, and builds up a suspense. Almost as a crime tale, with ghosts and added with a dark twist. The horror effects are convincing, and they take place around the love story of the film. It is a pity of the violence that takes place in the second part of the film. I think it spoils the theme of the film, and I can't figure out why? The film works fine without the blood spell. Despite of this, I will recommend it if you like a good old fashion horror movie, and one with a well done storytelling.",Crimson Peak
145,Dragonsouls,Twisted with a capital T,8,23 January 2016,"Guillermo Del Toro co-wrote this story and he really knows how to craft some pretty strong villains--villains so twisted that I find myself really rooting for the protagonists in his stories. Tom Hiddlestone and Jessica Chastain are fabulous in this film; one being a conflicted villain and the other a full fledged psycho. Jessica Chastain's portrayal of a damaged, emotionally scarred psychopath was chilling, and I found myself despising her. The performance would be Oscar worthy if this was a contemporary film but its not--and so she'd never get the nomination. Mia Wasikowska was also excellent at playing a childlike, innocent and naive protagonist, and fit excellently into the plot as a gullible victim of a manipulative lover. Besides the excellent display of acting by the entire cast, I thought the film's visuals, set design and art direction were on par with what you usually get in a Del Toro film. The costumes were amazing. The atmosphere really added to the somber story and my one gripe would be the CGI used for the ghosts. It just did not seem as good or as scary as it did in Pan's Labyrinth and I would've preferred makeup effects instead for a more chilling effect. There were also a lot of nods and inspirations taken from Kubrick's ""The Shining."" And that's a good thing!This is a beautiful, Gothic, twisted tale about the greed demon. And its a movie about intuitive life-saving forces that push us on the right track whenever we find ourselves slipping away from it. 8/10. The beginning didn't really suck you in, but it really picked up after the 30 minute mark. A classic example of a horror film that doesn't rely on jump scares, but rather, the actions of some really damaged emotionally scarred souls.",Crimson Peak

He also knows how to light Mia Wasikowska, who looks positively luminous. Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain give good support, and it is a testament to del Toro that (as with his other films) the design and special-effects don't swamp the performers...too much.

150,stephendaxter,"A Gothic Romance with some creepy elements, but not necessarily scary",7,14 October 2015,"Guillermo Del Toro, an incredibly diverse film-maker and a fantastic Gothic Horror director returns with Crimson Peak. It is a love story that incorporates many old school horror tones, but ultimately is more of a Gothic Romance with some horror elements as oppose to being strictly Gothic Horror. It is definitely of the most beautifully stylised horror films of recent years and it is evident that was a focus of Del Toro, through its emphasis in this film and his previous works. If you are going in to this film expecting constant scares as the trailer led you to believe then you will be pretty disappointed. The film definitely focuses mostly on the character relationships and incorporates horror elements here and there but other than a select few moments the movie isn't really 'scary' it is mainly creepy and spooky. There is no doubt though that visually the film is very well presented, and it has Del Toro's distinct visual style all over it. There are many beautiful shots of the scenery and detail of the house and uses small hints of bright colour to make each shot a little more interesting. The elements of Gothic architecture and decoration add to create an overall creepy atmosphere. The film does have some creepy imagery but it was mainly held together with an old school creepy mysterious tone that lasted for most of the film and proved to be more successful than jump-scares that ruin any tension in horror films. There are very few actually scary moments, the majority of the creepy imagery ranges from being spooky to creepy and did leave me wanting just a little more horror in this very character focused film. As i mentioned, the film is skewed in favour of character development and character relationships and it does take up quite a bit of the film but it still managed to blend in well with the creepy tones. This focus on the characters gave you a sense of connection between the horror elements and the characters and provided some context here and there that tied the two together nicely. I must say though that the characters are very well introduced and developed so they all have a distinct personality that comes through very well through the writing and the performances. All of the main performances i thought were very strong with Tom Hiddleston being the standout performance using his experience to give his character more personality. Mia Wasikowska could have played a typical horror film victim but her character i thought was stronger and more driven than many other female horror leads, allowing you to really get behind her. The overall plot of the film was still mysterious and did somewhat have me interested to see which direction it was heading in. But i have to say it was quite predictable in terms of some of the larger revelations later on in the film. It drops a lot of hints here and there as to what the bigger picture is but it was pretty obvious where the film was going. I wasn't 100% sure i knew what was going on but what i thought was happening around half way into the film ended up being right. So the scenes later on where they are throwing exposition at you trying to explain the things that are going on didn't have the impact they were supposed to, you could probably figure it out on your own. So in the end, this film will definitely turn off anyone wanting loads of jump-scares and a very horror focused film. But the Gothic Romance focus with the creepy tones and imagery i thought were a really good mix and with Del Toro's style accompanying it, it did make for a very well done stylised 'horror' film. I just wish that there was a little more of the scary as oppose to some of the more spooky stuff but what it did have was still enough to make this a Gothic Romance/Horror film worth watching. - 7.5",Crimson Peak
151,Tehmeh,"Beautiful, but a little confused and hollow.",7,23 April 2016,"""Crimson Peak"" was marketed as a horror movie. It has some horror-related stuff to it, but it's definitely not a horror movie. It's a romantic mystery thriller of sorts. It's not a romance, because the romantic part comes from the carefully crafted visuals and certain story elements we used to have in older, darker fairy tales. Set your expectations accordingly. While it's easy to mistake this for a horror movie, the movie itself is a little confused too. It doesn't quite know what it wants to be. We didn't need the first half an hour of the movie. You could say it was about setting things up, but none of it resonated to the main story enough. On top of that, our main character Edith is certainly not the main character. The movie tells us she is, even giving her the opening and closing narrations (which also could have been cut), but ""Crimson Peak"" is not a story about her. Not only is she not the main character, but we, the audience, have to suffer watching her finding out things we already figured out ages ago. This is the kind of storytelling I have problems with. I'm not watching a mystery reveal itself, I'm watching a character trying to keep up with rest of the movie, and it becomes a chore. And when it becomes a chore, ""Crimson Peak"" fails as a mystery. This wouldn't be a problem if these mystery elements were downplayed more, but this wasn't the case.I also know that Del Toro can handle horror elements without LOUD NOISES TO MAKE US JUMP, but for some reason we get that a couple of times, making the (rare) moments of horror lose their value. While this isn't a horror movie, I desperately needed more out of those scenes. Those were my main complaints. There is a lack of focus on the real story and how to tell that story. Guillermo Del Toro is still not the great storyteller I want him to be. He also doesn't seem to be an actors' director. This is a little disheartening, because he doesn't make movies in a cynical way and he certainly nails many elements of cinematic language like a master. One of the things Del Toro (and the production team) nailed was the visuals. The main location is a beautifully constructed set. The design, the colors, the lighting, the camera-work - all of it is excellent. This makes the main location - Sharpe manor - a central character to the movie. It doesn't just ""look good"" in a generic way, it has real character to it and it's endlessly fascinating. It looks more like a fairy tale than a realistic setting, and it works in favor of the film. For this reason alone I can forgive a lot. There are a few ghosts and apparitions too, and while they don't contribute much to the story, they are generally very interesting to look at. There is also a lot of symbolism to be found, some of it obvious and a lot of it very subtle (I noticed most of it only after watching some bonus features on the blu-ray). Visually, ""Crimson Peak"" is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain (Thomas and Lucille Sharpe) are the real main characters of this film. They are very good and very entertaining in different ways. Hiddleston does what he does best - he brings charisma and presence to the table, as well as some unexpected vulnerability too. Jessica Chastain on the other hand is often on the verge of really hamming it up, but in a good way. She can be very threatening when needed, bringing the story some much needed weight and energy. These characters along with the visuals save the movie from being a failure. Mia Wasikowska (Edith Cushing) isn't bad, but she isn't interesting either. Her character doesn't have much to it, and she did remind me of Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"". She is just someone who has something happen to her. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, especially when ""Crimson Peak"" follows the themes of some fairy tales, where many main characters are often passive. It isn't about what they are, it's about what happens around them. So of course you can do that, but at least make these characters interesting. I want to think Wasikowska can be better, and she probably can, but she didn't convince me here. All the supporting actors are...there. Some of them are good, some of them less good, and some (especially Charlie Hunnam) are just there for cheap reasons and in the hands of better storytellers would not be there at all. This is on Del Toro, all of it. In the end, ""Crimson Peak"" is a bit of a mess. It's a beautiful mess that feels almost like a fairy tale and it probably has a good heart - and I do like it enough to recommend it just for its high points - but it could have been a masterpiece. The potential is so strong, because the attention to detail and the amount of visual language is stunning. I can only imagine the outcome if the story and characters would have been handled in the same manner. Absolutely recommended for movie buffs, somewhat recommended for fans of the three main actors. Not recommended for people looking for a subtle, gripping or a tight story. Not recommended for those looking for a truly scary movie. If you're not very interested in shot composition, sets, wardrobes and generally the visual craft of cinema, you won't be fooled and chances are you will not like this film at all. Most of the people can probably enjoy the exciting ending, but if you're not admiring the designs and colors in the meantime, getting there will be a chore.",Crimson Peak

154,autisticreviewers,"Not a Horror, but definitely something special!",7,17 October 2015,"On his latest film, the Gothic romance Crimson Peak, del Toro said he'd been able to change that trajectory, making an ""adult movie in the English language"" for the first time. A period piece set in a massive, crumbling, haunted house, it's arguably the most gorgeous film of his career, and with Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, and Mia Wasikowska heading up the cast, he's never had more talent in front of the camera. But what exactly is an adult del Toro film in 2015 — and is it something audiences will even be receptive to if it's not behind the highbrow sheen of a foreign language film?Crimson Peak follows Edith (Wasikowska), an aspiring writer at the turn of the century who's much more interested in telling ghost stories than playing the society games her peers are so enamored with. She's a typical del Toro outsider, having lost her mother at an early age. She's also downplaying a rather curious supernatural ability: she can see ghosts. When she meets sibling duo Thomas and Lucille Sharpe (Hiddleston and a tightly wound Chastain), she's quickly taken by Thomas' romantic gestures, and soon they're married and off to England to take up residence at the Sharpe's estate, Allerdale Hall — which the locals call Crimson Peak due to the blood-red clay deposits that lie just beneath the house.Alone in the countryside with the pair, Edith quickly starts seeing apparitions, the kind of spooky, spindly armed phantoms that seem to populate all of del Toro's worlds. There are secrets hidden in the house, and as Thomas and Lucille's behavior turns increasingly erratic, Edith realizes she may very well be in danger.As a filmmaker, del Toro has always been known for striking, creative visuals, but with Crimson Peak he's truly reached a new level in his work. There's a glowing, painterly quality to Dan Lausten's photography here that is remarkable, and both the costumes and production design fully realize the world as a kind of stunning, waking dream. Allerdale Hall is pure atmosphere, the kind of place where dead leaves constantly stream through a never-repaired ceiling breach, and carved mannequin heads stare dead-eyed from the shelves of an attic workshop. The spell of that tactile reality is occasionally broken by some CG work that just doesn't quite match the level of what was built on set — an ongoing weakness in many of del Toro's films — but those moments are fleeting, the larger beauty of Crimson Peak overpowering the lapses.The character of the visuals — like the house itself — serve as the platform for the story, and that's where del Toro is able to meld his twin career tracks of US and European films into one singular entity. The surface appeal of Crimson Peak is in the ghosts and scares; the accessible fright feasts that he's been successful with both as a director and producer. But when he refers to Crimson Peak as a Gothic romance, that's not hyperbole; this is a story about the heightened emotional power of love, and the damage it can inflict even while it raises individuals to new emotional heights. It's the kind of story that has befuddled numerous filmmakers; one need only look back at Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula to see another similarly lush production that couldn't quite connect with its basic thematic premise.del Toro melds the twin tracks of his US and European films into a single Gothic creation But del Toro's ever-present, earnest embrace of melodrama — a weakness in something like Pacific Rim — is what sees him through here. That's not to say there aren't tonal missteps or weak points; more than one serious moment earned laughter from the theater when dread was undoubtedly the intention. But Wasikowska's performance is so warm and engaging that she shepherds the audience through, as does Hiddleston, who retains his likability even though he's clearly a man with a secret right from the start.Oddly enough, the weakest link in the entire film is Jessica Chastain, who is normally able to transform herself seamlessly from role to role, but here veers into a world of facial tics and menacing glares that borders on parody. It plays as a miscalculation on del Toro's part, like he's nodding a little too vigorously at Mrs. Danvers from Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca — a stated influence — though Chastain is able to shine in a few moments of quiet, emotional introspection.Plot twists and scares are almost beside the pointUltimately, that's how Crimson Peak lives or dies — not by its plotting (which can be clunky and unearned), nor its scares, but by how it connects emotionally. It's always been the secret to del Toro's Spanish films, which share a single weary, wounded romantic heart — the same one that's beating here. But as much as I enjoyed the delirious, gory ride (one that I can't wait to take again), I don't imagine Crimson Peak is going to do very well. It's not enough of a rote ghost story to appeal to hardcore genre fans, and movies trafficking in this kind of emotional sentiment aren't exactly known for their box office performance. Instead, Crimson Peak will likely be discovered by many in the same way that they've found the best of del Toro's work: on video, on Netflix, in art-house revival theaters — and in the work of those he continues to inspire. 7/10",Crimson Peak
155,paul_3-960-896774,A visual craftsman at his best,7,15 October 2015,"Crimson Peak is a visually stunning film with a solid-ish story. Going in, I thought it was an horror movie and I was setting myself up to hate, because I don't like horror movies. But Crimson Peak is, like Guillermo Del Toro said it himself it's not a ghost story but a story with ghost in it. The film is frightening but almost comical in its fright. It's a beautiful Gothic romance with stunning set pieces, good performances, and a captivating score. If you put all of that aside the plot is a bit blah. And there was that one scene that got me going ""I know adrenaline can do wonders but come on!""Crimson Peak is a stunning Gothic romance, with a few ghosts in it, that might scare the wimpiest of you but it's still worth your time for the cinematic experience that it is.

156,joelgodinho,Visually marvellous,7,20 November 2020,"Crimson Peak is a 2015 horror fantasy film directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston.
I like Del Toro's style, I haven't seen a lot of films from him but from what I have seen I really enjoy. I love how he merges horror and fantasy to terrific results.
The film is very beautiful with some of the best costume design I have ever seen in a film, the sets are also gorgeus in particular the mansion in Crimson Peak and I also absolutely love the colours of the movie.
The acting is good although I don't think it stands out much and the story is very interesting even though the twist is predictable.

157,lucasversantvoort,Style over substance,6,20 October 2015,"To say that Guillermo del Toro has a passion and knack for horror is an understatement of Gothic proportions. It's always been apparent in his films and he wasn't involved with the now cancelled Silent Hills game for no reason. Crimson Peak is his attempt at a Gothic kind of horror: a mystery filled with lush, expressive imagery, frights, romance and a compelling story. Wait, compelling story!? I'm sorry, I was thinking about Pan's Labyrinth. Anyway, back to Crimson Peak...It's the 1900s. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) can see ghosts, including her mother's who tells her to be wary of Crimson Peak. Edith is also a struggling writer. She writes ghost stories, but can't find a publisher. Around the same time, her industrialist father is visited by Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who, together with his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain), seeks funds for his 'groundbreaking' (literally) clay mining invention. He and Edith become romantically involved, but after Edith's father hires a private detective to dig up some shocking info on Sharpe, he tells Sharpe and Lucille to skip town. Soon after, however, Edith's father is murdered and Edith and Sharpe end up married after all. They move to Sharpe's dilapidated home in England, Allerdale Hall where Edith starts seeing ghosts again. She slowly uncovers the mystery behind all that has taken place here. For what it's worth, Del Toro's knack for impressive visuals is on full display here. When you enter Allerdale Hall for the first time, you can't help but be impressed with the attention to visual detail: the autumn leaves falling down, bathed in pale light, the grand fireplace, the staircase, etc. The use of color is also as lush and evocative as it was in Pan's Labyrinth. Yet, nice cinematography can only carry a film for so long before the audience starts wondering if the film's got some actual substance and here, the film falters. The early conversations on stories, horror and romance are obviously there to tell the audience that this isn't going to be a typical horror flick filled to the brim with jump-scares. Rather, it'll be more Romantic with a capital R. Del Toro sets up the mysteries quite well, The questions of who Sharpe and Lucille really are and what happened at Allerdale Hall are generally enough to keep you watching, but the answers--and therefore the entire story--are entirely predictable and uncompelling. The fault lies undeniably with Del Toro's writing and direction, both of which feel overdone. He alternates drama with jump-scares in a way that makes it seem like he didn't know which direction to take, making the jump-scares feel superfluous, an annoyance, a mandatory box to be checkmarked. What's worse is that the ghosts and the jump-scares aren't even the scariest parts. The scene involving nothing but Edith listening to a tape of Allerdale Hall's previous female resident is infinitely more frightening than any monster Del Toro can manufacture. Just think about that: a scene involving no ghosts and jump-scares was the scariest part of the film by far! This made me realize how much better this story could've been told if only Del Toro had infused it with a degree of subtlety and empathy and made the horror come alive in ways that don't feature bland ghosts. (Hitchcock's Rebecca was good precisely because Rebecca's shadow loomed over everyone and everything, not because she actively haunted people.) Instead, Del Toro has the usually terrific Chastain hamming her way through her scenes, not once presenting her in a compelling light, and then, once the big secret is out, we're actually expected to care. The dark Gothic Romance is there, but Del Toro is only able to adequately convey the 'gothic' part. Romance, the key to success with a story like this, is a concept apparently beyond his skill set. Crimson Peak is a great concept executed poorly. There's a beautifully tragic tale here filled with drama, but Del Toro's lack of empathy and poor direction prevent it from being told in a compelling manner.",Crimson Peak
158,ini_ynti-22457,Beautiful Classical Horror Movie,7,1 April 2016,"It's so classic and the beginning was so convincingly chilling. But along the way, it wasn't as much. I thought this story would put the death of Edith's mother as the main plot. Apparently it wasn't. Somehow, the creepy creatures here reminded me of those in Thailand horror movie. The way they move, I mean. Crawling so frightening like that.Some of the story I didn't quite understand. I don't know why. It came to my mind that Thomas and Lucille were actually ghosts or vampires. Is this true, by the way? Because there were dialogue saying Thomas's hands are cold. His face was so pale. And Lucille's look is so fierce as if she needs to drink blood.I wish there were better portrayal and explanation about what happened in the Crimson Peak. And about the red fluid hidden in the basement as well as the machine. These stuffs are really confusing. Like there are so much to tell but they ended up making me confuse and doubtful about the story. Anyhow, I get the big picture. Thanks for the beautiful cinematography and the wardrobes. They are amazing. Only sometimes I hate Edith's hair. Oh, Jessica Chastain gives a very good performance here. I love it.",Crimson Peak

The stupidity of the characters are also revealed fairly early on, starting with the departure of the father.This is a pity because the movie has a promising start. My guess is the writer cannot come up with a decent plot unless he dumb down the people.Even though this is a ghost movie, the ghosts play very insignificant roles. In fact, if the ghosts are removed, the movie would not change much.Oh well. At least I didn't pay to watch this movie. I watched the DVD from the local library.",Crimson Peak
160,cnycitylady,Sweet Gothic Horror,7,14 October 2015,"""Crimson Peak"" has much to recommend it. Its cast is spot on, its costume design and set are beautiful and spooky. The story itself doesn't really go for the cheap thrills that most horror today goes for, and I appreciate that.Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston have a fantastic chemistry and you readily fall in love with the love story they present you, but the real jewel of the film is Jessica Chastain. As soon as she walks on screen you know something wicked this way comes. Her piercing glare and overall sense of distaste for the other characters really unease's you in the most fun way. You can see little to no sympathy in her face and you cannot wait to see just where she'll go with it.The story starts off as pleasantly as any period piece and you wonder what the ghouls and ghosts are up to, and whether they are in cahoots with Hiddleston and Chastain. Unfortunately by the second half, the movie looses some of its spook and becomes somewhat predictable in plot, but because of this you will be able to watch it over and over again without ever really getting bored. This is because the horror isn't the selling point of the story, the heart of the characters are. And each character has more heart than they could possibly know what to do with. The acting is superb and although this story has been told in one way or another, you still root for a positive outcome. Guillermo del Toro creates yet another masterpiece of film. I fully enjoyed it. 8/10",Crimson Peak
161,djangozelf-12351,Terribly predictable.,2,10 December 2015,Things never get really scary in this so called horror. The thriller aspect is almost laughable and it takes way to long for it to get interesting. There are to few characters and all the development you can see coming from a mile away.There are not enough scares for a 2 hour movie and a lot of the story just drags and drags and you get the feeling it is done deliberately to make sure you get to see the whole house and it's creepy atmosphere. The ghosts mostly warn the main character and therefor also loose there power to be scary.Most of it was just way to obvious like the revelation that he had an incestuous relation with his sister and that they killed the mother when she figured this out.Visually it is sometimes stunning but you get the feeling it is just face value and noting is really done with it.It has a few shocking moments but not nearly enough to save the movie and even worse when you consider it is only about 5 minutes in a two hour run time.Sad is they wasted a lot of talent on this and ironically this movie sinks faster than the mansion does in the movie because it's build on red clay.There is some nudity in this film but if they left that out and some of the blood it easily could have been a 12 rating and for me it really had that feel to it.The director also wrote this and according to me he should not have done that because it looks like an epic failure.If your easily scared it may be for you but don't be surprised if you fall asleep and have an actual nightmare that is better than this.I will be cautious with the next Guillermo flick.Hope he improves.,Crimson Peak

It starts promising - a few motives, characters, conflicts, sumptuous period detail (if all a little ""clean"" and theatrical if you know what I mean - everyone with perfect teeth and makeup and speaking like a thoughtful scriptwriter). Then gradually you realise that everything that is glaringly obvious and predictable IS actually what is happening - and its a long, painful process watching it play out just as you expect it to. There's nothing to make you go ""ah! That's interesting!"" whatsoever. The ghosts look incredibly CGI and therefore not scary at all, but more to the point they had absolutely no point or function - clearly just shoehorned in (perhaps after the original draft?) as a way to make it ""horror"" and more marketable to the teenage market. Jessica Chastain is always watchable, and the film looks pretty colourful, but that's about it.",Crimson Peak
166,CountVladDracula,Gorgeous,10,2 November 2015,"Crimson Peak review: (Mild spoilers) So I just saw Crimson Peak and yes, it was very good.Doug Jones was masterful playing all the ghosts (except for certain ones near the end). The score was haunting. The visuals fantastic, particularly the ""red clay in the snow."" Gorgeously ominous.The film reminded me a lot of the Vincent Price version of The Fall of the House of Usher and Tales of Terror with Tom Hiddleston in a role that would have befitted Vincent Price in the early to mid-sixties.Like all Guillermo del Toro films there is at least one subtle Frankenstein reference. In this case it's toward the beginning where the protagonist Edith says she'd rather be like Mary Shelley (a widow) as opposed to Jane Austen (A spinster). This also works for foreshadowing for the end of the film.Guillermo del Toro really needs to get on the ball about making an adaptation of the Frankenstein novel with Doug Jones as The Creature. Please! I also believe Edith's maiden name (Cushing) was a subtle homage to Hammer horror icon Peter Cushing who starred in many spooky movies of the 1950s into the 1970s.I strongly recommend the movie. Yes, it is very much a haunted house movie but it is also a gorgeous period piece, a homage to traditional haunted house stories you don't see much of anymore, and a good murder mystery as well. If not for the fact that I know this to be a new story you would swear this was actually a much older sory being adapted into a film, it feels Victorian- as it should.The subtle inclusion of late nineteenth century supernatural / parapsychology theory was well done. And the fact that the first ghost Edith ever saw (her own mother) was roughly around the time of the first murder was well done too and left open possible twists and interpretations never addressed in the film. Did her mother have something to do with Crimson Peak? Do ghosts have some sense of the future or was her mother's ghost chatting with Thomas' mother's ghost on the other side and went ""Uh, Oh. I'd better tell my daughter just to be safe."" It's not so much a plot hole as something deliberately ambiguous. Was it really her mother or a premonition taking the form of her mother? Any fans of Penny Dreadful, Hammer horror, Gothic literature, Mario Bava or Guillermo del Toro should really check out the movie.This is an excellent haunted house movie right up there with The Legend of Hell House.I recommend this film to anyone who loves traditional Gothic Horror.",Crimson Peak
167,hoxjennifer,"Very pretty, but that's about it",6,8 April 2016,"I was really excited to watch Crimson Peak because I've always had a fascination Gothic Romance/Victorian themes. The trailer really lured me in - Crimson Peak seemed like a beautiful, morbid and macabre film perfect for around Halloween time. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to see it around Halloween and only watched it last night. Now, this is a very beautiful movie. The costumes absolutely blew me away - they were gorgeous and fantastic. Obviously not historically accurate, but beautiful nonetheless. Del Toro does a wonderful job of setting the scene and the use of colour is also powerful. Victorian Gothic mansion set amidst the backdrop of winter, in a rich red clay deposit, that's so old the walls seem to ""bleed"" from clay... or is it really clay? So in summary, the movie is very pretty. But that's about it. The storyline was interesting and could have gone further, but the execution disappointed me. The first half of the movie was a slow development leading up to the climax, and then from then on, it seems that the story just gives up. The ending is rushed, there are obvious plot holes and it's all sort of rushed. Even the ""scary"" ghost scenes are just a minor jump-trick and nothing else - although the CGI is well done. A gorgeous movie, although I wish I could find something similar with the same beautiful cinematography, but a better execution of the plot.",Crimson Peak
168,Brevin_Campbell,The critics were right here. This movie is awesome!!,7,17 August 2016,"Going into Crimson Peak I had heard a decent amount of bad stuff about the film from audiences calling it a sub par film however as far as critics are concerned the film sits in the 70s right now on Rotten Tomatoes and it deserves it. This film isn't the greatest film I have ever seen, but it is still a really strong film overall, and one I would defiantly recommend people check out. No it not a straight up ghost horror flick, but it does use some great horror elements within it to tell its story. The film gets off to a very slow start however by focusing far to much on the romance between Edith (Mia Wasikowska) and Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) making the film feel more like a slog to get through at the first halve, but when it pushes through that area the film becomes a rally fun murder spree of who can kill who. And let me just say the villain of the film is not whom the trailers make it out to be either I won't spoil it, but once you realize it and the incestuous relationship that goes along with it it becomes a jaw dropping ride and battle for life. Overall I highly recommend people see Crimson Peak and don't let the nay sayers try and tell you not to watch because you will miss out on quite the treat.",Crimson Peak

Combine it with great images and ""almost"" fantastic victorian architecture - and you have a winner in my books. - Well, not THAT easy.The story is simple. If i was generous - i would call it a ""classic"" story. If i was a bit more critical - i would mention that this exact story has been done over and over and over. Mind you, this is one of the better variations .. if only for the great visuals.Acting is good but limited due to the sparse and very victorian interactions .. and a fairly small cast of protagonists.Oh - and there are ghosts in the movie. That should come as a sidenote - because the ghosts are kind of irrelevant. I think some of their appearances are practical effects - When the ghosts appear very vague - it looks good... but when they are more detailed - they look a bit like some playstation 3 era cutscene (aka not very good) Nevertheless - i did enjoy the movie very much. I got sucked into this fantastical idea of a victorian fantasy setting with its Gothic style and vivid and saturated colours.On a sidenote - the victorian architecture fits very well to that movie. It displays style over substance - and so does the movie. Its visuals are waaaay too great for the story it tells; yet a pleasure to watch.",Crimson Peak
170,malmborgimplano-92-599820,Guillermo dreams of female heroism,10,1 October 2016,"You could do a doctoral dissertation on all the sources of this neo-Gothic pastiche, from steampunk and William Morris to ""The Heiress,"" ""Gaslight"" and ""Notorious,"" but it's a child that's got its own, a true original.In this film Guillermo proves himself a feminist, in the panoramic sense of being able to get inside the heads of his female characters and see things through their eyes. I think this may explain the unique look of this film. You're expecting a typical Gothic-Romantic-Victorian-steampunk looking story, but this is so full of light and unexpected color, with greens and reds and yellows more akin to the palettes of the pre-Raphaelites and Arts and Crafts movement. I'm guessing this is because this is at heart a progressive rather than reactionary fantasy. The protagonist is young, female and American, and although most of the film takes place in a wretched rotting European manor house, we see it through her eyes, with the viewpoint and coloration of her youthful, optimistic imagination. She is a writer, which may explain why the ghosts she sees are the colors of inks--black, red and sepia.The three principal actors are perfectly cast and do a great job. It's hard to imagine anyone being better than Tom Hiddleston, until you remember Benedict Cumberbatch was originally cast in his role, but maybe that would have been too perfect and as a love object Hiddles appeals to the same general demographic. There's a powerful sense of the female libido in this film, in its brightest and darkest aspects, and it is fun and refreshing to see Hiddles play the passive, seductive love object fatally trapped between two female egos at war.In terms of history, women like Edith were in the vanguard of the modern feminist movement, and decadent traditionalists like the Sharpes were their worst enemies.

The film isn't the most original, as it seems like every horror film has the main character move into an old haunted house, but this film does put a different spin on it. The film is different in that it avoids the one dimensional ghosts haunting a person, whereas she's seen ghosts her whole life, and these ghosts are serving a different purpose.

The director seemed focusing on the visual affects instead of depicting the intensities. We can see all the shadows from other movies like ""Jane Eyre"", ""The lady in black"", and it even borrowed the incest relationship from ""The murderous maid"". The last part I feel it's not required in the plots. There should or would have some struggling in the sister's part about the longing and obsessions but not physical acts which I somehow felt appalling. The childhood experiences should have some replaying memories to carry from one stage of their lives to the other. Audience very much could see the the story going.

This movie is an example of not judging a movie based on what others think. You must see it for yourself and be your own judge. Guillermo del Toro delivers a masterful display in visuals, which is a trademark of his. We are sucked into a dark Gothic world full of betrayal, murder and lust. The story, while not the most in depth, has enough to keep the viewer interested, while being entranced by the fantasy like atmosphere. There are some moments of extreme violence that comes as a shock, but i thought it just illustrated the power of the situation these characters were facing. I think the main problem here is what people expect from ""horror"". Jump scares, frequent violence, and frequent usage of ghostly figures are what passes, but when a movie comes along with great subtlety, it will be overlooked.

The oozing clay on the walls was a little much but it was not distracting in the slightest.The acting was sub par with Jessica Chastain leading the show, as she had the best performance out of the three, her character was convincing. She played a role unlike anything she has done before and it caught me off guard. She gives off a clear sense that there is something off about her in her first scene, but you never know the severity to her crazy until the climax.Tom Hiddleston's talent just seemed to wasted as he was just the lovable trickster that the fan girls who went to see the movie wanted. I thought this would be the movie where he would be playing a more challenging character that would further his career but I guess I was mistaken.Mia's character was bland and I could never connect with her enough to really care if she lived or died. We never learned to much about her character except that she isn't taken seriously by anyone and that she doesn't date. I would have added more to Edith's childhood flashback than one jump scare and try to make her more relatable to the audience.The time spent in New York was very enjoyable from the party scenes to the performances from the minor characters. The story in the mansion however has been done many times before and there was nothing to differentiate itself from its predecessors. The aspect of the story being Edith's book was a nice touch but to many unnecessary stabbings and over the top scenes like Edith's fall took me out of the moment.I would recommend watching just for the visuals alone, but the story is generic and predictable, so you should not go into expecting a grade A movie.",Crimson Peak
182,michael-3204,A beautiful empty vessel,4,30 April 2016,"Beautifully filmed, art directed, set designed and costumed Gothic romance that, unfortunately, neglects to tell a compelling story. This film seems to start and end with director Guillermo del Toro's interest in showing off something that looks cool on the surface and doesn't go anywhere interesting. As such, Mia Wasikowska's bland and affectless performance as the heroine Edith fits right in -- she's perfectly boring. When Tom Hiddleston's tragic anti-hero seems to fall genuinely in love with her, it makes as little sense and is as unsupported by anything we see on screen as everything else here. At least Jessica Chastain manages to bring some verve to her role as the crazy sister. The film only really comes to life when she's on screen, though Burn Gorman also does fine work as a vaguely creepy private investigator. But overall this is as inert as it is visually sumptuous. It is something of a cross between Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" that copies all their trappings without their dramatic underpinnings. There's no payoff, no sense of tragedy. The film fails to integrate its contention, spoken by Edith as the opening line, that ""Ghosts are real"" into the story in a way that is surprising, compelling or moving. Like everything else in the film, ghosts pop up from time to time because they look cool.",Crimson Peak
183,ivans536,Mediocre Visual Feast,6,5 February 2019,"Del Toro's movie is a beautiful feast of colors and gothic motifs, with an especially beautiful house that almost acts as a separate character.
The spirits' design is also very stylish, however they struggle to inspire any real fear, and serve more as instruments to move the story forward.The editing is lacking, with quick cuts where there need to be ones and campy transitions that rukn the overall style of the film. The script is adequate, not anything to write home about but period appropriate, and carried by capable and adequate actors, who are able to portray the necessary melodrama even when it seems too much. The motivations are sometimes paper thin so don't try to think about them too much.Problems, however, emerge with the story. Paper thin and predictable from the very start, the story doesn't veer from cliché, and stays very typical for this kind of period drama. Actors act exactly as you expect them to, and when they don't it seems very forced and unnatural.",Crimson Peak
184,keithlovesmovies,Crimson Peak Review,6,22 November 2015,"After marrying the charming Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), young Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) finds herself swept away to his remote mansion in the English hills. Living with them is Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), Thomas's sister and protector of her family's dark secrets. Edith who can communicate with the dead. tries to uncover the mysteries behind her ghostly visions which have been haunting her in her new home. As she approaches the truth, she may learn that true monsters can be made of flesh and blood.I would like to warn you right away that there are a lot of things going on in this film. It tries to be a horror film, a romance film, and a suspenseful/thriller film while attempting a Gothic style. I might need a refresher on the definition of the word Gothic but being a period piece which occurs in an old house does not scream Gothic to me. I also found the story in this one to be very confusing and contained holes. For example, the synopsis says that Thomas and Edith get married but it just felt weird to me that they barely spent any time together at the beginning and suddenly they are married offscreen. For a story that depends so much on the supposed romance, you can't help but to not believe it because I thought that Hiddleston and Wasikowska had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Without giving too much of the story away, there were a few subplots in the film that they tried to introduce without really exploring or explaining any of them. All of these made the story hard to follow since it just kept moving from one thing to another haphazardly. I kept finding it annoying when something new started happening for no reason. I guess the whole Gothic theme was used just as an excuse. Sure there were a few ghosts for no reason and there were various creaking and other weird noises but I did not find that very scary and most probably won't either. The acting in this one wasn't too great either. Tom Hiddleston seemed boring, uninterested, and slightly out of place. Mia Wasikowska's character was stupid and naive and just wandering around triggering all of the film's scares. Jessica Chastain was sleeping through most of the film until near the end where I think she stole the show. Charlie Hunnam was okay as Dr. McMichael despite being underwritten. I was trying to be patient with the film because of the promise of the subject matter but it was hard since the dialogue was so bad. The acting was not the worst part because the story, which started off with promise just fell apart from the middle-on where predictable twist after predictable twist kept occurring and the end had to be one of the silliest things I've ever seen. The only thing I liked about the film were the special effects as I found the film to be very beautiful to look and the CGI on the ghosts/monsters were well done. Also the sound effects and the soundtrack managed to heightened the tension and general spookiness. Overall, this was a beautiful film to watch but the story was unfortunately not at the same level.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Crimson Peak

186,samgiannn,"""Crimson Peak"" is engaging and beautiful",7,17 October 2015,"Misleading advertising has ruined many a movie, and unfortunately, Crimson Peak is another victim of poor marketing. Trailers made the movie out to be similar to recent scare fests like The Conjuring when it is actually more Gothic and romantic like Sleepy Hollow or Bram Stoker's Dracula. With all that being said, Crimson Peak is a very engaging and creepy film. Crimson Peak is about a woman named Edith, whose heart is stolen by a stranger who leaders her to a mysterious mansion atop a hill of blood-red clay, but she quickly learns that the house and her lover hold dark secrets. What may disappoint horror fans is that this movie isn't very scary. Apart from a great deal of dread and a couple of nail-biting sequences, Crimson Peak is not a horror film. Edith describes this film perfectly when she is describing a manuscript she wrote: ""It's not a ghost story; it's a story with ghosts in it."" It's a beautifully filmed, sexual, violent Gothic romance. There are great performances from the entire cast, with Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain giving standout performances, but the best character in the film is the house itself. The mansion's elaborate and darkly beautiful design make it one of the most memorable haunted houses in film, and every single shot of it is like a piece of art. Del Toro paints such stunning imagery in Crimson Peak that you could pick any frame from the movie and hang it as an art piece. He directs each actor and shot with grace and elegance that it makes up for the film's rather predictable plot. Crimson Peak isn't Del Toro's horror masterpiece as some people were expecting, but it is a beautifully crafted work of Gothic fiction that should be a suitable diversion just in time for Halloween.",Crimson Peak

188,benjaminweber,"Beautiful film, but takes a while to get started",7,10 April 2018,"This film is visually amazing. Anyone familiar with some of Del Toro's other work will see a lot of his signature visual touches, which is far from being a bad thing, and the design of the ghosts was refreshingly innovative and blended into the overall visual style. The plot is interesting once it gets going, however slightly predictable. Sadly, there are some noticeable downsides. The most obvious one is how slowly this film starts, with seemingly very little happening for the first twenty or so minutes. The focus is very heavily on the plot, and while some characters are developed more slowly because it ties in with the plot, others can feel underdeveloped. When this is combined with the slow start, it makes the first part of this film fairly boring. Some of the chronology of this film can seem slightly strange as well, when scrutinised. However, despite its faults, this is still a good film and worth watching. 7/10",Crimson Peak
189,venusboys3,Very pretty but kind of dumb,5,12 November 2015,"I've liked all of Mr. del Toro's movies up until now. I've seen others accuse him of being more style than substance and never found myself agreeing... until now. Crimson Peak looks great... opulent visuals, vibrant colors... every frame is visually striking. The costumes on the women are downright preposterous in their baroque details... the dilapidated house is full of ridiculously ornate details and furniture that threatens to steal scenes from the actors. Sadly, the story can't possibly live up to this fabulous environment. The tale that is told is merely ho-hum... a pretty standard yarn of a little rich girl whose romantic yearnings land her in harm's way. Oh, and there are ghosts... lots of ghosts... very convenient ghosts... ghosts that warn, lead, reveal and rescue the heroine every step of the way... to the point that they seem to be stand-ins for the girl having any intelligence or sense of her own.In the end I came away feeling like when I've ordered some amazing looking dessert only to find it overly sweet but otherwise flavorless. Crimson Peak's visuals overwhelm and distract from a much much lesser story and characters that never rise much above simple caricature.",Crimson Peak
190,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Visual ecstasy,7,6 March 2016,"Gillermo del Toro's new movie got us really going from the trailer to the end credits. If one is familiar to his previous works one will know that this movie represents everything del Toro does best. The stunningly beautiful visuals, the cartoon-like characters everyone loves, a decent story and great acting. The variety of movies del Toro made all had these things in common and the only thing differentiating them was the genre. In Crimson peak del Toro steps once again into the horror genre. Still, I would be doing this movie much wrong if I was to call it a horror movie. It does comes close, it gives a few scares, but it is not a real horror movie. Only del Toro know s how to create something like this.1) The visuals. This movie's greatest asset are the visuals. Never before has a director played with colors and shades as in this movie. Never before have I seen the tone of the scenes fit the plot line as in this movie. The thing that makes these visuals so great is the contrast he uses, and by doing so he creates the most beautiful scenes in movie history. By using blood red and navy blue in one single shot, and the way he doses the colors is magnificent . It leaves you just wanting to see the next scene, and when you do you can't believe how beautiful it is. Also, he plays with black and white better than old school directors ever did.2) The acting. By using Hiddleston and Chastain, del Toro ensured the movie gets it's fare share of acting. The two are brilliant, but as the movie progresses it becomes more and more vivid how Hiddleston stagnates with his character (and he shouldn't have), unlike Chastain that developed her character to the highest point imaginable. Her transformation and lunacy is what gave this movie that real horror element (reminded me of Hitchcock's Psycho). The only real problem is her accent that just isn't believable. Wasikowska on the other hand just isn't my cup of tea. There is something that didn't work for me in her acting or her persona. I do understand that she fits perfectly into the role, I just found her too mellow and too gentle for the ending of this movie.3) The story. Critics are bashing this movie because the story is not monumental or groundbreaking etc., etc. Truth is, the story is not original at all, in fact, this story can be found in a lot of other movies, but that is not the point. del Toro didn't want a story that was superbly original or Oscar winning, he wanted a decent story to work with and actors that would do their best with it. That is exactly what he got and what he delivered. On the up side, the pace is superb. There is not one single shoot or scene that doesn't fit perfectly into the way the story is told. Besides the visuals, this movies best quality is the way the story is told. Again, only a master director know how to time certain scenes and when to reveal certain crucial plot elements. I found this two hour movie to be more dynamic than most action movies.To be fair, it is not the best del Toro did, but it delivers. It will give you one hell of a visual spectacle, it will give you a few good scares and you will enjoy the way the story progresses and in the end explodes with gore and violence. I am still not sure if it is a horror movie. My personal point of view is that it is a scary fantasy, but maybe the problem is we have lost the sense of what real horror movies look like. Amongst the idiotic torture porn flicks we may have lost the true sense of horror. I do believe this movie is a step in the right direction.",Crimson Peak
191,srgymrat33,Really underrated,9,28 October 2020,"I am not sure honestly why this movie got so much hate . It was INCREDIBLY visually appealing, the colors , cinematography, costume design , casting, dialogue and overall feel we're on point .Plot wise , it wasn't meant to be scary, give cheap thrills or make you jump. It set out to be a time piece in which everything was supposed to look and feel as it would in the late 1800s, and it did . This was focused on the fact that the real ghosts in our lives are emotion, trauma and intuition and we need to learn to let some go and keep others with us.There are some BRUTAL scenes but they are placed well and used to add effect . It was a little predictable , but I don't think that's always a bad thing. It set out to be a story with a ghost (s)in it, but a ghost story and it did a great job of this and creating the incredible tension between all of the characters .I think this is one of his best and I would highly recommend it .",Crimson Peak
192,BillSims28,"Sumptuously Made, Well-plotted, Sometimes Uninspired",7,8 November 2015,"Director Guillermo del Toro helms this Gothic romantic horror film set at the turn of the 19th century which stars Mia Wasikowska (Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland) as American girl Edith who, enchanted by rich English businessman (Avengers heartthrob Tom Hiddleston), joins him with his sister, Zero Dark Thirty's Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain, in their mysterious and creepy northern mansion with as many hidden secrets as the siblings themselves. As blood-coloured red clay seeps from the floor, Edith uncovers more and more information. Del Toro is known for his impeccable set designs, flawless period production and unique visual style. This is clearly on display in Crimson Peak, with a lavish set design and top-notch production. Anything could be played out in these incredibly designed locations and be compelling. It helps that Crimson Peak as a wonderful plot that is always interesting, and consistently holds the viewers in suspense and captivating. The characters are solid, with some great acting skills on Hiddleston's and Chastain's part, with the former especially showcasing a commanding screen presence and boasting some fine development. This film really is great to watch: even when little is happening, the fantastic spectrum of colours and period production design can really draw the eye. The film isn't perfect though; the horror scenes are for the most part uninspired (if nonetheless quite suspenseful) though the ghost design is great. It results in the film coming across as almost lightweight in places despite the gorgeous production, and I'd suggest it would actually be better without the more supernatural elements, and remain a suspenseful tale of romance and mystery. However, it never fails to interest, and I found Crimson Peak to be a solid 77/100",Crimson Peak
193,HarlequeenStudio,The Unholy Trilemma,7,19 June 2017,"This is a meta-film. Just like it's a story with a ghost in it, it's a film with a book in it. We can see the book open and close in the end, with Edith's name on it. But you really have to look carefully not to miss it. So, maybe that's why the film resembles those penny dreadfuls written by working class boys. Or women? I know Del Toro intended to make a feminist film, whatever that may be, but the story revolves around a man, with two women fighting a bloody battle over him in the end. The man, played by Tom Hiddleston, is a perfect picture of narcissistic personality disorder, which again makes him more interesting than the leading ""good"" lady, played by Mia Wasikowska. As a true gentleman, Tom Hiddleston shows us his ass, again stealing the limelight from the ladies. This is not just a study in Victorian morals, it is also the revival of Victorian morals. Mario Bava films, Hammer horrors and Giallo films were full of female nudity. I find this new sort of feminism boring and moralistic. I shall have to take a look at this film again, maybe one day when I forget about Tom Hiddleston's face while being dragged to different airports by Taylor Swift. Jessica Chastain gives a great performance, but no tits. I can't decide whether showing tits today makes you a good actress, a brave woman, or a total slut. Looks like the whole showbiz is stuck with this trilemma, too.",Crimson Peak
194,moviesmaniax,"Just way too shallow, dull, and predictable in delivering its theme and story // instagram: moviesmaniax",6,15 October 2015,"Crimson Peak or pretty much Alice In Horrorland is another piece of imaginative work from the director of much superior films like Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy and it's clear that he should just stick with his fantasy/action genre rather than horror and romance here. I had a chance to attend the first screening of the film with director Guillermo del Toro coming to greet the audience himself and told us to see this movie as a Gothic romance love story rather than a straightforward horror film. He was right, because he doesn't seem to learn (as a producer from MAMA) that CGI ghosts are not SCARY, they sure look cool, but it's just that and also they don't seem to be much necessary to the story and are pretty left out as the story goes. After failing on delivering the SCARE, the Gothic romance theme that the director was trying to sell here doesn't seem to fully reach its potential either. The chemistry between Tom and Mia are just okay and watchable but nothing near excellent or touching whatsoever. Jessica Chastain however, did really well with creating a cold and memorable character which really makes the movie interesting to watch and helps add the thrill a bit to the climax as well. The story line is pretty simple with nothing much surprising or amusing as you can pretty much figure and predict what will happen at the end of each and almost every single scene in the film throughout. One good thing about this is probably the GORY scenes which is very terrifying and shocking and quite unexpected. Overall, Crimson Peak is another expensive-looking horror film with fascinating production to admire at, but it's just way too shallow, dull, and predictable in delivering its theme and story.>>C<<",Crimson Peak
195,captainmike-michael,A Creative Gothic Romance that Fall Short with Thin Plot,7,17 October 2015,"Del Toro spends almost ten years to make his imaginative horror love story into the big screen, it works well as a periodic Gothic romance thanks to its beautiful setting and sumptuous costumes yet falls short due to its predictable plot at the very opening of the film. It's a film full with paintings, dreams, terrifying fantasy and the addition of several modern types disturbing scares that really fit perfectly into the story but the supernatural are far more lesser than expected. Both Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston deliver solid performance while Jessica Chastain surprises audiences the most in which she is able to have fun expanding the full potential of her eerie character physically, mentally and emotionally well.

I thought maybe the young bride might figure things out when she arrives at this broken down house in England no where while her new husband is spending his money (or hers) on machinery instead of fixing the roof, but, no. Who feels comfortable in an old house that has red ooze dripping down the walls? Not me.The plot had it's ups and then it fell on it's face when she moves to England and this wreck of a house and her new husband doesn't have sex with her, hmmm? Anyway, it could have been a fair horror story but the writers fell on their faces with the numerous BS, no one around this big old dump period? Who is bringing the groceries or chopping the wood with no trees around for miles?

201,kimheniadis,Awesome scenery and costumes.,8,7 March 2016,"What kind of monster kills a dog and burns someone's manuscript?!? That is just wrong.I don't watch or read a lot of Gothic horror, and I'm not really sure why, since I often find myself enjoying them. From the previews I was hesitant because it looked like Edith (Mia Wasikowska) was just running around the ancient mansion trying to escape creepy ghosts, but there was so much more to this movie. We don't even get to the mansion until almost halfway through.Edith is an aspiring writer who believes she will get published because her father has raised as a strong woman who believes in herself. But she is still young, so she is easily swept away when a stranger, Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) comes to America looking to have his invention financed. The scenery, architecture and costumes throughout the film are gorgeous. The details are exquisite, and when we are finally inside the decrepit mansion, the layering of decay over extravagance is done perfectly. Spoilers Ahead.You know pretty much from the start that Thomas and his sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), are not good people. But the build up as to exactly how and why, is very well done. Also, since this is a Gothic story there are going to be family secrets. When Lucille and Edith were talking about if the marriage had been consummated, I knew there was going to be incest. When we are finally shown, it is done in a very sensual and tasteful way. The fact that Edith sees it with her own two eyes and still doesn't believe it, continues to show her naivete. The exploration of half-truths, lies and nothing being what it seems is played over and over again in perfect harmony. Just when one of the characters thinks something, there is a slight change in perspective that shifts everything, leaving the actor and audience slightly off balance. This is a very well done Gothic horror/romance, and if you enjoyed The Haunting (1999 or 1963), or the TV show, Penny Dreadful, I think you'll find this one to your liking as well.",Crimson Peak
202,AliceofX,Bland Plot,6,3 November 2015,"I'll start with the absolutely worst thing about Crimson Peak - the jump scares. I didn't expect this from you del Toro! Whoever thinks that jump scares belong in any movie should have their head examined. They're not actually ""scary"" and if anything they take away from the horror.Also the film thinks that we're morons that need to have repeats of previous dialogues told lest we become utterly confused about the plot. Less bad, but more persistently present, is the bland plot. It's weak and predictable and you pretty much see all the plot twists coming. Which again ties up with my previous complaint, that a plot this simple really does not require holding the audience's hand.And must every movie set in the past have a Strong Independent Woman protagonist. Frankly it's getting tiring of seeing the same character in every film and, dare I say, un-diverse.With that all said, Crimson Peak rests right in the middle where it's not bad or good enough to fall to either side. The best part is in the visuals, especially those of the ghosts which are pretty unique and, unlike the plot, do no feel like we've seen them a million times already.The characters were very likable, which is a shame because with a better plot this could really have been a great film.

207,ryanmark-57919,Crimson Peak Manages to Frighten without the Jump Scares,9,18 October 2015,"Right off the bat, I need to tell you guys that Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite directors and in my opinion one of the best directors working today. His movies are unique and full of something I have trouble defining. If I had to try then I would say that they're great at making you feel certain emotions very strongly. For example, Crimson Peak is one of the most frightening films I've seen in a while but it does this without too many jump scares. You feel the fear from the characters and that's what del Toro wants you to feel. This is another fantastic film from someone that I consider a true master of cinema. Let's get to the story.Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young woman that lives with her affluent father, Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver). Edith isn't like the rest of the women in high-brow Victorian society for the simple reason that she's more interested in writing stories than finding a husband to take care of her. This changes when she meets a young man named Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Thomas sweeps Edith off her feet and soon it becomes obvious that she's fallen in love with him. A horrible supposed accident soon takes her father's life (seriously, how does anyone think those wounds are from slipping) and she marries Thomas and begins a new life in England. She soon finds that the mansion she lives in with her husband and his sister, Lucille (Jessica Chastain), has a dark and bloody history and her new family isn't quite what she believes them to be.Wasikowska absolutely nails the part of Edith. She has a quiet and reserved manner about her but is actually very strong considering all the bizarre things she's seen in her life. She's obviously frightened, as anyone with a brain would be, but she's willing to meet her problems head on rather than let them get the better of her. Jessica Chastain is basically fantastic in everything she does and this film is no exception. She always plays tough characters but none of them are quite like Lucille. They're certainly not usually this unhinged anyway. And what can I say about Tom Hiddleston. How is this guy this likable? I have to smile every time he appears on screen no matter the movie he's in. Even when he's a villain he's enjoyable and it's basically impossible not to love this guy. Thomas is an interesting character because we know he has suspicious ulterior motives but he genuinely doesn't seem like a bad guy. As we see his motivations in more detail it becomes obvious that he has his own problems to deal with and he's trying to deal with them the only way he knows how.Man, this house is spooky. Holes in the ceiling and floor and blood red clay oozing from every pore of the house. Why would Edith stay in this place? Why would anyone? These questions came into my mind as soon as they stepped in but you obviously need a spooky house for a ghost story. Despite having servants around, no one seems to be in charge of cleaning inside the place and no one really seems to mind that the place looks like crap. I like how the red clay around the grounds and in the floorboards makes it seem like the whole place is covered in blood. Usually, the bloody walls and floor would be when people start freaking out but everyone just accepts it because of the ground they're on. It's a nice change of pace to have the characters surrounded by this the entire film rather than see it happen piecemeal.The ghosts in this film are interesting and done a bit differently than a lot of the other ghost movies I've seen. They're done completely in cgi and they don't truly look real at all but it works to give them a more distinct feel compared to most other ghost movies. Most of the time, the ghosts are either purely evil or their actions are ambiguous and they seem to mean harm to others even if that's not the case. The first time we see a ghost in this film it's trying to warn Edith about Crimson Peak and the subsequent ghosts are frightening in their appearances but they never come off as having murderous intent. Definitely not what I was expecting but a nice change all the same.This isn't my favorite del Toro film out there but it's still a damn good one. The story is interesting, the atmosphere is spooky, and the characters are likable (accept Lucille). I honestly have no complaints about this movie that wouldn't come off as me nitpicking just for the sake of it. Even people that aren't into most horror films might find this one a bit different and I believe they'll like it more than most. Give it a try and watch del Toro work his magic.",Crimson Peak
208,TheBarleyGuy,A Stunningly Beautiful Film.,9,18 December 2015,"I will declare my bias up front, and say that I have been itching for Guillermo Del Torro to make another horror movie ever since I saw Pan's Labyrinth, and I will also confess that I wasn't the biggest fan of Cronos or The Devil's Backbone, though I admit that both films are beautiful to look at. After really enjoying Pacific Rim, and really hating The Strain, I was starting to feel unsure about the future, and got hugely excited when I saw the first trailer for this particular movie. So, I admit that I marched into this movie with some lofty expectations, and I am thrilled that I don't feel disappointed in the slightest.This is one of those movies that I'm sure will get called a ""throwback"" and a ""love letter"" in future reviews, and for good reason, it's an absolute love letter to Gothic ghost stories, and the early days of horror cinema. It's in everything from the old- timey setting, to the amazing (and occasionally hilarious) iris out transitions all throughout the movie. I won't spend this whole review gushing about it or Del Torro, because it does have it's issues, but I'm going to get to those later on, don't you worry. What I will say before getting too specific, is that this is one of the most stunningly beautiful horror films I've seen all year, and it (at points) scared the bejesus out of me.One of the biggest surprises to me wasn't really about the movie, but about the massive number of pre-teens and families that were at the screening. I have a feeling this is partially the fault of Tom Hiddleston (The Avengers) and Mia Wasikowska (Alice In Wonderland) appearing in the film, but I will say that this movie is absolutely not a family affair. Despite it's 14A rating, it deals with some pretty heavy subject matter, and has Del Torro's brand of extremely realistic violence and gore. That said, Hiddleston is the standout actor in the movie, his performance is solid and he and Jessica Chastain (The Martian) have a really bizarre and fantastic chemistry on screen. Conversely, Wasikowska and he have the chemistry of a cheese sandwich and well, Tom Hiddleston. Also starring here are Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim), Burn Gorman (Torchwood) and of course, the fabulous Del Torro regular, Doug Jones. Everyone does a pretty good job, and even Wasikowska isn't BAD in this movie, she does quite well when she isn't required to have physical romantic chemistry with anyone. Of course, you could argue that her and Hiddleston aren't supposed to have chemistry based on what is revealed, but I digress.As I mentioned, the movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at. Del Torro's aesthetic is all over this movie, from the design of the house to the design of the ghosts, and the overall look and feel of the movie. Apparently the intent was to make this look like a work from Mario Bava (Black Sunday) and I'd say he hit that on the head, using modern techniques. This is clearly a movie made by someone with a real love and understanding of what they are going for. The ghosts in the film are frightening and beautiful at the same time which can be a bit of a hard thing to get your head around, and even little things that don't make sense are forgiven because of how beautiful they look in the film. Two examples of that : leaves fall through a hole in the roof despite there not being any trees tall enough to do that, and there is a hallway with horrifying spikes in the archway for no reason other than them being menacing.There are a couple of laughable moments in the movie, but all of them feel like they work with the kind of movie this is. A great example is the fact that Tom Hiddleston's character spends the whole movie dressed like Edgar Allan Poe, and his sister looks like the evil queen in a Tim Burton movie, and yet it Edith's father can't figure out what it is that feels ""wrong"" about them. They're a hair away from just being vampyres, but again, it fits with this style of ghost story. It's not really about subtlety, it's about that specific look, so really I don't see that as a problem, just something that added a bit of levity to a rather frightening experience.The weakest part of the movie is that it feels like pieces are missing. There are some threads in the plot that are picked up and dropped immediately, like Charlie Hunnam's character's interest in the paranormal, that made the movie feel incomplete. Now, the run time is a pretty neat and tidy 2 hours (OK, OK 119 minutes), and it wouldn't surprise me if there were chunks taken out in the final stages of the movie. Studios love gutting films, and Del Torro strikes me as a guy who would love to make a really long film.All in all, this one is so completely worth your time. It shows a lot of love for old, Gothic stories, like The Haunting and also a lot of love for those grand scale horror movies that you know and love, like The Shining or The Exorcist. If you're looking for a horror movie worth seeing in the theater, this is the one you should see. At this point, it's the best theatrical experience a horror movie has given me this year, and it's one you should have. If you've been trying to decide where you and your Halloween date should go, this is it. A great date movie, a beautiful horror film, and one that is not to be missed.",Crimson Peak
209,ken558,"Absolute Grade 'A' Visual Feast, but with Dime-a-Dozen Leaky Plot of a Cheap B-Grade Movie",6,16 October 2015,"An absolute visual treat especially when seen in an iMax venue. The costumes and detailing of the sets are impeccable (although I have no idea of historical accuracy, not that it matters for a fantasy-horror-murder-mystery-romance thing).Good acting by a strong cast, but with each deploying an overly caricatured characterization, which is likely the fault of poor scripting and the popsicle-style direction from Guillermo del Toro.As with a number of Guillermo del Toro's movies (e.g. Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Devil's Backbone) the movie initially promises much more than what is eventually delivered, driven by the strong visual factors which unfortunately are not at all backed-up by anywhere a worthy enough plot nor script, belying the initial promise of genuine intrigue, and the storyline eventually deflates into B-grade movie territory. Crimson Peak gives one the sense of copycatting from a range of other movies. For instance, the final scene of knives and shovel wielding femme fatales going at one another a la Fatal Attraction and Death Becomes Her, is just way too common and overdone. It also seems to copycat Guillermo del Toro's own The Devil's Backbone plot - ghosts not out to haunt, but to warn and to seek revenge.Still, the movie is worth the visual feast - so do see it. Just soak in the view, and just switch to 'que sera sera' mode when it comes to plot and plausibility.I still hope that Guillermo del Toro does still have it in him to churn out something truly outstanding, something in the likes of Hell Boy.",Crimson Peak
210,tyingling7766,"Knowing what will happen, but worth it",7,8 March 2017,"I don't think Guillermo del Toro has ever made a movie that I don't like. Running through the list in my head, I really can't pick one out. He is such a good director. Having said that. This seems to be the worst one out of the bunch, and yet I was well entertained by this movie. Probably more so than a lot of people. Let's get to the review.Synopsis: Edith Cushing's mother died when she was young but watches over her. Brought up in the Victorian Era she strives to be more than just a woman of marriageable age. She becomes enamored with Thomas Sharpe, a mysterious stranger. After a series of meetings and incidents she marries Thomas and comes to live with him and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe, far away from everything she has known. The naive girl soon comes to realize not everything is as it appears as ghosts of the past quite literally come out of the woodwork. This movie is more about mystery and suspense than gore. Starring: Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam Director: Guillermo del ToroThe first thing I want to do is get the two things out of the way that I really didn't like about the movie. The first thing is the fact that I pretty much figured out what was going on before Mia and Tom's characters even got married in the movie. I'm not saying it's a terrible thing, but he did hurt the movie a bit. Just because I did know the ending doesn't mean the movie wasn't still entertaining.The second thing, and I may get a crap ton of flak for this but, is Mia Wasikowska. I don't know what it is about this girl, I just don't like her as an actress. She just doesn't have that charisma factor to me. She has the one expression over and over again and she is as stiff as a board most of the time.On to the good things. Tom and Charlie were the best things of this movie. There isn't a single character they haven't played that isn't quite amazing. This movie only solidifies them as some of the best actors of this time.You already know how I feel about the director, but one thing I hardly ever talk about is the setting of the movie. It does take an hour to get to the Crimson Peak, but it is worth it. The design of the house is scarier than some of the real haunted houses out in the world. del Toro really knows how to create the perfect atmosphere for his movies. He made it seem more than what it was.Final Thoughts: Even though I am giving this movie a 7 out of 10 it is still a very watchable movie. If you haven't watched it yet, you probably should.Rating: 7 out of 10",Crimson Peak
211,chimera3,Gothic with a Capital G,9,8 September 2017,"After seeing Guillermo del Toro movies like ""Mimic,"" ""Blade II,"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I came to realize that he loves to model his works in the style of Gothic. There is nothing wrong with that. Like Tim Burton, he enjoys mixing his colors around, particularly the dark ones. I saw trailers to ""Crimson Peak"" and read up on it on the Upcoming Horror Movies website, which made me want to know more because I am curious about certain movies like this one.Seeing it just once made my blood run cold. It really did. I do not like writing reviews that are laced with spoilers, so I'll just say this to anyone who is interested: Go in it with an open mind. Watch it carefully so that you can take in all of the details. You might miss a few things if you don't watch it closely. It is a good movie that is done in true Guillermo del Toro style. To conclude, I guarantee that you will not see a film ensemble like that ever again.",Crimson Peak
212,arriva,Misunderstood and underrated,10,28 January 2016,"Here's a perfect example of a film which is misunderstood and underrated just because people expected it to be a horror/thriller/paranormal flick, yet it's a very romantic, sad and visceral yet kinda perverted love story.This movie is not about ghosts, and even though they are there, very well rendered I hate to admit, they are not there to scare or mesmerize - they are to foreshadow and to warn.In fact this movie could be easily called a continuation or a sequel of Gillermo's previous film, El laberinto del fauno. They share basically the same premise: the movies have paranormal and unreal only as a façade to the cruel and brutal interaction of human beings with a lot of love, faith and dedication involved.",Crimson Peak
213,punishable-by-death,a neat Gothic Horror story,7,15 October 2015,"Crimson Peak reminds one of Edgar Allan Poe scribblings, as the camera swoops around a giant, Gothic styled house, accentuating the beautiful arches and painstaking designed windows. The look of this house is appropriately surreal, as an odd colour palette is used to give the film an almost fairy-tale quality. It flirts with the horror genre but subverts expectations, creating a movie that isn't perfect, but if anything it is unique. It isn't a scary film but it is filled with atmosphere and unanswered questions.The tale takes place first in America in the late 19th century. A family tragedy occurs near the beginning of the film, starting the horror for Edith (Mia Wasikowska) while also driving her into the comforting arms of Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who the young author falls in love with and marries. Make no mistake, while the horror tag may have been stamped on this film, it is more of a Gothic romance story. Edith travels to rural England with Sir Thomas and his sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain), to live in the giant mansion I mentioned. The Haunted House. Despite the tame nature of this first act, some characters act extremely passive aggressively, creating a tense feeling that hangs over the film, which turns into a slightly more unsettling atmosphere later on.Once Edith has moved in with Sir Thomas and his sister, she begins to see strange things. The effects used are chilling and remind one of a Silent Hill video-game – hellish creatures that seem to speak some sort of inescapable truth. Edith seems convinced that they are ghosts, but how does she know? Who are the ghosts, and what is their agenda? Of course only she is seeing them Or is she? Personally I'd love to see this film again so I can answer these questions for myself as the film leaves it open to interpretation, which is nice for a change.Chastain plays the cold, unwelcoming sister to perfection and every time she is on screen she steals the scene, her face seething with bottled emotion. Without saying a word Lucille's body language makes it obvious that she shares only disdain for her brother's new bride, and regardless of the true love that they share, she seems intent on making Edith's life as uncomfortable as and awkward as possible. This is how the romantic aspect of the film connects with the horror – the house is haunted, sure, but the set of events that Edith must experience emotionally are equally as horrifying as the creatures she sees.I'll be honest, 99 percent of the time I can't stand romance in films. It so often feels forced or tacked on at the last second, having nothing to do with the plot. Either that or it is simply too sentimental for my tastes. This film however is unique in its genre-blending, as the romantic scenes between Hiddleston and Wasikowska work within the context of the story. Not only do they share great chemistry but the love these two characters share is integral to the plot. It is also tastefully done; each time they embraced it felt right within the world the film creates; appropriately Gothic in nature as the romanticism within the horror framework is further explored. This may be typical fare for a traditional Gothic tale, but for the big screen I can't think of anything that comes close. All I can think of is Stonehearst Asylum, and that is only because it too was based in a Gothic setting, also in rural England. But the similarities stop there. This film stands firmly on its own two feet, though I am sure there are examples of similar films that successfully blend romanticism with horror.Unfortunately the final act is a little underwhelming given the build-up; the reason being that the haunted house card is played subtly. Which is admirable for its attempt at something different, however the tale loses its heft because of this. It is also a tad predictable in this final act. But the rest of the film is so gorgeous to look at, whether it is the aforementioned Gothic styled mansion, the fluent camera-work or the extreme attention to detail regarding the period wardrobe I can forgive the final act for feeling a little flat. Additionally, isn't the sort of horror film that has a pay off at the end. Rather, this story features a main character who is slowly going through a world of horrors as the film moves on, creating a character-study that is an interesting mix of desperation, loneliness, depression, madness and love. Crimson Peak isn't perfect but it sure is an intriguing film. Recommended.",Crimson Peak

215,fabiolpinheiro1993,"There's style (breathtaking style) and substance, but the substance is just wasted in the by the numbers narrative structre.",7,31 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro is just one of those incredible, one in a million, talented directors, with a huge unique imagination, and his films always live up to his talent, my favourite being Pan's Labyrinth. Unfortunately his transition to big budget movies disappointed me, quite a bit (pacific rim). He's back into his original style, and i had high hopes. Now, did the film meet them?Not quite. The films is good, but unfortunately if some things had been done differently it could be great. The film has breathtaking visuals that just screams ""oscar for best production design"", something quite usual for del Toro. But here, they are so thrilling is quite impressive. Then there's just an ensemble cast that delivers performances as big as the Sharpe manor, particularly Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska. Then there's the thrilling eerie atmosphere. These three elements of the film are definitely the films biggest guns and what takes the film to another level. The four main actors obviously being what makes the film engaging. But what about the story? Well there's certainly no lack of compelling story, plot and backgrounds, unfortunately the problem, and to me, the biggest problem of the film, is the way the narrative unfolds. The film goes on until the last frame as a big mystery film, where everything is unveiled in the last act, but what they will reveal, you already have thought throughout the film. Is just a matter of being thoughtful and picking up the very obvious clues. So in reality there is no mysteries aside from a a thing or two, because the narrative is not constructed in a clever way to tease you and play with your mind, it just seems to say it all, and thinks that it isn't saying.It all feels by the numbers, and for an attentive viewer it is quite easy to figure out much of the mysteries early on. And even what you don't know for sure, you think about it, so there's no shocks. This ultimately is what weakens the film. The writers could very easily construct the narrative to be more mysterious and manipulative so that you could never guess what's coming, but unfortunately thats not what they did.",Crimson Peak
216,PrashunChakraborty,A fine entry in the Gothic Horror Romance genre,7,26 October 2015,"I don't really care much for horror but this movie is made by Guillermo Del Toro who is a genius when it comes to visual imagery and it was promoted as a Gothic Romance film with horror elements ala Francis Ford Copolla's underrated gem Dracula. This movie completely delivers on the visual front, the set designs are gorgeous, the high production values can be seen in every shot and every frame of the film, the house at Crimson Peak is so vibrant and a treat for the eyes. The story and the plot are not the strong points of this film and it's a problem which always haunts Del Toro's films, a bit predictable and clichéd. The movie has four prominent characters, Mia Wasikowska is the main lead who marries Tom Hiddleston and portrays the usual victim/detective in the horror film and serves as the audience's eyes and ears in the film, Charlie Hunnam is there for plot reasons and does nothing special in the film, Tom Hiddleston is great in this film, he portrays the handsome and charming but mysterious Thomas Sharpe who is torn between the love for his sister and his new wife; Jessica Chastain is the best thing in this film, she plays a Lady Macbeth type of a character and is constantly involved in a power struggle of sorts with the new woman in her brother's life. Siblings often hint of an incestuous relationship which is again a very interesting angle in the film. The chemistry is great as well and Jessica Chastain after how underused she was in The Martian proves why she is one of the best working female actors. However in the end the film got a bit too predictable but the climax was very good, I have watched worse movies in the same genre thought it was a decent time pass.",Crimson Peak
217,Icedooitle,Behold the Frame,8,3 November 2015,"When I was 12, I remember desperately wanting to see The Haunting. PG-13 horror movies were a rarity and pre-views for that and The Sixth Sense had every middle-schooler salivating. I walked out of The Haunting a little disappointed, but I could not stop thinking of the style. The mansion was an amalgam of all the Gothic and dark imagery that I loved and imagined from Poe, Burton, and Dracula. The story just couldn't save it. Even at the time I remember thinking how great it would be to have a better movie in that house. Enter Crimson Peak, with a better story and setting.I have heard of actors and characters chewing the scenery, this is the first time I thought of the scenery chewing itself. Guillermo Del Toro creates a world in many of his films that seems less designed for humans than the creatures that the world produces. This is an equally imaginative and fantastic world where humans may not belong, but not because they are out of place. That is precisely because there are two worlds for humans; living and dead, light and dark, good and evil. Subject matter that will never run dry provided a talented mind can heft the contrast. It also helps if you have a leading lady that is the visual equivalent of life and light.I can't understate how talented Mia Wasikowska is, but her appropriateness for this role is much more suited to her as a canvass. Mia's Edith Cushing is the pale-white center of attention that makes the crimson-red clay and deep-black shadows pop. This film is about Edith in a more direct way than just being a narrative about her. Her visions of death and the ""life"" after are hers alone. We are not seeing Del Toro's idea of what the spirits in this world would be, only Edith's vision of them.The events that bring Edith to Crimson Peak, a place she's been supernaturally warned of since childhood, are anything but supernatural. The tragedy and conflicts are not caused or perpetuated by the spirits, they are human made without ghosts to blame. Many films of this genre have a phrase explaining why a ghost haunts, ""Death leaves a stain. Sometimes tragedy leaves a mark. The spirits are part of this place now."" Little time is spent on justifying why these spirits need to exist here, because we get it. Why the spirits exist for Edith specifically is much more compelling.With so much visual grandiosity I had to note that a good deal of the setting was written only to serve the style. This has been a fatal misstep in many films (i.e. The Haunting, Sucker Punch, Speed Racer, Michael Bay anything). How Crimson Peak gets away with it is purposeful harmony. A financially doomed family on its last leg lives in the final scrap of inherited wealth they have, a decrepit manor that is slowly sinking into the blood-red clay that doubles as their only hope of reclamation. Not altogether likely, but gives a great excuse for the visuals of blood seeping through the walls and trails of scarlet in the snow without having to resort to paranormal forces as its cause.Attempting to throw adjectives into describing the great performances by Jessica Chastain, Jim Beaver, and Tom Hiddleston would only give away some nice twists in the story. When describing what amounts to a who-done-it ghost story, all you have to do is call a character ""twisted"" to reveal, ""Got it, that's the killer."" You don't need to watch the film several times to understand the bends of the plot, so take your time absorbing the frame when you can. Let it leave its stain.",Crimson Peak
218,natsuka_arei,Not as good as i thought it would be,7,5 December 2015,"There are two reason why did i watch this movie. First, because the director was Guillermo Del Toro ( i watched, Pan's Labyrinth. I tell you what, it was amazing. A good movie with a beautiful visual ). The other reason, was because of Tom Hiddleston took a role in the movie. ( sadly to be said, actually he wasn't get much of the role, i think. He looked like a supporting character where the story mainly focus on Mia Wasikowska as Edith and Lucille Sharpe as Jessica Chastain. Jessica act, was amazing anyway. She stole the role and i quite like her role )The CGI, the set, the costumes, the sounds effect, all of them was so great. It was finished beautifully. It gave the right vibe and emotion for the scene.However, the movie itself ( or should i say, the story ) was not meet my expectation. It was twisted, but predictable. The development of other supporting character was poor ( i take Dr. Alan McMichael, as the example.)Also, the ending was a big disappointment! Even though this movie labeled with horror genre, at the end of the movie things turned out to be bloody like one in movie with thriller genre. It was not scary. It was disgusting ( for me, since, i'm not a big fan of this kind of type movie. This shocked me and my friend, since both of us were not expected this kind of things in this movie ), with blood spilled here and there.I give 7, because i think this movie should have potential to make it a good one ( especially, the CGI was very good. The atmosphere of the scenes, also was great ). The story itself quite interesting until the half of the movie.",Crimson Peak
219,shadowyx12,"Emphasizes 'style over substance', but still stunningly original.",7,18 October 2015,"Having been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro for some time now, I had expected 'Crimson Peak' to be his next great masterpiece. Although the film didn't meet my expectations, I can't say that it disappointed them either.Near the end of the 18th century, aspiring author Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) meets a struggling inventor by the name of Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston). The two quickly fall in love and move into Sharpe's dilapidating mansion - which is also inhabited by Thomas' sister, Lucille (Chastain). Once there, Edith slowly realizes that not everything is what it seems and decides to dig deeper, in spite of the growing dangers.First, 'Crimson Peak' is not a horror film; it is a 'gothic romance' (with some horror elements thrown into the mix). The genre hasn't been visited upon for decades, yet Del Toro does a fine job of offering his own take on it. The film also contains plenty of blood and gore - so if you don't have a stomach for that kind of stuff, your chances of finishing this film are nil (for there are far more disturbing aspects).The story constantly switches in tone. I get that its a 'gothic romance' (two genres that can't be any further apart from each other), but it can get confusing for some people very quickly. One scene might seem like it was from a romantic period film while the next might seem like something out of a thriller! I think Del Toro and Robbins did a fine job of balancing the pacing, but they could have certainly tweaked a few things and cut the runtime down by an extra ten or fifteen minutes.That being said, the plot is pretty straightforward - up until the last third of the film. Again, there are some disturbing details that both Edith and the audience discover. It took me some time to connect certain things, but I eventually figured out the bigger picture. Nevertheless, the very nature of this film will undoubtedly shock you - and will do it in a way that no other film released this year has.Both Wasikowska and Hiddleston give good performances, but Chastain is the standout. Her role as a cold-hearted, manipulative aristocrat is done with sheer excellence; you can't help but suspect of her something. She allures your attention with her mysterious persona, yet you can't help but hate her for who she truly is.Just like in any other Del Toro film, the visuals in this film are amazing. This time, instead of the visual effects (like in 'Pacific Rim'), the main focus is on the production design and costume design. Every set, prop, and article of clothing not only have their own unique design but are also very telling of a scene's or character's given mood (now that's some good attention to detail). I would honestly be shocked if this film wasn't nominated for Best Prod. Design nor Best Costume (although I also wouldn't be surprised as the Academy usually forgets about films like these).Despite its narrative problems, 'Crimson Peak' is a grand visual experience that needs to be seen on the big screen (notwithstanding the blood and gore). Del Toro's directing has not faltered one bit, and he truly has come up with an original concept that we haven't seen in a very long time. And although I didn't completely fall in love with this film, I will say I'm glad I watched it in theatres.My actual rating for this film is 7.5/10",Crimson Peak
220,teiixeiral,Beautiful visuals but story issues hold this back from being a classic.,6,9 July 2021,"Crimson Peak is one of the most beautiful gothic films out there. The set designs are truly impressive, the costuming luxurious and the cinematography is spot on. I loved the atmosphere that Del Toro created and it's the perfect setting for something iconic.However, the story is flat. I saw the twist coming less than half way through the movie and the film only really gets good in the third act. Normally, I'm okay with a slow pace but the characters do some dumb things that make it hard to sit through, particularly the main girl. I thought Jessica Chastain was the acting highlight and she holds your attention whenever on screen.Crimson Peak is definitely worth watching at least once, especially for the gorgeous visuals and gothic setting.",Crimson Peak
221,tenyearreunion,Stunning(ly) boring,5,29 January 2016,"Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Del Toro directing. Surely a winner right?No, sadly not to this viewer. I don't know the history of it's script or if GDT was up against a deadline but boy, did it need more substance.Such an predictable plot, painstakingly told over two hours, sadly too painstakingly. This could easily have had 20-30 mins chopped off to make a more punchier horror with far more impact.I give it 5/10, purely as the acting cannot be faulted and the cinematography. I could look at Jessica Chastain all day long! And I love Mr Hiddleston in anything, from action to drama. Mia Wasikowska also gives a solid performance. Charlie Hunnam sadly can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but it doesn't distract from the rest of the cast.The cinematography is to the high standard you would expect, some lovely Gothic themes and touches, I felt cold! But this doesn't escape the inevitable boredom that ensues with the storyline and average finale.That is it, not much else to say. I am sure GDT fan's will watch this and 'appreciate' it but I would be very surprised if any gave put it anywhere near his top films, of which, Pan's Labyrinth pushes into my top 10 of all time, wow, that takes your breath away and hey, I loved the romp which is Pacific Rim.This will not join them in my Blu Ray collection!",Crimson Peak

223,cbak223,"Visually stunning...But, boring?!",5,5 November 2015,"Crimson Peak the new horror film from Writer/Director Guillermo Del Toro. Upon seeing the previews for this film it looks great, and to top that it's coming out around Halloween with not too many Horror films in theaters at this point. Well, yes once again very misleading, obviously Guillermo Del Toro has made a name for himself in Hollywood so upon seeing & hearing his name attached to a film it's like Hollywood tries to make this the selling point to see a film. Well after seeing this ""Guillermo Del Toro"" slapped across the top of a film, I will think twice. It was directed by Del Toro, but co-written with Matthew Roberts, This film stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, & Tom Hiddleston. It was a great cast, and Tom Hiddleston does give a good performance and he has great screen presence, you just sit and wait to see what his character will do next. Personally I thought Mia's performance was lacking, not on her part, but the writing, yes the writing is very sub par, and almost seems broken at times. The story unfolds with Mia and Tom's characters falling in love which seems like 3 seconds flat, upon 2 meetings it's ""your the only one, let's get married?"" wow. She loses her father, and yes seems like loses herself in the process and her reason to think, she moves in with Hiddleston & Chastain into ""Crimson Peak"". From the previews it seems like this is the main focus of the film, this is a very haunted house and it will be Mia's character to figure out what happened, that is the focus, but they really didn't put that to good use, the story almost unfolds years prior when Mia's character is a young girl, seeing the ghost of mother. So in the long run, it's not the beautifully constructed set of ""Crimson Peak, the house that's the focal point, it's Mia's character. If you were going to have this house be so much, it should have been much scarier, more ghosts, something to be ""Actually"" frightened about, hell halfway through the film she ends up talking with the ""bloody ghost woman"" like, What's up, what do you need? Just weak. She goes from scared as hell, to hey what's going on? Just very poor use of everything. I never once felt scared, I never once felt intrigued by ANY of the characters, you had a beautiful set piece in the house, you should have re-worked the script a bit, could've been something great.",Crimson Peak
224,starsteamer,Does not a setting a ghost story makes...,3,17 July 2016,"What a disappointment this movie is. It is a visual treat and the actors do what they can with what they have, but the plot is ridiculously predictable. The setting is a wonderful old English house, yet this is barely used in the plot: it seems such wasted possibilities. The movie lacks the one thing that makes a good ghost story - the creation and build up of tension. At no point does it get you even near the edge of your seat. The characterisation is interesting at first but after the first quarter, the characters settle into superficial stereotypes that make the 'twist' extremely obvious. The ghosts are ridiculous CGI: they look like something from a film a decade ago when this was first used (they are even worse than those in 'The Haunting'). And truthfully, they are pointless in relation to the plot and would be better off not there at all. This is very obviously a 'reworking' of 'The Fall of the House of Usher'. I just wish they had stuck to Poe's original plot. At least there may have been some tension. A very dull and predictable ghost story that could have and should have been great.",Crimson Peak
225,reoroy,Crimson Peak is one of the most artistic horror movies I've seen in recent times.,8,18 October 2015,"Crimson Peak is one of the most artistic horror movies I've seen in recent times. The movie's aristocratic splendor won my heart and is one of the main highlights of the movie. All the main characters in this movie are rich and you will realize why once the movie culminates in its climax. And then there are the ghosts. Now I have to admit that I have seen ""better"" ghosts in other horror movies because the ghosts in this movie look out of shape and straight out of a child's horror story book. ( Once again if you watch the movie carefully you might actually be able to infer why the ghosts in this movie look the way they do) BUT I won't deny the fact that the movie has it's spooky moments, some of which are extremely creepy. Moments like these get a horror movie going.So watch Crimson Peak mainly for the following reasons (1) The spooky moments-- Not exactly the moments when you see the ghosts but the prologue to those moments are the ones to cherish.(2) The movie's medieval Gothic architecture and the director's eye for detail that made Crimson Peak look so beautiful-- Yes, this is a ravishingly pretty horror movie. The architecture used in this movie more than makes up for all the ugly ghosts it features. If you are aspiring to be an interior decorator and want a cathedral for a home look no more beyond Crimson Peak.3) The aristocracy-- Like I mentioned earlier there is no dearth of opulence in this movie. The costumes are amazing and there is this exquisitely glamorous feel to this horror flick.So have a field day in the movie theater as you watch some wealthy people of the Middle Ages tackle vindictive ghosts against an immensely beautiful backdrop.",Crimson Peak
226,SandeepLoyalka,Perfect atmosphere; imperfect content,5,22 October 2015,"There are films that advertise - 'Nothing is what it seems'. Such films, when delivering on that promise, remain etched in memory as enjoyable mysteries that one can revisit often. 'Crimson Peak', purportedly a mystery, is unfortunately exactly what it seems. Everything the audience expects, happens. There are no surprises. This is its undoing - apart from a majorly flawed plot point (that I cannot reveal as it would amount to being a spoiler) that in fact renders the entire premise of the film redundant. All this is not to say that the film is without merit. There IS plenty to cheer. One can write paeans about the impeccable look of the film. From the immaculate cinematography, to the wondrous set designs, to the gorgeous costumes, to the haunting score - del Toro shows he's a master craftsman. The Gothic ambiance created by del Toro & his technicians is impressively spot-on. The performances are also uniformly excellent - Wasikowska & Chastain are particularly effective. The faint-hearted should note that the film has plenty of gore. But it's a strangely hypnotic gore, the kind you can't turn your eyes away from. However, as I said earlier, the perfunctory tale being told eventually leaves one feeling vaguely detached. A more complex story with unexpected twists & turns is what I went in expecting to see, but didn't get. Should make for a tremendous blu-ray demo disc though!",Crimson Peak

No one can accuse me of not paying attention.Anyhow, superb film craft in service to an undernourished narrative. Film students will love parsing the allusions to other films (particularly Hammer and Welles's The Magnificent Ambersons) but it hasn't the magic of Pan's Labyrinth. In fact, it can be argued that Del Toro has regressed since that magnificent merge of truth, myth and drama. This one is sort of Edith Wharton or Henry James with special effects by Tom Savini--not that that's a bad thing, now. Mia is a wan rich gal swept up by an Englishman and hauled off to his spooky place on the moors where things go creak and crack in the night. Besides the Baronet, there's his obviously psycho sister whom nobody seems to notice is completely wacko.

Wasikowska innocent complexion and golden locks highlight a disturbing perfection in a corrupt house. Although her childlike wonder echoes Alice in Wonderland, she isn't afraid to amplify a visceral prowess near the bloody finale. Rejoining her Lawless co-star, Chastain is at the defined peak of the triadic relationship. Donning a masculine terse, obsidian headdress styled in a feminine weave, the actress exhibits a deeply cold aura under a guise of boiling warmth that hints a terrible secret behind her piercing stare. And once that past is out, wielding an over-sized butcher's knife, Chastain becomes ghostly visceral as she seemingly soars through the malevolent climax. Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam, the latter as Dr. Alan McMichael—who's investigating the Sharpes be it due to the aforementioned murder or his displeasure in Edith's newfound love—both enlist fine showings. Profoundly conflicted, Hiddleston emits a vulnerable breach in his Prince Charming facade through a reluctant obedience under Chastain's venomous dominance – only finding warmth, and striking amenity in the arms of Wasikowska's purity and acceptance.""FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/10/23/crimson-peak-review-indie-adam/",Crimson Peak
230,kevin-38242,"It is supposed to be a farce, isn't it?",8,25 January 2016,"I enjoyed this Gothic farce enormously. I'm assuming that it _is_ a farce, or at least a parody -- it's so hard to tell these days, with so many movies being self-satirizing. It sends up all the usual horror clichés, and adds a heap of slapstick comedy: the last thirty minutes, in particular, are a riot. All the usual elements are there -- a troubled childhood, the spooky house, mysterious cellars, a mysterious past, things that go bump in the night; what makes this movie a work of genius is that none of these elements function in the way that that they do in an ordinary horror flick.Visually and atmospherically this film is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's _Brazil_ and _The time bandits_, but with the advantage of forty years' advances in cinematography. The sets -- particularly the spooky house and its surroundings -- are stunning, and the whole thing is permeated by a surreal, other-worldly atmosphere. The ghosties, or whatever they are supposed to be, add little to the plot (as others have remarked), but they are splendidly filmed.This movie will appeal, I think, to those of us who like to laugh at movie industry stereotypes. Whether the humour is intentional or accidental, however, remains unclear.",Crimson Peak
231,jamesnicholls-58600,A Great Gothic Horror,8,29 April 2020,"Overall this was a very entertaining, dark, somewhat mysterious Gothic horror film. I loved the period that the movie is set in as I'm a big fan of Victorian era fashion, technology and culture. The scenery was very good thanks to the amazing setting the film was in, the snow surrounding the Sharpe's large house in the middle of nowhere made the film even more dark but at the same time more beautiful and memorable.Plot Complexity: 15/20 - A lot of quotes Thomas Shape says are very thought provoking, such as the way he tells the protagonist she's childish and consumed by unrealistic childish dreams, it makes me wonder what he said there was true or whether it was simply his way of dumping her because of her father so even after watching this movie there are still some nice interesting questions to carefully think about after watching. The way Thomas' sister gets evidently jealous when he dances with the protagonist in the beginning was quite interesting as it shows his sister isn't content with their relationship being sexual every now and then, for her their relationship MUST be sexual all the time.Characters: 8/10 - I felt each character in this movie had some personality to them, even the protagonist to a certain extent though she was a very stereotypical Female character in many ways.Thomas Sharpe was easily the most interesting character as he had the most interesting thought provoking quotes, was the smartest character and had a lot of knowledge which made his quotes generally very interesting for history enthusiasts such as myself as well as giving the character a more broad range of things to say as a result of his vast knowledge. Tom Hiddleston's acting was top notch and the film did a great job of making it difficult for the viewer to decide whether to support Thomas or the protagonists father during their few scenes they have together.Emotion (not including laughs): 8/10 - The film had many emotional scenes such as the protagonist's father's death, Thomas' death and Thomas' dumping of the protagonist, the dance scene as well as the sex scene between Thomas and the protagonist.Consistency: 10/10 - No boring scenes in my opinion, overall a very entertaining film from start to finish, you probably won't long to watch anything else when you're watching this movie for the first time.Scare Factor: 5.5/10
Sex Factor: 6/10
Laugh Factor: 1/10",Crimson Peak

For the rest it's not clear what sort of movie it is if a horror, a scary movie, a comedy or a ghost tale, a Gothic romance, there's a bit of everything.Personally I wasn't scared but I don't know if it was by design or because I found the plot so predictable that I could see things coming.Still visually it is an enjoyable experience. Pacific Rim was quite similar, great visuals predictable plot. Many modern movies have this problem with the plot and the scripting.

I just wanted to a horror movie and got Murder on the Orient Express with ghosts. Del Toro can make a beautiful movie. Wasikowska and Hiddleston did a wonderful job.

235,Gorgorgorgoroth,"What happened to you, del Toro?",5,20 July 2016,"Well, aren't I a fool? I thought this was going to be a horror film, but no, it turned out this was a Gothic romance film.The first 30 minutes of the film was another one of those generic dark romance films. Thomas is an English man trying to advertise his clay machine or whatever it is, he fells in love with Edith but Edith's dad doesn't approve of those two to be together. Edith's dad hires someone to get information on Thomas so Edith's dad could use it against Thomas to convince Thomas to not be in a relationship with Edith. Thomas breaks Edith's heart because Edith's dad wanted it and the next day, someone murders Edith's dad by smashing his head to a bathroom sink.Yeah, not very inspiring.Edith and Thomas finally marry each other, he takes her to his shltty looking, old ass house that has a huge hole on top of the house. Edith notices there's a ghost in the house, I forgot whose ghost it was, and the ghost was obviously CGI so that didn't help the film out at all.Alan the doctor finds out Thomas is already married to someone else and the last check Edith's father ever wrote was for Thomas. Umm, how is a DOCTOR getting all of this information? Edith eventually finds out Thomas has been married to multiple women and kills them. He and his sister Lucille takes the wife's money and move on. Another thing is that it turns out Thomas and his sister have a fvcking thing for each other! Yes, incest! They killed their mom because their mom found out about their incest relationship! WTF?! How is Thomas already considered to be married before he married Edith when his previous wives were KILLED?! If your spouse dies, you're not considered to be married anymore.And for some stupid reason, Thomas actually loves Edith. So out of all of the women he married, Edith just happens to be this special snowflake and Thomas tries so hard to protect her from his sister Lucille. What's so special about Edith? Why did he feel Edith was so special compared to the other women he married? And what was that red clay on the bottom floor? The red clay would get on top of the ground outside of their house. What was the point of that red clay? It served no purpose at all.When Edith sees Thomas making out with his sister, Edith runs away and Lucille catches up to her. Edith says ""YOU'RE NOT HIS SISTER!"" and Lucille awkwardly says ""I am."" and pushes Edith from like two floors and Edith for some odd reason survives. It turns out Edith only has a broken leg from that fall. How?! She landed on her back! And you're telling me she could run after that fall?! Unbelievable! Towards the end of the film, Lucille is in pursuit of Edith and tries to kill her and Lucille was awkwardly hissing at Edith, which was so cringe worthy. Edith finally kills Lucille by hitting her with a shovel after Edith tells Lucille to turn around and Lucille, for some stupid reason, did what Edith told her to do.The story was just silly and the CGI wasn't very good. The movie wasn't terrible, some scenes did get my attention and I thought Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska looked pretty good here. The movie could've been better and I was a little disappointed by the fact that this movie was made by del Toro. I expected a little more from him.",Crimson Peak
236,rchalloner,A visual treat let down by a predictable storyline.,5,30 September 2021,"As always Guillermo del Toro provides a sumptuous experience for the eyes: the photograpy, sets and costumes are gorgeous. Sadly the writing falls far short of this. The film is billed as 'drama/horror/mystery and there is certainly plenty of drama. The 'horror' however, such as it is, is garish and unsubtle in my view and really, quite innecessary. As for mystery - well there is none. It is perfectly obvious from the outset what is going on at Crimson Peak and what is going to happen. There are fine actors in this, not least Jessica Chastain, but once again, the writing does not allow them to go beyond two dimensional characterisations. In Ms Chastain's case in particular, some element of pathos and more back story would have made a great difference to her portrayal of Lucille Sharpe. It is a great shame that the film is so uneven, but if you are a de Toro fan, forget about the plot and sit back and enjoy the visuals and atmosphere.",Crimson Peak
237,zalouteacher,A movie that has literature,8,20 September 2016,"I really liked the movie and the script especially because it had meaning, meaning of the controversies of the world and what we may be losing, gaining, or missing. Mila did it again with her innocent adult smile. The only thing that was a bit out of order for me is perhaps the long introduction of the setting and maybe the climax. The place is so British that it made me think again about my future wife. In other words, the setting was another duplicata of literary description of master pieces with color contrast between red and crimson that again reflects controversies of values and principles according to one given nation or to put it in the words of Jessica:"" It's a monstrous love"".",Crimson Peak

239,gorepump,"Stylish and colorful in typical Del Toro fashion, but suffers from sloppy script and abysmal CGI...",3,14 April 2016,"I can't say I'm a huge fan of Guillermo del Toro's films across the board, but I did dig ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and I vaguely remember ""The Devil's Backbone"" being alright, but it's been years since I saw it. The rest of his most recent credits are attached to all sorts of ""Pacific Rim"" and ""Hobbit"" sh*t that I could give a rat's ass about. ""Crimson Peak"" was one I figured I'd watch eventually, seeing as how, again, I enjoyed ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and was moderately interested in seeing how the self-professed horror fanatic would 'spin' the ever-dwindling mainstream approach to the genre. In all, I wasn't all that impressed...The daughter of a wealthy capitalist falls in love with an English inventor and the two move to England's countryside after her father's mysterious murder. While waiting for dead daddy's money to arrive, they move into her new husband and his nutty sister's childhood mansion where he's attempting to break into the clay mining business. While there, his new bride starts seeing ghoulish apparitions lurking around the halls and rooms, giving way to a violent background involving the strange siblings.Visually, ""Crimson Peak"" is as lavish looking as you would expect from del Toro, but as it turns out, this only goes so far in keeping the movie engaging. Being a supernatural period piece gave it potential, I thought, and a slower pace CAN add to a tense build, but this flick gives in to the same overuse of CGI that almost all these types of ghost/haunting-themed films do these days. And every effect is so up front and in-your-face that all you can do is laugh at the cartoonish, digitized obnoxiousness. One scene contains a homage to ""The Shining"" that has all the subtlety of a Mack truck barrel rolling through an artillery range and the creepiness of a Saturday morning cartoon (which it looked like...). That, on top of the characters being extremely dull and the story feeling somewhat disjointed made ""Crimson Peak"" just hard to get 'into'.The film comes across as exactly what it is: a horror flick made by a guy long marred by studio influence and giant robot movies whom everyone seems to mistake for a visionary.More reviews at http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/",Crimson Peak

242,porkchopis2,An Absolutely Beautiful Film!,8,11 December 2015,"I avoided seeing this movie, because although I am the biggest fan of the horror genre, I am not a fan of romance movies. It's a good thing I watched it anyway!I had heard that Tom Huddleston, Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver did great work in their assigned roles, but I was still surprised at their talent.For Beaver and Hunnam, their roles were not in keeping with others I had seen them in, but as real talent does they became the characters and were believable.Jim Beaver's gruff and disparaging Cushing is a sympathetic character in his love for his daughter and his protection of her, but when those things are in motion, as in his dealings with Sir Sharp, he is despicable and cruel. Unfamiliar with Huddleston, I found his facial expressions dead on and his gentleness with Edith very touching and yet creepy, given the storyline. Most people who see him in this role will become Fans!Charlie Hunnam, out of the deadly biker character I only knew him for, plays a bland character, quiet, smart, but not exciting. His looks, costume and speech are well done and I didn't recognize him at first. Probably a difficult role and well done.The lead female roles are also well acted and cast. No one else could have given the role of Edith the vulnerability and naivety that Mia Wasikowska does, and by pitting that character against the dark and insane Lucille (played by Jessica Chastain) there is a classic good vs evil situation that you don't want to miss.I was astounded at the beauty of the costumes used throughout. The rich fabrics and embellishments on the women's gowns and coats are breathtaking and put you right in the middle of the century in which the movie takes place. The male costumes are done equally well, although not as pretty!Any one unfamiliar with the great work of Guillermo del Toro will want to see more of it after seeing Crimson Peak.Finally, the sets. With an overall feeling of darkness and foreboding, they are all very well done. The creepy house in which the Sharp's reside, filled with large and heavy furniture, fabrics and lighting, contribute greatly to the overall theme of the movie. The different rooms are designed to clearly be different spaces that cause different emotions and memories to arise.Don't miss it, worth the time.",Crimson Peak

So instead of seeing it in theaters, I waited until it came out on DVD. So Tuesday, February 9th my mom and I went to Target and bought it. Excited to finally see it! It was kind of slow, but it kept with the story. After watching, I thought it was good and creepy. Not so much scary as I hoped, but it was more of a thriller. Some of the acting I thought wasn't so great at times from the girl that plays Edith. Lucille was by far the creepiest. I would have been a little more careful and not so trusting if I was Edith.

So it's all wasted (not really, it makes you care even more for the characters so it hurts more when they die). That is how I felt with this movie. I love period films and this one is on my list of favorites now. And this period film really felt like a romance of it's period and I loved it and then the horror came it. Which was also amazing. It was creepy without having to constantly jumps care you (it had a one or two but that's fine). It is a slow burn movie, but it's also about two hours long, so I'm not sure if you could call it a slow burn.

His latest film, ""Crimson Peak"" is what happens when these two worlds collide, in other words, a big budget English language horror film.""Crimson Peak"" is set in the late 19th century, first in New York, then in rural England. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young budding writer who is intelligent, beautiful, and strong willed, refusing to allow Victorian sensibilities dictate what she can and cannot do, and as a result butts heads with those around her. Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) is an English aristocrat and inventor who is in New York seeking financial backing for his mechanized clay mining business back home. When tragedy strikes, Thomas marries Edith and brings her to his home, Allerdale Hall in Cumberland, where his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) is waiting. As Edith tries to fit into her new surroundings, she discovers that secrets abound and nothing is as it seems.The visuals in ""Crimson Peak"" are so glorious, they are almost overwhelming. The sets are spectacular visions of beauty and decadence in decay; costumes are intricately detailed and gorgeous; the lighting and over saturated color bring depth and meaning; the ghosts are grotesquely beautiful; and, of course, the del Toro trademarks of insects and clockwork gracefully found their way into the story as well.Because ""Crimson Peak"" is a rather large studio production, it is being marketed to a large audience. I believe this accounts for some of the lackluster reviews I have been reading. If one is not familiar with del Toro's prior Spanish language films, they may not understand his unique cinematic perspective. For some, this will mark the beginning of a journey into del Toro's fantasy world, for others it will be a disappointment. For me, it was almost everything I wanted it to be.",Crimson Peak

251,writerever365,"Destined To Become A Classic, But Not In Horror",10,24 October 2015,"I went last night to see Crimson Peak with a few friends. Here's what I have to say about it.First, let me run down what I really liked. The acting was superb, almost to the level of Oscar performances, with the exception of Mia Wasikowska. She was very good, but not on the level of the others. Jessica Chastain is the show-stealer. She floats above this movie like the ghosts who haunt Allerdale Hall - cold, transcendent, distant. Yet when she unhinges, it is a beautiful and terrifying thing to see. Tom Hiddleston is also very very good, playing the role he is in to the absolute best, twitching and hissing his way through a deeply complex character. Charlie Hunnam is very good and serviceable, though his character never develops too far. The two standouts are definitely Hiddleston and Chastain, whose performances genuinely are Oscar- worthy. Second, the look of the film. The film's aesthetic is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. The colors are rich and real, the sets are EXTRAVANGTLY beautiful. The costumes swirl and constrict realistically, as if you've actually gone back in time. Third, the score. The score, penned by Fernando Velazquez, is brilliantly beautiful. It accents the film uniquely well.Now for a few little qualms. Bear in mind, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. None of these little things could stop my love for it. But: First, the sex scene. It was one of the most ridiculously laughable sex scenes I've ever seen. So outrageously pandering to a predominantly female audience. It felt out of place and completely unrealistic. The woman remains completely clothed the entire time, to the point of you can actually see the woman pulling her shirt up at one point so as not to let her cleavage go any further. It was downright laughable. Not that I think the woman should've gone fully nude or anything, but if you're going to have a scene like that in a movie, what is the point of being unrealistic? Literally what I got from that scene is, ""women undress men, and mens butts are seen, but women must remain clothed AT ALL COSTS"". It just didn't make sense. Second, the writing was pretty bad at a few short times in the movie. Some of the lines were just cringe-worthy. But, on the other hand some were pure genius, so you really get the best of both worlds. Third, the ad campaign. This movie was marketed as a chilling horror film. LIES. While there are some intense moments, this is not a horror film. I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. This is a Gothic romance with horror elements. While I'm on the subject, you won't see any effects that are too scary. If you've seen Jim Carrey's A Christmas CAROL, then the ghosts in that film are about as scary as the ghosts in this film. What gives this movie its scares are is visceral scenes. This is one of the most delightfully brutally violent movies I've seen in a while. The violence is sparse, one scene occurring at about ten minutes in, the others all happening towards the end. But when it happens IT IS BRUTAL. Eyeballs roll out of skulls smashed into porcelain sinks, armpits, chests, and faces are stabbed, people are slashed at and thrown down stairways - it's violent and that's what makes this movie R. That, and one COMPLETELY unnecessary F bomb. Like, when it happened, I really did laugh out loud, because it simply made zero sense. Go see Crimson Peak. It's a fantastic film, beautifully made and acted. Just don't go in expecting a horror film. You'll be more scared by the trailer of THE WITCH that plays beforehand than by anything you see during your stay at Crimson Peak",Crimson Peak
252,Chris12955,It's more of a story with a ghost in it.,7,16 October 2015,"Atmospheric, lavish(in a good way,) and creepy, Crimson Peak is a slow burning thriller with nicely developed characters and tension between them. Set in 1897, the film makes splendid use of the period look, along with the dour, sinister, yet lush and beautiful looking key set piece that is Allerdale Hall. Mr. Del Toro shows us he hasn't lost his touch for visual flair with superb asides to directorial styles of past filmmakers to great effect. Excellent acting and a gripping score help sell the picture, but the gore and blood themes feel a little too over the top given the focus on suspense.The movie opens with aspiring writer Edith Cushing assuring us that ghosts exist, and that she can see them. They are in the film but this is not a movie about the dead, instead the living are the primary focus(this is not a bad thing if you are worried.) Edith marries eligible bachelor Thomas Sharpe, and moves into his ancestral home where his sister also resides. With the mysterious siblings, and a haunted house, Edith's stay is going to be more than she expected.The slow buildup of the movie gives us an increasing tension, and a weighty sense of dread, but I feel it was just a little bit too slow, or lacking on. something additional. All in all, an enjoyable suspense film that is a visual treat, although, not one of Mr. Del Toro's better works. Worth seeing, but I've seen better in the genre.",Crimson Peak
253,rzemph,Abysmal,1,7 January 2018,"The current rating for this film is totally unjustified. It should, of course, be zero. Where to begin? The catastrophic script, which sounds like it was written by a creatively-challenged eleven-year-old glue-sniffer trying to cram in every cliché ever regurgitated by Hollywood onto our screens over the last ten decades or so? The utterly ridiculous plot, so badly cobbled together from a handful of implausible premises that it actually makes your eyes water to follow it onscreen? The cringe-makingly horrendous acting, complete with terrible accents from at least two of the main protagonists? The lurid sets that look like they came straight from some cheesy 90s computer game? The bubble-gum-coloured CGI ghosts that would look at home in even cheesier computer games than those of the sets? The hackneyed score that punctuates every move of every leaf, doorknob and eyebrow and that we seem to have heard thousands upon thousands of times before? Yes, folks, it's all here. A true compendium of all the don'ts of filmmaking. And then one asks: how oh how does such unadulterated garbage make it to the big screen? Fudge knows. This is the cinematic equivalent of a very cheap, very rusty 1950s ghost-train ride in a very rundown fairground managed by illiterate crooks, only it comes disguised under a thick veneer of glossy technicolor paint to fool the one or two under-sixes who might just be able to watch this plastic cheeseburger of a film to the end without throwing their arms up in total disgust.",Crimson Peak

All his films have been sophisticated, deeply creepy, and always original -- until this one. It's still visually stunning, with all kinds of gorgeous horror eye- candy, from the red snow to the smoky ghosts to the absinthe-green walls. But even Del Toro's genius can't overcome a leaden script, completely predictable plot, and pedestrian performances. Oh, the cast can act just fine -- but they've brought manners of Masterpiece Theatre to a scenario that makes TV's old Dark Shadows seem like highbrow television. It might have been better as a sort of horror comedy -- but it takes itself far too seriously throughout. Fortunately I got a free ticket, so I can't complain and ask for a refund -- but I don't think I'll automatically rush out to see Del Toro's next film",Crimson Peak

That's what takes this from being a one rated to two.The story is preposterous, the characters terrible, the usual annoying Brits-are-the-baddies casting.There is a big slice of graphic violence, claims that ghosts are real, incomprehensible behaviour from otherwise level-headed characters and an over-long running time. The film started to drag from the half hour mark and never really got going properly.

As Edith says when she's hawking around her novel, this isn't a ghost story but a story with ghosts in it. The ghosts mainly served only to provide clues and move the plot along. If the aim was to scare, Crimson Peak missed its target by a mile. So that leaves us with the core story, which was probably old-hat when my granddad was still a kid.This is a personal indicator but I'll tell you anyway. My wife isn't a big film fan, she just can't sit still for two hours. But she sometimes comes in when I'm watching something and after a few minutes she'll ask what it's called - a giveaway that she's gripped. Crimson Peak ticked all the boxes for her; ghosts, costumes, a big house in England. She gave it ten minutes and went back out without a word.I did like Crimson Peak while I was watching it, and that's why I've given it a possibly generous 7/10.

259,mowasteph,Ghosts are boring,2,25 July 2016,"I got to see Tom Hiddleston's butt for 3 seconds...that was the highlight of this movie. As of the rest of it....puh-leeze. It's a good thing I didn't pay to see this in the theater nor even pay to rent if from Red Box. It came on HBO or something and we DVR'd it for later viewing. Still, I wasted a good 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.This movie is so dull. How'd they get this cast (who are usually fine performers) to be in this dreck? Chastain is a total caricature. I figure she aspired to be Judith Anderson in Rebecca but sorry, she didn't come close. As hard as she tries, Mia W. has NO personality. None. And even Tom's butt (and fine acting) cannot save the day.Absolutely nothing in this movie was original and there wasn't anything coming that couldn't be seen from a mile off. The siblings are after Mia's money. Big surprise!! They're poisoning her. Big surprise!! They killed their own mother. Shock! They're sleeping with each other....oh like I didn't figure that one out as soon as Tom and Jessica's characters made an appearance. Ho AND hum.A few people here have commented along the lines of ""well, at least it LOOKED good"" and, true, the set design was somewhat appealing visually, but I have to say that I have never seen a movie with such hideous outfits in it.

260,DigitalShark1,Great Movie,8,19 December 2015,"""Crimson Peak"" is an awesome film. It's directed by Guillermo Del Toro who previously made the Masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and while I don't think it's nearly as good as Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak is still a great film.Easily the best part of Crimson Peak is it's visuals. The movie's visuals are enough to keep you entertained through Visual Stimulus alone. I really mean it when I say the production design is absolutely incredible and the use of color over it is some of the best I've ever seen. It's insanely impressive and fits the Artsy Haunted Mansion theme perfectly. Now, it does have problems. Some plot points aren't explained very well, and there are a couple plot holes I noticed. Here are some examples: There's a scene later in the movie where after Edith realizes that the tea they're giving to her is poisoned, and she refuses to drink it, but continues eating the porridge. As if she didn't think for a second that they probably poisoned the porridge too? There's another scene where they stab the doctor, and the doctor pulls out the knife from his deep stab wound. Wouldn't the doctor know that you're not supposed to pull it out, because you would leave a gap that now blood will start pouring out faster? Apparently, Tom Hiddleston's character didn't realize this either, because when he get's stabbed in the cheek, he too pulls it out. But with problems aside, Crimson Peak is still a great movie and one that I would recommend.8/10",Crimson Peak
261,farchettiensis,"Mediocre, quasi-artistic, if you like, but ultimately tedious and uninteresting",4,17 August 2016,"One thing I came to learn using IMDb is that horror movies have a tremendous deviation in their rates, so what's valid for other genres certainly isn't for this one. From 4.0 to 4.49, there's a good probability that the film is actually bad and probably not worth watching, but maybe not entirely bad, and you may actually be surprised. From 4.5 to 4.99, you may still get shabby productions, predictable plots and so forth, the likelihood grows that it's a good horror movie. From 5 onward, the probability increases, and I'd give a shot to most movies with this rating. Probably this is because horror movies cause strong emotions in some people who then feel dissatisfied with their experience. These people shouldn't even rate this movies. For movies like Crimson Peak, I think it's quite the opposite. Because it has mainstream elements, romance, interesting, though dull, historical reconstruction, and a famous director, this draws a wider audience which appreciate these extraneous, or secondary, elements, causing the rate to go up. The deviation moves the rate higher. My guess is that horror movie fans will dislike the movie, but it may be more accessible to a wider audience.There's not much interesting in this movie. The story seems to have no obvious wholes in it, but it's uninteresting. There are no genuine scares, though it tries hard to. You can see all of them coming, even their angles, and the creatures are very boring. I have no problem with clichés. I'm much more interested in their interpretation and presentation. If you tell an old story in an interesting way, I think it's always valid. If you make a horror movie and you play down its main element, which is horror, and pay more attention to the subordinate elements, it won't be a good movie. The best I can say about the movie is that it feels like a whole; it's not a sloppy work, but it's simply dull and insipid. I give it 4 out of 10 and would not recommend it if you have a choice. A very forgettable flick, I think it may please those who are into this sort of blend between horror and romance, and the historical reconstruction, but it gets boring soon.",Crimson Peak

I like Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, never watched the Hellboy movies, but am familiar enough with the work of Dell Toro to appreciate. This film however, really infuriated me for the waste of time it was.The only good things about this film, is the cinematography and set work (colors, etc). The plot is terrible, MTV-Kardashian-Degrassi type drama, and the film tries hard to be like Coppola's Dracula, Burton's Sleepy Hollow, etc etc...This film is supposed to take place over 200 years ago, yet everyone looks like they have had fresh plastic surgery or are magazine models, not very convincing considering people did not look that way in the USA (or anywhere) over 200 years ago.I wonder if Del Toro didn't understand that the plot was not old and overused, but incredibly shallow and yet another movie aimed at Americans who like useless drama. This is not a film for the thinking brain, it's eye candy with lousy acting and good use of color scheming, that's all. If I were to write more on this movie on why it's so bad, I'd have to write spoilers. The CGI isn't terrible, but isn't good either.

Every single supernatural element could have been cut from the film and the story would be unaffected. That's just bad writing in my opinion.Mia is so one note. Very boring actress to watch, but I guess Guillermo was going for the Alice character again because really it's a copy paste job here too. One minute the character is portrayed as a feminist and a thinking woman, and the next moment she's a total idiot. 'I pretend to be an independent woman because no one asked me to the ball'. Really? Chastaine is always good. Although she's showing up everywhere these days, she owns her roles so well it's not a problem. She was fun to watch, given what she had to work with.I just feel this film wasted Del Toro's talents. The movie is long, and only a few small times does it feel like it's dragging.

268,thefilmlawyers,There's no need to beware Crimson Peak,7,20 October 2015,"Crimson Peak is the much anticipated, brand new film by acclaimed visual director Guillermo del Toro. This is del Toro's English- language ode to his previous Spanish films: The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth. The movie stars Mia Wasikowska as Edith Cushing, an aspiring writer in late 19th century Buffalo. She becomes enamored by Tom Hiddleston's Sir Thomas Sharpe, who is accompanied by his sister Lucille Sharpe brilliantly played by Jessica Chastain. Now the first to thing to realize is that Crimson Peak is not your typical horror film. It's exactly what del Toro had said during promotions that this movie was a Gothic romance and not necessarily a horror movie. But, that's not to say that there aren't a few scares here and there. They are mostly prevalent with the ghosts in the middle of the film, but even then, the scares are quite predictable and for hardcore horror fans, they will be nothing. However, the sequence at the end of the movie (for about 20 minutes) is fantastically gory and has been described by many as a tribute to hammer horror. If Crimson Peak would've actually explored more with that side of its film personality, this movie could've qualified more as a horror than anything else frankly. But that's not to say that the Gothic romance of the movie is bad or underwhelms. There is a certain sense, especially when you meet Lucille, but even with Thomas Sharpe that he may be an odd character even though he is this charming Brit seemingly just in America for a business opportunity. And when Thomas first meets Edith, there does seem to be a legitimate connection between the two characters. The movie is at its peak in terms of its characters especially with the portrayal of the Sharpe siblings. Jessica Chastain channels her inner demonic being in portraying Lucille, while Thomas is the smooth and suave Brit who is the charmer but you can tell that there is some sort of cynicism behind his character. The character of Edith on the other hand is just used as a plot device, where her character is what is allowing the progression of the story and no further. She does make significant contribution once the action begins towards the end, but until then it's a lot of interactions with ghosts who tell her to take heed of Crimson Peak (but of course, she doesn't). However, if there is one thing that Crimson Peak cannot be faulted on, is its style and surroundings. It will be the movie that gives The Man from U.N.C.L.E. a run for its money in terms of costume design at the Oscars. The costumes are absolutely brilliant and really do show off the period nature of the movie. The movie is also brilliantly shot with a very late 19th-century color pallet to start the movie and once the film moves to Allerdale Hall, the construct of the house itself really makes it apparent of the creepiness of Crimson Peak. All in all, Crimson Peak is a great attempt for del Toro in his first English language film that is similar to his previous work in Spanish. But it's not his best; that title would still belong to Pan's Labyrinth with The Devil's Backbone closely behind. There is definitely more style over substance but it shouldn't detract from the fact that del Toro has made a movie that wants me yearning for more of his work.Crimson Peak gets a grade of B-.

269,TreeOfWolf,Surprisingly enjoyable,7,3 September 2016,"The movie will be more fun if you don't read my spoilers. Nothing is perfect, but it's good enough to be worth it.I forgot why I got that movie and when I read the plot about a man being thorn between two women, I thought ""why the hell did I pick a boring romance movie!?"" And then I saw a slender gentleman approach with grace, confidence, and curly dark hairs under his tall hat. I thought ""Whoa, what a gorgeous man"" and when he came close enough to remove his hat and reveal his face I screamed ""Oh god it's Loki!"" I was ready to endure the worst bore just to look at Tom Hiddleston. But I actually had a good time watching this movie.The effects were spooky enough to creep me out. There's a much more complex plot than ""someone died, became a ghost, and now wants to freak out the living just for the laughs"". The dresses looked as glorious as they seemed uncomfortable. The movie is beautiful to look at and not just because Tom is in it.PROBABLY SPOILERS...I like how Tom ends up thorn in many more ways than just between two women. Thorn about morality, his dreams, hope for his business... even life and death... Something precious would have to be sacrificed... whether he chooses or not... But not choosing soon enough might bring the worst loss... I liked the ending.I thought that the characters themselves where lame for what they are doing, but that doesn't make a lame movie. There are truly people like that... stubborn people who refuse to see their failures and ruin other people's lives to persevere... when they could move on to so much better... but I can't really blame them... they were denied better options all their lives... the wrong way to love is all they've ever known. To them, it feels like letting go and moving on would make them lose everything, but it's clinging on something destructive that make them destroy everything... with their own hands... everything they love and even themselves... for nothing... just to avoid the fear of change.Some people don't wake up until it's too late... some people do so after death and their ghosts try to warn us not to make the same mistake...It's a good story about abuse to remind people that sometimes if you don't get leave a bad situation and move on, only a deadly agony awaits you. Your hope and dreams for happiness and love never existed in the first place, they were just a bait to lure you to your doom... Because not everyone wants love when marrying... And that was scarier than the ghosts... Even terrifying... Waking up from a dream to live a nightmare requires immense courage. But facing the truth is the only way to end the nightmare. Manipulators can rip your heart, mind and soul apart... to use and abuse you... I'd rather face ghosts and demons.I read a review that someone knew what would happen at the first frame so he didn't enjoy this movie. But I would gladly watch it again. And not just because we get to see Tom's ass in it. I liked the creepy poesy used to tell the tale. It was a good horror movie, not a slasher, but a good ghost suspense.",Crimson Peak

But this is just another Home entertainment thriller with a brilliant man directing it, nothing more. The real problem in this movie is the casting choices that an esteemed director like Del Toro should be able to avoid. 1. Instead of the original choice of Emma stone on the leading role, they went for Mia Wasikowska who actually have some talent but Alice in Wonderland proved she should not be spending it in medieval pictures. 2. Tom Hidleston was casted after Benedict Cumberbatch rejected the main male role. Again they should look harder. Tom Hidleston is a decent actor but I can not stop seeing a Cumberbatch in his place doing a better job with the specific role. 3. Last but not Least we have all the cast of our favorite TV shows in all the wrong places: The robust biker Jax Teller portraying a doctor who speaks about science? The lovable hillbilly from supernatural as Mia's father? The evil dagger cuthroat killer from Game of thrones as a detective? All the above are poor casting choices who look hasten when the first choice refused the part. The only actor who truly shines is Jessica Chastain and its a bad thing this movie is not better than a mediocre thriller because it could be an Oscar for her if the movie drew more critic's attention.

It's a pure delight to look at and the actors all do a fine job with their characters (please, someone give a medal to Jessica Chastain, she was absolutely superb). The problem is cinematography and CGI ghosts can't totally detract attention from the sub-par plot and the half-baked romance which seems all tell and no show. Tom Hiddleston's character seems especially underdeveloped. Sure, he goes through the complex emotions the Baronet Sharpe feels, but at the end of the film, you're still wondering what happened. And no, ""love happened"" isn't an adequate enough reason. It's a convenient cop-out.If you've seen the trailer, you know too much already. If you haven't been living under a rock, you will know what's coming, and no amount of monologue at the end will be able to move you enough into convincing yourself this was a great love story or something with much wow.To summarize...The good: Jessica Chastain, the cinematography including pretty CGI ghosts, Lok-- I mean Tom Hiddleston if you have a crush on Tom Hiddleston, the costumes, the gore unless gore is not your thing and yes it's called CRIMSON Peak for a reason The bad: the plot, the pacing The ugly: the romance, the cheesy dialogue (A+ on the witting or unwittingly done reference to Jane Eyre, which Mia Wasikowska starred in, what a laugh) Go see it if you're okay with eye candy. If you're looking for something more filling and thought provoking, Crimson Peak isn't for you, because it babies you by spoon-feeding you all the answers well in advance. In the end, Crimson Peak earns its crimson title, but not much else.",Crimson Peak

This is a so bad movie that after you watch you will say to yourself ""what the hell""; this is a very very bad copy of ""Sixth sense"" series; that you have a message from a ghost! Listen it cause he is trying to help you, but what the hell , these ghosts only seen to our chars not the bad chars ( i wonder what is the sense in it; the ghosts should curse the guys that killed him, but no :) ) , so nothing special about this movie, even don't believe the score; i must say Hollywood cant produce good story on horror anymore, cause all spots, all stories have been produced. In each horror movie i wathced in last 10 years i feel the same; i guess i will stop wathcing those; and i must add all chars in the movie lacks intelligence as no one is really smart ; also hate those; anyway step away from this if you trust a fairful foreigner.",Crimson Peak

276,oksanasinner,A tribute to classic horror,8,8 December 2017,"This what I like to call 'your mom's horror movie'. It's a love story set in a previous century, there's some mystery but zero intrigue and occasionally you get some spooky (don't mistake for scary) scenes. It's not everyone's cup of tea but I don't think this movie deserves any less than a 6. It is a stylish little peace that leaves you with a slight feeling of melancholy as Del Toro's films tend to do.The story follows the Gothic novel formula: an old mansion, a family secret, some ghosts and romance. Apart from the hustle, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. In fact I think the story would've been much more entertaining if it focused more on the villains and their scheme instead of showing it to us from the victims point of view(because each step that the heroine takes is predictable). Ironically the antagonists turned out to be more interesting and developed characters compared to her.The design of the ghosts is actually pretty interesting. Sadly, they appear just for scares. The ghosts are merely metaphors just like it was stated in the begging of the movie. It would've been more interesting if they played some role story-wise like persuade the heroine to avenge their death by killing off the Sharpe siblings.Which leads me to the final problem I had with 'Crimson Peak'. It builds up as this stylish and refined horror but in the end Lucille gets killed off with a shovel to head like it's 'Evil Dead' or something and Edith even delivers a one-liner after wards. The part where she gets Lucille to turn around is silly. The whole scene is just comedic and out of place. So was the sex scene but I don't even wanna get into it. It would've been smarter if Edith fixed Lucille's tea and gave her a taste of her own medicine if you know what I mean.Despite it's flaws I liked the movie's appreciation of classic horror. The acting was good. I'm not really fond of Mia Wasikowska but the others were great and Mia looks good in vintage gowns. The use of color and texture keeps you focused on the screen from beginning to end. Most modern horror movies just make it as dark as possible and put a teal color filter on it. Some people compare its style to 'Suspiria' but I would say that it's much closer to Mario Bava's 'Blood and Black Lace' and the third episode of 'Black Sabbath'. You'll see not only the similarities in style but even where inspiration for the ghosts came from.",Crimson Peak

278,electrobird,Technically and Artistic Perfect.,7,17 October 2015,"Crimson Peak is visually stunning, well directed, beautifully shot edited and recorded. It is technically perfect. A masterpiece that only Guillermo Del Toro could have made. Jessica Chastain gives an Oscar deserving performance. Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston and the entire cast are perfect in their roles.The movie has a great atmosphere. Costume design and art production are impeccable! At times, the creepy Allerdale Hall reminds me of the hotel in The Shining . It's isolated and majestic. The exterior and interiors are almost like characters themselves. The costumes reminded me of Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula. Incredibly beautiful and original. Oscar-deserving material, no doubt.It is certainly the best horror movie made in a long time and its only flaws are the very predictable plot and the many ghosts flying around the screen haunting Edith. The screenplay is incredibly obvious and the spirits could have been presented in a much subtler way. Sometimes, what you don't see can be scarier than a CGI flying corpse with a hatchet stuck to her head. If Del Toro had learned a thing or two from Robert Wise's The Hauting (1962), he could have made this a masterpiece. Apparently he only watched the bad remake.Regardless of these flaws, this is a great movie and worth every penny and every second of my time. I watched in XD and I was mesmerized by its beauty. I strongly recommend.",Crimson Peak
279,Faizel-R,Slow and comical,6,11 July 2016,"I watched the movie over the weekend and wondered for the first three quarters what the movie was about. The visuals gave the movie somewhat of a comic feel. The apparitions were visually stunning and scary at times but also unrealistic and comical. They did not add to the movement of the plot which was also very thin. Overall, the movie should have been shortened to a run time of just over 1 and a half hours. There were many characters that simply did not drive the narrative. One plus for the movie is the thematic use of colour which kind reflects the emotions of the main protagonist.",Crimson Peak
280,brittneysaid-787-572711,good trailer - not so good movie,2,24 October 2015,"When first seeing the trailer for this movie it looked fantastic, however after watching the movie i was very disappointed. One of the things that got me interested in going to watch the movie to begin with was the male lead role played by Tom Hiddleston, and he played is part well.It took a very long time to get into the movie and give you enough information to follow the movie then summed the lot up within the last half hour or so.something else that confused me and wasn't answered at the end was that Ediths mothers ghost warns her at the beginning of the movie to beware of Crimson Peak. No where in the movie did it explain how she was connected which i think if this was explained or if she was in someway connected to crimson peak, this should have been explained.I also believe they could of explained more about crimson peak during the start of the movie, which just dragged on, and those women who died there. There was a bit of information shared however again not until much later on in the movie.The movie was also predictable, the incest which wasn't 'discovered' until the end of the movie was made quite obvious at the start along with many others i wont go into.overall not the best movie i have watched this year and i think they could have done a much better job with it.",Crimson Peak
281,CyclopsKnowsBest24,"Great visuals, directing, and solid acting... The story is it's weakest link",7,20 October 2015,"""Crimson Peak"" (2015) has almost everything that can make a movie a masterpiece. Guillermo del Toro has made a return to form after his last underwhelming film, ""Pacific Rim"" (2013). While that film made a decent impact at the box office it lacked heart, originality, and talented actors who made the most of their roles. ""Crimson Peak,"" however, shows that del Torro still has magic left in his hands to craft beautifully haunting scenery and images.Throughout the film, the audience is shown dark Gothic scenery mixed with vivid colors. These contrasts constantly catch the eye, making it hard to take your eyes off of any scene. ""Crimson Peak"" is one of the few films in recent years that knows how to use outstanding set pieces and mix them with brilliant colors, and beautiful cinematography.The visual aesthetics aren't the only thing great about this film. The four lead actors are captivating in their emotions and motives. Mia Wasikowska is an actress who I've only seen in one other film, Tim Burton's ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010). Honestly at the time, I wasn't impressed with her, so I had my concerns that she could pull off the leading lady role in ""Crimson Peak."" She ended up making the perfect Edith with her ability to emote joy, sorrow, innocence, and more. I was amazed at her performance, and I expect bright things in her future.The two male actors, Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam, do a great job at being romantic interests. Tom Hiddleston's character is more developed and complex then Hunnam's, but Hunnam holds his own with what little time he has.Jessica Chastain steals the show as Lucille, however, proving yet again that she can take any role complex or not and deliver a solid performance. Seeing how well she changes and develops from the first act to the last act truly took someone of her emotional caliber to perform that way. It'd be hard to picture another actress in that role after Chastain's viciously cold performance.Despite having great visuals and acting, ""Crimson Peak"" does fall flat in its storytelling. If you have watched many Gothic types of film, or are an avid film watcher, like myself, you can see what's coming a mile away. The plot is very predictable, and though it flows nicely, it isn't at all shocking or surprising in the way in wants to be. I could easily figure out what would happen next, which took away from the shock value and frightening scenarios.Despite that flaw, ""Crimson Peak"" delivers on entertaining and well filmed cinema. It may have a ""been there done that"" approach, but it is solid entertainment. In the end, isn't that why we go to the movies? My movie recommendations: If you liked it: Edward Scissorhands (1990), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) If you didn't like it: The Sixth Sense (1999), The Others (2001), Scream (1996)",Crimson Peak
282,lindashadowland,Kept my interest,8,5 April 2020,"I purposely didn't come here to read reviews or its rating because it just sounded good and I didn't want to be influenced. I'm glad I didn't because some of you really hated on this movie. I thought it was very visually striking throughout and I thought the performances were very good. Yes, it was predictable, but it was still a lot of fun along its ghosty way. If you want a mildly scary but worthy movie to watch while in quarantine this is a winner.",Crimson Peak
283,polinka,Not what I expected,6,28 October 2015,"First of all, I LOVED ""Pan's Labyrinth"", enjoyed ""Hellboy"", not so much the other movies, but hoped that this one is going to be gorgeous and imaginative as the first, given the theme and actors. I don't like horror movies in general,- unless they are smart and not done for the gore and blood,- so I thought 'Crimson peak' will answer that requirement of mine as well. It was quite disappointing: I could guess from the start the plot development, the brother/sister thing (I think it was so obvious that the protagonist,Edith, should have been very dumb not to see it, and she was portrayed at the beginning as smart). The visuals were beautiful:the outfits, the house, the people are attractive,the bloody images were more disturbing than scary. But my main problem was with the story: Nothing was surprising. And I didn't care about any of the characters. Acting: J.Chastain is the best of them (I think she is one of the best actresses we have now),doing a very nice job, being quite creepy during the movie (not at the end, which was SO predictable); T.Hiddleston was OK,not more than that, and I think he was wasted here; M.Wasilkowska was OK too,but I must admit that I am not a fan (note:gorgeous costumes and hair style for her); C.Hannam looked good... but I thought that he is not convincing in his character. Summery:If you never watched a Gothic romance, or G.Del Toro movie before, you will enjoy it. But from the Master of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" I expected much more.",Crimson Peak
284,Merang0,Has the scariest VFX ghosts I've ever seen in my life!,10,17 October 2015,"Guillermo del Torro's Gothic ""Crimson Peak"" is not what I thought, but a million times better!!! This movie has the scariest and best VFX ghosts I've ever seen in my life! The Victorian sets will make a Designer giggle with delight and make you wonder how on earth they accomplished such magnificence - I couldn't tell where a practical set ended and where the VFX began, it's that seamless. I cannot see this film not get an Oscar nomination with a possible win for its luscious sets and maybe even an Oscar nod to its Costumes, because really, the sets are exquisitely gorgeous and the Costumes are superb. The performances and settings do give you the feel of old black & white movies, such as ""Wuthering Heights"" with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier, ""Jane Eyre"" with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine, ""Rebecca"" with Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, and ""The Innocents"" with Deborah Kerr and Peter Wyngarde, and if you like the aforementioned, then you will be thrilled with this movie. Keep in mind it will make you scream and cover your eyes and it does have some gory and gruesome as hell visual effects that will no doubt make you sleep with the light on the night after you see it. The sex scenes are a tiny bit risqué, but for the most part, the R rating is because of the gore. I'm not gonna mention any story bits, because this one is fun to figure out for yourself.

285,TheMaster01,Another disappointment from Del Toro,4,26 February 2016,"What works for 'Crimson Peak' is the fact that aesthetically, it looks great. Everything within the film's mansion was constructed purely for the film, and I'll be damned if it doesn't feel genuine and authentically spooky. A house where red clay seeps through the walls and floor as if it were alive and bleeding. The art direction is excellent as is the costume design, headed by Kate Hawley, provides a real classic, brooding, Gothic feel. It's just such a shame that Del Toro and Robbins' writing is so incredibly silly, plain and devoid of any humour. Running off a plot concerning two mysterious siblings (Tom Hiddleston and a sadly miscast Jessica Chastain) who seek to use writer Edith Cushing (a wonderful Mia Wasikowska) for their own elusive plans, Del Toro seems to get wrong everything that Tim Burton gets right, in terms of interesting Gothic-horror-romance story telling. Burton's take on such a tale would be undoubtedly far more interesting.",Crimson Peak

It is interminable. The plot could have been good, but it just goes on and on and on. After a while, the ghosts are a big yawn. It starts pretty well, while we have a plucky heroine. Much is made of her writing, but eventually this just disappears into the cold, red sludge, along with all her personality. I kept thinking, this looks amazing, I love gothic stuff, I adore Jane Eyre, I really liked Del Toro's previous work, so why is this totally failing to engage me? I really wanted to like this. But it's definitely a ""meh"" from me.",Crimson Peak
287,Seraphima12,"Beautiful start, upside down middle and confusing end",5,6 May 2018,"My judgement is purely based on the screenplay I read not the movie itself. But what I have read from the movie synopsis it seems they somewhat deviated from the story while making it. The story starts beautifully - interesting female protagonist, Edith, her father - self-made businessman, Boston society. Then it gets confusing with each turn as Edith who is a clever, educated and aspiring, suddenly becomes somewhat dumb and starry eyed and falls for the antagonist too easily - Mr. Sharp. Then her father turns into an antagonist too... Being a woman several scenes stood out as not quite true or believable - one is when Mr. Sharp comes to Edith at night asking her to join him to the Ball, when couple of hours before she refused to go there with her father. From being in her pyjamas and writing away her book she suddenly transported to the Ball, all beautifully dressed and stuns everyone with her dance... In real life try to get a woman out of her pyjamas and into the Ball... Good luck, I would say, as women need lots of time to prepare. I also found it not very believable when her father would not show her the papers that he discovered about Mr. Sharp but instead keeps it secret and pays Sharp to leave and also break her heart too. Not quite the character that was portrayed in the beginning of the story. Personally, I think there was no need for any ghosts at all, as Edith discovers the truth by finding clothes and albums of previous women who stayed at the castle and were murdered, so she is able to understand what has happened and will happen to her. Doctor suddenly becoming alive in the basement also is unrealistic and does not serve any purpose... The end is also very confusing - Edith gets out saying she decided to live but she never gave an impression of a person who did not want to live... I believe it could have been such a wonderful story but somehow it was lost to maybe 'too many cooks' and a wish to make a horror movie out of it. What a pity.",Crimson Peak
288,AudreyAwesome,Disappointed movie and wasted potential,5,17 October 2015,"I was looking forward to this movie, and was really disappointed. Here are my reasons for my 5/10 rating.1. The acting was poor. I think Jessica Chastain was honestly the best one, and Tom Hiddleston was fine, but Mia OH MY. She felt so wooden and she just didn't give good emotion. She just really didn't seem that scared either. It was like ""oh well, I suppose I should get out of this house now."" Charlie wasn't that great either. I'm wondering if the acting though was due to the next issue.2. Terrible script/dialogue. Some of it just downright didn't make any sense and it was utterly cringe worthy. It was terrible delivery. Another thing that I definitely cringed at and found strange was at the house when she thought she saw someone. She was calling out for Thomas' sister and then when Thomas came in she said she saw someone. When he asked her if it was his sister, she said ""no it wasn't her."" She couldn't even see who it was so how would she know if it was her or not? Stupid.3. Predictable plot. I actually could have gotten past the first two gripes, but the plot pretty much ruined. I pretty much saw everything coming.Out of all of this though, I did find it touching that .In the end, so disappointing! Could have been a great movie but it wasn't. What a wasted use of potential and probably the most disappointing movie this year that I have seen. It is sad to see a movie that could have been great fall to mediocrity.",Crimson Peak

290,dhti,looks great but terrible story,4,18 October 2017,Would be better without sound. The decor is stunning but the script is abdominal. The script is similar to all other horror movie clichés. When you are in a life threatening situation always stay in the easily escapable situation and shout: who is there?. I don't believe the average human being would act in that way.

292,Deigues,Del Toro returns to form with stylish Gothic tale,7,25 February 2016,"The latest film by Guillermo Del Toro proves to be a return to the director's roots as he brings us a harrowing Gothic tale set in late 19th century America.""Crimson Peak"" tells the story of Edith Cushing, a bright and well- educated young woman who's struck by a terrible family tragedy. Now heir to her father's fortune, Edith soon marries a young English aristocrat named Thomas Sharpe and moves in, with him and his sister, to their mansion. As it must be, things quickly take an eerie turn, when Edith begins to believe something sinister also inhabits the house.Del Toro himself came out in defense of ""Crimson Peak"" reminding audiences that the film's more of a Gothic romance than a horror film. It definitely feels like one; almost a throwback to the Gothic films of the 60's with Vincent Price, Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing - If Edith's last name isn't a nod to this British actor I don't know what is. Either way, one can see where Del Toro's coming from, particularly when taking into account the rest of his work. He's a filmmaker who's excelled in the fantasy genre, often with horrific elements – films like ""Cronos"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" and his towering masterpiece ""Pan's Labyrinth"".""Crimson Peak"" feels like a true Del Toro film and it's a welcome addition to his portfolio after the ""Pacific Rim"" misfire. However, although the atmosphere is truly eerie and filled with breathtaking visuals, some of its story elements feel watered down. It also feels particularly unfortunate when such a talented and imaginative director as Del Toro uses a clichéd trope like jump scares to frighten the audience. ""Crimson Peak"" has more than enough elements to be terrifying, but when you catch it setting up the jump scare you can't help but feel disappointed by the film's lack of confidence in itself.""Crimson Peak"" might not be a modern horror classic like ""The Babadook"" or ""It Follows"" but it doesn't need to. It's still a true Gothic tale, with a genuinely creepy atmosphere and beautiful visuals.",Crimson Peak
293,LifeVsArt,Del Toro's gorgeous beast,10,24 October 2015,"""Crimson Peak"" is a beautiful, melancholy, grotesque dream/nightmare; it's a true hybrid, a blend of Gothic romance, horror and fairy tale - the Brontes and Hitchcock, and much much more, all filtered through a wonderfully crazy Mexican genius. I do feel del Toro has created a new breed of beast, comprised of many different parts, a kind of Frankenstein monster, but gorgeous and feminine, tragic and beautiful, unique and multi-layered. The acting by Wasikowska, Hiddelston and Chastain is absolutely first rate - it's melodrama, as in classic Hollywood, but not maudlin or cartoonish, the actors still manage to be naturalistic and not come off artificial; they're both dramatic and subtle (beautiful work). The characters, representing the polarities of love/fear, past/future, transformation and decay, and the tension between, are archetypes, but, at the same time, they're complex individuals and profoundly human – they must choose their own destiny.What I feel is often missing these days, with all the formula, box- checking approach to movies, is real individuality - Crimson Peak is the full expression of a creative artist, it's not following trends or determined by committees; it's one person bringing multiple talents together to express a vision. This film is visually fantastic, romantic and hallucinatory, tragic and outrageous - it creates its own ""logic"" within a waking-dream reality.A film like this, that blends genres, can bring out many different responses - it's not clearly, obviously, one thing, meeting one set of expectations, but if one approaches it with an open mind, engaging the imagination, it will resonate deeply long after viewing.",Crimson Peak

295,parrishcub,"""More ambiance; less substance,"" said Picard to Data (predicting Crimson Peak).",3,19 October 2015,"CRIMSON PEAK A Review by JP October 19, 2015""BE—WAREof Crimson Peak,"" said the raspy-voiced black skele-ghost lady. I thought she was speaking to the terrified little girl Edith who would grow up to be played by Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland, Stoker), but sadly, the better-than-average CG apparition was warning the audience. Perhaps releasing 2 amazing trailers 6-8 months before the feature's release built hype a little too much. In the end, the seemingly-twisted Gothic tale with specters was not-so-surprising after all. It was not necessarily disappointing, but with all the ambiance, it lacked substantive balance.With solid performances by the obvious antagonists Tom Hiddleston (Thor, Muppets Most Wanted) & Jessica Chastain (Mama, Zero Dark Thirty) as well as Mia's struggle to give her character some depth, Guillermo del Toro's highly-anticipated-by-horror-aficionados-visual-gasm offered about 70% of what the trailer advertised. Visually, it was quite stunning. Aside from that, it was ""The Others"" (2001) meets ""Dial M for Murder"" (1951), but not nearly as good as either title. The gore was anything but implied and the editorial choices left perfect opportunities to insert an endless array of riffs. Those 2 ideas may differ, but expectation & delivery of this 2-hour tale also contradicted.Hollywood markets mostly for the 18-25 year-old range, so I am surprised ""Crimson"" got any kind of green light not being a .25-found-footage or cut-&-paste-86-the-soul remake. I salute Universal for that, but if you want to see a visual feast from renowned director Guillermo del Toro, see ""Pan's Labyrinth"". My best compliment: the choice to have the pretty 100th-anniversary Universal Pictures logo in blood red. Nice work there.",Crimson Peak
296,ixtlan,What a Waste of Acting Talent,5,7 October 2018,"There is some really good acting in an otherwise horrible script. Yes the sets and costumes were amazing. Jessica Chastain was brilliant as the possessive sister of Tom Hiddleston's Thomas Sharpe. But she had some awesomely tough plot turns that worked against her. She had so little good dialogue to work with. There is absolutely no way even someone as stupid as the Edith Cushing character (Mia Wasikowska) is going to sign away her wealth, at that particular point in the movie. Why did Del Toro even think that was going to work? Maybe he was trying to emphasize the psychological horror of Edith's predicament. I wondered why have the story even go there? Learning not to drink the tea is one thing (we got it: Rosemary's Baby), but to then go ahead and eat the porridge when we all know that's poisoned too. It's just too obvious. And then to have to work with the plot device of having Lucille leave the rest of her keys on the tea tray, knowing that Edith stole one, was too much for me to believe. I kept losing my suspension of disbelief over and over and having to find it again to get back into the movie. Very distracting. He also chose two completely wooden actors to play the sympathetic leads. I don't think Wasikowska knew at all how to make Edith believable. Charlie Hunnam as Dr. Alan was marginably better. For me, the violence overshadowed any subleties and interesting philosophical questions Del Toro might have raised. The final two lines, ""Ghosts? They never go away,"" were intriguing. But the questions that could be inspired by the last assertion were not in the least way explored in the movie. It is a waste of a final statement. I came away thinking, Huh? What exactly happened in this movie? Why did it happen? Do I care about Edith? She's stupid and careless. And she's freakishly strong for a woman on death's door. This was a gorgeous movie in a visual sense, and had good horror for the sake of horror, but not of the calibre of say a Cronenberg or Hitchcock. It might seem that Del Toro built the sets and ghosts, loved them so much, and then just tried to fit in a story, with any old horror trope, and hope we wouldn't notice. Well I noticed and was disappointed.",Crimson Peak
297,byStevenRamirez,A Movie for Another Time,8,19 February 2017,"Don't get me wrong—I liked this movie from the great Guillermo del Toro, a filmmaker I have admired since his amazing 'Pan's Labyrinth.' And similar to that film, 'Crimson Peak' is beautifully crafted, like the china teacup Lucille uses to serve Edith her questionable tea. Unlike del Toro's earlier effort, though, this movie felt distant and terribly formal to me—the Noble Style vs. a rollicking square dance. And, speaking of dances, there was no better scene to illustrate this aloofness than the one in which Thomas waltzes with Edith in front of her father.To me, the best horror is visceral, not mannered. Referring back to the Hollywood classics of the 1930s, 'Crimson Peak' felt closer to 'Wuthering Heights' than 'Frankenstein.' Sure, we get to see abominable CG apparitions, but even they are distant. They never really engage with Edith in a way that would induce sheer terror in a cultured young woman. Of course, I realize they are there to WARN her, rather than scare her. But still  By now, movie audiences have been exposed to such fare as 'Saw,' 'The Human Centipede' and 'House of 1000 Corpses.' Pretty hardcore stuff, don't you think? To my way of thinking, resurrecting Gothic horror was a bit of a risk for everyone involved. Why did they do it?I've seen a lot of horror movie devices over the years, but never clay. Usually, desolate places like Cumberland are filled with moors floating in a dense white mist. But clay? This didn't really work for me. Sure, it was red and resembled blood, but . They never really DID anything with it—even when they had their chance in the cellar, which held huge wooden vats of the stuff. Maybe those scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. And as long as we're talking about missed opportunities, what about Edith's so-called writing? She managed to bang out one story and never really writes another word during the rest of the film. Okay, the movie is not about her writing, but the story would have worked just as well without it.'Crimson Peak' did not do well at the box office. As of this writing (April 2016), it has earned $75M worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, with a production budget of $55M. Compare that to Warner Bros.' 2013 hit 'The Conjuring,' which to date has grossed $318M worldwide, with a production budget of $20M. To me, 'Crimson Peak' was a movie for another audience in another time.In the trailer, the quote ""Gorgeous and terrifying—it electrified me"" is attributed to Stephen King. Terrifying? Really? Come on, Steve. I can't imagine that anything short of an alligator chewing your fingers off one at a time would be terrifying to you. And certainly not this movie. Disturbing, yes—especially concerning the twisted relationship between Thomas and Lucille. Henry James would be proud. As I said, I liked 'Crimson Peak' but, sadly, I went into the thing wanting to love it.",Crimson Peak
298,BloodGuts,"Frankenstein, Dracula, The Woman in Black, Crimson Peak",8,28 October 2015,"Guillermo Del Toro doesn't make terrifying ghost stories, instead creating beautiful masterpieces that unfold in what can only be described as dark fairy tales. From 'Pan's Labyrinth' to 'The Devil's Backbone', Del Toro has a fantasy for Gothic storytelling that is matched by no-one.Crimson Peak is no exception and from its period characters to the derelict household, everything about this film screams from an era of horror that has been iconic ever since.When brother and sister Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) and Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) arrive on US shores, they come seeking finance in a last ditch attempt for funding of Thomas' revolutionary clay mining machine. Complicating matters further is Thomas' charm with his potential investors daughter, Edith (Mia Wasikowska). Not content with an offer above any other, Thomas pursues Edith until he claims her as his wife.Upon their return to England, Edith, now Mrs Sharpe, learns of the namesake she inherits and the curse that comes with it as they arrive in the ghastly Crimson Peak is a masterpiece to behold and is rich with Gothic detail. Del Toro may have hit his commercial peak with 'Pans Labyrinth' but what he has achieved with this movie is an oil painting that is as representative of his own work as it is of his inspiration.It truly is a beauty to watch with every corner of Allerdale Hall gloriously detailed in rich history and colour, something that you wouldn't perhaps associate with a ghostly tale. With a resurgence in Victorian ghost stories in recent cinema, it's no surprise that 'Crimson' doesn't quite pack the punch it should in terms of scares and storytelling but then again, the modern classics of 'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' that made big budget horror a box office smash, this ghost story pits itself firmly in that category of films.The trio of leading stars are sensational and their ranks in Hollywood royalty are well earned here. Wasikowska delivers a familiar turn as the frail victim and Hiddleston's charm is on show in droves but it is Chastain whose dark cynicism casts a shadow over any sign of happiness in this tale. There's something unnerving every time she appears on screen that only adds to the drama unfolding between the web of on screen relationships.Everything from the ghastly apparitions to the lead cast prove that horror can be as enchanting as it is haunting and for fans of Guillermo Del Toro's growing repertoire of films, will know what to expect from the start. Yet despite the predictable nature, it doesn't make the journey any less enjoyable. Each of the pacing hallways hosts a haunt that is creative to look at and further detail is hidden in the walls as the attention to detail mean a companion book is a must. Throughout the layers of this mansion lie secrets to behold and the bittersweet tale once again, that Del Toro is the author of the grandest of fairy tales.",Crimson Peak

300,Sebastianostlund,Is Guillermo del Toro the new M. Night Shyamalan?,5,27 October 2015,"I think that Guillermo del Toro is a director that started of really strong, with some really unique horror movies and a beautiful eye for details and story telling... and now, well he still got a great eye for details but his stories and the god awful CGI he uses in every new movie he makes is all average or below average. Okey, Pacific Rim is an exception on the CGI part but it's not a good movie, at least not in my opinion. Crimson peak is one of his worst movies. First of all it's not a horror movie, it's a love story with some horror thrown in there and it's a bad love story. The falling in love part is so rushed that you don't get or feel any emotions from the characters, well the actors do the best job they can with what they have to work with but the dialogs are painful to listen to at most parts. It feels like you have seen it all before, there is nothing unique in how the story is told or how it unfolds. I don't think you have to be a movie fan to see the twists in this movie from miles away, that's how bad it's written and it's sad because it really had potential. Not every movie has to be the new next thing but this feels like a copy and paste, you have seen it all before and i must point out the awful CGI effects, when you can tell that the ghosts are made in a computer then it's not scary anymore! I know i said that it's not a horror movie, but it actually tries to use some jump scares and they all fail. I wasn't scared at all, i could have seen this movie alone in a cabin out in the woods and i wouldn't have been frightened buy it... It's sad to say this but Guillermo you have lost one fan here, i have been disappointed to many times now and spent to much of my hard worked money to be treated with all this mediocrity...5/10...",Crimson Peak

303,istvandragos,A movie ruined by its marketing and lack of good story,4,31 December 2015,"The movie was marketed as a horror that will scare the you know what out of you, well we got everything, but just not a horror movie. As it was mentioned in the movie and Guillermo del Toro said it too:it's a story with ghosts, not a ghost story. They could've said this from the beginning,this way at least the audience wouldn't have walked out with a sour face. The final product that we got is a Gothic romance, which is a genre that doesn't really have such a big mass appeal, most likely that's the reason why they marketed it as a straight forward horror movie. It could've been forgiven all this confusing marketing, but the problem is that the movie is not as great as many would've hopped. Being the return of Guillermo del Toro to the genre that made him such a big name in Hollywood, many had high expectations. del Toro's visiual style is all over the movie, every set piece is wonderfully crafted, the costumes are great, the ghosts are (almost) great, but the movie lacks a good story that can keep the viewer thrilled. Every bit of the story is very predictable and the movie teases way too obviously its ending. The twists are kind of recycled, they are way too familiar, especially to those who are watching dozens of movies and TV shows. There are some characters who seem to be a last minute addition to the story, in the beginning they are teased as if they are going to have a great contribution to the story, but they are never used properly, thus there are some scenes that seem random and out of place. Despite all this Jessica Chastian still manages to pull of a decent performance that is pretty creepy, probably she's the only thing other than the set pieces that can make the movie bearable. In conclusion the movie is a disappointment from director Guillermo del Toro, he's focusing way too much on the visual aspects and bringing homages to the Gothic genre. Those who have interest in this genre may find the movie interesting, but the others will find it hard to sit through it",Crimson Peak
304,bojopm,The Brits outshine the Americans on every level,9,3 July 2020,"This film has incredible gore sequences, the sink scene in particular is a very amazing sight. I think the characters were realistic, especially as they tended to have a lot of characteristics people from their countries tend to have. The main character for example was an overly ambitious author stuck in a fairy tale magical land of her imagination and her father had no ambition or recognised any great potential when he saw something unless it was similar to an invention that already exists, which is very American I feel as Americans don't tend to have much creativity compared to Brits.I also thought the ghost of the main character's mother was very sexy because she was a lovely white woman, to me it doesn't matter how decayed or old a white woman gets, she'll always be beautiful in my eyes so yes her mother's ghost was a very good treat for my love sack.I also think Thomas' sister is arguably the sexiest character ever so I can see how her and her brother ended up having the relationship they did. The Brits in this film, Thomas and his sister really did put the Americans in their place and outshone them on every level, Thomas Sharpe was a very complex highly intelligent character which paid a tribute to the British gentleman of the 19th Century and whilst he has a lot of ambition, unlike the main character he knows the limits of his ambition and doesn't let his ambition drive him insane or to a fictional world which only exists in his mind.My only disappointment in this film was that I wanted Thomas and his sister to hug each other and look after one another in the final scene of this film to show that they live happily ever after, as I feel those two characters were born for each other.",Crimson Peak

And now, after seeing the film, all remains with me is just a disappointment with a shock of such talented director's choice over a very empty story line with a poor dialougues. There's no need to mention beautiful visuals, clothing and places in the film, and the atmospheric shots. they are all there as you'd expect them to be from a Del toro's style in film making, but oh my! what a boring , predictable story. it's a very good choice of casting, too. However everything feels like happening in rush. there's nothing proper shown the love development either.

I have enjoyed most of Guillermo Del Toro's work. Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece, while the Devil's Backbone is clever ghost story and Cronos is an easy-to-watch fun movie. Hellboy II actually has a lot more to it than your standard action film. Sadly, this film cannot even surpass Pacific Rim in its campy fun. It was borderline unwatchable at a lot of points. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston seemed to be trying, but their characters were a drag to watch. Even the gore was unsatisfying. However, in fairness, once the revelation in the second half happens, it does get pretty funny to watch in a detached sort of way for a solid fifteen-twenty minutes, and Jessica Chastain does do a good job of at least being entertaining. If you like special effects, monsters or gore, those are the best parts of the film, but it's such a drag to get there. I think the only reason I gave this a 4 and not a 3 is that Guillermo directed it and I sort of see what he was going for.
However, you should watch literally any of his other movies, Pan's Labyrinth is his best movie, but the Devil's Backbone and Cronos are worth watching.",Crimson Peak

The ghosts are a bit gimmicky but are also outward symbols of her inner torment, which works for me. The ending had me at the edge of my seat when the secrets of her husband and his sister are revealed and climaxes into an epic fight, not epic for being gruesome, because its not, but epic because of struggle to kill one another.

But why was it all squandered on gore and a loose, watered-down interpretation, if not plagiarism, of significant parts of all of the following: Misery, The Shining, The Others, and even the Woman in Black (strictly for the isolation, to me)? I feel there's too much character action without any character depth or development, especially in the case of Edith's friend, played by Charlie Hunham, except for Thomas. All the character development that does happen is shut out till the end, but not for a plot twist- just affirmation. There was more character development in the side characters than amongst the main, all put together. The gore was unnecessary not for the genre but for what they made you expect from the trailer. There is no hint of it except for the hilariously brightly red clay everywhere. By the way, as a metaphor, that would have been such a funny departure if they explained in depth what the clay was to represent.But on the whole, it was too contrived, and all the good and great acting in the world, and all the cute dogs in the world, and all the pretty imagery in the film, could not further a story that is 1) being retold and a) poorly so.

318,mommyplum,"Should have been good, ruined by wide plotholes",3,13 March 2021,"How much did I want to love this movie? A lot. How much did I like it when I saw it? Barely. I'll start with the little bit of positive - visually, it's gothicly gorgeous. Lush fabrics, dark manses, snowfall against stark backdrops, twisting hallways, phantoms, beeswax warm candlelight in dim rooms rich with wood paneling. When I saw the original trailers, I thought it would be just my kind of film. Then I watched it and felt bamboozled into a mess of a plot that asks the viewer to suspend all common sense, reason and thought. We are introduced to heiress Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) as a child menaced by the creepy spectre of her recently dead and much loved mother and this is moment one I can't understand - why on earth is the ghost of a mother so loved and loving a terrifying visage? Why would she appear in a form to scare the wits out of her child? Then we jump to Edith all grown into an educated, sensible and insightful adult...who inexplicably ends up falling for shady stranger Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) after knowing him for about 35 seconds of dancing. Hmmm, sure, totally believable. Even when the father she loves and trusts tries to warn her off, shortly before being found dead under dicey circumstances, she persists in her infatuation, marries Sharpe and heads off to his estate in England about half a heartbeat after she's seen her father properly buried. And did I mention she also does this over the pleas of her childhood friend (a hotty with a crush on her) Charlie Hunnam, playing Dr. Alan McMichael? This sensible and smart young woman doesn't take even two moments to wonder why everyone she cares about is telling her to run? Nope. Then she gets to Sharpe's home, also populated by his disagreeable sister Lady Lucille (Jessica Chastain), and it has massive holes in the roof. Like the size of school buses. Another idiot plot point I hate - first off we are to believe Edith would just shrug and say, sure, seems legit, and two, that she wouldn't immediately insist on using the funds she actually has to make repairs? Because it's winter and basically if this was the real world everyone in the stupid mansion would freeze from exposure no matter how many fires they lit and all the wood would become rotted in a month and fall through. Also, there are no servants in this giant house. None. Not a one. Edith, a woman who grew up with every privilege and comfort and a house with the staff she would expect neither notices nor asks. Yet, everything in the mansion seems to get done - towels in the bathrooms, linens on the beds, candles, fires lit, etc. Seriously, it can't be Lucille doing all this, no one person could, and Edith isn't doing it. So, how is it happening? Never explained. Further, from day one, Edith spends most of her time alone in the desolate mansion and doesn't see Lucille or her husband anywhere for 20 hours a day, everyday, and never asks where they are. Sure. Then we come to the plot reveals - Lucille and Thomas have been having an incestuous relationship since they were adolescents and cooked up this scheme as adults to have Thomas marry rich heiresses with few relatives and lots of money, then kill them for the cash. They've done it before Edith several times. Yet, they still have no money currently despite all their huge windfalls and live inside a broken mansion with nearly no roof? Were they burning the cash from their previous kills in the fireplaces? I know we are to believe they've been putting a lot into Thomas' strange scheme to restart the family business, but doesn't it defy reason to think they didn't at least use the huge sum of money from killed wives one or two or even three to fix the place they live? Maybe replace a few carpets damaged by, oh, the snow and rain falling on them from the open roof? It's dumb. Lucille is revealed as the killer of Edith's father (Edith actually seems shocked to find out her father didn't just, oh, smash his own head straight through a 6 inch porcelain sink by accident - absurd) and then Lucille kills Thomas when they argue over Edith's fate. Edith's handsome friend from back home arrives, but stupidly brings no back up with him when he thinks she's in mortal danger. Why?? He's injured in short order, rendering him unable to save Edith and eventually Edith is aided momentarily by Thomas' ghost to dispatch a crazed Lucille. Later Edith and Alan leave the Sharpe mansion together and Lucille is now a ghost trapped there.In conclusion, I spent most of my time watching just yelling angrily at the screen over all the ridiculousness and it absolutely ruined the whole thing for me. If you don't much care for the quality of plotting, watch it for the visual pleasure. If you're like me and plotting and sense matter, skip it and save yourself the frustration.",Crimson Peak

321,purplehayes76,Like reading a Gothic novel,8,20 October 2015,"I want to see it again to digest the film.I could write much, and keep on reading about this film. But I won't retread what others have said.This film does reward a person who can see it in a specific lens. That is from Gothic/Romantic Novels and stylized Hollywood films such as REBECCA, NOTORIOUS, GASLIGHT, etc.It is a love note to the Gothic novel (and by extension Gothic film). It is a beautiful thing to watch it tick all the right boxes. It wasn't about surprise, it was about execution (perhaps literally, hehe).It did feel as if I was reading a novel visually, and I don't think I have quite had that experience with a film. As in a novel, there were moments in the theater that I wanted to go back and ""re-read"" what had just happened, especially as there are such subtle emotional shifts in the beginning that carry as much weight as action.That in itself gave the exhilaration of a ""page turner"".Something as small as a glance, or a social slight becomes like a shot gun blast when you are used to that restraint of convention in the Gothic novel.Watching the opening sequences were as delicious as reading Wuthering Heights or Agnes Grey or Ethan Frome for the first time. I really enjoyed Edith Cushing's character (Edith Wharton gloss, perhaps?). I got who she was very clearly, and I was on her team.Thomas is a worthy and sympathetic Byronic hero. The moral weight of his choices and thinking through the ""what ifs"" with him, and mentally trying to fill in all the back story that is elliptically told, becomes part of the sad fun of watching the film.The house is pitch perfect.Lucille transforms visually and symbolically according to Gothic/Romantic archetypes.Was just great fun to watch, and I enjoyed that it committed to the genre in ways that did not feel compromised for Hollywood/mass audience.I did feel there was a little too much reliance on some ""visual quoting"" or narrative borrowing from some sources that it is clearly alluding to (such as Hitchcock's NOTORIOUS), but I could forgive it.If you are Bronte/lit nerd, Crimson Peak is like visiting an amusement park.",Crimson Peak
322,mcmvision,This is not a good ghost story...,6,1 February 2016,"... but a very good and mysterious love story. If you were looking for a creepy ghost story, you were fooled by the ads, because this movie is not scary, is not horror, and the few times the ghosts appear looks like bad CGI. This movie would be a wonderful dark, period, mysterious love story with a twisty third act, but no, there has to be ghosts that ruin the whole thing. I really like ghost stories, and i was expecting some horror from the director, but it was really not necessary to bring in the supernatural in this complex love story. So, on the horror part the movie is a big fail. On the romantic and thriller part it is a good movie. Just ignore the ghosts and you will see a good movie. Just like the title character says about her novel: It is a love story that happens to have ghosts in it. Besides the supernatural that ruins a good movie (just like it did in Mama... is there a pattern?) the movie looks stunning. The visuals are haunting (the CGI ghosts not so much). I really loved the chemistry between the 3 main characters. Just like in Mama, the third act is a little bit of a mess. With a little patience you will get through it.

This on the contrary is just a petit guignol gothic melodrama. While it shows that Hiddleston is suited to the saturnine and cadaverous, Jessica Chastain's role as the evil sister is thoroughly overplayed.
But the red skeletons that keep appearing do nothing but make you laugh - they are too shiny and synthetic and ther movements comic in their efforts to scare. What a waste of Dle Toro's imagination - maybe he needs the money - yet he put his name to the script. 
And what on earth is the red liquid underground clay that they pump out - there's not enough story to suggest it's a metaphor for anything - and I've never heard of red sludge there for the digging.
You can't introduce too many random fantasy elements or it fails to dispel the disbelief.

It is supposed to be a quirky, creepy but visually rich story with ghosts in it. The script is so weak that I got the impression of having watched this movie, although it was impossible. There have been so many movies in a haunted house, with 2 perverted siblings, whatsoever, that you immediately get a dejavu. The only surprise (which is not really a surprise if you're a movie nerd) is that the siblings f*ck each other. The rest of the story is very weak. The lines are so lame. No references to anything. You feel like you're reading a badly written children's novel. I'm really not a hater. On the contrary I was very ready to praise this film. I've just read the trivia here and I see that the house was completely designed only for the movie. The costumes were ""blah blah"" fabric. Ms Chastain learned the PIANO for this role?! It took 6 years for the movie to be finally shot, del Toro wrote 12 versions of the script.. All this effort and yet you have a very averagely shot, boring, visually inadequate film. The costumes looked like they were made in 5 minutes, out of curtains. Very sloppily made, not detailed and not suitable for the time period. Even the hair-styling was so bad I sometimes wanted to cry (especially of Edith). The coloring looked like a bad instagram filter, rather than looking artsy and rich. The house was ridiculous. Everything looked plastic and cheap rather than antique and original.. There was nothing interesting in the story. The ghosts SFX looked like something out of a 90s computer game. Really? Such a great illustrator like Toro can work so hard and only come up with ghosts that look like stupid, red, skeleton men? I can understand the need to emphasize color red here, but it was horribly done. And the things that were supposed to look like blood rather looked like goo. Overall it looked like the budget was 10,000 bucks TOPS. From my point of view, Tom, if he's for the first time fallen in love with someone other than his sister, should not have slept with the sister again, after sleeping with Edith. So many details were unanswered for in the script. What good is it that Edith is a story teller? Why, after listening to the recording in the MAIN HALL OF THE HOUSE WHERE EVERYONE WOULD IMMEDIATELY HEAR HER, she leaves everything and runs in the snow? If she is so intellectual, why doesn't she make a nice plan to run away? Why does she even keep eating the food they give her? Blah blah blah.. I'm very sorry but even a 4 is too much for this. It's one of my fav directors, along with 2 actors that I ADORE, the movie is in the genre that I LOVE, and it's still like sh**.Long story short: No one will read this review but if you do, lower the expectations.

326,visualandwriting,Stylish rather than horrific,6,4 March 2016,"Love hurts, especially this unfulfilled. It lays in the steps of a human horror. This has been an inspiration for a Guillermo Del Toro - Crimson Peak a Gothic romance surrounded by a horror elements. Crimson Peak is an originally conducted yet using scheme of a horror. Definitely for viewers that are interesting in experiments and are able to sit through the film even when they have a feeling that have seen it before.Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a daughter of American prominent banker and an aspiring novel writer. One day she meets British baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) that seeks founding for his new machine. Tall, slim travels with his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastein) capture an attention of New York society. Romance flourish and the father doesn't approve it. Turmoil will experience Edith but the feeling will survive but cost payed not in money but emotions.Guillermo Del Toro is a specialist creating fantasy world with bestiary diversity at a high level. When somebody sees his name it indicates movie to have outstanding characters . Crimson Peak aesthetic proves him to be a master in fantastic worlds. Here ghosts, costumes and its surrounding are the best point to fix an eye. The narration does prove anything that differs from what we have seen before. Crimson Peak is more a set to expose the fantastic world of a romance and a horror. Gothic romance is the highlight of the story, tumult emotions and tragedy behind a family. Tears, anger and betrayal. If Your movie taste is not up for romance probability of leaving the screen room rises. Characters deal with a past in a surrounding that is a monster - a house. Magnificent old Gothic house that embodies romantic and tragic love. Has a rotten foundation, that slowly makes it sink ..cold one but is like a living organism. Is set on a hill that is soaked with blood. Breathe the cold winds. As to speak red, black and white elements gives the tension between characters. Gothic costumes what is characteristic for the protagonist. Dark gown of a sister and brother. Mia wore white night gown, colorful. With costume remembering with high collar, tight in waist and heavy or light. Wiktorian corset and boundaries they implies. Edith is dressed with modern styling with puffed shoulders and right colors. White blouses, light hight gown that quickly takes dirt. The red clay that surfaces thorough the snow, and in red colors.Edith Cushing finds herself in a harsh environment. Emerging feminist has also a soft spot for dreamers. Still have the aura of mysticism but eventually the men , he overpower her. Coming from a family without mother she is looking for the emotional connection. One might think that this is weakens, but she survives. This film is a vulnerability and scary combined, shifting the emotional state. The beasts are little but are precise. Proportional to the other elements of movie. Just about right of elements creating a harmonious film. Is conducting the direction smoothly flowing through corridors of lies and mysteries, stumbling upon on horror. It is a dream come true or rather a nightmare. It starts as a sweet dream and wake up sweat in nightmare wondering: was it true? visualandwriting.com",Crimson Peak
327,SoundwaveG1,The Addams family's manor,6,30 October 2015,Basically a movie about an American clairvoyant heiress who marries an English Addams family's son from across the pond all grown up. Not all is as it seems as she begins seeing the undead in the English sibling's old manor and finding clues about several mysteries surrounding the place. The movie was okay for a date movie for Halloween. I thought many of the subplots was predictable. The CGI undead was not that scary at all but probably because I am used to watching rotting Walkers. The ending chapter however gets pretty bloody literally if you enjoy watching blood and gore.,Crimson Peak

We witness a scary movie alike which is not scary at all. The plot twist could make us forget about this but this is not the case.The more Guillermo have from Hollywood, the worse he's getting to. The magic he has is gone and he leaves us with this insipid movie where the only thing you can find attractive is the beauty of photography.The disappointment is so hard that i feel like i could not trust Guillermo again to do what he's capable to.

Crimson Peak is not gore it is not slasher or guts exploding on the screen. It is a period piece dating into the 1800's a ghost story that is bound to be a classic. If you enjoyed the movie Peter Straub's Ghost Story and other ghost story movies such as The Lady in White you will enjoy this movie. It is a thriller with suspense. Since this is a period piece the main character typical of how women carried themselves in that era yes its a bit predictable towards the end but it is no surprise in any thriller as it wraps up. the special effects are creative and the story line captures the viewers interest as everything unravels. The sets in Crimson peak are beautiful with detail, along with beautiful costumes threw out the movie. If you like a classic ghost story that is a thriller then its worth seeing for during the Halloween season.",Crimson Peak
330,sandwichlemon,Absolute Visual Treats,7,20 March 2020,"The first time i seen this movie, i didnt like it that much. I find the story ... good but kind of awkward; in the pacing, the love plot, etc. Though, the ghastly image of the red skeletons lingers very strongly. Not that it was traumatic (maybe, in a sense), but it was a very strong imagery; and unique.Oh, back then i decide to watch this in theater because of Mia and the movie setting. Also, the mystery i think.Years later this movie played at the cable, hence i rewatch it. I find the story more, charming now; and the awkwardness in the love plot more justified.Tldr; i quite like the story, though not so much. Its a very scary one too, aside the ghost. I absolutely love the setting and wardrobes !",Crimson Peak
331,peter-beaves,Really enjoyed the twist at the end,9,30 March 2021,"So what twist, everyone else who has reviewed the film here will ask. Well, the final shot during the credits shows the book of the film's title written by Edith Cushing. So most of the film is in the imagination of Edith. The clues are there if you look for them. She writes a story with ghosts. She's told it needs a love story which she scoffs at but does so anyway in her own macabre way. Yes the story is predictable because she's writing it from her imagination when she has not lived enough in the real world to know any better. Del Toro's imagery of the gothic mansion and goings on are perfect to illustrate a young woman's imagination of things which she has never experienced. Almost everything she imagined came from listening to Thomas Sharpe speaking to her father's company, it's all there. Oh, and the butterflies. And the nightmares of a child. Brilliant, I loved it..",Crimson Peak

I'm not a fan of horror, but this film is more than just cheap thrills riding on tides of gore and moments that make you jump. The story is well written, the plot twists are clever, the visuals are beautifully done and the characters are so empathetically portrayed they have you wanting to know their fate and feeling drawn into their world. Mia as Edith Cushing was a likeable hero and Tom Hiddleston was brilliant as Sir Thomas Sharpe, imparting to his character a sense of depth and complexity which really made this story work. I didn't give this a 10 because I'm simply not a fan of horror, but it saddens me to see the number of trolls posting incredibly negative reviews of this film for ""reasons"" that don't seem quite correct if you've actually seen it. One is left to presume this is similar to the attack on Captain Marvel, heavily trolled because the hero is female (thank goodness the Aliens movies achieved their popularity and reviews before this unfortunate rise of misogynist trolling). Good films like this deserve higher scores and more attention.",Crimson Peak

334,ChristinaBarrett-USA1986,I give it an A+.,10,16 October 2015,"The funniest part I realized was that the girl was in love with the guy, and the sister was crazy and killed him by accident.I most liked the innuendo. It was basically a task well done.If I were to improve it, I would hope the main girl would have a better time. I thought the main girl actress made it worthy of an award. I thought the man was very desirable. The sister was very interesting other than that she was a lunatic murderer. The character must have been a schizo, and the actress portrayed this well. Some people have it in them to do something wrong. It's like the fascination I've seen with Lizzie Borden.The scenery and costumes all looked very good. I liked seeing the snow pour down.The graphics were excellent. I liked seeing the ghosts. I felt most sad to see the also obscure baby ghost and the man turn into a different, see-thru ghost, then vanish and wisp away.The sister killed her brother when he acted like it didn't matter that he broke his promise and fell in love with someone. The main girl was out to get the sister for all she did, a murderer, mostly for revenge for her father. The brother was a lost soul, willing to connect with the girl but tossed aside by all, like a mistake in the wind.It didn't make me cry to see the guy disappear. If anything would, I think it'd be that. I was just so flabbergasted.If I like anyone, it's the brother. I liked the girls as actors, too, tho. He must have gone schizo with the sister's reminder of why they needed to kill people to save their own lives. I didn't catch what their other option would be. What's wrong with the main girl is she wanted to kill the man she loved before the sister did, for revenge for her father, assuming him to be ""something he's not."" Something about the main girl trying to kill her husband was funny, like she just wanted to kill and didn't really know why, rather than have him love her. She didn't say anything to him about that she was killing him in self- defense.What I didn't like was the way they acted like tho the main guy were so romantic that the girl ends up with him as an mystery and an enigma and she turns to the other guy like the 1st guy didn't even matter. The 2nd guy was exciting but rather crass, a lot like the problems with the father.I feel a problem with this film is it put on the pedestal the girl actress being cattled away like an American because she's Polish-Australian, while the English actors show off like they're more European and she's the kind of European as Americans, when most people there aren't exactly always treated like that. You -can- ""judge"" our ethnicities but not our countries/""nationalities.."" I talk about this kinda stuff sometimes every day on my blog. I know that I'm 1/2 American and I've felt there's a scale. America is on one end, and Europe is on the other. Everything else is in between.I could go on and on about this like I used to with Sweeney Todd and find out more things than the director nor actors even know. I wonder if they realized that the dude was treated like he was worthless. Who was really worthless, the father or the husband? I'm not saying either has to be just to make one so.I know movies leave a lot to be desired and are rather halfway there, if that. It was a little depressing and downbeat. Imagine if Tim Burton co-directed this. The music was not a big thing, neither. I was a music major for a year or so. They seemed too uncomfortable to be close. All in all, they did what they could and I rated this movie a 100+%. If I played someone, I'd chose the main character. The sister is too crazy and halfway there. She's like one of those crazy people, a rare thing to encounter. She comes at you from the background and turns out not to be right in the head. It's sorta the opposite of a bad guy sidekick who seems to turn out to be nice. I realize the sister must be more dynamic, but what she did that was uncalled for was just not interesting to me. It might send an interpretation-called-for message to the modern day world outside of the violence, but it seemed unexplained and probably more to it than her just being crazy; I didn't tune in as to what was going on then.",Crimson Peak

There are just too many plot-gaps and the cut doesn't improve that either. Sometimes the plot jumps and misses important emotional developments of the characters. It really seems rushed in many places. Sometimes even illogical. The best thing about this movie is the scenery, hands down. The pictures are beautiful with vibrant colors and contrasts. You could get every 5 minutes a still that would make an awesome poster. Story would get a 6 from me, scenery a 9 - this sums up to 7 (cause plot is still the most important thing).

336,peterjkh,Beautiful failure,3,11 December 2015,"I like Gothic movies. I like horror stories. But they should be believable. This one was not.It had a lot going for it. The premise was good, the visuals and costumes stunning, and Chastain was marvelous as the evil and insane Lucille Sharpe.But the story made no sense whatsoever. I mean, Edith seems to be a pretty sensible young woman in the beginning of the film. She is well educated, and seems to have inherited a lot of the traits of her father, a self-made millionaire, a no-nonsense man with a lot of common sense.Nevertheless she decided to marry a man she knows practically nothing about and whom her father has warned her for. But OK, let's say that love defies logic. Except, I did not see much love, not much chemistry between the two of them. So why on earth would she marry him? Then he whisks her away to his family mansion – which turns out to be a decrepit crumbling ruin in barren surroundings, with a mining plant right in front of it. Which sensible, rich woman would have stayed there? I would have turned around upon arrival, no way would I have staid to live in such a house.The loving husband seems always absent, he does not even share a bedroom with his beloved bride. Really? How believable is that? And well, the whole thing that was going on between Thomas and Lucille – let's say, that was obvious from the beginning.And although the walls are crumbling, the roof is caved in, the floors are sinking and there is a constant stream of debris falling into the house and the whole interior is constantly exposed to the weather – the house looks immaculate. The room are tidy, clean and neat, the furniture does not seem to be affected by damp or dirt, there is a well-maintained fire in every chimney, and yet there are no servants in the house. So how is this possible? The twisted sister surely did not seem to be running around with mops and dusters, nor did Edith or Thomas. So who did all the housework? The ghosts? Well, if so, they are welcome to come and live with me! Which brings me to the ghosts. Why were they there? They didn't add anything to the story. They were not creepy. They did not do anything. They were completely unnecessary.Well, and the ending... a bit of a mess. Twisted sister seems super human, because after having been stabbed right in the heart, she manages to kill her brother, run outside and start a fight with Edith. Sure. But Edith whacks her with a shovel and that's it.

The acting was good, especially from Jessica Chastain. Unfortunately I believe this movie wasn't marketed correctly. I went into this movie thinking it was a horror movie, it wasn't. Although there were creepy looking ghosts in it, you could have easily taken out the ghosts and the story would have remained exactly the same. The ghosts did nothing to further the story and were there purely for the main character to follow while holding a candle in the middle of the night. There were a few jump scares here and there but overall, there really wasn't anything horror about this movie. And of course, this movie was rife with movie tropes that have been run into the ground by many other TV shows and movies.

339,MarketaN,Love in the almost traditional Gothic horror,7,28 October 2015,"This was highly anticipated film. The director didn't succeeded in fulfilling the expectations of audience and not at all film-critics. Still this picture does not belong to the category of completely useless pictures that you wouldn't enjoy. The art design including costumes, scenery, stylization, camera operating and everything made to satisfy the eye is perfectly done with detail. The topic for it's self must be the house of the Sharp family. The building has its own spirit, which the characters itself unfortunately lack.And characters is the next important thing to talk about. There is quite a top actors basis. Mia Wasikowska representing a young Victorian woman absolutely fits. Tom Hiddleston as the wanted perfect man with dark secrets is a natural choice. And finally the amazing Jessica Chastain showed a perfect performance as the evil sister. She nearly stole the whole spectacle for herself. But still it does not work very well. The main problem is that the relationship between Edith and Thomas is not believable. They lack ''chemistry''. Some converging and strongly intimate scenes are missing. The other problem is Edith Cushing herself. When arriving at the house, she suddenly changes from an intelligent emancipated woman to classic scared horror virgin type who needs a protection and loses a good deal of sympathy.The story itself is predictable, and so does not need to be focused on. Maybe the reason is that Guillermo del Torro planned to shoot this picture a long time ago and he simply lost the connection with the topic and focused on technical stuff. On the other hand, this is an opportunity to see a pure cliché, not meant in a bad way, horror- drama movie with all its attributes and great visual quality. The treatment with sounds for increasing the tension is comparable to The Woman in Black (2012).It does not deserve to be strongly criticized nor praised, but since I'm fan of all three actors and Guillermo del Toro, I must say I enjoyed it quite a lot.",Crimson Peak

Now I have to say that I appreciate that this wasn't a typical annoying hapless horny teenager slasher flick, filled with characters you actually don't mind getting murdered and could care less about, but it smacked something of like ""The Haunting"" and didn't seem to break any new ground. It could have come out on television and I think a 10 year old could handle most the ""frightening"" moments. Del Toro can be applauded for most his work, but this was just okay and didn't live up to the hype. And actually, as to the hype, it was said Stephen King called the film ""gorgeous and just -explitive- terrifying"", and said it ""electrified"" him, but that sounds just a little over the top coming from a guy who wrote books that had me frightened of a ticking clock in my parents little house after reading The Shining from cover to back in 48 hours. There is nothing terrifying about this movie. Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times wrote that ""Crimson Peak is a gorgeous mediocrity"", and that is basically what I felt after seeing this on Blu-Ray. What an incredible picture and how just okay the story. And I could only deduce, like most films today, that it was probably made for the 13- 18 year old crowd looking for something to do on a Friday night.

342,puppyaddict,A well-done thriller--go elsewhere if you're looking for horror!,8,18 March 2016,"This is a very well-done movie, and you can really feel Guillermo del Toro's style. If you're not a fan of his work, you probably won't like it. If you're looking for a horror flick, this is not the right choice either--it is NOT a horror movie, and is not intended to be. It is a thriller that simply features ghosts. The Woman in Black has a somewhat similar feel, and both pace somewhat similarly with parallels in the settings and several other elements, but this does not have the very dark aspect that The Woman in Black does--of course, that is not its intent--I would dare say it actually is the opposite, and is supposed to evoke a sense of hope and faith in the strength of the human heart (extending even beyond death), despite its contradictory weakness. This in spite of the disturbing material & storyline.The cinematography is beautiful; acting is excellent. Yes, there are a few predictable elements in the story, but since it is a thriller- - and actually a psychological thriller in a way--these somewhat obvious aspects actually help you to empathize a bit with the protagonist, as she also knows things are not right, but not everything fits until the end for her, either.Crimson Peak is not trying to do anything super original, but to deliver a different twist on a not-so-new story, with style!

Didn't this renowned director realize that by the twelfth or thirteenth bloodbath, the whole thing loses any shock value it might have had?

344,jfictitional,In Which We Paint the House Red,7,2 November 2018,"There's a term in film studies, the ""auteur theory."" It's to film directors what a modus operandi is to criminals: a distinct way of doing things that readily identifies a work as theirs. One of the best modern examples is Guillermo del Toro. Even in commercial fare like the ""Hellboy"" series and ""Pacific Rim,"" there's a giddiness and fascination with the bizarre and grotesque you won't find from any other director. The only one who comes close is probably David Cronenberg, yet where he is more of a cold observer, del Toro is clearly having the time of his life. Which is why ""Crimson Peak,"" a film I saw for the first time last night, was a bit of a disappointment.To be fair, this is not a horror film. Del Toro considers it a gothic romance, and despite his usual trademarks - insect imagery, unique creatures, religious symbolism - there's very little to actually fear in ""Crimson Peak."" And that's fine - del Toro is so skilled a director it's exciting to see him branch out as he did with ""Hellboy"" and ""Pacific Rim."" However, he holds onto his most cherished genre just enough that I couldn't help but feel something was missing.It is not the visuals - Dan Laustsen, filling in for regular del Toro cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, is just as consummate a stylist, and the house is arguably the most eerily beautiful set of all his creations. I do wish, though, that the editing had been a little less choppy - it threw off the pacing of several scenes and made the film, even at two hours, feel rushed at times. Not the acting, either - while Tom Hiddleston and Charlie Hunnam were a bit stiffer than I expected, Mia Wasikowska is compelling, while Jessica Chastain outshines everyone. It has all the ingredients required for a good creepy romp. So what, then?Perhaps this - one of the greatest strengths of any given del Toro film is not just the visuals but the inventiveness. Unless you're totally in tune with his sensibilities, you can't possibly predict what insane thing will happen next. There's not much of that here. Except for one late twist, the story is surprisingly simple, and at one point I felt as if I were waiting for the characters to catch up. Again, this being a homage to a bygone era of filmmaking, it's understandable, but in terms of plot and tone I surprised myself by thinking this was del Toro going through the motions. The ghost story itself is strangely rote, the human drama melodramatic but ultimately unremarkable. Perhaps the most egregious moment was a sex scene between two relatively normal adults. I mean, come on! What is healthy, conventional sex doing in a Guillermo del Toro movie? Where are the fish men and their hidden appendages?Okay, I kid. I don't believe it's possible for del Toro to make a truly bad film, or at least one not worth watching. He's a visual genius, and his basic concepts are almost always refreshingly original, even when riffing on old genre tropes. Here, though, seems to be an instance when his eccentricities aren't equaled by the plot they are in service of. Still, even conventional del Toro shows more ingenuity and genuine enthusiasm than the vast majority of Hollywood, and for this reason Crimson Peak is still well worth seeing. Just don't expect to be in as much awe as you're used to.",Crimson Peak

I have so much appreciation for Guillermo and his creature designs are always amazing and horrific and original. But for some reason he just downplays them into finding allegiance with the main character or he humanizes them too much to the point where audiences sympathize and the creature loses its power. Anyways, I feel like he's holding himself back with his continuation into the horror genre. And while visually captivating, the dialogue and ""mystery"" are completely jaded. The incest wasn't particularly astonishing nor was it a strong pretext to kill over. It just never made me ""awed"". The viewer is given no evidence of why Edith & Thomas fall in love (other than that Thomas takes the time to go over Edith's writing and teaches her how to waltz), and even when they first see each other they already put on a familiar chemistry that leaves them acting more like good friends than anything else.All in all, It's not a romance, it's not a horror. It's Just Guillermo doing his CGI monsters, over-saturated colors, and writing a shallow story.",Crimson Peak
348,autumnhendersonbrazie,"Crimson Peak definitely has its ""jump out of your seat"" scares, but it's the tormented psychological motivations of the Sharpe siblings that leave your skin crawling.",10,14 December 2015,"Crimson Peak, is NOT a horror movie, according to its director, Guillermo Del Toro that is. Instead, Del Toro would like it to be categorized as a ""Gothic Romance."" I'm sure if you've seen the trailer you would beg to differ, but I side with Del Toro here. The film is breathtakingly beautiful, story driven, deliberate, and well acted- not exactly the usual ingredients of a horror movie.Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing, a young, ambitious author in a time when it was expected that women celebrate their husband's careers instead of their own.Edith makes it very clear that she's more interested in the ghost story that she's writing than with finding a man. This, for some reason, changes almost immediately upon meeting Sir Thomas Sharpe, a once wealthy engineer from England. The first 30-45 minutes of the film is supposedly dedicated to making the audience believe that she did in fact fall madly in love with Thomas. All I was convinced of, though, is that she loved her father and he believed in her dreams. Wasikowska came off as more impressed with Thomas's worldliness than head-over-heels in love, which would make sense had they stuck to her earlier narrative. But because they attempted to go with the ""blinded by love"" rationale, all of her decisions from that point forward seem inauthentic.Before Thomas whisks Edith away to his creepy mansion in the desolate English countryside (Allerdale Hall), he introduces her to his frighteningly even-toned sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain), who also happens to be a talented pianist. This comes in handy later when creating the unsettling ambiance of the haunted mansion.Yes, there are ghosts in this film. Ghosts that have been beautifully crafted by advanced special effects. Seeing this movie in the theater alone, was probably not the wisest idea. The trip back to my car through the dark parking lot was certainly a tense experience. *Spoiler* Although the ghosts are visually terrifying, they have no malice in their intentions. The only beings that mean to inflict bodily harm at Allerdale Hall are human beings. Dun dun dun dun!The mystery is fairly easy to solve, but that dosen't mean that those theories aren't horrifying when physically manifested.*Spoiler* Although I assume that Del Toro meant for his ""gothic romance"" to be between Edith and Thomas, the far more compelling love story was Thomas and Lucille's (no matter how twisted it was).Jessica Chastain (as per usual) stole the show. In fact, I'd like to see her name on the Oscar ballot for supporting actress. Her Lucille was passionately monstrous, with enough restrain to make her measured dialogue as unsettling as her gruesome actions.Crimson Peak definitely has its ""jump out of your seat"" scares, but it's the tormented psychological motivations of the Sharpe siblings that leave your skin crawling.",Crimson Peak
349,lguerrero54,Predictable!,6,22 October 2015,"I read some mixed reviews about this movie before watching it; however, I still had high expectations. I saw it yesterday, and the only thing I can say is: ""Predictable"". Don't get me wrong, the movie is fun to watch, it has a cool scenery and some gory scenes that will make you cringe. The biggest problem is that, in the first 15 minutes of the movie, you already know what will happen (similar to a chick flick). So basically, the only thrilling thing about it is how the main character will figure everything out, (something that you already did), and how the extremely fake ghosts will jump-scare you.The actors: Tom Hiddlestone, OK. Jessica Chastian, good as usual. Mia Wasikowska; personally, I don't like her ""Alice in Wonderland"" type of acting, she tries to look strong, but she is mostly dull.In general, I give this movie a 6, it is not bad, but it's just not that good.",Crimson Peak

Based upon the trailer, I was really looking forward to this and so I was very disappointed. This is not the film advertised in the trailer.The protagonist's description of the novel she's written is that it's not a ghost story, but it has ghosts in it. This film has ghosts in it, but it isn't a ghost story. It would have been so much better if it were. The ghosts are peppered throughout and promise more than they deliver.I enjoy the actors and they do well enough (bless 'em) but they desperately need an interesting plot.Intentionally vague spoilers: From about 10 minutes in it was obvious what was happening, who was involved, what their relationships were and who had been involved previously. The only twists were telegraphed clearly and repeatedly throughout the film. I expected that the ghosts would provide some essential clue or information but they really just wander through occasionally, looking terrifying but behaving quite nicely. They were completely ineffectual (except for one moment when someone who probably shouldn't see them inexplicably does, but the moment would work exactly the same if there were no ghost present).Recommended only for someone who has never seen an actual ghost story or Hitchcock film.",Crimson Peak

The plot is silly, the script seems hacked together, the acting is wooden. It's not scary, it's not romantic. The FX look nice, but aren't used effectively. Same for the sets. I guess the clothes are nice. The whole movie comes across as the plot for a puzzle style video game. It was successful in giving my wife and I something talk about all night, though we had not much nice to say about it. It's really hard to pin point what went wrong when really nothing in the film works. I guess it's biggest flaw is that it's incredibly dull. I have no idea how a supernatural love story could be so dull. Before I get carried away, I must make sure I mention the one highlight. The dog. There is a papillon featured in the movie. A wonderful breed. A terrible choice for a horror movie. The dog wound up being more charismatic than the human actors. And, being such a peppy dog, it really made light of situations that I'm sure we're intended to be suspenseful.",Crimson Peak

Except, the story within would be materially the same thing if there were no ghosts. Or maybe there weren't ghosts and the narrator was simply having visions? Or maybe the ghosts do exist, but no one else can see them? Or maybe the ghosts exist, but Thomas and Lucille simply see them as shadows? Who knows, it's never made clear. What is clear is the predictably awesome set designs, colors, and vibe of a Del Toro movie. You will certainly fall in love with the Gothic, fairy-tail-like feel of Crimson Peak. The mysterious red clay and pink snow. The uncomfortably creepy indoor snow. The dim candle-lighting. And you'll remain at the edge of your seat waiting for the explanation... that never comes. #--- MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW -------- This is, at its heart, a movie about a crazy, incestuous brother and sister. The sister murdered their mother and went to an asylum. The brother... we're not sure. He went to a boarding school, came home and... suddenly began a mad cycle of getting married, killing wives, digging fruitlessly in a mine for a red clay that is impossible to dig and yet exists in truckloads in their basement. The clay is valuable for an unknown reason and un-mineable for another unknown reason. There's a dog who, unfed and outdoors, didn't starve over the long, cold winter. There is a seemingly supernatural ring that serves no purpose other than to explain the conspiracy to another character. And there are the butterflies and moths, who... I don't even know. Metaphor? The movie is jam-packed with half-baked ideas that don't add to the storyline other than to make it increasingly creepy. I was so sure this was a story about some sort of magic, except it's not. It's just crazy people and ghosts that don't seem to matter. Why do Thomas and Lucille kill Thomas' wives after they get the money? The gramophone that explains the entire story is kept... why? So much is unexplained. So much makes little sense. In the end, I just left frustrated at the potential. Great idea, still sort of charming, but overall, this is no Pan's Labyrinth.",Crimson Peak

A marvelous movie with beautiful picture, sets, actors and special effects. Everything lies within the old fashioned climax, like a clever revival of HAMMER FILMS. It's as classy as Coppola's Dracula.. It's everything The Haunting (DeBont)and Wolfman (Johnston) failed to be.

But unfortunately, none of the above. What a waste, it's looks magnificent, but that's about all. Style over substance, any substance will do.Apparently the film was novelised afterwards by Del Toro, and considering how mediocre the film was, the books might actually be better.

First of all, this is not a horror! By referring to it as such is an insult to horror fans. Its more like Shakespeare in a creepy house! The acting is as wooden as the floorboards and Jax Teller was ridiculously miscast as the pretty boy Doctor. I think the best performance belonged to Jim Beaver as the protective father, but then I'm a Supernatural fan. I was so bored watching this I kept wishing it would end! Even the violent finale was boring! And the ghosts? What was the point of them?? They had nothing to do with the plot and the cgi was terrible. Then there is the performance by Jessica Chastain. She seemed more bored than I was! I get that she was meant to be a dark character but she only had the one facial expression throughout.

Mia and Tom were awesome too. Really sympathized with both their characters. The directing and cinematography was brilliant. Loved the costumes. Victorian fashion was so elegant and beautiful. Kept me gripped from start to finish and jumped out of my seat so many times at the ghosts. To be fair the cgi and the skeletal appearances of the ghosts were pretty good. Just loved it and it kept me guessing since I had a few theories of my own when the trailer came out.Only gripe i had with it was *spoiler alert* was Edith's naivety when Thomas told her her dad made him reject her but he did love her, and then afterwards she is told her father died (quite violently) maybe it's just me but I would have been suspicious if I'd been in Edith's shoes and Thomas told me Cushing made him reject her but he came back and suddenly Cushing had died ""accidentally""I also prefer Tom in this role rather than Benedict.

It is Gothic romance with elements of horror and the key role takes the relations and deep feelings between people.The movie is extremely enchanted. You are submerging to the Victorian era from the first moment, it was like to buy a ticket to the past. The atmosphere is full with mystery and anxiety. The main role here takes the castle. It is unbelievably beautiful, but at the same dark and frightening. I have got the most aesthetic enjoy i ever had.Jessica as Lucille is the best in here. You can't take a look out of her. Even Tom is in the shadow in comparison with her. Her demonic nature hides under the fatal appearance. Tom's performance is perfect as always. He plays Thomas Sharpe - a gentleman with immaculate manners - his eyes are full with sorrow.

Though why your own mother would choose to return to warn you of something in such a terrifying way and in the middle of the night I really don't know.One question I have is why leaves were continually falling through the hole in the roof. Firstly the roof was much higher than the treeline and secondly, the outside shots showed a lone tree with barely enough leaves to have poured through the hole for five minutes let alone weeks on end. I can only conclude this was a plot device to explain why Edith had a massive patch of snow to fall on later.Talking of Edith falling - I know adrenaline can keep you going but her ability to keep going despite the fall and other injuries was quite something. And how Dr McMichael didn't bleed out within minutes was truly impressive. Maybe he used the leaves as some kind of temporary bandage?Warning: close your eyes for the sink scene.

364,mason-shaw,"Disturbing, hair raising and intricate - Crimson Peak",8,19 October 2015,"Disturbing, hair raising and intricate; this ghastly tale is unlike any of your usual conventional horror flicks.Straight from the mind of Guillermo del Toro comes the ever so creepy 'Crimson Peak'. The story delicately places itself within the late 1800's of New York, an era where uncertainty and 'ghost' tales had no means of connection within a thriving yet sexist publishing business. Within a system frowning upon the penmanship of women, a lone female stood out in an attempt to have her work heard by masses, only to be denied for its lack of lust and romance. Rescued by the companionship of a male counterpart, Edith Cushing finds herself swooning for a man filled with intelligence, culture and a love for her tale. However, is this all a ploy just to get towards her brooding, and powerful father.Del Toro has a knack for filling films with his creepy essence, from 'Mimic' to 'Pan's Labyrinth' many have witnessed the passion from his elaborate sets to his ghoulish designs, with 'Crimson Peak' being no exception. The film itself is interesting and terrifying, yet in a way that only Del Toro himself could deliver. We have seen the classic ghost stories where the fear of the unknown is heavily covered by mutilated figures and human harming ghosts. This is not one of those stories. Instead we are given a warning that fills the air with a mist of suspense and a touch of macabre.The sets are stunning, yet shocking in a devilish 1800's way. The level of detail that was placed into the film for its set and costume design sets itself miles apart from previous 'era driven' horrors, smacking into a league of own.In an era plagued with found footage material it is refreshing to see something delivered as delicately as 'Crimson Peak' as no stone is left unturned in terms of style and essence. While watching this film I couldn't but help feel a slight sense of unease as the camera angles and cinematography captured a frightening attack that almost placed you within the walls of the warned 'Crimson Peak' itself. Stunning performances from Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain added to the mix of creepiness as the brother/sister duo certainly displayed an unnerving chemistry on the silver screen, making their presence strongly felt.This film is a must see for the scary season with Halloween approaching, there is nothing better than a few eerily delivered scares to get the heart racing and the blood flowing. Catch this film while it is still in theaters as it is surely something for every horror lover to indulge in.I give this film a solid and satisfied 8/10.Mase ShawFollow us on twitter : @theweeklyspoon Follow us on Facebook: The Weekly Spoon",Crimson Peak
365,botias-386-78390,"Visuals were beautiful, but the story was boring, characters not engaging",5,21 October 2015,"I enjoyed the set up of the film alright and it was visually lovely. I loved the costumes and the Victorian and Gothic sets, but I guess the characterization failed because as the character stuff trailed off and the horror ramped up, I trailed off caring about the characters and any sexual tension there was in the first part had departed by the time the characters finally had the sex scene teased in the trailer. A sex scene that seemed weirdly frisky and fun for two characters in a fraught situation who have never done it before, even given that it's a movie. The film just didn't work for me. The main character spends the last half of the film mostly interacting with cgi 'ghosts' and discovering what the audience already knows, which turns out to be a very straightforward take on a very classic Gothic story line. I went hoping to see Tom Hiddleston in an effective Gothic romance/horror, and though I was skeptical I was lured in by it's high IMDb ratings, but I guess the high ratings are the directors fans.

I was genuinely surprised that someone felt that way about it. I think in the land of caped crusader and exploding-robot cinema, that people will miss a lot of the subtleties and pure artistry of this film. I considered it an art house film with a bigger budget and well known actors. To me, it had the right amount of mystery, drama, intrigue, suspense, romance and gore to keep everyone satisfied.

369,kamyk2000,Gothic? Yes. Horror? Marginally. Worth watching? Mostly.,7,31 October 2015,"Let's get right to the point. This movie is touted as a Gothic horror. The trailers certainly seem to indicate such. What it turns out more to be is a Gothic ""romance""/tragedy/mystery with horror elements.The good: The premise of the story is unoriginal, but is nevertheless a captivating one at first. The production values are fantastic. Special effects? Top notch. Sets? Excellent. Directing? Superb (of course). It's also a bit gory which I personally think makes it more realistic, (but it's certainly nothing remotely resembling ""torture porn"" like Saw, or even Hellraiser). The mediocre: While mood appropriate and well performed, the soundtrack is utterly forgettable. The sound effects are superb, but also utterly forgettable (save perhaps the house ""moaning"" in one scene). The ghostly elements are very nicely pulled off. At least on a par with ""Mama"", but ultimately serve no real purpose to the plot in any way. I debated them being a plus, but they could be removed from the movie and the plot wouldn't change in the slightest. Some of the acting is less than stellar as well. Certainly nothing terrible, but nothing anyone is going to get an Oscar for either.The bad: The story is entirely predictable. Not a single original idea (other than perhaps the setting). If it had been written as a novel around the same time as Frankenstein and Dracula and the like it would have fit right in, and probably now be considered a classic. However being made in this day and age it's just a rehash of your typical Gothic novel clichés. Is it a Gothic ""novel""? Absolutely. To the core, but did I mention the plot is ridiculously predictable? If you watch this movie and think you've guessed a plot turn (I won't even grace it with the word ""twist""), then you probably guessed right.The ugly: Anyone who has seen a previous horror movie directed/produced/written by Del Toro, here's a caveat:Don't expect to be scared. It has none of the tension or shocks of ANY of his previous horror endeavors.Ultimately is it worth going to see? Yes. I did give it 7/10. It's well made and it wasn't at all boring. Go see it if you have an hour or so, and like Gothic novels or other forms of media with dark Gothic themes. However, don't expect much horror unless the mere sight of wispy black figures freaks you out. But if you are the kind of moviegoer who likes to be kept guessing until the ""reveal"" where you go ""Oh wow, I never saw that coming"" this movie is certainly not for you.",Crimson Peak

Do you want to be frightened into sudden familiar horror clichés ? No, this is not the right movie to waste your time for. There is only a crime story and a woman who can feel the dead. The murderers have common motive and the departed end up as usual in their final state. There is nothing unexplainable or supernatural but the girl's ability to see not only the dead corpses but their dark dissipating fragile shapes. Their images are flawless and she is their hope, they do not want to harm her, they are seeking relief. The sense of danger is perpetual and horror comes easily in perfect visuals, radiant colors and impressive theatrical scenery, but you lay back in your chair and enjoy a masterpiece rather than a movie designed to shock or cause fear and disgust. This Guillermo del Toro's work of art should be placed to the top rank of all horror – thriller movies and considered a reference value for anything relative has been already directed.",Crimson Peak
371,entenn-studio,Gorgeous visuals and not much else,5,22 October 2015,"I'd like to start my Crimson Peak review by saying that I love Guillermo del Toro. I love the man with a passion. He has a fantastic artistic eye, and to be quite frank I'd like to be like him: being a director, an artist, with a man-cave that is an entire house filled with collectibles and art, not just a puny room. I think he has very interesting ideas especially when it comes to creatures and monsters. But that's that. The truth is - and I can see a lot of people wanting to punch me for this - he is a mediocre storyteller. At best. Yes people. Just because you like someone or want to like something you must be neutral when you judge it. Don't get me wrong Crimson Peak once again shows off del Toro's talent for art direction the movie is gorgeous to look at and in general very atmospheric. But pretty much that's it. I was really looking forward to this feature and was extremely disappointed to see that the Master making the same mistakes over and over again when he works on his personal projects namely he cannot make up his mind what is the movie he actually want to make. The madly over hyped Pan's labyrinth was just the same. If you remove the fantasy element from the story the movie still works. There is absolutely no reason for the ghosts or monsters to be at present within the movie apart from del Toro's love for them. They don't add anything to the story and while their designs and executions are pair to none they always deflate like a balloon since the message is always the same: People are the real monsters. To be fair if you have seen one of del Toro's movies (I mean his personal work) you have seen them all. It really hurts me to write this because he is the only director today in this stature who makes the movies I'm interested in. But I'm tired of seeing yet another wonderful trailer for a promising del Toro feature and get let down by it. Crimson peak's story is flat and you figure it out from the very beginning because one of the characters - no spoilers - figures everything out in the first ten minutes. No surprises, no twists. Minor spoilers: The ghosts, two or three of them appear they look scary but they don't take the story anywhere. Besides the director spells it out to us that they are not the actual threat. The final third of the movie is when things really start to happen but no surprises there either. End of spoiler. Tom Hiddleston is amazing as usual and Jessica Chastain is absolutely fantastic in her role. Mia Wasikowska is okay but she has not much to work with. Her character has no ark she doesn't go anywhere she I guess just represents the audience. And finally the weakest link is without a doubt Charlie Hunnam. Why are they keep hiring this guy? He is one of the most untalented actors that ever disgraced the silver screen with his presence. Period. All in all the film is very underwhelming, I'm really sad because this could have been something really special. And for certain level it is, but we have seen this before dozens of times, even from del Toro and we have seen it done better. PS: del Toro has two movies both surpass this ""The devil's backbone"" from back the time when he really wanted to tell an imposing beautiful tale, and ""Hellboy II: The golden army"" from his blockbuster portfolio with beautiful visuals and an interesting story.",Crimson Peak
372,ecidnac,"Pretty but boring, and not remotely scary",3,24 August 2017,"I thought I'd give this film a shot since famed horror author Stephen King called it ""Gorgeous and just f---ing terrifying"". Well, it was gorgeous... The costume design is great, but the story is dull, predictable, and not at all scary. Mia Wasikowska's acting leaves much to be desired; that girl is like a walking wet rag. Jessica Chastain's Lucille is almost cartoonish in her ridiculousness. The ""scandalous twist"" isn't much of a twist and, if you paid any attention to the trailer or promos for the film, you knew exactly what it was. This seems more like a paycheck movie than any kind of ""labor of love"" or ""homage to the art of horror"".

374,avlis-nec,Crimson Peak- Gothic romance at its best,8,21 April 2017,"Since the movie hit the theaters time has passed, but I believe it is never too late to see and review a good movie. As you may have noticed by my introduction I did not watch it when it first came out, even while it did grip my attention. I suspect it must have been the fact that it was marked as a horror movie, a genre I avoid, a fact that as it seems also kept other possible viewers from seeing it. Be as it is, I'm not going to chit-chat, I'm writing a review. Let's start.Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a young bright woman and her fathers only child living in 1901 Buffalo, New York. As an aspiring writer she gets nothing more that a few amused smiles, until she meets the handsome English baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston), who seems to be smitten not only by her writing but also with her. He, who came searching for investors to finance his new clay-mining device, gets rejected not only by the financier but also by Edith's father, who feels an unease in the presence of this young man. The sudden and surprising death of her father leads Edith deeper into Thomas'arms and the young couple travels to his home back in England. Allerdale Hall is everything else but a shining castle and her sister-in-law Lucille (Jessica Chastain) seems as cold as the winds that blow through the many holes in the roof. At first Edith tries to make the best of it, but with a sister-in-law cold and unsettling like a shadow, a husband who is kind but distant and a house where ghost's whisper warnings at night it does not take long until her life is in threat when dark secrets come to the light.Well, there are so many things that should be talked about, that this fact alone should make you interested. I already noted that this movie was wrongly advertised as a horror while it actually is nothing else then a Gothic romance, a style very popular in the 19th century. Imagine it like a mix of Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" and Hitchcock's ""Rebbeca""- being more like the later one. Add a few ghosts. The performances and characterizations of all the actors are top, the best you can get. We have side characters like Edith's father (played by Jim Beaver) who is IMO a refreshing realistic good father and we have also Edith's childhood friend Dr Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) who all the time senses something bad approaching and aids her for help. You may argue that he could have said something earlier, but then again, who is he to forbid her to marry the one she wants, and if that someone is not he then its fine too, all he wants is her too be happy. Also, without any evidence there was nothing he could say. Now lets get to the three main character, and man, they hit it. Mia Wasikowska as Edith is a wonderful choice (I only saw her as Alice in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and did not like her, but again, nobody was good there) being an educated bright young woman who searches friendship and love in the people she knows. She plays it never bland, shy at most, which is more then fitting given everything she goes through. Tom Hiddleston as Sir Thomas will surely make a few hearts out there skip beats, giving his character enough elegance and kindness while slowly letting the darkness shine through, all while adding a touch of vulnerability to it. And speaking of darkness, Jessica Chastain as Lucille will make everyone's blood run cold, playing her character as mysterious and twisted as you only can.While I listed all the character and performances pretty much on their own, I will like to note that the relationships, all of them, is what makes them so special. There is a motive through out all the movie with butterflies and moths, Edith being the butterfly searching and meaning sunshine and Lucille the moth in the dark eating weak butterflies, which shows perfectly everything. Promotional posters also have Thomas being overshadowed by a human skull representing death and Alan having angel wings appearing in the background showing his role in the end as well. All in all, this movie is as much relying on visual storytelling as it is on the script. You could argue that the story in its self is very simple, but the visuals are what carry everything through. We have wonderful and amazing costumes, we have a haunting gorgeous old house that slowly sinks into blood-red clay, visual storytelling at it best in all ways. If you fear it may be too scary with the ghosts, let me tell you that they are more unsettling than scary and might actually not even really be there. Its the atmosphere that makes this somewhat a ""scary movie"" and not jump-scares and unneeded gore.I highly recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good piece of mystery, great atmosphere, amazing visuals and a bit of romance. And I hope even people who, like me, needed time to finally see it will be positively surprised.",Crimson Peak
375,kushsengupta,Not Horror but a Gore movie,6,14 February 2016,"There are two aspects to the movie which needs separate treatment- 1. The horror aspect 2. The Gothic and/or Gore aspect It is perhaps misleading to call the movie a horror movie because the ghosts have really no function. In fact, you would even wonder why are they in the movie at the first place. The heroine Edith's mother's rather grotesque ghost keeps on warning her from going to a place called ""Crimson Peak"". It hardly helps her because she ends up there anyway. The other ghosts in England merely serve as visual reminders of the misdeeds of Sharpe siblings, a pointless plot device. The director seems to have take a short cut to establish the misdeeds of the Sharpes instead of a procedural method of revealing the deaths.However, the Gothic aspect of the movie is spellbinding. I was pleasantly surprised because I expected a Horror movie but ended up watching a Gothic movie with breathtaking symbolism and decor. It is very hard to innovate in an overworked genre like horror but Gohtic (in its literary sense of term) is still under represented in movies. That is what brings novelty to the movie, the gore and the blood horror.The plot is way too predictable and draws from many other predecessors. The cartoon-y feel to the sets might act as a detriment to some but for me enhanced the fairy tale-esque environment for me.The best part of the movie is it is not focus-driven on one plot line like most horror movies, instead develops multiple plots. It is however a shame that most of those subplots are not developed.Watch the movie if you are a fan of Gothic and like the whole Radcliffean school of Gothic",Crimson Peak

Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. The story starts off great with the girl and the ghost. The ghost at the beginning proved to me that this movie is no joke. Then that where it went down hill with all the crap.I was getting in to the story but I felt like it was all over the place. You got this guy appeared out of nowhere, then he married and take her to a disgusting house. All of sudden strange things start to happen because their trying to send some message. Not once did I feel the intensity of the movie. I didn't even feel scared or jump from fear to anything.Talk about the disappointment; however, the acting was decent but also in adequate. The ending made me very displeased. I wanted all the ghost she killed to be of help and appear to stop her. No, this didn't happen instead a dude shows up and little miss missy smacks her with a shovel.You what I'm tired of these ""horror"" movie not delivering.

378,zachcaslin,Know the genre before watching the movie,4,1 December 2015,"Crimson Peak had an okay story line. At many points throughout the movie it was very predictable about what was going to happen next. However, I did like that the director used the idea of family scandal to the best of his abilities. The flashbacks were a tad bit questionable at times and I still had questions by the end of the movie. I expected the movie to be way scarier then it was, but that's on me. I went into the movie believing that it was a horror film, based on the descriptions from the people I was with in the theater. I should have looked the film up beforehand and I believe that doing so would have allowed me to enjoy the film much more. The setting was non-realistic and I didn't feel as though I was apart of what was going on in the film. I wasn't really able to connect or relate to the circumstances going on. When Edith and Thomas had sex in the middle of the film, when Lucille was not with them, it allowed the movie to have a little bit of a shake up and stray away from all of the predictable scenes. Crimson Peak gave me a weird vibe in a way that I feel the director was not going for. All in all, I wouldn't recommend the movie. If you have received different feedback, at least know that it is not a horror film before going in.",Crimson Peak
379,gchahalgchahal,So shocked about the reviews,8,25 November 2015,"I'm really shocked about all the really low reviews. Personally i found this Gothic horror really appealing. Usually i'm not into these sort of movies. But we went just because we thought it was a scary movie. It had a really slow buildup but all the stuff you learn throughout the movie like the incest adds a little spice into the mix. The bad guys typically aren't the real bad guys. The end i was feeling sympathy for the guy who the main character married. Because PLOT TWIST he is a semi good guy>??!?! like say what since when. and i hated the sister who was rightfully f*cked in the head. Something was truly messed up with her. My friend guessed right from the beginning that there was incest going on because of the way they ""hugged"" ?!?! I denied it and boom we found out there was incest. anyways i don't understand all the hate this movie is getting because it truly grabbed my attention",Crimson Peak
380,godheartsu,Why put in certain things?,3,16 February 2016,"The movie wasn't what I thought it was. I saw the trailer and thought it was a cool, scary movie that I would enjoy. Then, I saw the movie and was less impressive then expected. To me, the story line didn't make much sense, there was no need for a mild sex scene in a scary movie; a scary movie is more about the scary elements, and not sex. The beginning of the movie started out pretty well, had a nice solid start, but just ended wrong. The special effects were pretty cool though so, not all bad. If others saw the movie and thought it was good, then that's fine but, for me, it was less impressive and it's a movie that I won't see again and tell people to not watch because it would be a waste of time.",Crimson Peak
381,giamustaine,"Entertaining, but could've been better",6,8 January 2016,"Due to lack of time I wasn't able to see this movie in the theater, I just watched it at home.I highly enjoy stories of that period: long dresses, men dressed up in fancy suits, beautiful houses, beautiful landscapes, a romantic story, and if we throw in the English accent well it has it all for me.So, I was ready to enjoy this. The first part was interesting but as it continued, it felt like something was missing. The Sharpe house was lovely in its own unique way, every room, every hallway, the fireplace, the paintings, the curtains, everything was exquisite. The photography, the environment, the music, it was perfect.Now the characters they were probably a bit predictable and you could guess what they were going to do next, but when you have strong performances and the story manages to involve you, you don't care how predictable it can be, you're still enjoying it. But unfortunately this wasn't the case.One of the things I enjoy a lot of Tom Hiddleston is the way he manages to complement his acting with his voice. I don't find that often in actors, but Tom is excellent at it. And the first part of the movie had it. That scene when he broke Edith's heart you could feel the despise and hate in his voice. I would've loved to see more of that in the second half of the movie. Now I have a problem with Jessica Chastain playing Lucille. Sure her role was a cold blooded woman, who was nice to no one, only to her brother. And that's fine. The problem is that she failed in how to say it give a heart to the cold hearted woman. There was no passion, her lines felt cold and empty. Maybe she thought that by making a fake sad/annoyed expression she was going to transmit more of the character. Well, wrong. While Tom was trying to keep things up with the story, Jessica seemed to be dragging it down. If she had managed to give more as an actress, I'm pretty sure the story would've felt better, not so empty.And I think the one to blame for this is the director. He should be able to see (and feel) that something's missing, and he failed. Too bad, because he had a good project in his hands.It keeps you entertained, but it leaves you with a feeling of 'damn, it could've been better'.",Crimson Peak

Guillermo del Toro was partly inspired by the vintage Hammer and Mario Bava - autumn leaves raining from the ceiling, for example, is borrowed from the classic Hammer.Unfortunately, the lush vintage colour and even traditional film stock are replaced by ugly digital cinematography, and a Gothic mansion is just ugly dump.

It would have made the movie more interesting if the crimson clay had a mystical ability to release ghost spirits wherever it was used. For example, the crimson clay bricks were used in Edith Cushing house which allowed the spirit to warn her but you didn't find that out until the end that the Sharpe's have been supplying these bricks for years without knowing the crimson clays true power. There would have been a sequence showing Sharpe bricks being used in homes around the world and a epidemic of spirits being released.

387,georgef-65599,Simple plot but worth a watch,7,28 August 2020,"Whilst it does have its problems, I would recommend watching it and forming your own opinion if you're on the fence about this movie. It wasn't scary for me, but it was creepy. The horror is peppered throughout so didn't become stale, but I also didn't feel starved of it.
I would recommend if you like the idea, just don't watch it expecting a ghost story, it just has ghosts in it.Crimson Peak is a spooky movie about a woman (Edith) who falls in love with a mysterious man (Thomas) who is trying to restore his mining business. Thomas has a dilapidated family home which is sinking into his clay mine.Plot-
The start of the movie was its weakest point in my opinion. Thomas' appearance felt forced to begin with but in retrospect fitted with the story. I'm not a fan of lengthy time skips (few days or maybe a month) and the start of this movie had a few. This led to the romance between Thomas and Edith mostly happening offscreen and felt rushed. Once the characters arrived at Thomas' house (crimson peak) my enjoyment of the movie skyrocketed.I personally thought that the plot was quite simple, which isn't necessarily a problem but I was left wanting to see more of the house and the characters could've been explored further, especially Thomas. There was a good explanation for the ghosts but it was done at the wrong time and this is my least favourite part of the movie and what I think is the weakest scene.Cinematography-
The way this movie looks is excellent. It's gorgeous. The only criticism I have is the weak CGI. It's not terrible, but I could tell it was CGI.Length-
I thought that it was an enjoyable length for me and it didn't outstay its welcome, just a shame it left me wanting more.Immersion-
For me, what went on was believable in the context of the movie (or depending on your beliefs regarding ghosts.) The time skips at the start hurt my ability to get really immersed, but I never looked at my watch.Soundtrack-
The music was fine and wasn't distracting. None of the tracks apart from the main theme really stood out to me.Would I watch it again-
Yes, I plan on watching it again.",Crimson Peak
388,nay-pay,Spoiler Synopsis of What could and should have been a top notch horror,4,13 December 2015,"*Spoiler Alert Below*The very first, rather short, trailer i saw of this movie had me chomping at the bit to see what Del Toro had in store. The later trailers had me much less enthusiastic, and now that I've seen it I must say it was a terrible disappointment from the first, SHORT, trailer, and from the later ones even. *Spoiler HERE* I was sure that the sister (a convincingly brunette Jessica Chastain: hubba hubba ) would be the main villain, and the brother (Tom Hiddleston, soon to play a not so English Hank Williams: intrigued) a less than completely willing accomplice, but I must say I expected SOOO much more from both characters (though the acting was fine, even good). And basically I think this movie was just another case of a director/writer not wanting to do what would seem to me to be most obvious thing to do if you were gonna really put out a frightening film.It even seemed to hint at such notions early on, which makes me think he had it in mind, but just chickened out. What should have happened was that the brother and sister (incestuous) duo should have killed and hidden many ""would-be brides"" all over the house (no shortage of ghosts), and not just their Mother and the brother's first (no real account) wife. This would have given plenty of reason for them to continue needing new brides to lure in and dispose of. I thought for a moment they were even gonna turn out to be cannibals (that could have made for some real horror). But most disappointing of all was the way everything came to an end. I was sure that the brother and sister duo would make long work of disposing of Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) and that the (obviously) ""psychic"" character of Edith ( Mia Wasikowska ) would prove resourceful enough to have lead one or both of the lead villains on a chase through this HUGE place of so many ALLEGED secrets (having procured the houses many (as it turns out largely unused) keys from hubby's ""sister-dearest"", and having discovered much of the houses secrets, would then use her knowledge and connection with casper and pals to outsmart her pursuer(s) and led them (or siss at least) on a trail across her (their) final revelation that the house was indeed haunted, and she (they) was (were) to be it's next victim(s). Not so much though, just your basic ""thin little crazy sister"" kills the sturdy, robust, hard workin, father of the would-be bride Edith with only her hands and a conveniently placed porcelain sink early on in the film. Though it seems pretty obvious that it was a man who did this 1st and only ""innocent"" killing, though even her Dad was kind of a prick,alas), and psycho's little brother finally achieves redemption through his kind deeds towards the two not so badly treated victims, one turned shovel-swinging heroine. I don't have to completely spoil it to get the funky drift of this film more than across. Altogether I give it a 4 of 10 mainly because i had hoped so much more, and I would NOT consider this film a horror either, just another wanna-be scary, well acted, prettily-made, but plot-wise empty, little ghosty film. Shame on you Guillermo Del Toro,you should have made this movie like your first trailer and reallyshocked, horrified, amazed, and enthralled us.",Crimson Peak
389,weetiger3,Loved it! But they are selling it wrong,8,16 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak is a true Gothic romance that just happens to have ghosts in it (as well as copious amounts of blood and blood-like substances). What it is not, is a horror movie. There are thrills and chills, but no real ""scares"" at least in terms of what movie-goers born post-Freddie Kruger and weaned on the Paranormal and Insidious series' as well as remakes of Halloween, The Fog and Poltergeist. The film, written by the director and Matthew Robbins (Mimic) is visually stunning.All of the colors are rich and over-saturated. Both Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain often look like they belong in a Pre-Raphaelitepainting. A lot of the sumptuous fabrics used in designer Kate Hawley's costumes are vintage from the period depicted. The set design (all of which was built from the ground up specifically for the film) is incredible. del Toro has said that he wanted the film to look like a Technicolor Mario Bava film (Bava was a painter before he was a director/cinematographer)and JMHO he's succeeded. But this film owes as much to Bava as it does Hammer in its hay-day. Charlie Hunnam's Dr. McMichael is straight out of their repertory company. The score, by Fernando Velasquez, and the dialogue, particularly in the early scenes, is straight out of a period-perfect Penny Dreadful (speaking of which, there are shades of the Showtime series as well - again, not a bad thing at all), with a lot of stilted delivery of the phrase ""my child"". Watching Wasikowska and Hiddleston, it's hard to imagine Emma Stone and Benedict Cumberbatch in their roles. Hiddleston,in particular, was made for this type of film (if you haven't seen his tortured, soulful vampire in Only Lovers Left Alive, remedy that. Immediately). But it is Jessica Chastain's Lucille that is the beating pulse of this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me. There are monsters and there are monsters.",Crimson Peak

392,gstards,Beware the Darkness of the Human Heart,10,15 October 2015,"This film was a really tough experience, which I can compare to the previous works of a genuine director Guillermo Del Toro - Pan's Labyrinth and The Devil's Backbone. I watched this film in a cinema, and I was experiencing on myself all that darkness and helplessness, which saturate it. The main question, on what director tries to find the answer, is still the same - what beast is more cruel, human or monster (ghost, in our case)? This is the question of the non-pronounced trilogy of Guillermo Del Toro's Gothic films. And the Crimson Peak is completely worthy of his ancestors. It offers the really interesting and sensual story, which is incredibly touching.This picture definitely features one of the best performances of Jessica Chastain. The actress definitely did the great job to do her character a believably mystic and truly insidious figure. When she will appear on screen, trust me, you all will focus your attention on her, so colorful and brilliant performance this is. Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska also did an incredible job of portraying their characters. Tom plays also a mysterious figure, who appears to be more sympathetic and, well, good, but who knows what hides his heart... And Mia did a great job of playing someone, who will take us in the labyrinths of the charms of madness, which rules in the dark corners of Crimson Peak. The chemistry between this trio - Tom, Jessica and Mia - is just mesmerizing.The soundtrack is something which doesn't so touch you in the film like, well, Pan's Labirynth, but the one thing will definitely touch you right in the heart - the lullaby performed by Jessica Chastain. This song just creeped me out. You MUST listen to this.Art directors and CGI animators did a great job of portraying the ghosts. The ghosts are real, and you will see it in the Crimson Peak. This film is totally stunning in terms of visuals.Guillermo del Toro, again, proved me that he is a true master of his craft. He created the story of darkness, passion, love, desperation. This bloody masterpiece worthily closes his unspoken trilogy about the wickedness of man, which sometimes overshadow even the whole cosmic horror of supernatural entities, dwelling in the Unknown.",Crimson Peak

395,airidass,Crimson Peak Review,8,21 October 2015,"Guillermo Del Toro is known for his particular style of movie making, from pans labyrinth, which surprised many viewers because while looking like a colorful fantasy movie, is actually violent and a sad story set during the world war two. And Pacific Rim which is a bit smarter then your average blockbuster.The new film from the acclaimed director does not disappoint, but is not for everyone. The story follows a young woman that suddenly loses her father, but at the same time finds the love of her life. But as always is not as simple as it seem, she moves in with him, and his sister and that would be the end of it, if not for some supernatural things that start to happen. It's not as simple as I explained, but I do not want to spoil the movies plot, because you should see the movie knowing as little as you can about it. When I went to see this movie, I expected a straightforward horror film, because it was advertised as one. It's more of a twisted romantic story, then a horror film. There are a few instances of a jump scare, but they are done very well. Also I need to tell that this movie is very violent, there are just five or six scenes involving violence, but they remind me of Pan's Labyrinth as in they are very shocking.The main heroine of the movie is played Mia Wasikowska and as in most of her roles she is brilliant. She is not the typical damsel in distress. Tom Hiddleston who is famous for playing Loki in Marvel movies plays her Husband. I read that he was not the first pick to played the part, but in my opinion he was cast perfectly, one minute you think that he is disgusting and another, you are rooting for him. His character is not one dimensional, like the male leads in most horror films. Up next is his sister, played by Jessica Chastain. Again what a great performance, from the moment you seen her you know something is wrong; she is really creepy throughout the film. It may sound weird, but everyone is cast perfectly, at least that is what I think. And Charlie Hunnam plays the last main character. I think that he should have had more scenes in the movie, even thou he gives a great performance. At last we have the visuals and the sound of the movie, but as you can probably see from the trailer, and the stills released before the film it's amazing. Whole movie has this creepy atmosphere and the sound makes it uneasy to watch. I need to say, that horror fans might be disappointed that there is not enough jump scares, and overall tone of the movie changes midway through the movie. I personally loved it, the ending is unexpected in a good way. I would love to see more horror movies like this. Guillermo Del Toro is not afraid to take risks while making films and once again it pays off. The movie may not be the box office success, but don't let that fool you. It's a great movie, you should definitely check out.",Crimson Peak
396,sidrahali27,Best horror I've seen in a while,10,18 October 2015,"Amazing film, the best element has got to be that it doesn't follow the clichéd horror film template; it's very unique yet original and creative. It's very gory, however, so if you're squeamish, this isn't a great film to watch. The plot is well structured and intense and thrilling. The character development is great as well and the costumes are beautiful. I have nothing bad to say about this film, the ending is superb and the acting from all the main cast was exceptional. If you've seen any of Guillermo del Toro's films, this is similar to them in the sense that it is very creative and original at the same time, and very unusual, might I add. Just to clarify, if you're put off by blood/gore and the like, this is *definitely* not a film for you to watch. All in all, the film is amazing, has the right amount of horror and is well worth your money and time. You won't regret watching it.",Crimson Peak
397,glennbecker,... and I generally like del Toro ...,5,20 July 2020,"I feel I am in a real minority here -- there are critics I respect who think highly of this movies.I did not. It's possible some of my reaction could have been a case of ""wrong film at the wrong time,"" but even though I was happy to accept this as a ""fantasy"" of sorts, I found myself yelling at the the screen (of my laptop, that is) because of the sheer style-over-substance-ness of it all.Somehow, the Sharpe family's penury manifesting as a 20-30' foot hole in the roof through which leaves (and then snow) can oh-so-picturesquely cascade in a column throughout the film was too ""I'm just doing this for the shot"" for me. And that example is multiplied for the length of the film.The leads are physically attractive, and they show that they can mimic some extremities of emotion -- but in the end, do you know these people at all and do you care what happens to them? I didn't.YMMV.Del Toro has huge talent, but for me this was an enormous misfire. It's all spectacle.",Crimson Peak

399,izzyscadeng,"Visually stunning, shallow characterisation",6,20 August 2016,"*SPOILER WARNING*This film is visually stunning; the attention to detail is superb as seen in the set design, lighting and particularly the costumes. Del Toro's vision and artistry is flawless, 10/10 for presentation. However the predictable story and shallow characterisation let Crimson Peak down. Although technically a ghost story, Crimson Peak took care not to make too much of the supernatural and the ghosts are generally secondary to the protagonists. I liked the blend of old-fashioned horror and romance, yet the relationship between husband and wife Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and Edith Cushings (Mia Wasikowska) never felt genuine to me; the Sharpe siblings' motivations were too obvious from the outset. I wasn't sure if we as an audience were supposed to admire or pity the heroine Edith, if she can be given the title of 'heroine'. The often pathetic demeanour of Wasikowska's character let the movie down at times. Chastain's character Lucille carried the whole movie in my opinion as she seemed the only character written with any real depth.I didn't like the 'reveal' uncovering the siblings' incestuous relationship, it was obvious enough to the audience throughout that I felt the film would do better to merely hint at the possibility, thereby provoking more intrigue. Lucille's explanation to Edith when the latter is signing away her inheritance could have revealed the truth without their incestuous affair blazoned before our eyes. Finally, the ending was just plain lame. It became a chase between grief-stricken-revenge- mad Lucille and poor little Edith provoking little excitement in the viewer. The appearance of Thomas' ghost at the end was utterly pointless; wouldn't it have been better if his ghost somehow aided his wife, maybe by distracting his sister who was hell-bent on killing her? Instead it only reinforced in my mind the weaknesses of his character throughout the movie; and I do not say that lightly (I'm a huge Hiddleston fan)!The acting was good, particularly Chastain. Tom Hiddleston played the chivalrous Victorian gentleman to perfection, and by the time he utters his first line you've fallen in love; then again I'm sure much of the audience were in love with him to begin with. This role was made for Hiddleston, it's just a shame that more couldn't have been done to add depth his largely feeble character. For me it was undoubtedly the cinematography and visual appeal that saved this film from the clutches of mediocrity.",Crimson Peak

The sole star I gave this movie was for the good actors who I don't know what they were thinking when they agreed to play in this movie. The story is pointless, if it could be called a story. It makes absolutely no efing sense. I understand that the brothers are psychos, but this is got to be the worst crime story I have ever heard. Plot holes everywhere, details and stuff that happens for no reason and have no part in the action whatsoever. So she opens E.S.'s letter, doesn't read it, goes full Sherlock Holmes on random stuff when picks from the house, which was supposed to be big. If I had to write everything that's wrong with this movie I would spend a lifetime and a half. The only thing that actually was a little entertaining was Jessica Chastain's performance, whom I've never seen in such a role.

The over-the-top, gaudy, improbable costumes, the pretentious art direction, and the lame direction (who cleaned the house and took care of the fires, food, and cleaning of the mansion, bedding and clothing?)along with acting that is so wooden, you could have repairs the gaping holes in the crumbling ceiling with all the clapboard verbiage being mumbled by the actors who, most of the time, look as though they have wandered in from another film set accidentally. There are more holes in the tale than decades old Swiss cheese and just as stale and unappealing. Rent THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE if you want shivers up and down your spine.

403,Somesweetkid,Visually vibrant but plodding & predictable Victorian-era film,3,30 August 2020,"As I've gotten older, I usually prefer the classic films from the 30's-60's decades. However, I subscribed to a 30-day free trial offer for Cinemax and thought this film looked intriguing, especially since I am a fan of Tom Hiddleston.First off, there was no convincing chemistry between any of the three leads, and the incestuous relationship between the brother and sister was telegraphed with their first glance. The film would have been much more effective and surprising concerning this main plot element if they had acted more like a restrained brother and sister of this particular period of time.In addition, I found the film confusing and plodding as well and the use of gory violence unnecessary. The ghosts' actions also made no sense and didn't add to the film's progression, and neither did the corpse in the ""bloody"" vat in the lower level. The liquid's color, though graphically vivid, looked neither like blood nor like red clay. The film's violence was just too over-the-top for me. I watch too few ""horror"" films nowadays and that is why I will go back to my old standards like ""The Innocents"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" with the handsome and charming Ray Milland. A film's horror/scare factor can be just as effective in black and white and with minimal, well-placed use of screeching and screaming. It's a shame that filmmakers (of any era) capitalize on all of the gore and violence. Give me the b/w cinematography from the first half of the 20th century any film-viewing day over the gut-wrenching violence and gore vomited on film lovers in the past few decades.My three stars are for: 1. the cinematography, 2. the costumes, and 3. the tiny dog's light-hearted presence and barking that added relief from the film's excessive, graphic violence and the irritating shrieking of the ghosts.",Crimson Peak

Visuals are great - although most of them do not serve any purpose at all, but look great, if you can accept that.

The movie is slow and it feels staggeringly dull since you know everything that will happen.Visually stunning - yes! Great performance - yes! Terrific period piece - yes! Scary - no!

I had seen the masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth and expected this to be, if not as good, at least worth seeing. It is not. The acting is pretty good (apart from the very poor Charlie Hunnam)but that is the only aspect of the film that passes muster. It starts reasonably well, albeit predictably, but then descends quickly into something akin to a poor man's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, complete with ghosts that are laughable rather than scary and a big old house with a preposterous hole in its roof. The house appears to be the main character, but it is not believable as either a real house or a Gothic horror house, because it is schlocky not scary. What possessed Chastain and the other good actors like Hiddleston to take roles in this mess is beyond me. Not good for the reputation.

While Crimson Peak does not come anywhere near the quality of Labyrinth in terms of the script, it still showcases del Toro's unique skill for beauty and suspense.The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are sumptuous in that signature del Toro way. The luxurious train on the heroine's robe that audibly thumps behind her as she sweeps down the staircase? Yes, please. There is a nod to all the images our minds ever conjured while reading fairy tales. The rich colors, the music, the textures all help draw us in to this world and settle us in for the story.The film is not without its flaws. There are a few glaring plot contrivances that had me groaning. There is a superficial quality to the scenes involving Thomas Sharpe's clay mining business.I was impressed with Jessica Chastain's talent for conveying two conflicting emotions at once, all playing out on her face, reminiscent of Gillian Anderson in Bleak House.",Crimson Peak

But that's ruined by a stereotypical, cheap Hollywood screenplay. The dialogue and character motivations were laughable and put there only to connect the nonexistent ""twists"", which can be seen by everyone who've seen more than 5 movies of the genre. At some parts of the film there were some attempts of ""poetic verses"" or something, which sounded so bad as the cameraman wrote them in his lunch break. The actors are not really to blame here, they did what they can with with this mediocre script.If you value your time don't waste it with this movie. Wasikowska and Hiddleston's previous Gothic film ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" although not perfect is far more meaningful than this.

410,lunarwill-987-554663,A Comic Book Ghost Story.,6,18 October 2015,"I tend to give Guillermo del Toro a lot of leeway when it comes to his films, even on the rare occasion where he misses the mark. I'm afraid that would be the case with Crimson, unless you are expecting a very different kind of movie. By that, I mean, instead of expecting a Gothic ghost tale that is genuinely frightening through the use of subtlety and implied horror, the viewer should expect a visually stunning ""comic book ghost story"" and all that it entails.What I consider to be the benchmark for all Gothic ghost films was the original 1966 Robert Wise version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" (not the terrible Spielberg remake.) Wise successfully makes his audience cringe and jump in their seats by using only camera angles, loud noises, one very strange door, and the implication that something horrible is about to occur. While I understand the need for del Toro to make use of CGI to try to appeal to a larger audience, the movie lacked any of this type of fear at all, with the viewer being able to see every single detail of the cartoon corpses coming through the floorboards. Visually interesting, but by no means terrifying.I understand that there can never be another Haunting, or the Innocents (with Deborah Kerr), but if you remove the subtlety and realism from a Gothic ghost tale, and replace it with CGI spirits, it ends up being rather soulless.",Crimson Peak

Really, I think the worlds he creates are fascinating, intricate tapestries that are a joy to try and unravel. This movie was more or less a dishrag with really pretty *super red* embroidery.What worked for me: It seemed as though we were teed up for a successful Gothic romance with the panache of Edgar Allen Poe. The costume design was extravagant, the colors rich, and it truly was an excellent cast (although to be honest I'm not a great fan of Mia W... but I can't put my finger on why, to my own discredit). Jessica Chastain was exceptional, and what's not to love about Tom Hiddleston?What didn't work for me: For all the build up to the ""big reveal"", the characters really never develop. And the writing. Oh god the writing. What was, I'm assuming, an attempt to draw out the more grandiose language of the era was twisted into a mixture of long-winded sentences and really, really terrible one-liners. ""Sweat and regret,"" ""...Drink...your tea..."" Oof.But the two things that did it for me were the motives behind the murders... and the dog. Is it weird when people lose their marbles the moment a dog dies but don't even blink when the leading male gets a letter opener plunged right in his face at the hand of his incestuous sister? A little bit, yeah. But dogs. just. should. not. die. in. movies. It's a deal breaker for me. As for the motives... look, if Lucille and Thomas wanted to be together, they should have just run the hell away together before sending him off to get married. I get that Lucille is off her rocker, and Thomas is a malleable twit. Why not just change one of their names, run away to, you know, anywhere else in the world, and be merry? Why marry Thomas off for money only to kill the new wife so they can barely afford to keep running a decrepit old house that they can't stand, trying to run a business that's clearly failing? ""But Ellen,"" you say. ""It's more complicated than that,"" you say. ""Think about The Fall of the House of Usher!!"", you say. If it's supposed to be more complicated than a crappy business model and a crazy woman's penchant for stabbing people, then it really shouldn't have been so easy to predict about 80% of the plot fifteen minutes in.I guess what I'm trying to say is, I really wanted to like this movie. It all seemed like a recipe for del Toro's earlier genius. The Devil's Backbone meets The Fall of the House of Usher meets Jane Eyre. What I got out of it was more akin to a less interesting Jane Eyre meets anything by Baz Luhrmann meets that time George Lucas thought he could write a screenplay, and we all sighed.

A case in point was the ""excessively dark and oppressive house"", the rather vague and meaningless ""ghosts"" that regularly popped up, and the lengthy ""stabbing and slashing"" scene by a small but confusing variety of people with a variety of objects, near the end. This became all quite tedious and had the effect of 'a numbing out' of the senses. The story was also somewhat disjointed and lacked depth.There was little of the subtlety of movies of a bygone era when there was less reliance on computer graphics and gore, and more effort put into story line and build up of suspense. It has little of the ""fear quality"" that can be found in B&W movies such as ""The Young Innocents,"" ""Psycho"" etc and even color such as ""Black Christmas,"" ""The Shining"" and the excellent, ""The Others""Take a look at some of these and you will hopefully 'see' what I mean.",Crimson Peak

I must say I didn't expect a love story thus the reason why I was initially disappointed. But then again I have no idea why I was waiting for a something more sinister. Maybe the trailer gave me a bad impression... Maybe the marketing for this movie was simply wrong. Doesn't matter.Now I believe that the beginning of the movie sets the storyline and also predicts the ending. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is an aspiring author. Her ""ghost"" story is criticized for not being about love and her career choice is ridiculed by other women comparing her to Jane Austin. Yet Edith sees herself more as a widow like Mary Shelley rather than a spinster. And there you go... A handsome young man, known as Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) appears and her ""ghost"" story suddenly changes to a love story. The reason I keep using quotation marks for the word ghost is because it's really not a ghost story.

The movie is very luxurious, but special effects are strictly confined to the screenplay. Although the main story is a cliché, the screenplay itself is amazingly well written with no logical pitfalls, which is a very rare case in the modern film industry. There is space for some minor tweaks, to make it a bit more realistic, but it would certainly spoil a lyrical thread of the movie. Guillermo del Toro extremely well balances between reality and fiction, love story and brutality, intelligence and madness. All characters are very complex and quite realistic. Their psychological profiles are one of the many virtues of this extraordinary movie. It is very hard to convey the impression imposed by the move; it is something that has to be experienced.",Crimson Peak
416,kennoth-sasa,"Just average, barely",5,5 January 2016,"Some people have hyped this movie hard, in no small part because it's been a while since del Toro has done a genuinely scary movie.

It focuses on a young girl who has always had an affinity for supernatural, and following her father's death (don't strain yourself too hard on the killer), she decides to leave everything behind and go to England with her new lover/washed-up aristocrat.The beginning is interesting enough, but the move drags on for too long, and it offers us very little in return. You might expect some sort of haunted house setup, but what you'll actually get is mostly a boring ""whodunit"" drama between three people in the middle of nowhere. And the final twist is just underwhelming because by the time it happens you'll either figure it out on your own or just not care about it anymore.It's a shame that such a stellar cast of actors (shout-out to Supernatural fans here) got involved in this, considering that this had a lot of potential, but eventually simply failed to deliver. The costumes and photography are really good, and along with good acting probably the saving points for this movie.

What better metaphor then ghosts to convey this in the movie. Spirits that should have moved on to peace, are instead deteriorating in a world of past traumas and pain.

424,mondovideo,"Beautiful, but slightly lacking.",6,9 November 2015,"Del Toro never disappoints in crafting beautiful, extravagant sets for his movies. The problem is the actual story of 'Crimson Peak' is not very interesting - even when looked at as a Gothic romance.Let's start with the ghosts; These tortured spirits, roaming a massive decaying castle at night, mysterious and gory. They should evoke fear. The problem is, and this is the same problem I had with Mama, is that the ghosts appear so frequently, in the same exact way every time, that you get used to their presence. They are clearly made to be nonthreatening to the audience, but the main character doesn't understand this. It's hard to use this as a critique because Del Toro has stated the movie isn't a horror, but it's frustrating all the same.While on the topic of the genre, which is Gothic romance, there is a severe lack of romance in this movie. The ""gothic"" is covered extensively via Allerdale Hall, images of Wasikowska wandering with the dark halls with candlelight, the brilliant blood-red clay which seeps its color into the bright white snow. Even with all this imagery, there is no romance to support it. Hiddleston and Wasikowska have no chemistry. From the very first time you see Hiddleston he looks sinister and unloving and his demeanor never changes until maybe the final moments.Though Hiddleston fails as a romantic protagonist, his sister played by Jessica Chastain was marvelous. She was by far the most interesting character.'Crimson Peak', with its' various plot problems, was sometimes dull to watch, sometimes spectacular. The scenes inside Allerdale Hall, along with the excellent final act, somewhat make up for the weak central romance, but it is overall a slightly disappointing effort from Del Toro.",Crimson Peak

This outstanding film, which has incorrectly been promoted as 'horror', is one of the best I have ever seen. Finally a film that's not scary for all the things you do see, but scary for all the things you do not see.Young, innocent, curious Edith Cushing falls in love with handsome, dark, mysterious stranger Sir Thomas Sharpe, and it is evident they are made for each other. His sister, Lady Lucille Sharpe, is an enigma. She's cold, distant, yet so close and warm-hearted around Thomas.Now, allow me to clear up the confusion about the 'horror' thing. It's definitely not a horror film. It's a Gothic romance; it does have elements of the supernatural, but they do not determine the plot. In this case, they are very important, but they are a foreboding. The romance part is obvious: the innocent girl, the dark stranger, his mysterious sister. Fun fact: the film contains loads and loads of metonymy; the most important one being the cold, decayed house, sinking in red clay, obviously resembling the two Sharpe's relationship. Once you're home and you think this film over and over again, you will find more and more metonymy, beautifully hidden in the background.'Crimson Peak' is romantic, a bit scary, but most of all, a must-see for all.",Crimson Peak

Seeing it yesterday at a midnight Halloween screening, I was severely disappointed.To be fair and thorough, I will start with the few things I liked about this movie and then get to everything that went wrong.+ The casting is fitting and most of the actors play really well. Particularly Wasikowska does a great job, carrying every emotion in her face without overacting or losing her grace. Hiddleston is as good as usual. The rest of the cast is solid at least, but sometimes its hard to tell if the the characters or the actors are that shallow.+ This movie got style. The costumes are awesome, the scenery is amazing. Down to the make-up and hair-style, everything is superb. It even got unique element with the red clay. If you're happy just seeing great actors in authentic looking Gothic attire, running around in a spectacular old mansion with butterflies everywhere, you might actually enjoy this movie. My girlfriend did.The first big setback is the characters being implausible, one- dimensional and really stupid. It starts off so well, with Wasikoswska portraying this young, independent, smart writer with Mary Shelly as an idol. What a promising character! Turns out she is just a simple girl ready to submit fully to the first charismatic man paying her any attention. Another example is when someone comes to the rescue, confronts the evil guy, and then just turns his back to them to leave. I mean, even in slasher movies they take a baseball bat or golf club or something to defend themselves. This whole movie would have turned out differently if any of the characters would have had a golf club instead of just, you know, expecting the evil to guys to not do evil things after turning their backs to them. Duh.The special effects are technically mediocre at best. But even worse, they are completely uninspired. It's just translucent skeletons. Sometimes with clay on the bones. That's it. You come to expect great monster design from del Toro after movies like Pan's Labyrinth or Hellboy. Not in this one, boys. Just stupid, boring, old skeletons. Meh.Very graphic gore and violence, that seems totally out of place and never really hits home. I watch a lot of gore movies, so graphic violence is no problem to me. But in this movie, it doesn't work, because it doesn't feel embedded. At one point, you see a head smashed into a sink repeatedly, über-brutally. It really doesn't fit with the more graceful style of the rest of the movie. And not in a good way, like the sudden violence in Pan's Labyrinth that turns your stomach. This is just randomly mixed in B-movie gore.It's not creepy. I mean, this is supposed to be a horror movie, I thought. But it doesn't manage to build up creep or even just setup nice shock effects. The style I praised before is partly responsible: the scenery is too be pretty and stylized to actually be scary. The movie is also very bright, no dim lights anywhere. And the ghosts, well, as I said, boring old skeletons. Nothing new or creepy from this side.The plot is the worst part of the movie. It is utterly predictable and based on lazy writing and the stupidity of the main characters. You know the good guys and bad guys in the first 15 minutes and can pretty much guess what comes next at any second. The ghosts are completely superfluous for the story. Nothing really would have changed by keeping them out, all they do is prophecy bad things and try (and fail) to be scary. The clay mines had so much potential for plot and scares, but they used none of it. There are no twists, no character development, no nothing. Not the least bit of originality. Once the movie ends, you just feel bored and empty.To sum it up, if you want to watch this movie because you are fan of Pan's Labyrinth or other work of del Toro comparable this, don't go in this one. If you are looking for a cool ghost movie with a few scares and original character design, don't go in this one. If you just want to see a stylish movie with at least as plausible and smart as Hollywood action flick, still don't go in this one.If you don't care at all about plots or ghosts. If you just want to enjoy good actors in great mask with awesome costumes, playing before in a fantastic scenery, then you should watch this. If you don't mind unexpected gore and look forward to Mr. Hiddleston's exposed butt, then you should watch this. If you liked the Devil's Backbone, del Toros' other ghost movie that is very similar to this one, then you should definitely go for it.Just know what to expect, so you won't be as disappointed as I was.",Crimson Peak

Storyline was weak at best, and there was a lot of plot holes. Visually I did like the house, but the cgi ghosts were awful. I haven't read the book so I don't know how much of it is in this movie but it did not live up to the hype at all. The thing that bothered me the most was the love story. It seemed to have been created out of thin air. I mean they fell deeply in love within hours without saying more than a few words to each other?! Sure it's possible but it just didn't seem believable at all. Also, the main character didn't seem to mind the gigantic hole in the ceiling of the house, or that it was sinking into the ground, she just moved right in.

I had to choose a movie from the horror genre, which wasn't my thing, and a friend recommended Crimson Peak. It miraculously held my attention throughout the whole thing (a miracle on it's own since I'm ADHD), and had my heart racing several times. The cast did an amazing job, and the visuals were awe-inspiring. I watched it twice in one day, and enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Definitely one of my new favourites.

Story: Story is exceptional with plenty of intrigue, suspense, and many factors that keep one interested and invested as to what may happen next.Characters: Acting allowed for the characters to have a life of their own and be completely believable as people.Effects: Visual effects and designs definitely cemented belief in the setting and situations, extremely well done visuals and sets.Lighting: Use of scene-based lighting rather than pure studio lighting is present in most scenes, allowing for added immersion.Sound Design: Sounds do not seem out of place and further add to immersion with their well-done designs.Themes: Set pieces, props, and clothing seem to be quite era-appropriate, once again allowing for a pleasant immersive experience.Expanded (no spoilers)
Though a simple story in premise with only a few unique parts to it, the story elements do not overstay their welcome, or flesh out to become something entirely different from what they were initially established as.The journey that our main characters go through feels natural and enjoyable, having them confront several stopping forces and through a combination of subtle to large changes, evolve as characters. Revolving primarily around three characters for most of the central plot means that there isn't a lot of room to flesh things out under ordinary circumstances, but with the well thought out plot, the characters are able to work off of each other and allows for a lot of small developments within them, going on to further breathe life into the world around them.Characters are established in various levels at the beginning, giving us enough to work with for some, and plenty with others. Though as the movie unfolds, more is learned about all of the characters, allowing for better understanding of what has led to them being the way that they are now, with some more of the twists and secret information being kept until very close to the ending sequence of the movie.Set across an interesting time in which harsh conditions and approval was of utmost importance, the movie manages to handle these themes competently and even manages to play around with them a little, almost leaving them as a backdrop to the overall concept of the movie without forgetting them and making sure that the audience feels connected to the characters.Lighting greatly enhances the immersion in this movie as in several scenes the lighting excels at creating atmosphere, reflecting character personalities, what they bring to the table, and most importantly, allowing a scene to feel correct with depth and lighting style.Extra (spoilers)
Filled to the brim with symbology right from the start, Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is plagued with the ability to see ghosts, including that of her own mother, which haunts her, though as we come to learn rather quickly, this is not a malicious spirit, and is benevolent and guiding, something shared by the other ghosts presented in the film.Suspense is successfully built up after the arrival of Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddlestone) and Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) when they have a short but crucial interaction with Edith's father, Carter Crushing (Jim Beaver). We quickly learn that all is not as it seems, though not quite at the depth revealed as the story continues.Edith is torn between two worlds from the very start, wanting to write about ghosts as an author, and conforming to the societal norm. Through that inner turmoil reflects the outside world she is living in, when she begins to fall in love with Thomas Sharpe, she has a chance at escaping all that her life has become and taking charge. However, her father puts a stop to that when he feels that something is not quite right between Edith and Thomas, being suspicious of him from before when mentioning the amount of times Thomas has reached out for help across various places.Edith eventually ends up going to Crimson Peak, unaware of its name at that time, previously having been advised from deceased mother to ""Beware of the Crimson Peak"".A large portion of the movie takes place within the house in Crimson Peak, where Lucille offers Edith some tea on a few occasions, we learn rather quickly to believe that something isn't right with the tea, and it is later revealed to be poisoned, a great display of Lucille's character. Showing that she is subtle in the way she deals with her problems but hinting that her toxicity is a deep flaw.Edith, slowly dying from the poison would begin to suspect the happenings at Crimson Peak with the interference and guidance of a few spirits, including that of Lucille and Thomas's mother.Thomas and Lucille plan to have Edith die once she has signed off a transfer deed, granting the Sharpes ownership over her estate, not longer having need of her afterwards.During this time, we learn of Thomas's multiple marriages and the fact that Lucille had been in a mental institution, furthering the ""something isn't right"" feeling.Up until around three quarters in to the movie, Thomas has been all for Lucille's plan and excited to go about this prospect once again, though now starts to feel suffocated by her presence in his life, wanting to leave that life all behind and start anew, having actually fallen in love with Edith. This advances Thomas's character and serves as a strong growth point for his character, showing a divide between the once perfect sibling couple. Lucille is unable to accept this information, and once Thomas burns the signed papers, Lucille lets her jealousy take control, killing her brother in a blind rage.With the final confrontation taking place outside of the house, Edith fights off Lucille, aided by the ghost of Thomas. Edith tells Lucille to turn around to look at her brother, Lucille doing so. Upon seeing the ghost of her brother, it is clear that her character has developed in her final moments. Having had either no guilt, or such little guilt over her previous murders, she was not able to see the ghosts within the house. Seeing the ghost of her brother shows that there is a guilt weighing on her now that was once not present, this being all Edith needed to get a final blow on Lucille, freeing herself from that nightmare.Returning to the beginning of the movie, it shows that a core plot point is that you never escape the ghosts of your past, only ignore for so long until they manifest, and you are unable to escape what has happened. Though this is portrayed differently with Edith and Lucille. Edith is able to learn from these past incidents and ghosts, allowing for her to survive where they had not, accepting the past and trying for a better future, whereas with Lucille, she is unable to move on from the past and these ghosts end up serving as a sign that her past has caught up to her, finally being too much for her to escape from.Overall the movie is extremely well directed, written, lit, designed, and acted out. The concept though simple was well executed and made for an entertaining and informative movie that I would highly recommend.",Crimson Peak

Also you know no big deal but directed by Guillermo Del Toro!!! (I was also very pleased to see Jim Beaver after my supernatural days)This has become my favorite film of all time. Aside from an A+ cast this movie had so much going for it. Period drama, fantastic score, a downright creepy and spooky setting, gorgeous costumes, a heart wrenching romance, and twists at every corner. Yes the plot could be considered lack luster but its not meant to be some life changing experience. Its a spooky scary movie about a spooky scary house with a cast that gives it their all.Crimson Peak is a masterpiece and I will never grow sick of singing its praises. If you haven't seen it, Go watch it now. And If you have seen it and you're a fellow movie enthusiast like me watch all the documentaries and YouTube essays about this movie.

I love Guillermo Del Toro and think that's Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best movies ever made. And Crimson Peak was very good. Not as amazing as Pan's Labyrinth and not as scary as the trailer makes it seem, but definitely worth seeing. The costumes and makeup were fabulous and the set design, and cinematography were gorgeous and the casting was great. The violence and gore and the whole kind of fairytale atmosphere of the film were signature del Toro. The violence was quite graphic in some instances, such as a character's head being repeatedly bashed, crushing their skull and leaving their face pretty much in recognizable. Definitely worth seeing but I just wish it had been scarier. I'd give it a 7.5, maybe 8 out of 10.",Crimson Peak

The characters are bland and unoriginal, as are the actors performance, but there is simply nothing for them to work with.At no point was I scared or startled or impressed, but rather found myself wondering if it was ever going to get interesting.

446,BBeaV,Extremely Disappointing Gothic Film from the Amazing Del Toro,3,19 October 2015,"2 stars are for the beauty, detailed beautiful fashion, and haunting screen shots in the film. One more star for Guillermo del Toro ---because I love him. That said, there isn't much in this film for us to go on. Crimson Peak is neither romance nor a ghost story. It treks upon a betrayal drama with a inkling of 'supposed' romance but none of the relationships stand out significantly to our disappointment.A beautiful young wealthy American woman name Edith (played by Mia Wasikowska) falls for a tall dark Handsome British Baronet Thomas Sharpe ( played by Tom Hiddleston) and moves to England with him after her father was mysteriously murdered, ghosts appear and seems to haunt her in the decapitating house of Thomas and his sister Lucia (Jessica Chastain) is cold, harboring resentment to everyone, especially to Edith. Portrayed as interesting, quick witted and perceptive in the first 40 minutes, Edith quickly becomes fearful, and delusional in the house---- Ghosts appear but they did little to explain the story, the twist quickly comes when Edith realizes through a series of investigation at night-- that Lucia and Thomas were a scheme. Thomas would marry rich women to get their money to invest in his inventions and Lucia murders the wives them by poisoning their tea. Of course the implied love story here is that Thomas has fallen for Edith, he woos her in America and marries her and although scheming her, he does make love to her after a night out of the house when they got snowed in at the post office, even declaring she is not the 'others' (other wives he had schemed). But the romance is neither believable nor substantial when he declares he loves her near end of movie. Edith soon finds out Thomas and Lucia were having an incestual relationship, discovering them having sex after an apparition leads her to Lucia's room; the declaration of love on Thomas's part later in film comes off as weak and entirely unbelievable. Lucia throws Edith off the balcony when Edith found them and she wakes up in a chair, saved by Dr. Alan McMichael (Edith's friend from America who came to save her; played by Charlie Hunnam ). Ending unravels in a mess, Lucia killing Thomas over his apparent love for Edith and the madwoman chasing Edith around in the snow outside, when Thomas's ghost appear, distracting the guilt ridden Lucia for a split second thus allowing Edith to snap Lucia's head with a shovel. Edith saves Dr. McMichael and they walk out into the snow away from Crimson Peak.The ghosts---- in the film were used only when 'necessarily' thus even the supernatural aspect of the film felt cheap. The romance between Edith and Thomas hardly exist and exasperated the ending where he declared her love while there was no significant or interaction in film to show proof of that. There was very little chemistry among the actors and that is proof among Hiddleston's portrayal of Thomas and Chastain's portrayal of Lucia: although in a incestual relationship born out of a childhood bonding from their isolation from the outside world and parental abuse, it was came off as forced and off putting. Overall plot to the film was weak, with very little character development, there was even a intriguing short dialogue where Edith explains to Thomas that characters in books can freely chose who they can be , further implying Thomas had a decision in his part of scheme and can change but that neither explored or investigated later in film. However Hiddleston's performance as Thomas is convincing and outstanding, at times convincing us of Thomas's humanity but unfortunately his character experiences no true revelation of his own. Viewers can see he is a mere lover/puppeteer to Lucia and he dies expectedly so. He cowardly saves Dr. Alan McMichaelson but from second half of the movie, falls into a secondary character. Neither could he save himself; or in this manner, his supposed romantic interest : Edith. Lucia however, quickly become a central character in the film, unveiling her evil motivations, exercising sexual and maternal possessive role over Thomas, and confessing to Edith of her murders including Edith's father. The beautiful bright Edith portrayed by Mia was interesting in first portion of film but quickly falls wayside when half of second movie was her running around in dark halls of Crimson Peak, delusional and confused----much like the viewers. She becomes highly reactive and immature, losing our interest as viewers to trust that our narrative character could change the current situation or respond in a coherent manner.Viewers within first hour of movie will waiting --anticpiating-- for Del Toro's master storytelling: will it be a horror film full of ghosts, or rather a mystery/crime period piece? A true Gothic love story with strong romantic lead characters? Unfortunately It was none of those.Although Del Toro's other Gothic fairytale Pan's Labyrinth was dark, mysterious , scary, fantastical, violent and beautiful, Del Toro was able to bring to it such a depth of humanity with surprisingly moments full of joy, love, compassion and even innocent wonder ---all which were deeply lacking in Crimson Peaks. Crimson Peaks simply put-----is lifeless, much like the ghosts haunting the halls of Baronet Thomas Sharpe's mansion.",Crimson Peak
447,Maestroo7,"Perfect Halloween movie, great atmosphere, loved it!",8,15 March 2016,"For those who don't fancy horror, don't worry, if there's something I don't watch a lot it's horror. This movie however is not the cheap 'booing-accompanied-by-sudden-loud-noise' kinda story. The setup, the drop by drop delivery of the mystery, and the portraying of ghosts (yes, there are ghosts but no spoiler here because we know that after the first sentence of the movie; I would say its not a ghost story, it's more of a story with ghosts in it but that will make sense only when you watch the movie) all part of a plan of a great director who brought us 'Pan's labyrinth'. Visually often the 'you can't take your eyes off of it' kind of creepy. Mixed with brilliant game with the lighting and such beautiful and vivid colors that come through even the darkest corridors.Sensing the big secret behind the main characters is not a big deal, actually my version of the background halfway into the film turned out to be better (or just more creepy...) than the actual one. It's only partly about secrets.The set was exactly what it was supposed to be. I loved the costumes, loved the way people were phrasing sentences, and loved the whole set. But the big house the second half of the movie focused on, was just the perfect place to get scared. Every time the mansion was on the screen I felt that I was mostly amazed and a little frightened somehow (pretty much what one would expect watching a Tim Burton movie) but - weirdly - feeling every single time a little bit more impressed by the measures of it, by the beauty it once may have had. And every time I saw the defects of the house my disgust started turning into 'Wow how cool is that!' As for the faint-hearted who don't like the sight of inner organs and blood, on a list of 1-10 (where 10 represents Elm street amount of blood mixed with Tarantino's detailed sound effects and 1 stands for... say, SpongeBob...,) I'd give it a 6 or 7 because of the finale of the movie.

I'm not sure who would have been scared or even remotely freaked out by this movie. The cgi ghosts are cool looking, but not creepy or scary at all. I think the best scene in the movie was when the father got his face smashed on the sink and the bloody water is going everywhere. Besides the cool visuals everyone's dialogue made me roll my eyes.

Even if (like me) you aren't a fan of the genre, I think you'll be able to appreciate its quality. Also, the acting was fantastic. I have two quibbles:1. I thought the ghosts were . . . not very scary. Their hands were creepy as hell, and catching glimpses of them guttering down hallways was scary, but once you got a good luck at their faces, they were liked evil Wallace and Gromits, with the oversized, misshapen Día de Muertos skulls. Plus that shade of red reminds me of over-lacquered knickknacks at Chinese restaurants.2. Tom Hiddleston's character was kind of beta, and I infinitely prefer alphas. BUT.

452,Aretean,Misunderstood Plot? (Contains lots of SPOILERS),10,17 October 2015,"I agree with all the reviews about the exquisite setting, costumes, the magnificent old rundown mansion that is Aderllel Hall. What I really want to talk about here though is the Plot of the movie, and beware there are so many spoilers in this it is probably best to read it if you have watched the movie or have no intention to watch it, or do not mind find out about the entire story before watching it.I had been following Crimson Peak from when the trailers were first released and was very much drawn into its beauty and the mystery that was portrayed, thinking there will an unexpected twist or ending, but there wasn't, so I walked out of the theatre slightly dissatisfied and with a lot of questions.I knew I liked the movie because it's beautiful and I felt the chemistry between Edith and Thomas, I thought they both played their part brilliantly and their feelings were very believable, I also enjoyed watching Lucille. But I was undecided yet whether I should have loved it because something didn't make sense yet. I was equally dissatisfied that I had to believe Del Toro really just spend all his energy building this beautiful set, the costumes and completely disregarded the plot? All the reviews I later read were also split between dissatisfied viewer's criticism on the plot with the appearance of the ghosts for what? and fans with repetitive praise over the visual effects. later when I thought through the movie scene by scene, it all became clear to me, and it was apparent I had my energy and focus on the wrong expectation and missed the point of the movie. I would like to blame the trailers... ""This is not a ghost story, it is a love story with ghosts in it..."" Edith tells this to Thomas in one of their exchangesWe have to really realise that Crimson Peak is not a narrated by anyone else but Edith herself, no one else is telling us this story but Edith. And in fact it is the very story Edith had been writing throughout the movie, that love story with ghosts in it..""The ghosts are merely metaphors of the past...""Someone in a review asked why Edith's mother's ghost came to warn her about Crimson Peak but her dad's ghost never came to warn her? The ghosts are not real, they were merely metaphors, The Sharpes targeted widows and their lone daughters and it is the time when Edith's mother died that Edith became a destined victim, the ghost that came to warn her is a metaphor of this destiny. Do you remember the encounter at the publishing house? Edith runs into the mother of Sharpe's original chosen victim, in response to her attacking Edith:""you will die a spinster"" Edith rebels to her saying:""I would rather be Mary Shelley and die a widow (referring to back to her)"" is a subtle confirmation of the criteria the Sharpes used to choose their victims.The other ghosts were also woven into the story by no other than Edith herself as she recollects her time at the Aderllel Hall, from the first time she enters, the eerie feelings it may have given her and all the supposed secrets it was hiding. Many in their reviews asked why is it that the Sharpes can not see them? they are not hallucinations and they are not ghosts she actually saw but metaphors of what was hidden, the secrets.Many other 'plot holes' also start to make sense once you realise the story is told by Edith. I initially spent some time contemplating the time when Thomas showed up wet at Edith's house after being in the rain for a long time, it was never explained later what caused him to do so, had he fallen in love with Edith at first sight at her father's office? Did he think she had more money that the other chosen victim? Perhaps he thought she was an easier target to sign her fortune away. It was never explained, and rightly so, because whatever the truth is, Edith or anyone for that fact would never know, and will never know...But this is Edith's love story, it's about her love, her doubts and her pain. Every scene is actually a recollection from her point view, a young girl falling in love for the first time and experiencing through an horrific discovery of secrets hidden from her. Every scene is in the perspective of Edith and no one else, the observations were Edith's observation, it was entirely her world. Once the point of view becomes clear you will find how impeccable everything is about this movie, it's casting, set and even the language.I do think though that the build up to the movie had mislead many looking for a horror story or ghost story, but I also enjoyed the discovery process.

I've never written a review before, but I strongly believe that I have a responsibility toward the human kind to warn you. DON'T WASTE 2 hours of your beautiful life watching this... thing. My friend George says that this movie could be a good cult movie. Kate was apologizing all night for making us see it. Michael was laughing so hard, he was given a verbal warning. Anyway, the ghosts did not contribute anything to the plot. The characters were flat (the only thing the protagonist did was to follow sounds around). The mother was basically scaring the Dejesus of her daughter and scarred her for life (as all mothers do; so touché Del Toro... touché) for no apparent reason. She just served as a haunting spoiler alert. I cannot believe that this script was made into a movie. I am sad. SAD.",Crimson Peak
454,veronikabel,Beautiful and dark Gothic horror movie.,9,22 October 2015,"Movie reviewsI was very excited to watch Crimson Peak. I was expecting a dark story and rather gruesome supernatural characters, judging from Guillermo del Toro's previous work (still have nightmares about that creature with eyes in its palms in Pan's Labyrinth). The supernatural elements are few and very delicately positioned. There aren't a lot of horror elements just for the sake of horror. They are all part of the story. The ghost figures are shown as these dark mangled skeleton figures, covered in black or blood red clay. The their eyes looks chillingly human and tortured. Although they look scary and upsetting, they do not pose a threat to the living. The real threat is very much alive. Furthermore, Edith is the only one who seems to see the ghosts and even though they scare her, they do not wish to harm her, but rather try to help her. Crimson Peak (Allerdale Hall) is magnificent from the inside as well as outside. The huge mansion stands alone on a bare heath. The long driveway is covered in red clay. When Edith first enters the house the leaves are falling through the roof into the middle of the foyer. There is a huge gaping whole in the middle of the house where the roof collapsed, leaving the foyer open to the elements. The foyer is surrounded with massive staircase leading to different parts of the house. There is also and old metal elevator running through the house and into the bowels of the clay mine which is situated right underneath the house. The red glow of the clay makes it look like the way to hell itself. The basement, where the clay is stored, is an interesting space with dome like ceiling where the light and snow falls into the room. During the winter months the whole estate is covered in snow. The grounds around the house however turn red, when the snow falls on the red clay. It looks like the house is bleeding and the blood is seeping out of its deep wounds. The house is full of wonderful rooms, exquisitely furnished and now sinking into decay, the same as their owners. The house and their inhabitants seem equally damaged and full of ghosts of the past. If there was ever a perfect Haunted Mansion this is it! Costumes are another thing that makes this movie worth watching. I love the beautiful fusion of different styles. Edith's old high-necked evening coat as well as her puffed up sleeves on her morning dress. The colors the characters tend to wear are also a reflection of their character and true nature. Edith wears lots of yellow dresses. She is like one of those butterflies we see at the beginning of the movie. Thomas and his sister Lucille with their dark color wardrobes resemble moths, which as Lucille says ""eat butterflies"". More than just a ghost story it is a story of love. It shows how love or the lack of it can damage, destroy, heal and bring back ghosts. The main love story between Edith and Thomas is short lived and tragic. Even though we find out that their marriage was based on a lie, Thomas's love for Edith was real. She is the first person he truly loves and I think his love for her sets him free at the end. The love between Thomas and his sister was born from the lack of love from their parents. They only had each other for a long time and with time their love grew into a deadly poison which was destroying them and everyone who came near them. Edith arrives and brings hope to Thomas of another, better and brighter life. His sister cannot find peace even in death. Her ghost remains in the house, playing the piano, clinging onto her strong emotions of love and hate. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Its story and its characters are well layered and full of little metaphors. And above all the house is truly a masterpiece.",Crimson Peak

It was super slow and really drug out and I actually saw people fall asleep in the theater. I was really hoping once they got through the initial plot set up it would get better, but nope. Then there were the graphics which really surprised me at the lack thereof. It was stuff you see school projects. Very clay-mation or something like that. Anyway, the plot left holes, which I don't mind for #2 but there should never be a number 2 on this movie. I did have on jump but there were several times that if you have EVER watched any scary movie you could say, here it comes and sure enough there it was so there was NO jump or scare just, yep saw that coming 2 minutes ago.

Hiddleston should stick to Shakespeare or Thor. I am a fan of Hiddleston but this is not a good vehicle for him. Del Toro has done much better work in the past. Hopefully, he'll come back much stronger with his next film. The suspense was predictable and boring. The cinematography was good. The sets and costuming were okay but nothing to write home about.

462,bryanlaesch,A Gothic Soap Opera (Spoilers!),2,15 October 2015,"This movie is terrible. It seems like it was made for the sole purpose of being as weird and as twisted as possible. ""You know what's dark? A guy who marries women and kills them for their money."" ""You know what's even darker? A guy who does all that because he's in an incestuous relationship with his older sister."" You get the feeling early on that there's something strange between the brother and sister, and in the back of your mind, you're thinking, ""I really hope this doesn't end up being one of those weird brother-sister things."" And then it does. The most original twist in the movie is that you're supposed to believe that the sister has killed not only three of the brother's wives, but also one wife's child--it turns out that the child is actually the sister's and died from being malformed and sick.Regarding the horror, this movie is not remotely scary. The visuals of the ghosts cease to be scary when the first one appears. There is so much CGI put into them that it looks overdone and super fake. Ghosts need to be done with a light touch because familiarity with monsters takes away their scariness.As for the acting, it wasn't bad but the only one worth mentioning is Jessica Chastain, who plays Lucille Sharpe. She's really good as the creepy, twisted, and perverted older sister.And as for the writing, I never believed that the characters Edith and Thomas were in love because the courtship part of the story seemed rushed. And the awkward and dry sex scene did nothing to convince me.Oh, and normal people can't bleed as much as these characters did without dying. So, is there anything good about the movie? There a few small things:1. Wardrobe: The filmmakers wanted Edith to stand out, not only from the villains, but also from the side characters. Edith was usually seen in bright colors and has blond hair; everyone else was in dark colors and black. 2. Literary References: During the film, there are three references made to some of the best novelists of the 19th century: Jane Austin, Mary Shelley, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Which is strange, because writing seems to take center stage early on, and is then swept aside completely in the second act. 3. Paranormal Theory: Early in the film, the character Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) discusses how he believes that ghosts are tied to certain places because of stone or mineral deposits in the earth. This is an actual theory in the modern ghost hunting community, but I'm not sure if they were aware of this fact in the Victorian period.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is daytime TV tripe. Don't go see it.",Crimson Peak

Much blood is spilled before the heroine and her rescuer emerge slightly the worse for wear but still alive. The setting was depressing rather than eerily atmospheric.

467,mewskadevoted,Crimson Comedy,2,28 October 2015,"Let me begin this review by putting everything into perspective for you: Hey, it was free! And those words pretty much summarize my feelings regarding Crimson Peak. I saw the trailer a few weeks ago and was intrigued by it. A historical ghost story is a pretty enthralling category to start. I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this movie, necessarily, but with Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston to its name, I thought it would at least have a bit more credibility. We begin the movie with our main character, Edith, trying to shop out her manuscript. Shortly thereafter, she first runs into Thomas Sharpe. He is alluring, but ultimately Edith decides to keep her distance. Later, you have the standard 1800s-era waltz scene, where Thomas demands Edith as his partner and all the women oogle at the pairing. Her father, at odds with Thomas, takes matters into his own hands as their nonexistent, chemistry-less romance flourishes (flounders would be a more accurate word, because apparently Edith falls in love after one dance, which...um, okay). He uncovers something about Thomas and his sister, Lucille, and warns him that he better leave. He even pays him off to do so. This brings the first of my gripes. There was never any real suspense set up, because there were scenes between Thomas and Lucille to show that they're not ""good""; we knew they had malicious intentions. I think it would have been more effective to confuse the audience, to let us piece it together along with Edith. Instead, we were handed all the plot foreshadowings on a platter and had each one pointed out to us, labeled, and described. Not the most effective tactics, mind you. My second complaint is directed to whomever did the transitions between scenes. I know the tunnel-out was purposeful, an artistic choice or whatever, but every time the circle paused on the main focal point of the scene and it faded to black I was jerked out of the story. It was extremely campy and it pretty much stole all remaining credibility from the movie, at least in my opinion. That's pretty much all the strength I have for summarizing left in me, so let me touch upon some of the most unbelievable things (and not in the dictionary-definition ""so good it's unreal"" way--I'm talking about the ""honey, it's absolutely unbelievable that you gambled away all our money last night"" way). 1) Mia Wasikowska's acting: I really liked her in ""Jane Eyre"", so believe me, I'm not saying she's a bad actress or anything. I just didn't love her acting in this. My mom's friend, who saw the movie with us, first pointed it out. I had thought something was maybe off about her scenes, but that cemented it for me. Her acting was just not very good. Any and all emotional reaction from her seemed extremely fake and forced, and her voice veered into wooden territory many a time. I just don't think this was the role for her. 2) The violence: I had no idea this movie would be so violent. It was more violence than it was horror, really--especially near the end. Something does happen in the beginning, though, that's pretty graphic, and arguably maybe the most graphic happening. The violence was all pretty visual and the shock-factor was there, but it went so over-the-top at the end of the movie that--wait for it--we started laughing. In the theater. The most unbelievable thing happens when (MAJOR SPOILER) Lucille stabs Thomas. Okay, we get that. She's knife-happy. But then she stabs him again, and then she just kind of--well--she pretty much jams the knife into his cheek. Yeah. It wasn't beautiful. The horrible thing is, I had to stifle a giggle. I think I was grinning in disbelief. And later, after we were out of the theater, I laughed aloud thinking back to that scene. It was so over-the-top that it, again, completely jarred me out of the movie and so blunt and so ridiculous that I just had to laugh. Hence the title ""Crimson Comedy"". Later, my Mom actually did laugh, when amidst silence and tension Edith hits Lucille over the head with a shovel and it produces this ringing, cartoon-esque booooing. She had to cover her mouth in the theater to stop herself, and then I started laughing, because it really was ridiculous. So, yeah: if you want a couple of incredulous laughs, this movie's for you! The good, redeeming things about this movie are that first, it was watchable. It might have been terrible, but it was a watchable terrible. Second, it did have some good moments. Jessica Chastain is the best, and I've thought that since seeing her in ""The Help"". Its amazing to me that she can go from a character like Miss Celia to Lucille with so effortlessly, and made even more so by the fact that, even with Miss Celia's ""This. Is. So. Fun!"" ringing in my ears, I still believed her as Lucille. I would argue that the most poignant part of this movie is when Lucille whips around with the pan in her hand and almost hurtles it toward Edith. First, because it gave us a clean-cut, uncontrolled view into her crazy mind. It was unsettling because you could see the insanity in her eyes, because it was such a close call, and because she was just barely coherent enough not to do it. That was a scene that wasn't handed to us. They didn't point to Lucille's insanity with words but rather let her actions speak for themselves, as they should have done the entire movie.Overall,this was kind of terrible, and I wouldn't watch it again. 2/10, don't recommend, unless you want it to prompt some inappropriately-timed laughter on your part.",Crimson Peak

I wanted to like this movie, i like Charlie, Mia, Tom, etc but they are working with such a hokey/super campy script that it pulls you straight out of the narrative. i wanted so much more! Also as bad as the opening the act is, it's actually way better than the third act. (middle act is so-so) So with that said, wait for hbo/redbox, it's something you'll be annoyed you spent 12 bucks for. on a side note Tom Hiddleston did prove to be decent actor outside of Loki.

Thirty minutes into the movie and I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror movie or a old time love story. Without giving away spoilers, progression was slow. The end was very anticlimactic.

Yes there might be historical inaccuracies and all i have to say about that is: it's a fantasy movie, man, don't look for it in history books. As for horror- wise it might not be the most creatury feature out there yet it possesses one of the most beautifully balanced real/fantasy horror notes. There is supernatural yet the supernatural is but emphasis to the real evil, the one that is incarnate here, flesh and blood.

And although not his best display, it's hard not to gaze up at in the October darkness and get lost in.",7,19 October 2015,"As is always the case with Guillermo Del Toro and his dark fairy tales, the art direction and cinematography in Crimson Peak is stunning. Step for step with the anthropomorphic architecture is Kate Hawley's costume design, a showcase of ruffled and laced Victorian gowns drenched in deep blues and crimsons for the ominous, and veiled coppers and beiges for the less assuming. Aesthetically, it demands to be seen.A self-proclaimed Gothic romance, Peak follows Mia Wasikowska's Buffalo, New York Industrial Era ingénue, Edith Cushing, and her dreams of turning a haunted reality into print fiction. Before her pen turns to type, enterprising outsider Thomas Sharpe(Tom Hiddleston)and his eerie, yet elegant sister Lucille(Jessica Chastain) supplant her notions of normalcy and her sunny, Western New York sky turns endlessly obsidian. Although creepy throughout and quite literally set in a house of Technicolor horrors, Peak is far from a horror movie, which the film's marketing department did a pretty bad job of...marketing. The weakness in the film is in its screenplay, which doesn't do a great job of burying the twist or fleshing out most of the leads (specifically Wasikowska and Charlie Hunnam's characters). Even without a wealth of meat to work with, Tom Hiddleston is indefensibly charming as he wades through his murky inventions and intentions and Jessica Chastain is all-in, stealing the show with a devilishly unhinged performance of a woman fraying at the seams of her questionable intent.

There aren't many horror factors since it is more about the love stories. The visuals and the acting, however, is brilliant. The house that ""breathes, bleeds and remembers"" definitely adds up a creepy feeling to the movie. The ghosts in the house are beautifully made but aren't even scary, their jobs is to make people feel sympathetic. The protagonists Lady Lucille and Sir Thomas are perfectly portrayed but i'm not sure about Edith. You can feel how evil but also heart-broken Lucille is when she angrily stabs Thomas , you can see the overwhelming sorrow in Thomas's eyes when he looks at Edith and Lucille...

475,stoeberj1,Overstated metaphor meets period drama with an Edge,6,17 January 2016,"I went into this movie without reading any criticism as I am a huge fan of Del Toro's and I get shivers every time I see Del Toro with a writing and/or directing credit. If you're expecting Pan's Labyrinth level of originality, look elsewhere. If you are expecting a ghost story with thrills and jumps, although there may be a few, look elsewhere. If you are expecting a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense -horror, look elsewhere.If you're looking for a romance film that is beautifully shot and acted, and that plays out as the story goes with a certain level of prediction, you've arrived at the right film (granted with quite a bit more ""crimson"" than any other romance I've seen). Del Toro takes a tired genre (how many Jane Austin films are there now?) and adds a twist to the genre. A gory genre twist. To put this film in the ""Horror"" category doesn't seem correct to me and honestly is somewhat misleading. It is more like ""Hor-Drama"". I have to admit the film was predictable, but I believe it was intended to be so. I don't necessarily think this film was intended to be super deep, or super secretive in its plot layout, much like the romance films in this period. Just like some similar period films, the facts of the story are presented from all angles, making the plot obvious to the viewer, but not the characters in the film, making the viewer attach to the characters that much more.Two downfalls I saw during this film. A lot of the character development happens within the last twenty minutes that the audience would already have known if they paid an ounce of attention throughout the beginning of the film. I felt myself identifying that I already knew these things about the characters, and frankly what could have been a climatic moment, was reduced to a moment of dull satisfaction. The metaphor of crimson peak is drilled into our brains over and over and over again throughout the film. This is potentially the one thing that could have been saved for the last possible moment in a great crescendo yet was given out too early in the film.Two greatness's I saw during this film.The direction is beautiful, as almost every scene could be a painting in and of itself. The characters are dressed and acted in exactly how they are meant to be portrayed. The acting (except for Charlie, not a huge fan) is spot on. Each character plays their role to a ""T"", nailing both the fragile innocence, and the dark hatred.6 out of 10 for this one.",Crimson Peak

479,nmason8275,Del Toro's Gothic Romance,8,16 October 2015,"Crimson Peak was a good film as a whole, but unfortunately the horror aspect was lacking. It is a gorgeous film, the way the shots are shown, lighting, costumes and setting, special effects, its a very visually impressive film. There is a scene towards the end involving a confrontation between Hunnam and Hiddleston and the shot of them standing in the door at the end of the fight with the winter storm in the background is my favorite in the whole film. It's not an original story and it is predictable, but its executed excellently by its main cast, especially by Hiddleston and Chastain playing the Sharpe siblings. Tom Hiddleston's performance was entertaining as always. He carries a special suave and charisma with his acting and it shows in his character. You know that there is something mischievous about him. His eyes are the most expressive feature of his person. Jessica Chastain's character was probably my favorite to be honest. I love Hiddleston, but Chastain's Lucille Sharpe character has just the right balance of insanity and caring sincerity when it comes to protecting everything that her brother and her achieved. This is a character that is up there with Essie Davis's Amelia (Babadook) and Julie Harris's Eleanor Lance (The Haunting). The rest of the cast did a good job. While I'm not a fan of Wasikowska's past characters like Alice from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, she was fine as the main heroine of the movie. Charlie Hunnam is another actor that I enjoy watching when the role is right. I hated Pacific Rim and his role in Crimson Peak is a good one, but you could've gotten almost any other A- list actor and he probably would have had the same impact as Hunnam had on me. Again, its not a scary movie, atmospheric sure, and if you watch it in a theater the loud stingers might make you jump, but Del Toro himself said its not supposed to be a horror movie but a Gothic romance, which I completely agree. Sure the visuals of the ghosts are disturbing but its not nearly as jumpscare heavy as recent horror movies have been. The Gift is not even a horror movie but it still scared me more than this because of how realistic it is. My heart was pounding more watching The Gift then some of the jumps during this movie. I was more smiling and somewhat laughing listening to the audiences reactions then being scared myself. Final thoughts, a fantastic, visually outstanding film that is led by a great cast but unfortunately falls short on the horror side of it.",Crimson Peak

But bit too predictable and bit too rush/",7,17 October 2015,"First of all, I want to say sorry for my bad English, and grammar.I will give the score 7,5 out of 10. The movie is good, beautiful and amazing and I like the setting of story. But the movie is bit too predictable and bit too rush. But overall the story is good. And don't ask why, but I got bit turn on when I watched this movie.And, *Spoiler Warning!* I smiled and almost laughed when I saw the moment when the ghosts showed up and Thomas pulled out the knife from his face after got stabbed by his sister because of her jealousy. And I enjoyed the fighting scene between Edith and Lucile. It really made me excited when I watched it.And it's really sweet when I watched the relationship between Thomas and Edith, and Thomas fell in love with her because she is different (in my opinion different than his other wives(maybe) and women, because of her interest of ghosts and some of his work. Because in my opinion not many women in Victorian era interested with a men work especially the nobles).The movies is bit too predictable, especially the sharpe siblings relationship. I can predicted it when I watched the trailer few times, and bit too rush in love relationship between Edith and Thomas (which is still okay for me).But Overall, the movie is good and amazing. I will wait for another Guilermo's movie, and I will have a good dream tonight after I watched this movie.",Crimson Peak

484,jdclaw,I am not afraid of these ghosts. Where is the Horror?,4,31 October 2015,"While the plot of this movie seemed very interesting, with a superb pallet of color, and Gothic theme, as well as a familiar face Tom, it just falls short of something really worth watching.I knew what was going to happen for the most part within the first 20 min of this movie. Only you will be waiting for something interesting to finally happen, and when it does, you just feel nothing(aside from a few gruesome scenes). This movie was just boring exposition, complete filler, and dare I say horrible acting from the main protagonist.It was like Misery, only it wasn't like Misery. It just sucked. Keeping someone captive to get something for yourself. Without the whole crazy about a book series, but about money.""Look out behind you."" at the end. Expecting to see the man who was stabbed only to see Thomas in his ghost form do nothing but stand there.Thinking back on this movie just gives me a brain aneurysm.The scary/horrific scenes were pretty gruesome (well a few were), but I just couldn't feel for the characters. The Gothic theme just wasn't enough to hold my interest in a movie filled with drab conversations and boring exposition.The entire Key missing scene was just horrible. Obviously the protagonist took it, who the hell else was going to take it, by that time you know the jig is up. Get the dumb woman to sign the paper and kill her. Why drag it out and have the doctor stabbed by Thomas only to be forgotten at the pivotal moment when he could have been the one to save her. He obviously showed interest in her from the beginning and throughout the movie.Why not go check the suitcase? Why tell her to stay out of the lower levels then not ever go down there until the end of the movie for a slasher flick session.Screw this movie for getting me interested in a ghost story only to be let down by a horrible execution.YOU WANT SOME TEA? ILL GET YOU SOME MORE TEA....",Crimson Peak
485,lacvegas,Del Toro did it again,9,14 October 2015,"Just for the record, i'm not a fan of horror movies. The only reason i watched Crimson Peak was the director: Guillermo Del Toro. His previous movies showed that he is a genius whose mind is filled with creativity, moreover he is able to turn his visions into reality. He has a great sense to create unique worlds and his ability to balance CGI and practical effects makes these worlds more existing.I was terrified and amazed at the same time. Visually this movie is unexceptional, i wanted to carefully examine every piece of it, but the scary theme didn't ""allow"" me to immerse deep in this visual beauty for too long. The tension was built up well and constant fear of the unknown was in the air all the time. Music was a very good ""wingman"" of the thrill and well-timed sound effects added even more to the overall experience.Many famous trademarks of Del Toro were smuggled into the events successfully. The sets, make ups, costumes looked amazing, but (for me) the most impressing was the creative use of colours. The external and internal design of the house ensured a perfect environment for the creepy atmosphere. This atmosphere was the major element that captivated me from the beginning till the end. That thrill that carried me through the movie is hard to describe. I was under the influence of fear and anxiety, so all elements were in the right place to make your heart beat faster.Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska were great, but Jessica Chastain was clearly the one who almost stole the whole show. Her character was cold, seductive, mysterious and scary at the same time. I couldn't even decide whether to love or hate her.All in all, Crimson Peak is another masterpiece of Del Toro. I recommend this movie even for those who don't like horror movies, because this is one of the few that offers much more than jump scares and unimaginative stories.",Crimson Peak
486,jackypetters,A dark love story with a splash of gore.,8,16 October 2015,"Crimson is ""of a rich deep red color inclining to purple"". It's a color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure - all of which are contained in Del Toro's latest film, Crimson Peak.Guillermo del Toro is no stranger to adding detailed elements in a film to add depth, subtle or not. In Crimson Peak, his use of color and setting accompany the characters in a dark Gothic tale of love and deceit, with a sprinkle of suspense and gore that take the viewer on an enchanting experience. Rich color tones stylize the film for a gritty and unique ambiance. Edith, the main heroine, lives in a world where everything is dull and dark. But her presence, however, is evident in subdued yellows, greens, and neutral colors as she stands out in the world she resides in. Her pale skin and light hair also attribute to the innocence that she attains.The story itself takes the viewer down a dark path, following the love between two people from two different worlds. Del Toro was smart with the balance of action and build up. For just a brief time did the story feel slow, but it later facets to the build up of later scenes. Although this film wasn't as thrilling as I tend to prefer, it did a beautiful job of telling a dark love story that held hints of violence, making it just as enjoyable. I couldn't help but feel that Del Toro paid homage to some of the classics, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Nosferatu, and even his own Pans Labyrinth and Mama with his use of transitions, shadows, symbolism, and sound.If you're looking for a film that is romantic with a dredge of somber, makes you uncomfortable yet hopeful, leaves you heartbroken but still enamored - all while being visually breathtaking, then Crimson Peak should be at the top of your list.",Crimson Peak
487,jux_ta_pose-75060,Its a sumptuous feast for the eyes,8,16 October 2015,"Guillermo del Toro really knows how to draw you into his world and the depth of this pretty world is astounding. I mean if this doesn't win Oscar's for Set Design and Costume i'd be shocked. I found it eerie but not necessarily scary, but maybe that's just me. All the acting and actors are stunning and the love story is believable. Jessica Chastain's performance stands out (you can see why she's such hot property right now) but Tom Hiddleston and Mia Wasikowska are also truly wonderful as the lovers. Although I do believe Tom could charm a nun he's that convincing and he devours the screen in every scene.I was blown away by the set, the house and all it contained it was just so rich and delightful you just want to live in that set minus the ghosts for a little while, it's that inviting. It's perhaps the story itself that lets it down a bit. Let's just say it's not exactly something you haven't seen before in films. Not that i'm saying don't go see this film because it still has plenty to entice you.",Crimson Peak
488,aurasilversky,Crimson Peak Starts Wonderfully But Then Disappears,5,16 October 2015,"Del Toro's movie was just like Edith's book in the film. It needed more real romance, not some weird contrived romance that never felt real at all in any facet...and just missing something despite a lot of potential. So much wasted potential.I am very disappointed by this film. I was looking forward to something with Del Toro (as well as Hiddleston) for some time. While I'm not generally a fan of much horror I do tend to like Gothic romance. I feel that this story started out delivering all of that.I love the cinematography, the staging, and the costumes. Everything was gloriously detailed and lovely. I really enjoyed the amount of effort that went into the pictures as they were made. Sadly, the plot starts wonderfully and is even a bit surprising but then it falls flat and doesn't get up again. I'm not sure if parts were just a result of poor editing, or if it was planned to become dull after the trio move to England.The opening was really inviting, there was a lot of promise in the plot. Some of the hints for the future were a little obvious in my opinion but others were less so. I feel like the director must have been trying to insult people that like romance because there was incredibly little. There were a few lines that didn't feel all that romantic and instead felt a little more like bad smut novel lines. Once you get to England and the haunted house things just get weird. Half the time no one is around as Edith wanders about discovering all the murders that the siblings were up to. Edith is almost always left to her own devices while Thomas works on his red clay machine and his sister...plays the piano and I dunno...sharpens her knives? I guess they must have been off practicing the 'incest is best' mentality almost all of the time - to include the middle of the night. Why does she never ask her husband why he is never actually in bed with her? Is this for the same reason none of his marriages have been consummated without any questions? A tradition followed by law to this day. She just assumes all husbands don't want their wives? What? This was the first of many glaring issues.Why is the heroine first depicted as incredibly clever, self-reliant, and capable in the first half of the film? (Before they arrive at the crumbling manor - I now take this to be a symbol for what is about to happen to the movie.) All of these aspects sort of fall apart when she ignores all manner of clues despite previously noticing small details. When she, even though she has the money, just goes along with living in the estate at all when all logic dictates to not...yeah, well there goes a reasonably intelligent main character. Damn, we had one for the first half.Then suddenly he does have sex with her the night they're in town? Why? It was just ill-timed, forced, and awkward, not romantic. I think Del Toro just figured he'd sell the movie more if he added a bizarre Hiddleston sex scene.From the first scene with both siblings I knew they were shagging. It's not like it's a new theme for Del Toro. He's done it before. (Hellboy 2) It was overtly predictable and boring. Which leads me to believe he must have had some pretty unhealthy thoughts about his own sister. Thomas as a character felt worthless. Never was I convinced he actually loved Edith, I think he just really wanted to love her and wanted her as an escape from his abusive sister. I didn't feel bad for anyone. Thomas was a coward, that was pretty obvious and clear from the get go. Edith would have been good if she hadn't suddenly turned into a retard instead of seeking real help.The ending bothered me the most. The order of it was just all over the place. Thomas was bumbling about like the imbecile he is. He doesn't come to really mean much of anything. Edith saves herself and he just wanders in to his sister's lair. He might as well have just stabbed himself in the face and saved everyone else the trouble of his existence. His presence might have meant something if he would have walked in to declare that this wasn't okay and that he was going to let Edith go or that they'd live together or something in his crazy head BEFORE Edith had already saved herself. But since Edith had already seemingly stabbed the bitch in the heart (a lot of that pen went pretty deep) it wasn't really meaningful. That plot arrangement was just as pointless as the character, Thomas.Then crazy sister goes on a merry chase when she's been stabbed heavily near her heart. Cause you know, she wouldn't be bleeding to death or anything...evil people don't bleed, just not totally horrible ones. Then finally Edith doesn't get any real help from Thomas' ghost other than to function as the oldest trick in the book: 'hey look over there!' before she smashes in evil sister's head. Wow really? Worst ending I've seen in a long time. If at least he would have intervened before Edith saved herself then it might have had an ounce of feeling, but this was just poorly put together. So incredibly hollow, I'm sad good acting was wasted on that.",Crimson Peak
489,shaoyiming,Mundane movie without creativity,1,17 October 2015,"My girlfriend insisted on this movie rather than the Tom Hardy action flick LEGEND.Crimson Peak had my attention with how it LOOKED for about 15 minutes. The setting was believably authentic, the actors and actresses beautiful in all their movie star glory, and the imagery vivid. However, the plot was filled with cliché elements. For example, the incest element has been played to death by the hit show Game of Thrones, beautiful brother and sister sex simply does not arouse WOOs and WOWs any more. There is no play on the moral ground here, the audience nowadays are too morally desensitised by something like this. The ""marry a rich woman only for her money"" gambit is no shocker either. Bring me some real action, if i want to question human morality i simply have to go on youtube and enter search terms related to the Middle East and all its hideous violence. Crimson Peak, you are bland. Unbearably bland.In terms of being a horror flick, the suspense created in Crimson Peak does not cut it. You never feel that the protagonist Edith is in any real danger. The ghosts are dull and tasteless. There is no spite, no hate, no aggressiveness that you would normally associate with ghosts that have the back stories like they do in Crimson Peak. Make the ghosts do things, instead of having them crawl around like mindless zombies.Overall, my girlfriend is very satisfied with the movie because all that she is after is ogling at ""Loki"" from Avengers and Thor. She may even became moist when ""Loki"" and Edith engaged in some R-rated action in the wood cabin.If you have a choice, go see LEGEND, instead of this garbage. If you don't, make sure you buy plenty of comfort food so you can nom your way through this yawn fest.",Crimson Peak
490,chrisroch-95769,Bored badly,2,18 October 2015,"The plot telegraphed everything so you know what is going to happen way before it does happen. The character development seems interesting, for about twenty minutes... The supernatural parts are brief and rather pointless. The decor and costuming come off as of only mild interest and the house itself... more pathetic than anything else. The acting was stiff and rather lame. The villains come off as incompetent, not particularly menacing. There is a small element of steam punk to it that feels thrown in for no particular reason. The landscape around the house was not spooky at all, but rather dry and sterile. Del Toro seems to think throwing in a bunch of insects adds something. It does add something, which is to make you wish you were watching a Peter Greenaway movie for real, instead. A Stephen King TV mini series would beat this by a country mile. Save your money.",Crimson Peak
491,geckosquid,"A film so good, you'll have to see it twice to realize it",10,20 October 2015,"As a die-hard fan of del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth has been my favorite film for some time now), I went into Crimson Peak with high expectations. Upon my first viewing, my opinion rested at a solid 8/10; it had beautiful production design and great performances, but the narrative seemed too lopsided and muddled.Then I saw it again.Seeing Crimson Peak for the second time was an indescribable revelation. Suddenly, every nuance of the performances made perfect sense, and the Gothic feel of the film, which easily eluded me the first time through, swept me up and carried me away, because I finally understood how the film was meant to be watched. The end of Pan's Labyrinth informed the beginning, but Crimson Peak is meant to be folded over on itself; only then can the depth of the narrative be understood. By the movie's nature, we only really discover what the story is within the final act, but when you watch it again, you realize that these realizations undercut the entire rest of the movie. No longer are you sitting around waiting for it to happen; it grabs you by the throat and keeps you there, transfixed. Now that I had the narrative under control, I was also able to begin to appreciate the incredible depth of the production design at play here. Some of the details are mind-blowing. What really changed, I think, about the second viewing was that I was able to step back and realize the immense amount of layering that had been poured into every single frame of the film, working on both visual and emotional levels. The pacing suddenly worked perfectly now that I knew what was going on, and I came to the conclusion that del Toro is simply a step ahead of all of us. I'm gravely disappointed that the reviews, especially those of critics, have mirrored the ignorance attached to a single, non-invested viewing. Crimson Peak is such a masterpiece that it's impossible to even realize its genius without diving headfirst into its folds. I could write a dissertation on the implications of this essential second viewing, but I'll spare you the details and stress to see this twice, preferably in IMAX.",Crimson Peak
492,susannestcy,Flower's in The Attic Meets Psycho,5,21 October 2015,"Yes it was Gothic and the costumes were very sumptuous, otherwise this was slow, even though the romance felt rushed... and it just felt gimmicky in my opinion. Never felt scared. Tom was great as usual but this film did not do his career justice. His talent is too big for this Disney Haunted Mansion style movie, he and Mia's Father out acted all of them. Mia was OK but felt the actors talents were not fully utilized. This was like Flower's in the Attic meets Psycho filmed by Disney.What was the fading circle about? It felt like a Warner brothers bugs bunny cartoon affect when the circle faded away on the character in the shot.Although there were other decent actors in this film, sadly most of the acting felt forced and hollow. Again, except for Tom's and the Dad's. It's like their ability was greater then the script and it showed. The girl fight scene was just silly by the way.Chastain is usually very good in dramas, but the last two horror movies she attempted did not show her talents at all. She just seemed bitchy. There was once scene she did well in to show emotion on her face but otherwise not really impressed.An example of a great ghost story was THE OTHERS with Nicole Kidman in my opinion. The child actor's were excellent. Though Nicole isn't my favorite actor, she was good in that one.",Crimson Peak
493,joanlostwoods,"I love Del Toro, or at least I did before Crimson Peak",2,24 October 2015,"First of all, I'd like to say I really enjoy Del Toro's movies and therefore I went to the cinema quite excited, despite how little interesting I found the trailer. From the very beginning, and I mean, the first 2 minutes, I had this horrible feeling that the movie was going to be as bad as the trailer. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The first mistake, and the one that made me want to leave the cinema right away (because Del Toro is no amateur, he should've noticed this huge mistake): there is no way Thomas could've known the script of Edith was ""good"" and ""about ghosts"" by looking at it for less than 10 seconds. Well, I was eating some popcorn so I decided to stay. As soon as Lucille entered the scene, I whispered to my boyfriend's ear ""yeah, Thomas and the sister have some kind of creepy mansion they can't leave, take Edith with them to get her money or maybe sacrifice her... but in the end, Thomas will face his beloved sister in order to save Edith. They'll probably both die, but Edith will be saved"". It's not that I'm such a smart girl, it's only such a bad and predictable script. I know it's a horror movie and in horror movies, characters do stupid things (walking alone at night, going to check what was that noise, not grabbing a knife when there's danger ahead, and that kind of stuff), but Edith just goes to a new level of idiocy. And such an idiotic performance makes the movie feel UNREAL. None of us would act the way she did, because it's even against nature. I can believe - well, I don't- there's a ghost, but I can't believe someone won't realize Lucille is creepy af and is up to no good. The visual effects are little to no scary, nothing seemed real (something Del Toro usually excels at). But what I want to point out about the ghosts in this movie is the following: If you're going to introduce to the audience a ghost (which should be a main character since... it's a ghost-based movie) make them believe it's evil and then explain to them the ghost is actually a soul in pain, please, make the ghost important again. As soon as Edith finds out the ghosts are Thomas' murdered wives and Enola points out where Thomas and Lucille are having sex, the ghosts disappear completely from the movie. If the ghosts could open and shut doors, they could as well have helped her fighting Lucille, or something. Instead, Edith bangs Lucille in the head with a shovel and says -Men in Black style- ""I heard you the first time"". I laughed. It was hilarious. I left the cinema feeling insulted. Del Toro can do much better than this. It's pretty sad such a good director makes such a poor, mediocre film. (Sorry if there're mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.)",Crimson Peak

I hate a movie when you can tell the plot in advance, and especially when it goes from just OK to ridiculous. The end is bad, seriously bad. One expects laughs at movies with Freddy Kruger or Jason Voorhees, but when you hear them at the end of a movie that pretends to be serious... that a complete fail, and that's what this movie is.There are too many things which are absolutely incoherent in this movie... from an architectonic point of view a house wouldn't have lasted centuries if built on such a clayey soil... or clay won't emerge from your ground floor when you have a basement underneath... or a mother's ghost warning her beloved daughter wouldn't be a dark scary one, but a pale figure full of sorrow and love.

495,joannamerricat,"So much potential, so many flaws",6,25 October 2015,"Although aesthetically very pleasing, this del Toro venture unfortunately falls short in the story department.I really liked most of the director's previous films because they were in some way playful regarding the genre(s) they were associated with. Crimson Peak, however, is exactly how you would expect a Gothic Romance/Horror cross over to be - there is no twist or turn which isn't predictable a mile ahead. Different characters find out the same information, seemingly without much regard to whether what is being shown actually adds a new perspective for the viewer or not. I won't start listing plot holes here, but if it was possible to weave illogical character actions with stereotypical scenarios, this film would have made a sophisticated carpet. And if one was to argue that the story aligns itself with a traditional Gothic romance arc and, as such, celebrates the stereotypes attached to it, please someone explain why they felt the need to make the ghosts look like the dementors in Harry Potter. Visually, I suppose a style more in the fashion of the photographs shown very early in the film might have been more suitable if a celebration of nostalgia was the aim this otherwise inarguably beautiful film.It might have been easier to forgive the shortcomings in logic and character motivation if the film had been a bit more empathetic to its protagonists, but despite - in my eyes - marvellous performances by Chastain and Hiddleston, their characters weren't given enough scenes to make the viewer really care about their fate.Overall, I felt the film was a bit of a missed opportunity - the actors and production design were setting it up to be great, but it lacked the boldness and innovative bite to really use its potential of becoming a modern classic.",Crimson Peak

Crimson Peak is not what it seemed to be, in fact it is more of a suspense: keep you wondering what was truly going on kind of movie. The movie starts at the funeral of Edith Cushing's mother (Mia Wasikowska). The night of the funeral the mother visited Edith in the form of the ghost; she told the young Edith to be wary of the Crimson Peak. Not until she meet Thomas Sharp did she understand the warning her mom gave her.I went into this movie expecting a horror film, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was a thriller. I thought that this movie was genius, Guillermo Del Toro did it again with this film. The whole movie you are wondering whether or not you are able to trust Thomas Sharpe and his sister after Edith moves to Allerdale hall in Cumberland. The movie was brilliantly written as well as being visually stunning. From the decaying-state of Allerdale hall to the piercingly-vibrant colors throughout the movie.Some people are saying that this movie is similar to Pan's Labyrinth in the way that it is dark and dreary. To a certain extent I can agree with these people both movies are dark; and both lead female actors acquire help from strange creepy entities not of this world. Aside from these points the movie stands alone. I would give this movie a seven out of ten stars, ""beware of the Crimson peak!""",Crimson Peak

I liked a lot the acting from all actually,,especially Jessica Chastein as the cold blood sister was awesome but this is so far my enjoy goes. Very good Gothic atmosphere but for some unexplained reason,it felt like everyone and everything was holding back from director's unreasonable way to keep that slow plot with no great horror scenes,that spoiled all the movie i expected to see so long time. Last years every horror movie i saw was at least bad with no plot at all and as for acting don't mention it at all... That's why i was very disappointed about that movie,,cause i had big expectations.It could be far better with some better scenes,,actors after all were great in bottom line but the plot it self it was so little for them that could be a great movie with a few changes in storyline. Ghosts you see in the trailer and you think the story will be actually more relative with them it comes secondary and most of the times you forget you see a ghost story like the trailer.

Just because something is ""gothic"" does not give license to offer a poorly-developed plot which even a bored child would effortlessly pick through and conclude it unconnected, inadequately explained and underdeveloped. Examples include the sudden deep ""love""(?)felt between the major protagonists,(where did that one come from?), lots of fluttering butterflies inexplicably on their way to an inevitable death, laughable cardboard cut-outs of the shambolic ancestral home and its immediate environment that should have been condemned by anyone still sane. Sorry, I do like a good pot-boiler but this one lacked everything apart from its gorgeous costumes and interior decorations.

503,deezmoart,Gothic Horror,9,12 June 2020,"Not action horror.I'm not sure about other countries, but trailers here made this movie look like a slasher, fast, action horror when really it was closer to a Gothic romance one. I think the movie suffered from miss-marketing and people went in thinking this was something it's not.The sets, costumes and ghosts were all beautifully designed. I'd expect nothing less from Guillermo del Toro though.The characters were interesting and I want to especially emphasize how much I loved Jessica Chastain in this. She did so well in making her character as eerie to watch as possible, like you know there's more to her there.
She was legit scary at the start, without needing a hockey mask and a machete.The story was engaging, even if other's might think it would be too slow, I felt like I was on the edge of my seat, trying to piece together the puzzle on what's going on in that mansion.As someone who's tired of the jumpscare-riddled, overly gory and big chested, screaming ""high schooler"" horror movies out there, this one was a big win in my books and a breath of fresh air.",Crimson Peak

505,avagracestone,An absolutely worth-seeing movie!,8,13 May 2017,"Excellent casting. Amazing,mysterious,dark atmosphere that will have you hooked in no time! A movie so dark and mysterious,with some ""gothic""vibes that will appeal to anyone who loves mystery in a mix with dark romantic features and Victorian aesthetic.Plot twists that you can barely imagine, amazing actors and the scenery is terrific. A dark,romantic and rather sweet but also horrific story dealing with the feelings of love,hate,madness,paranoia,devotion,loneliness,abandonment..An absolutely worth-seeing movie! T*SPOILERS* The only thing that could be better is the ghosts. They are not scary enough,they are rather silly. Kids will surely find them terrifying,but the movie isn't for kids anyway..Ghosts were made like this in purpose,it is a new technique. Some might find them fine",Crimson Peak
