0,Leofwine_draca,"Generally good, although the music's intrusive",6,14 July 2018,"ATOMIC BLONDE is a generally well-made and fine-looking Cold War action thriller, featuring a now-hot Charlize Theron in the titular role as a female agent modelled on James Bond. She indulges in some passionate sex and attempts to pick her way through a murky conspiracy, battling and beating up henchmen at every turn. The film was made by one of the JOHN WICK directors and features a string of violent set-pieces which possess good cinematography and choreography. My main complaint lies with the lazy soundtrack, which plays loud, '80s era pop songs over all of the big scenes. I love '80s music but it's done intrusively here and is a lazy way of transmitting emotion. The good news is that, towards the end of the film, there's a lengthy tracking-shot fight scene which dispenses with the music altogether and is the highlight of the movie, a violent and frenetic bit of filmmaking which is worth the admission alone. The film is guity of going through the motions a bit, but the action makes it a worthwhile watch.",Atomic Blonde
1,SnoopyStyle,terrific stylish muddle,5,11 February 2018,"It's 1989 in the days before the fall of the Berlin wall. British agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is sent in to retrieve a list of agents. David Percival (James McAvoy) is her contact. Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella) becomes her lover. After the mission, she is debriefed by CIA Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) and MI6 Eric Gray (Toby Jones). There is the music, the action, and the lesbian sex. I love the hose fight. There is such great intensity. The car chase is also right up there. This movie has great sequences. The story itself is a muddle of unknowable characters and simplistic plot devices. The biggest sin is the flashforward debriefing scene. It takes away the danger and it also grinds down the pacing. It should have been done straight up timeline. This could have been a fun spy romp but the storytelling is so jumbo that I stopped caring about the plot or the characters.",Atomic Blonde
2,Horst_In_Translation,Atomic Bonde,6,27 August 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"" is a film by many countries in many languages, but the most dominant language in these 115 minutes is of course English. The director is David Leitch, who has almost worked in every position by now in the film industry, most of all as a stunt artist. Directing may not be his most prolific area of expertise, but if you take a look at the films there, they are also fairly known nonetheless. The film is based on a graphic novel, which makes sense as I can vividly imagine a comic equivalent of the protagonist here. If you hear that the writers who adapted the novel for the screen, have worked on stuff like 300 in the past, you may be a bit worried, but it all turns out okay in the end. The huge star here is of course lead actress Charlize Theron from South Africa, who gets to play another lesbian character like in her Oscar-winning turn. They made sure not to cast any really big names next to her, even if McAvoy comes close. This doesn't mean they didn't cast quality though as Goodman, Marsan and Jones always deliver of course. They also do so in here.The film takes place in Berlin in almost its entirety, so you will find the occasional German actor too like Til Schweiger, who is okay, but doesn't have that much to work with. Barbara Sukowa is in it in one scene only (luckily) and it's cringeworthy to watch her desperate attempts to turn a nothing character into something. She is as bad and over the top as pretty much always. For the film as a whole, I enjoyed the watch and I also liked the ending, even if it wasn't that surprising. I could have done without the Soviet scene at the end though, it may have been one plot twist too many. The interrogation scenes were okay, but they were not as important as they wanted them to be with the way they included them. I think it would have been a better watch 100% chronologically. Now about the title of my review, these almost 2 hours had a gigantic aura of Bond to them, maybe slightly less ambitious, but we get to that later. The main antagonist with the blonde hair felt like taken right out of a Bond film. I liked him a lot given how little screen time he had. The title character even works for MI6, screws girls and lets be honest about that French agent: The way they showed her as an almost worthy opponent near the end in the McAvoy fight could not deceive anybody. Her story including her tragic fate at the very end felt 100% like the one of a Bond girl. Cut out the cars and gadgets and A.B. is the epitome of a female Bond. The Cold War was also a truly common subject back then in many many Bond movies.Now about the ambition I mentioned earlier: I believe that despite the important subject the film never really had any ambition to deliver in terms of being a political movie. It's really all about the action with thriller coming in second. This makes it eventually a bit of a pointless film, but pointless fun at the same time I think and that is perfectly fine. There really were no major deal breaker aspects in here where I would say those were so disastrous that they leave a truly negative impact on the overall product. I am generally not the biggest Theron fan, but her turn here was decent, pretty strong action performance most of the time. I don't really think this film should be on top of anybody's best of 2017 lists unless they have seen very little. There is no greatness in any non-technical area in here, but there are also no huge weaknesses and as a consequence I give the film a thumbs-up. 2 or 3 fairly memorable scenes in here, for me personally the Kino International scene. This one and other inclusions of the German capital make it worth checking out for Berlin citizens especially as they may recognize certain areas where they have already been. I also liked the shot near the end of McAvoy going outside to the cheering masses. All in all, this film is worth seeing for sure. I personally wouldn't be surprised at all if they make a sequel at some point and I guess I'd watch it too.",Atomic Blonde
3,Prismark10,Neon lit action,4,14 May 2019,This stylish but vacant action film is set in in 1989 when Germany and the city of Berlin was still divided by the Cold War and the Berlin wall.After a British spy is killed trying to smuggle out a secret list of spies including that of double agents. MI6 send in Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) to retrieve the list of agents and find the spy's murderers.As soon as she arrives in Berlin her cover is blown. Broughton has to work with the local station chief David Percival (James MacAvoy) who she does not trust as he has gone wild in Berlin's seedy side.The film is told in flashback as Broughton is debriefed by MI6 Eric Gray (Toby Jones) and a CIA operative Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) who she resents.The film has some comic book kinetic action sequences as Broughton is pursued by eastern European secret police and spies while east Berlin is facing civil unrest.Atomic Blonde is based on a graphic novel which is emphasised in its visuals but it has characters that lack depth. Theron as some nice kick ass moments especially the stairwell scene but the film's plot is just so muddled. MacAvoy chews the scenery. The film's soundtrack is all over the 1980s which could leave the viewer confused.,Atomic Blonde
4,claudio_carvalho,Wonderful Soundtrack,6,29 October 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"" is one of those promising films that the viewer expects to see a great movie but the screenplay and edition do not help despite the various plot points along the story. The characters are not well- developed in the beginning and the lesbian sex scenes are absolutely unnecessary. The best part of this film is the soundtrack with classics from the 70's and 80's. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Atômica"" (""Atomic"")",Atomic Blonde
5,nogodnomasters,These Relationships Aren't Real,8,7 August 2017,"In November of 1989 Berlin, a microfilm goes missing that contains ""active clandestine operatives and all the shady deals"" whatever that is. Charlize Theron of the MI6 is sent to locate and retrieve the missing film from a known Russian assassin they believe have the film. (And he does we saw him take it.) Her cover is compromised as soon as she sets foot in Berlin, but she continues, discovering a man named ""Spyglass"" who has memorized the list. They are also interested in the identity of a double agent named ""Satchel."" The story is told as a flashback as Charlize is being interrogated by MI6 (Toby Jones) and the CIA (John Goodman). There are a number of twists. Theron's drink is Stoli on the rocks, not some sissy martini. The production smartly utilizes music from the 80's to match the scene, albeit mostly early 80's and not always the era. The movie is based on a graphic novel, however it failed to capitalize on that fact by using CG scenes, artificial color imposed on a black and white film, or comic filler...the things I expected from the cover art. Note the playing of Casablanca's ""As Time Goes By"" at the bar scene.Guide: F-word, FF sex, brief nudity",Atomic Blonde
6,kosmasp,Not so cold war,8,12 September 2017,"When Charlize Theron is taking a bath (that is literally the first thing that happens in the movie), you see signs of things to come. And it again shows that she does not care too much about being portrayed as flawless as possible on screen. That also true of the fight scenes, which feel as real as possible while still stylized (it's one of the John Wick guys at the helm, it should be expected).So acting is on a high level as expected, stunts are really exceptional. It does quite a bit and shows quite a bit so it really deserves and acknowledges the R-rating it got. The story may be predictable and overall simple, even the time structure does not change that a lot. But this does exactly what it set out to do: Entertain on high level",Atomic Blonde
7,classicsoncall,"""It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.""",8,12 February 2018,"For those who didn't like the movie and contributed a fair share of disparaging reviews here on IMDb, I'd invite you all to watch the movie again and this time pay attention. There are a significant number of elements in the story to keep the viewer guessing on the identity of double agent 'Satchel', and near the end there's still that final twist that brings it all home to a stunning conclusion. This was a well scripted espionage story with intriguing characters and a duplicitous David Percival (James McAvoy), who if you think about it, was actually a double agent himself, willing to hand off 'The List' to a Russian who was the highest bidder. Following the trail of the List from the opening scene when Russian spy Bakhtin (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) killed James Gasciogne (Sam Hargrave) for it, the fun was in watching it pass through the hands of Percival, on to the the Russian Bremovych (Roland Moller), and eventually to the Atomic Blonde (Charlize Theron) herself. Along the way, I thought the umbrella ruse was pretty clever as a way to protect Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), even though it ultimately didn't do him much good.I guess if you want to point to a downside for the picture, I'd have to mention that seeing Charlize Theron kick butt and absorb punishment the way she did is more than implausible. But I'll tell you what, the fight scenes between her character Lorraine Broughton against various henchmen were exciting to watch and staged rather realistically, even if the average person couldn't maintain that kind of stamina for real. That's why I can't give these kinds of flicks a full '10' rating even if all the rest is outstanding. But with the backdrop of the fall of the Berlin Wall, this was an intense and high energy story that did a good job of pulling things together for the final outcome, and the revelation that the Atomic Blonde was really working for the American CIA.",Atomic Blonde
8,lee_eisenberg,Oh really?,4,11 December 2017,"I admire Charlize Theron's kick-ass performance but ""Atomic Blonde"" is a ridiculous movie. Maybe it's that I've never read the graphic novel on which it's based, but I didn't find anything in it to recommend. The whole thing is a typical action movie in which the main character takes on multiple people at once. Since Charlize Theron played a similar kick-ass role in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (she OWNED that movie), I suspect that we'll see her in some more of these movies.Basically, if you're looking for nice, brainless fun, then this is the movie for you. But if you want something intelligent, then Charlize Theron has starred in lots of other movies.",Atomic Blonde
9,jboothmillard,Atomic Blonde,6,16 August 2017,"I had heard about this movie a couple of months in advance, I found it was an adaptation of a graphic novel (comic book), and I was also attracted by the gorgeous leading actress in the leading role, so I hoped for something awesome, like the trailer made it look. Basically set during the Cold War, on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) has shot and killed MI6 agent James Gasciogne (Sam Hargrave) and stolen the List, a piece of microfilm concealed in a wristwatch containing the names of every active field agent in the Soviet Union. Ten days later, top- level MI6 spy Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is brought in for interrogation by MI6 executive Eric Gray (Toby Jones) and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) about her mission to Berlin. The day after Gasciogne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to Berlin to recover the List and assassinate double agent Satchel, who betrayed Gasciogne, and has sold intelligence to the Soviets for years. Arriving in Berlin, arms dealer and KGB associate Aleksander Bremovych (Roland Møller) has KGB agents immediately ambush her, but her main contact, agent David Percival (James McAvoy), shows up to help her escape. Lorraine fails to find immediate leads, so searches Gasciogne's apartment and finds a picture of him and Percival, then the West German police ambush her. Lorraine realises Percival is the only one who knew she was going to the apartment, she suspects him of being Satchel, she also encounters naive French operative Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella), who has been following her, she is suspicious of her intentions, but they enter a relationship with each other. Bakhtin intends to sell the List to the highest bidder, Percival is tipped off, kills him and takes the List for himself, he then meets with Bremovych to arrange the transfer of the List to him, which Lasalle photographs. A Stasi officer code named Spyglass (Eddie Marsan) is a defector who stole and memorised the List, Percival offers to escort and his family across the border to West Berlin, Lorraine tries her best efforts to keep Spyglass away from harm, but Percival shoots him and tips off Bremovych's men. Following a chase, shoot out in a building, and attempting to escape in a vehicle, this crashes into the river, Lorraine is unable to save Spyglass from drowning. Lorraine returns to Lasalle's apartment and finds that she has been killed, she is too late to save her, Percival killed her to cover his own tracks. Lorraine discovers the photographs Delphine took that proving Percival to be Satchel, as Percival burns down his safe house and attempts to get away, Lorraine catches up to him, kills him with a bullet to the head, and takes the List. Returning to the MI6 debriefing, Lorraine presents the photographs, as well as audio tapes, painting Percival as a traitor, but she denies knowing the List's whereabouts, the agency is forced to declare the case closed. Three days later, Lorraine meets with Bremovych in Paris, revealing herself to be Satchel, she gives him a fake List, he admits knowing she set him up. Lorraine kills the henchmen, she reveals to Bremovych she had been manipulating events from the very beginning, then she kills him, later in Paris Lorraine meets with Kurzfeld and reveals herself as an American triple agent planted by the CIA, before she returns with him to Langley. Also starring Bill Skarsgård as Merkel and James Faulkner as Chief 'C'. Theron does well with the English accent and being a no-nonsense spy, she is commendable doing the majority of her own stunts as well, there is pretty good support from McAvoy and the other well-known stars as well. It certainly does well with the authenticity of the Berlin Wall time setting, and the style does look like something from a comic book, including a sexy lesbian love scene, it is perhaps more style over substance, but you can't complain about the catchy 80s soundtrack and the exciting and brutal fight and chase sequences, most memorable being the staircase scene supposedly filmed in one shot, all in all it's a worthwhile action spy thriller. Good!",Atomic Blonde
10,Tweekums,A stylish spy thriller set in Berlin in the days before the fall of the wall,9,3 August 2019,"It is 1989 and tensions are high in Berlin. A British agent is murdered as he tries to smuggle a list, which contains details of every agent on both sides, out of East Berlin. Fellow Agent Lorraine Broughton is sent to Berlin to recover the list. Her contact is David Percival, the MI6 Station Head. It soon emerges that as well as listing every spy the list contains information on the identity of a high level agent within MI6 who is working for the Soviets. Lorraine is in a very dangerous situation as there are plenty of people who will kill for the list or kill to stop its contents being revealed.I really enjoyed this stylish thriller. Even though the story is told in flashback as Lorraine is debriefed there is a real sense of danger for her and those around her. There is plenty of exciting action; this is fairly bone crunching at times. The action includes unarmed combat; gun fights; knife fights and the use of whatever item is at hand. While the action doesn't appear overly choreographed it is stylishly shot. The much of the film has a distinct blue tint, with flashes of pink; some may dislike this look but I really liked it. As the story approaches its conclusion we are treated to twist upon twist upon twist. The cast is impressive; Charlize Theron is great as Lorraine and James McAvoy is suitably ambiguous as Percival. The rest of the cast is impressive too. In the background we get a soundtrack of great songs from the era. Overall I'd definitely recommend this fans of action films.",Atomic Blonde
11,BA_Harrison,I borrowed the DVD of this film from the same guy at work who lent me Baby Driver; what have I ever done to him?,3,19 May 2018,"Atomic Blonde features a lesbian sex scene between Charlize Theron and Sofia Boutella, and yet I still found it insufferably dull.Set in 1989, the film stars Charlize Theron as undercover MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton, who is sent to Berlin to try and retrieve a missing list of double agents. As cold war thrillers go, this one is remarkably light on thrills, with a convoluted plot and a lack of action in the first half that quickly leads to boredom. By the time Theron finally gets serious about hurting people, I was way beyond the point of caring.Director David Leitch's primary aim seems to be for his film to look and sound uber-cool, with enough neon lighting for a hundred '80s soft-core porn films and a retro soundtrack that is full of classic '80s pop tunes (although, rather bizarrely, almost all of them are from the earlier half of the decade, not 1989). Decent storytelling doesn't seem to be very high on the agenda.In short: Atomic Blonde would make a really dreadful double-bill with Baby Driver.",Atomic Blonde
12,paul_haakonsen,Average action thriller...,5,10 June 2018,"This was hardly a movie that got me all worked up. First of all, the concept didn't seem all that inspiring, and secondly it was Charlize Theron in the leading role.The story in ""Atomic Blond"", however, was set in an interesting period of time - during the fall of the Berlin wall. I will say that the atmosphere was quite convincing and realistic.I do think it was really good that they opted to have people actually speak Russian and German, instead of just English with a horrible stereotypical accent. The fact that people actually spoke the languages did add so much more credibility to the movie.They did have a very nice list of cast ensemble, and the actors and actresses were doing good jobs. I can't consider myself a fan of Charlize Theron, but she performed well enough here. It should be said that it was actually James McAvoy whom stole the spotlight in the movie with his performance.The storyline, however, was just a bit too befuddled and scrambled. It seemed that writers Kurt Johnstad, Antony Johnston and Sam Hart along with director David Leitch just bit off more than they were able to handle. And it showed through the storyline.Hardly an outstanding movie in any aspect, and if offers nothing to the genre that hasn't already been done or seen in other similar movie.",Atomic Blonde
13,michaelRokeefe,Top shelf spy flick. Urgent action,10,15 February 2018,"This high octane action thriller directed by David Leitch surely gives the bang for the buck. A British agent is murdered in 1989 Berlin. Fellow MI6 agent, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), is assigned to investigate and strongly advised to locate and retrieve a list of double agents carried by the murdered agent. In order to do so she will be working with Berlin officials while the Cold War wanes. Broughton will also be forced to work with another spy, David Percival (James McAvoy), and there are major trust issues. More than enough brutal fight scenes and car chases to keep you flinching. And the much talked about lesbian sex sequences with Theron and agent Delphine (Sofia Boutella) are super hot, but brief! As the story progresses, there will be twists and turns as the very bruised Broughton relives what took place on her mission.Theron, whether she did her own stunts or not, was tremendously believable. The cast also features: John Goodman, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, Bill Skarsgard, Johannes Haukur Johannesson and James Faulkner.",Atomic Blonde

19,view_and_review,"Theron Great, Movie Wasn't",6,19 July 2018,"Charlize Theron is great in everything she does and this movie was no exception. I've never seen her in a role such as this but I'd say she pulled it off.This was a high octane spy-vs.-spy movie. When you aren't trying to figure out who all the players are and their roles you are entertained by some butt kicking. This movie had some incredible fight scenes. Theron had to be in remarkable shape to do these long, almost Daredevil-esque, fight scenes. And don't think that her character, Lorraine, was just running through faceless goons like Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon. It was give and take: she would give some serious licks and take some serious licks as well. They made a point of showing just how badly battered she was after a few brutal dust-ups.But the fighting alone couldn't save this movie. I think it suffered from a weak script in which they tried to be too clever. Within the story Lorraine is tasked with acquiring a list of names of spies stationed in Berlin in '89. Obviously, a list such as this is very sensitive and valuable, especially considering that one of the spies is a double agent. Once you get into double agent talk a plot can get kind of wild with crosses and double crosses and what's really going on.My only other gripe, which may paint me as a prude, is that I had no need for the soft core girl on girl action between Theron and Sofia Boutella. I guess they were trying to depict Lorraine as they would any male super-spy by having her creatively beat people up, deftly use firearms, dress chic, and have sex with a beautiful girl. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm sure this appeals to the 18-25 male audience but I'm past that demographic and I was never much into that anyway.Theron was great but the movie wasn't and that happens. There were other big names in it: James McAvoy and John Goodman. They did their due diligence but I still say they could only make the movie slightly above average.",Atomic Blonde

Any plot developments - and there are many, this is a textured story - are rolled out sequentially as the film goes along, and even the mild twist at the end won't be a shock to anyone who has seen more than half a dozen films in their life. The story is fine, but unexceptional.Charlize Theron plays Lorraine with an air of languid ennui and with a British accent, neither of which is always effective. John Goodman and Toby Jones are reliable, James McAvoy has fun, and Sophia Boutella has a smoking hot lesbian sex scene with Theron. But the action - ah, now you're talking. First of all, it's always integral to the story - so often, car chases seem to be just dropped in for the sake of it. Secondly, it is choreographed, stunt-worked, filmed, and edited as well as any action I've ever seen - the visceral 10 minute stairwell fight is stunning: it appears to be a single moving camera sequence (but isn't). The action alone elevates Atomic Blonde to a level above most action thrillers, and makes it a film I look forward to rewatching..",Atomic Blonde
21,ferguson-6,The Charlize Show,6,30 July 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. David Leitch has taken the rare Hollywood career path of stuntman-to-director. His expertise in fight scenes is beyond reproach as evidenced by his limited work on JOHN WICK (2014), and in his helming this heavily promoted, style over substance summer action film masquerading as a spy thriller. Kurt Johnstad (300) adapted Antony Johnston and Sam Hart's graphic novel ""The Coldest City"", and in collaboration with director Leitch and the ultra-talented Charlize Theron, has created some of the most brutal, bone-crunching and violent fight scenes ever seen on screen.Ms. Theron stars as Lorraine, an MI6 agent whose life-sustaining nourishment is apparently derived from Stoli on the rocks and an endless supply of cigarettes. The opening scene features a naked Lorraine submerged in an ice cube bath seeking relief for her bruised and battered body. She then heads to an official debriefing by her supervisor (Toby Jones) and a CIA officer (John Goodman); they want details on what went wrong with her most recent mission. Those details come through flashbacks of Lorraine's trip to Berlin to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and the stolen list of all agents. It's 1989, and the Cold War concern is that the list falls into the hands of the KGB, immediately placing all agents and missions in peril.With the recurring backdrop of President Reagan exhorting Mr. Gorbachev to ""tear down that wall"", the film in no way employs the clever clandestine strategies of the TV series ""The Americans"", or even slightly resembles international espionage classics like TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY or THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR. Instead, whatever plot lines or MacGuffins exist have one sole purpose: generate another fight scene for Lorraine.Stairwells, kitchen utensils, a skateboard, water hoses, car keys and a corkscrew all have their moments (no, it's not a Jackie Chan movie), as do a couple of car chase sequences. Ms. Theron is a physical marvel (she performed most of her own stunts) as she takes on numerous adversaries in various locations all while sporting more fashionable black & white outfits (with coordinated stilettos) than we can count. She has proved many times (MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, NORTH COUNTRY, MONSTER) that she is much more than a pretty face, and this is her most grueling role to date.This is undoubtedly Charlize's show, and supporting work is provided by an underutilized James McAvoy (fresh off of SPLIT) as the rebellious Berlin station chief, Eddie Marsan as a German Stasi known as Spyglass, James Faulkner as MI6 Chief, Roland Moller as the Soviet Bremovych, the always-cool Til Schweiger as the watchmaker, and Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise in the upcoming IT remake). Sofia Boutella plays the wonderfully named Delphine LaSalle, a French agent who, like most of the human race, is attracted to Ms. Theron/Lorraine.Though it's understandable we don't get to see much of Berlin, the soundtrack continually reminds us that we are in 1989 thanks to music from such varied artists as David Bowie, Public Enemy, Nena, The Clash, Depeche Mode and A Flock of Seagulls. There is even a clip from MTV making a crack about the ethics of sampling, and Cinematographer Jonathan Sela's background in music videos works perfectly for the flash cut action segments.A more intricate and full-bodied story tied to the international espionage of the Cold War could have elevated the film to a more elite status; however, it immediately becomes one of the top female-led action films and features some of the most impressive and fun to watch cinematic fight scenes ever. Next up for director Leitch is Deadpool 2, so we will soon find out if he can inject humor into his expert action.",Atomic Blonde
22,morrison-dylan-fan,Blonde du Look.,9,14 August 2017,"Discovering the movement when watching 100 French films in 100 days in 2016,I've always been disappointed about not having the chance to see a Cinéma du look creation on the big screen. After the trailers caught my attention, a pal spoke to film reviewer Kim Newman,who along with revealing that the ending of the film is an ""unofficial"" remake to the Film Noir The Big Clock,also said that the appearance of the flick matched that of Nikita and Diva, which led to me seeing du Look turn blonde.The plot-Late 1989 in Berlin:Believing that the Berlin Wall is reaching a tipping point, MI6 send in secret agent Lorraine Broughton to East Germany,in order to retrieve a document with a list of all the agents there,that is at risk of falling into the wrong hands. Arriving in East Geremany, Broughton finds disenfranchised youth, and KGB agents who already have their eyes on her. Meeting up with agent David Percival, (who is feared to have gone rogue) Broughton starts searching for the list, but finds out that Percival has an atomic secret. View on the film:Spray painting credits and the sound of Blue Monday blasting from a car window, director David Leitch & cinematographer Jonathan Sela heat up the final days of the Cold War with a lush Cinéma du Look palette. Nodding towards the graphic novel,Leitch splashes the screen with ultra-stylised blue,reds,dark greens and crisp whites,which along with giving an elegance to the covered in blue Broughton, also gives the action scenes a fresh crunch. Closely working with editor Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir to make a scene done with 40 shots (!) look like it was filmed in one take, Leitch makes the fight scenes incredibly energetic and ruthless, with the ""one take"" trick allowing for Broughton's to hit with a blunt force, and also allows each fight to build towards a vicious knock out.Peeled from the graphic novel pages of The Coldest City by Antony Johnston and Sam Hart,the screenplay by Kurt Johnstad stabs the Spy Thriller with the overarching theme of Cinéma du Look: disenfranchisement,from drugged up David Percival being left to burn out behind the Iron Curtain as people kick out of the Berlin Wall,to Broughton stating that she always fears revealing her true feelings,over the risk it will be used against her. Looking at the mission from an extended flashback, Johnstad gives the spy sharp twist and turns,with the oncoming fall of the Wall pushing Broughton to pick up secrets before the Wall tumbles down on them.Spending five years trying to get the film made, Charlize Theron (who broke two teeth doing stunts) shows her excitement with a very charismatic performance as Broughton,who screams out in fury at the fight scenes,which Theron turns into a calculating simmer,as Broughton battles to complete the mission. Making the flick with a broken hand, James McAvoy gives a wonderfully unhinged,snarling performance as Percival,who sets off the atomic blonde.",Atomic Blonde
23,phd_travel,The fight scenes are phenomenal thanks to Charlize,8,27 July 2017,First off it's such a joy to watch Charlize Theron who is a good actress and one of the most stunning beauties of all time in a role where she is supposed to be beautiful instead of the opposite. She is totally watchable from start to finish. That makes the many stunning fight scenes even more mesmerizing to watch. I read she did a lot of it herself without the use of stunt doubles. Great directing from a former stuntman turned director helps. The scene in the kitchen is great but wait till you see the staircase fight and the car chase. Brilliant.I think Luc Besson movies have better stories than Atomic Blonde which is a kind of misleading title - but the fight scenes here are beyond the Luc Besson standard.James McAvoy has been doing edgier roles recently and he overcomes his short stature to be pretty effective. That's the skill of a good actor. This year's Mummy Sofia Boutella is different as a French agent.The story is quite interesting at first - not too comic like. It's set around the fall of the Berlin Wall with all the Cold War protagonists CIA MI6 and KGB. It's all quite good till the last twist where I felt I didn't quite get all of it. But it doesn't matter if you don't understand all the story it's a well done piece of entertainment and could spawn a few sequels.,Atomic Blonde

When she's sent on a covert mission into Cold War Berlin, just at the time the Berlin Wall is doomed for destruction she must use all of the spycraft, sensuality and savagery she has to stay alive in the ticking time bomb of a city simmering with revolution and double-crossing hives of traitors. Broughton must navigate her way through a deadly game of spies to recover a priceless dossier while fighting ferocious killers along the way - types such as Percival (James McAvoy), Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), Watchmaker (Til Schweiger), Kurzfeld (John Goodman), Gray (Toby Jones), Delphine (Sofia Boutella) etc. Very loud, very brutal, there is more violent behavior and killings then storyline.

Therefor the lighting and the way it was shot doesn't fit in for the 'normal viewer'.But if you are open minded for special way of editing with the score used then it's worth picking up. For me it was a trip down memory lane. Seeing Berlin back with the wall, but the soundtrack used was really making me happy, Siouxsie, Flock of Seagulls, Bowie, Nena,...if they should used Einsturzende Neubauten it would made it complete. Naturally there's the flick itself. I liked it a lot, Charlize Theron is stunning again, and knowing her age she is worth seeing here. But not only that, all acting is superb. Of course Charlize in a flick means mostly seeing her in her nudies and she does it a few times even in a steaming scene with Sofia Boutella (Delphine Lasalle). A new actress worth noticing. Just coming out of Star Trek Beyond (2016) and know moving further in The Mummy (2017). The story is believable and has a few twists.Worth picking up especially for those who had their youth in the eighties.

There are enough twists to make it interesting to watch, even a bit too much for me. Charlize Theron has the leading role playing the hard special agent with amazing fighting abilities. The fighting scenes are numerous and are definitely the best parts of the movie. The fight choreography crew that worked on Atomic Blonde deserve the most credits as the scenes are amazing and technically well done. Charlize Theron did a good job with her character, even though I thought her character was a bit too dark. A smile every now and then would have been better.

I also think a lot of the other actors in the film are some of the greatest actors in their generations. The design was credible and complete with the right sound and atmosphere. Yet the story went nowhere. It was so derivative that if I tell you the names of the films that stand on the left and right of it you would know the entire script. In fact, it was so easy to spot the two influences from the very beginning that it was difficult for me to watch knowing what was going to happen, play by play.Atomic Blonde happens in (ba da bum!) Berlin, during the fall of the wall. A mysterious list, that had no reason existing in the first place, is the target of multiple agents from various governmental spy agencies. They fight, shoot, deceive, kill, betray. Why? Because that's what spies do, naturally. None of the characters seems to have a well defined reason for what they do other than that.Bottom line: I loved how people acted in this film. Especially James McAvoy who is a beast when unleashed.

29,lasttimeisaw,a Theron's star-vehicle,7,8 November 2017,"A Cold War spy flick directed by stuntman-turned-filmmaker David Leitch, after cutting his teeth with JOHN WICK (2014), as both the producer and uncredited co-director, now he is currently the helmer of DEADPOOL 2. In the tumult of Berlin Wall's impending collapse, this retro-futuristic action-er pits MI6 spy Lorraine Broughton (Theron) against a bunch of ruthless Soviet Union KGBs and a friend-or-foe local contact David Percival (McAvoy), to seek out a leaked list which will put all the field agents in the Soviet Union in danger and also, find out who is the mole with the appellation ""Satchel"". Before anything else, ATOMIC BLONDE is a Theron's star-vehicle, the point-blank, minutely choreographed fisticuffs between her and her co-stars/stunt-performers are brutal, visceral and bluntly female-empowering, they are divested of the usual veneer of sleekness and flaunting, but revert to a primal, beastly, clumsy combat exigency which could take place between non-martial artists, but lethal killers battling with instinct. The film adds another brickbat to her throne as Hollywood's most redoubtable ass-kicker, and that title is not inclusively confined to the distaff circle.Berlin, brisk, forbidding and sunless under the daylight, breaths an iridescent decadence and nihilism into its nocturnal life where this convoluted triple-agent shaggy-dog tale takes its shoddy shape through Lorraine's stiltedly obfuscating recounting in the MI6 headquarter, sadly, the screenplay fails to live up to the standard of an arresting thriller, there are over-stretched longueurs moseying between fighting sequences which barely subsist to engage audience's attention (including Lorraine's soft-headed lesbian relationship with a French tenderfoot), thus the tantalizing of its plot wears thin quickly, however, a cracking miscellany of Synth-Pop/Electronic hits becomes the unexpected grace note to render the restive zeitgeist. Last but not least, James McAvoy emits some coruscating élan when he is not typecast as the salt-of-the-earth sort, his morally ambiguous Percival is an effervescent foil against Theron's prosaic inscrutability, maybe Hollywood has been using him all wrong, instead of relentlessly priming him as a matinée idol, he is much more in his wheelhouse as a chameleon-like character player, a rogue with distinctive charm.",Atomic Blonde
30,Hellmant,I had a lot of fun watching it.,8,31 July 2017,"'ATOMIC BLONDE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new spy thriller starring Charlize Theron (who also served as a producer of the movie) and James McAvoy. It's based on the 2012 graphic novel 'The Coldest City' (by Antony Johnston and Sam Hart), and it tells the story of an elite MI6 agent that's tasked with taking down an espionage ring in Berlin (during the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989). It was directed by David Leitch (who also co- directed the first 'JOHN WICK', uncredited, and the upcoming 'DEADPOOL 2') and it was written by Kurt Johnstad (who also co-wrote '300' and it's sequel (which were also both based on popular graphic novels). The movie costars John Goodman, Toby Jones, Sofia Boutella, Eddie Marsan and Roland Moller. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a mild hit at the Box Office. I had a lot of fun watching it.It's 1989, during the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall. An Undercover MI6 agent has just been murdered in Berlin, and a powerful espionage ring is believed to be responsible for it. An elite MI6 agent named Lorraine Broughton (Theron) is sent to Berlin to retrieve a list of double agents there, that are being moved into the West secretly. She's ordered to work with a Berlin station chief, named David Percival (McAvoy), who she does not trust in the slightest. A lot of very bloody action ensues.The movie is really well directed by Leitch, and Theron once again gives it her all in the lead (and she makes an amazing, and very sexy, action heroine). I had a lot of fun watching the very violent (and quite bloody) fight scenes, car chases and shootouts, but the story just didn't interest me at all. I didn't find it involving in the slightest, except for a few brief scenes.

31,thesar-2,Cause Spy's a Blonde,2,7 November 2017,"Seriously, I am nostalgia'd out. With Stranger Things 1 & 2 and 2017's It, I've kinda had my fill for now. Had this come out 10 years ago, okay then.Late in this movie, there's a one-shot, fight scene that saves some of this boring mess. Other than that, the trailers ruined this movie.Normally, I don't rate a movie on its box-office success or failure. But, basically this movie bombed and it was probably due to false advertising. It surely promoted non-stop action, kick-ass Charlize and intrigue. This had none of that.After the Fast and Furious (which one? Part 29?) movie that featured the lovely Charlize Theron, I had HIGH HOPES for this kickass female Bourne movie and instead got an incredibly slow, downplayed and uninteresting retro film that never lived up to the hype.And boy, the music. Distracting. Again, release this a decade ago and wow, those 80s tunes would've really have an impact. Instead, it thoroughly distracted from one great action scene featured in the previews. The movie is incessantly deliberate and Charlize underused. I really wanted to see her fight, win and move the plot. Instead, she's moving from scene to scene to discover a list of spies. Oh, and not so subtle by the way: one's even named ""Spyglass."" Really?Worse, this movie is told in flashbacks and narration when it would've benefited by just being told in straightforward storytelling.Charlize is absolutely badass. Internally and externally. But, she's not getting any younger. Stop wasting her talents with boring films. Despite one long and admittedly fantastic fight scene in the latter part of the second act, this movie is an absolute skip. ***Final thoughts: Literally, just watch Spielberg's Bridge of Spies or even Munich. Both resemble this movie without the quick outbursts of female kickassery. Only, as slow-moving those spy films were, they at least were interesting and well shot.",Atomic Blonde
32,cherold,not much fun,5,16 September 2019,"There are two main sorts of spy movies; colorful, over-the-top romps like the James Bond movies and gritty dramas about betrayal like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. Atomic Blonde represents a melding of the two, an increasingly common sub-genre that I rarely enjoy.The movie is filmed in the cold, antiseptic style of the cold war drama and there is a general grimness to the characters. Yet Charlize's bottle-blonde spy and some big action scenes are far removed from John Le Carre.The movie is full of twists, some of which directly contravene what has come before, and Theron's character says things as though they're sharp and witty that really aren't. 45 minutes in, I had zero interest in what was going on and started skipping forward to check out the vaunted action scenes, although I still wound up watching big, generally uninteresting chunks.The action scenes are interesting. The movie is *reasonably* convincing in showing how a small woman can take out several larger men, which involves a mix of ingenious use of props and a lot of gunplay.The best scene is easily a trip down the stairs in which Theron takes on quite a few villains. The scene is notable for showing how utterly exhausting fighting is, which I rarely see in films. I found the scene admirable yet still not all that entertaining.This movie is generally spoken of as a distaff John Wick, but since I haven't seen the John Wick films this movie brought to mind my very vague recollections of the first Jason Bourne movie, which featured a bland hero and an unengaging story.It's a well-filmed movie, but for me it's simply not an enjoyable one.",Atomic Blonde

But along the way, an inevitable web of betrayal and murder plays out where no one can be trusted and no one is safe.After making his name with the relentlessly violent John Wick, which re-launched Keanu Reeves as a bona-fide action star, newbie director David Leitch here seems to be trying to balance the battle of the sexes, by suitably casting Charlize Theron in the lead role as the kick ass blonde chick, which she fits the skin of just perfectly. Even if the film isn't always holding your attention, she certainly is, those big black boots kicking and prancing all over.The film strikes a strange tone, on the one hand aiming to be a sassy, colourful, slick adventure, but constantly at odds with the gloomy, oppressive backdrop of East Berlin. Script wise as well, though, it seems to be more interested in being an intricate, multi-layered spy thriller than the throwaway fun the promotional materials suggest. It's all still hugely satisfying, though, woven in with a barrage of rousing action set pieces, including a group of heavies being dispatched to the backdrop of George Michael's Father Figure.It's not quite exciting or riveting enough to be great, but it's still a few ranks above average, and a perfectly inspired action film, with a cool, funky '80s soundtrack to guide it along. ***",Atomic Blonde

That's aside from a single scene that seems to be a long unbroken take late in the second act, which represents one of the most painful and well-executed action sequences of the year in a jarring yet welcome departure from the rest of the piece. It's a bizarre move to include so little considering it was billed as an action-flick through and through, with a breakout female bad-ass star and a cleanly choreographed style. There is very little below the surface really, that surface being this grimy pseudo techno-punk membrane that floats atop the picture without ever merging with it or even feeling like it fits the material, and where it falls flat in its attempt to ape 'John Wick' is that it simply omits the style, wit and emotion that made that film and it's sequel so successful. 5/10",Atomic Blonde

But she kills far more people in glossy escapist fantasies like 'Aeon Flux' and this; set in Berlin nearly thirty years ago in the good old days when the Wall was still standing and all the West had to worry about was the KGB rather than mouth-breathers in scruffy beards running amuck shouting ""Allahu Akbar!""Charlize had just turned 40 when she made this, and it's great to see a woman in her forties kick ass on an industrial scale without the obvious use of CGI (always in tip top physical condition despite being a smoker). As usual, given the choice between saving the life of someone who matters to her or revelling in yet another violent death, the makers would rather see them die than give the lead actor a chance to prove just how truly heroic they are by saving their life; but utter lack of concern for human life is a hallmark of most modern action films (along with an almost comical amount of designer swearing even more gratuitous than the violence).Saddled for the most part with an exceptionally ugly blonde eighties mop, Ms Theron looks a million times cooler than anywhere else in the film (or in 'Aeon Flux') when she adopts a black wig covering one eye like Madame Viper to obliterate yet another room full of bad guys. Maybe we can hope for her to return some time in the not too distant future as an Atomic Brunette...",Atomic Blonde
37,bowmanblue,Style over originality,6,11 July 2019,"I'm annoyed. I really wanted to love 'Atomic Blonde.' It certainly has two things I enjoy in a film - action and eighties neon (or 'three' if you count Charlize Theron!). She plays Lorraine Broughton, a hard-hitting, super-spy from (eighties!) Britain and she's sent to a divided Berlin in order to prevent a stolen list of the world's secret agents from falling in to the wrong hands.I'll stop right there. How many times has a super-spy had to retrieve such a list? Probably quite a lot. However, it's a well-known fact that there are only so many different stories and the success or failure of a story is largely due to the WAY that it's told. The problem is that 'Atomic Blonde' isn't told differently enough. Which is a shame, because there's loads of positives.First of all there's the cast. Of course Charlize Theron is totally A-list and she looks and acts the part of a high-kicking, bad-a$$ spy who has a habit of getting her own way. Accompanying her are whole host of other great actors including James McAvoy, Eddie Marsen, John Goodman and the excellent up and coming Sofia Boutella.Then there's the direction. The film looks (i.e. visually) stunning. Every shot is beautifully-crafted and the neon really highlights the eighties feel of the settings. The soundtrack is effectively a playlist of some of the best songs you're likely to find from the era and I was delighted to hear some of them used to such perfection throughout the film.But despite the cast all playing their parts well and the film looking and sounding amazing, no matter how many famous faces you have on the cast list or whether your favourite artists are included on the soundtrack, sometimes these sorts of things just don't take away from the fact that film is too unoriginal and too long.The film is nearly two hours long. Now, this wouldn't be that bad, but the problem is the film feels the need to have so many twists and turns that it requires nearly four potential endings in order to tie everything up. Plus all the characters seemed like superheroes. Now, it doesn't bother me that much when Thor or Captain America take what feels like an infinite amount of punishment when engaging in a hand to hand fight. They're superhuman therefore the rules are different. The problem is that in 'Atomic Blonde' everyone is plain old human and therefore shouldn't be able to take quite such heavy beatings and just get up and do it all over again. It's worth noting that the fight scenes are very well shot and quite memorable, it's just they're also too unbelievable and I actually found myself laughing at just how much abuse each character took before getting up and continuing the battle.Overall, I was disappointed with 'Atomic Blonde' and no one is more annoyed with that outcome than me. However, judging from the other reviews I've read online, most seem really positive about the film and clearly enjoyed it more than me. I've even seen online that it will be getting a sequel at some point, so I guess I'm in the minority with this one.",Atomic Blonde
38,dromasca,feminist spy thriller,8,22 July 2017,"The name of the film was not enough deterrent to go and watch Atomic Blonde which was brought for an early screening at the cinematheque in my village one day after its world premiere in London. I have no regrets about deciding to go and see it, as the film is much more than the name says, and by far exceeds the level of most of the comics-inspired movies (not that there is something wrong with them, its just that too many of them are childish). It actually may be one of the best action entertainment films of this summer, with a story complex enough and interesting enough to draw the attention, and excellent execution on all that relates to the action parts of the film.The dark and violent spy story in Atomic Blonde takes place in the last few weeks and days of divided Berlin. The Wall is going to fall, and the epoch of the games of lies and treason fights between the secret services of the powers on one side or the other of it is speeding up to the point of losing control. Last minute accounts are violently settled and everybody prepares for the day after. A list of the active agents has the value and power of an atomic weapon. In order to get hold of it, the British MI6 agency sends the feminine equivalent of James Bond - the super-spy and super-killer Lorraine Broughton played by Charlize Theron. She is ten times as deadly as any of her male competitors and is a master of double or multiple spying games. Success is by no means ensured however and the road to it is paved with uncountable numbers of corpses.The director of the movie is David Leitch, actually a first timer in film directing, but a master of stunts with more than 80 films on record. No wonder than that the fights in the film are superbly directed. I have not seen better since The Matrix. Leitch succeeds however much more - he builds a violent but credible story that shows the world of the classical John le Carre novels falling down together with the Wall in a Big Bang. No need to say, Charlize Theron is fit to the task, and calling her the feminist answer to all the misogynist action movies we have seen in the last 100 years is no exaggeration. Unless you really detest violent action movies, you should like this film.",Atomic Blonde
39,ThomasDrufke,This is No Jane Wick,6,2 August 2017,"I know a lot of people went into this movie thinking that it was going to be ""Jane Wick"", heck it's even directed by one of the co-directors of the first John Wick film. But really, the only similarity between the two characters is the fact that they are both assassins. The stories are entirely different. I've had a few issues with the writing/dialogue to the first two Wick films, but the 'fun' in those movies outweighed the weaknesses. With Atomic Blonde, it's more of the opposite. The action is perfectly shot, acted, and choreographed. But the story is more ""take it or leave it"". The film reminded me a lot of Angelina Jolie's 2010 Spy-Thriller, Salt. The action is great but maybe too few and far in between. Instead, the film is spear- headed by twists and turns that don't do a whole lot for the endgame, but play more for shock value than anything else. It gets to the point of losing impact because you don't feel like there are any consequences when the plot keeps getting shuffled around. Don't get me wrong, the cast is great and the characters are semi-interesting, but you don't get a sense of character motivations at all. This is especially true of James McAvoy's character (who I love as an actor), but he got stuck with a convoluted plot. Let's talk about Charlize Theron, though. Talk about an actress who absolutely gives it her all every time out. It could be tricky/clever camera work, but it sure looks like she does all of her own stunts in this film. She certainly does during an incredible stairwell fight sequence, which proceeds to kicka** for around 10 minutes. But she's also just quite good at just acting here as well. Sadly, the script she's given is sub-par and tries to be more-clever than it probably has the right to be. I don't usually like saying that, because every film has the right to be clever, but it's just a matter of how they use that cleverness.

And the fight scenes were cool and I liked how they filmed it with the different colored filters. On the negative, the plot was confusing because I got lost as to who was double crossing whom.

41,cricketbat,"Flat and lifeless, with one cool fight scene",4,28 December 2018,"Atomic Blonde is flat and lifeless, even with its bright colors and cool soundtrack. It's easy to believe that Charlize Theron is a tough super spy, but the overly complicated plot and slow, plodding pace bog down the impressive action sequences. It's as if this movie is trying to distract us with fun sights and sounds. However, it just comes off as overcompensation for a bunch of shortcomings.",Atomic Blonde
42,inkblot11,"Charlize Theron nukes the enemy but good! Intriguing but very, very violent, not for all",8,13 August 2018,"As the film opens, a battered and bruised woman, Lorraine (Charlize Theron) is telling her story to skeptical CIA officials, including Emmet (John Goodman). A few days ago, the Berlin Wall was about to come down, causing most people in the free world to rejoice. However, the undercover spies were in danger, for Britain and the USA had operatives which were believed loyal to the other side, Russia and the communists. There was a ""list"" of these folks which must not fall into enemy hands. Flashing Back, Britain sends its one-woman A-bomb, Lorraine, an expert in martial and ""other"" arts, to find the list first. She is to meet with the local chief spy, Percival (James McAvoy) and plan her next move. However, the limo which picks her up at the airport is not the correct one, being full of Russian-side agents. Using her high heels as weapons, Lorraine soon gets the Russkies dispatched. But, ho, someone has blown her cover already. Percival arrives to help her at the last moment and he brings her to temporary safety. Now, a new plan must be hatched, one that involves Percival, the ""watchmaker"", a beautiful French woman named Delphine and others. But, there is believed to be a supreme traitor among the spies which puts Lorraine and company is grave danger, from within and from without. Who will win ? Wow, Atomic Blonde is quite an intriguing film, made special by Theron whose beauty and lethal limbs make mincemeat of the enemy. The other cast members are quite fine, too, such as McAvoy, Goodman, Toby Jones, and more. The seedy underworld which Lorraine inhabits always has a television playing the joyous news of Berlin re-unification while spies are suffering. Quite a contrast. Beware, viewers, this is a very violent film, with some funny ironies, such as the ""shoe"" daggers and a spy getting hit with a refrigerator door. Therefore, its not a view for children AT ALL or any one who hates smash-em-up. Then, too, there is a gay story line some will not appreciate. But. for others, its a guilty pleasure indeed to see a female nuclear weapon do her stuff.",Atomic Blonde

45,atlasmb,An Action Masterpiece,10,9 August 2017,"Some of the best graphic novels are very cinematic. What does that say about a film adapted from such a graphic novel? That it is very graphic? ""Atomic Blonde"" is best described as an action film. That action is extraordinary. Charlize Theron served notice when she starred in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"": Here is an action star with a convincing physicality. In AB, she take that physicality to another level, having trained for months to handle fight choreography that will remind some of the Bourne series.Theron's character, Lorraine Broughton, is a British agent sent to a divided Berlin in 1989. Her mission is to obtain a list of agents and claim the body of a slain comrade. But when she arrives, survival becomes an immediate priority. Everything about this film is superior: the action, the stunts, the cinematography, the editing, the camera movement which more than once made me smile in admiration. The MTV-fueled period music served both to power the action and place the action in the 80s. The sets are wonderful, the fashion is striking. The story is mostly told in narrated flashback. The pace is intoxicating. When one character asks another if he would like a break, I had to laugh, because it was like the director was asking viewers if they needed a moment.Though Lorraine Broughton has an ultra-cool presence, this is not an espionage story where the hero triumphs almost effortlessly, bloodlessly. AB is raw and brutal. This gives the film a ruthless verity. And it gives us a new protagonist capable of carrying a franchise.",Atomic Blonde
46,tabuno,Ragged Fusion of Action and Brains,7,10 January 2019,"31 July 2017. While the action became more brilliant as the movie continued along at a greater captivating pace, the convoluted, but typical plot became more and more cumbersome slowing the movie down. This female version of The Bourne Identity (1988) wasn't able to hold together the physical battles with the mental mechanizations that created a rather murky thriller to wade through. What really stands out as perhaps one of the best physical action movies in decades are the latter portions of the movie in which the fighting scenes where the combatants become so raggedly brilliant in their tired but brutalized condition. Unfortunately, this amazing directing and acting performances cannot overcome the periodic slow pace of the movie in spots as well as a plot twists that were on much better display in John le Carre's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy mini-television series (1979) or The Russian House (1990) based on Le Carre's novel. If only this movie had taken its prompts from Paul McGuigan's Lucky Number Slevin (2006) for its stylish action and slick plot twisting script, Atomic Blonde might have a much great explosive impact on the movie scene.",Atomic Blonde
47,The-Sarkologist,One Awesome Soundtrack,8,4 August 2017,"It turns out that this is another movie that was based on a comic (or a graphic novel), though I had never heard of the movie until I saw the preview on IMDb. At first it really didn't appeal to me, namely because it seemed to be one of those spy thrillers that I tend to find rather boring. However, as the trailer moved on it turned out to be quite a bit more than that – more like an action movie that a rather slow thriller like the John La Carre novels, so I decided to go an see it – that and the fact that a friend of mine also saw the preview the week before (and he has a reasonably good taste in films).The movie is more of a retrospective, set in Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall. Actually, the whole protest movement, and eventual fall, is occurring in the background while our Atomic Blonde is running around trying to find a Russian agent, a list that could prove disastrous to British Intelligence, and a double agent that is basically leaking everything to the Russians. While slow at first, the action does pick up quite a bit, though you are sometimes left wondering what is real and what is not, and who this double agent actually is.The thing that really got me into this movie is the awesome soundtrack – it was like a trip back to the eighties, and even took you into a late 80s Berlin nightclub. Mind you, one of our characters is quite an interesting fellow, since he seems to demonstrate the lifestyle that many of the agents back then lived – a rather extravagant one. Okay, maybe that is a bit of a misnomer that originally came out of the James Bond movies, and there are a lot of attempts to try and remind people that the life of a spy is actually no where near as exciting as the films make it out to be (once again, look at the John La Carre novels). Yet, there was a suggestion that our philandering Mr Bond wasn't too far from the truth – not so much where it came to super villains in their lairs, but rather the wine, women, and the parties that they would attend.Yet Atomic Blonde is much darker and grittier than your typical James Bond film. This isn't Monte Carlo, or the Cayman Islands, but rather it is a dark and gritty East Berlin that is under the ever watchful eyes of the Stasi while mass protests are slowly tearing the country apart. These are dark and gritty hotels, with danger around every corner. This is seen when our Atomic Blonde, at the beginning of the movie, shows a body full of scars and bruises, and during the debriefing they comment on her black eye.However, as I have mentioned, the problem is that once you get to the end you are left scratching your head because it is suggested that one person is the double agent, but then again it is somebody else, and you also have a third person thrown in that you never saw before. Okay, they were trying to make this out to be a spy thriller, as well as an action film, and a spy thriller wouldn't be a spy thriller without a twist, however it simply didn't seem to work for me. Still, the movie was quite fun to watch, though the end did drag on for just that little bit too long.",Atomic Blonde

49,paulclaassen,"Good, but should have opted for a different narrative.",6,8 June 2018,"First-time director David Leitch is a very versatile man - being an actor, stuntman, writer, producer and stunt coordinator. He combined his experience in these fields to bring us an unforgettable spy thriller. Charlize Theron was excellent as a spy on a mission to find a list of double agents. I enjoyed this spy thriller being set in 1989, before all the modern technology and mobile phones. It was a different approach to the modern spy thrillers out there at the moment.I would have preferred a different narrative, though, as the films takes us backwards and forwards in time with Charlize's character, Lorraine Broughton, telling the story in an interrogation room. This approach was similar to 'Life of Pi' for instance, and removed a great number of suspense in the process, as we now knew nothing was going to happen to our protagonist. It would have been more effective in a straight forward storytelling narrative. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film's pacing and the action scenes were incredible. The premise was a bit complex, hence the film deserves more than just one viewing to fully understand how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. I can't help but wonder why the Lesbian scene was added to the film, as it wasn't relevant to the characters or the story and might be a bit inappropriate for this type of film.The film felt very much like a female version of James Bond, with a bit of 'John Wick' thrown in the mix. Just like John Wick, the fighting scenes become more brutal and intense as the film progressed. Although it was rather violent, it was exceptionally well done. The entire cast was very good, as well.",Atomic Blonde
50,tomgillespie2002,Style over substance,6,1 December 2017,"There is a scene about two-thirds into Atomic Blonde that will likely go down in cinema history as one of the most exhilarating displays of visual trickery and good-ol' fashioned stunt work that the action genre has ever offered. Charlize Theron's MI6 spook enters an apartment building in pre-Wall collapse Berlin with a wounded informant and battles gun-toting thugs up and down stairs, in and out of various rooms, using fists, knives, a crowbar, and just about anything else she can lay her hands on. It's a kinetic, utterly dazzling set-piece that eventually takes the violence outside and into a moving car, all in one long, mind-bogglingly complex take. It comes as no surprise that David Leitch, an uncredited director behind 2014's sleeper hit John Wick, is the man calling the shots.This spectacular moment justifies whatever entry fee you paid to see Atomic Blonde, and highlights just what can be achieved with action cinema when a director like Leitch is the puppet-master behind it. Yet it also underlines the lack of heart and intrigue contained within the rest of this tale of double-agents and double-crosses whenever Theron's Lorraine Broughton isn't kicking butt. She is sent to a Berlin bristling with tension and distrust after MI6 agent James Gascoigne (Sam Hargrave) is murdered by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin (Johannes Haukur Johannesson) and a wristwatch containing a microfilm list of intelligence agents is stolen. Her task is to find the list, assassinate a double agent known as Satchel, and rendezvous with David Percival (James McAvoy), a fellow agent who has recently 'gone feral'. Matters are complicated when Lorraine falls for young French agent Delphine (Sofia Boutella), and Stasi informant Spyglass (Eddie Marsan) reveals that he has memorised the contents of the microfilm.Based on Antony Johnston and Sam Hart's graphic novel The Coldest City and re-titled Atomic Blonde to suit the 80's setting, the film looks slick, colourful and chocked full of period detail. While the grey streets of Berlin are laced with ice and stalked by shadowy double agents, the interiors show the German capital in 1989 as a catwalk for the newest fashions and a platform for great music. Theron dons a variety of outfits to suit whatever role she is playing in her mission, naturally looking great in the process, and will likely make many teenagers' dreams come true in her steamy scenes with Boutella. It's all very superficial, with very few characters succeeding to engage on an emotional level. Spyglass, a man trying to save his family from falling into the hands of the Russians and using every tool at his disposal to do so, is the most interesting character in the film. Marsan is always a delight to watch, and it's a shame he doesn't feature more than he does.Although she certainly looks terrific, Lorraine doesn't really seem to do all that much. Her approach is to enter a room looking fabulous, receive information from the dodgiest-looking person in there, and proceed to dispatch anybody foolish enough to confront her. She's a wafer-thin protagonist, but Theron brings a great physicality to the role, and the actress is now the most accomplished action star working today. As Percival, McAvoy continues to impress with his ability to juggle the good guy, bad guy act. He did so to great effect in Trance and Split, and here he injects a Tyler Durden-esque fashion sense and swagger to his punk- rock rogue agent who may be Lorraine's largest obstacle. Ultimately, Atomic Blonde is a handsome, exciting action movie with fantastic physical performances all round and a central set-piece that will leave you as breathless as its participants. Anyone hoping for a deeper exploration of the shady world it so wonderfully sets up will leave frustratingly underwhelmed.",Atomic Blonde

52,cruise01,"Charlize Theron is a brute force, nothing can get in her way in this stylized action film.",8,27 July 2017,"Atomic Blonde is violent, stylized with impressive fight sequences and tone. Even, the 1980s soundtrack on the movie was perfect in every scene if it was a German group or an 1980s group. From the help of director David Leitch, who can handle the action sequences very well, the style, and tone of the movie. He made John Wick an entertaining movie and now Atomic Blonde follows right up there. The plot follows Lorraine (Charlize Theron) an MI6 agent, who is trying to track down a list of double agents that's been taken. She will need the help from David (James McAvoy) and an undercover French agent Delphine (Sofia Boutella). The plot is just a typical standard spy concept. Lorraine is professional at what she does. She cant trust anyone in Berlin, were anyone can be a double agent. But she does what she does best, she gets the job done. Even if it requires her to beat down several guys with anything she sees from either a rope, corkscrew, keys, or just her skilled fighting. She takes a beating, she is no invincible character. The opening scene opens with her coming out of an ice cold bathtub with bruises all around her body. Charlize Theron is awesome as the character. And the fight stunts was brutal and gritty. The action and fight sequences are top notch exciting and gritty. If you seen John Wick, you may know how it will be. Some scenes may leave you cringing as a character gets keys stabbed into their face. One awesome impressive scene was when she was in a building trying to protect Spyglass (Eddie Marsan) and several guys are trying to fight her. The scene was well orchestrated in one single take with the camera for like 8 minutes. Which was impressive to see and I am curious to see the behind the scenes on how that was planned out. Even when she escapes in a car, and the camera is set in the backseat as we see what she sees in the car chase. Charlize Theron was great. She has been great in her other movies like Mad Max, and even as the underwritten villain in Fast 8. Sofia Boutella was beautiful and stunning as well. She did well with her character. James McAvoy was also a great actor. But my one issue with the film is the script does leave all the supporting characters to be one dimensional and predictable. It would have been better if the characters were layered and had more depth so when a twist appeared, the impact could have been more satisfying. David Leitch focused majority of his work on the action and style. The movie was never slow or boring. It runs in a fast pace. The 1980s soundtrack was great from 99 Balloons, even a dubbed language of Major Tom song, etc. There was plenty of gun shoot outs and fight sequences to make the film worth watching. Overall, Atomic Blonde is a good spy action film. The plot of the main character searching for an agent list and going through every set piece fighting bad guys. The cast was perfect. Downside is the supporting characters were predictable and shallow. The direction and music on the film was great. For the most part, the action was worth seeing and seeing Charlize Theron being awesome as the brute force agent.",Atomic Blonde
53,eddie_baggins,This female John Wick is lacking in charms,4,6 May 2018,"Atomic Blonde wants to be the female John Wick (it even shares one half of John Wick's direction team in the form of filmmaker David Leitch) but this stylistically shot yet often unengaging action affair adapted from a cult graphic novel series, is a film that tries too hard to be cool, coming off then as a wannabe, rather than a genuine contender for John Wick's female lead partner in butt-kicking crime.As if she needed to prove to us that she can match it with the boys after her brilliant Furiosa performance in Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron is perfectly cast as M16 super-agent Lorraine Broughton, tasked to head to Berlin during the heat of the East/West tensions of 1989 and recover a secret list of undercover agents before it falls into the wrong hands.Theron's Broughton is like the daughter of Jason Bourne and John Wick (if that were a possibility) as she fights and shoots her way through a plethora of generic goons, wisecracks and defies logic in her quest for survival.The action of Atomic Blonde is directed proficiently, a highlight being an extended sequence in an apartment building that eventually turns into a fight on the roads and you will absolutely believe that Theron can take it to any baddie's brave enough to take her on but the biggest problem with Leitch's film is that Lorraine is a bit of a wet-blanket when it comes to charisma and charms, while writer Kurt Johnstad's rather unnecessarily loaded plot-line is sometimes too convoluted and tiresome to truly get invested in.Films like John Wick understand what their audiences want from their experience with the film, they want action, they want thrills and they want it thick and fast and far too often Atomic Blonde takes detours into uninteresting strands, while surprisingly for a film mooted as an action blast, there are often large periods of time where the action disappears for far too long.Another disappointing element to Leitch's film is the underusing of solid supports like James McAvoy, John Goodman, Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan. All fine performers, the collection of recognisable stars bring nothing of note to a film crying out for more memorable and engaging characters, making Atomic Blonde feel like just another action experience rather than an exceptional one.Final Say -Willingly and energetically lead by its leading lady, Atomic Blonde wants desperately to be cool and while it has its moments, Leitch's film is far too bland in a large portion of its delivery to be anything more than a pretty distraction. The search for the female John Wick therefore continues to rage on.2 sets of car keys out of 5",Atomic Blonde
54,leonblackwood,Impressive action but poor storyline!,5,28 January 2018,"Review:
Although the action in this movie was quite impressive, the storyline was pretty poor and I lost interest after a while. I'm not used to seeing an emotionless Theron, who seemed quite depressed through the whole film but she certainly didn't pull her punches. All of the baddies used her like a punching bag, not taking into account that she was a woman but she proved that she can take a punch, even though it seemed a bit far fetched in parts. Anyway, Charlize Theron plays a M16 secret agent, Lorraine Broughton, who is sent to Berlin during the cold war, to retrieve a priceless list which is kept on a watch. She is teamed up with David Percival (James McAvoy), who has been working in Berlin for some time, after the murder of a fellow undercover agent. The secret list contains all of the names of every British spy, so Lorraine has to fight against KGB agents and lethal henchmen, to make sure that the list doesn't get in the wrong hands. There are some twists during the movie, which are quite predictable, and the ending could have been much better, so it was basically the action scenes that saved it. I also wasn't that impressed with the acting, which was moody and glum, and the whole dark look of the film could have done with a pick me up. Anyway, I can't see myself watching this again in a hurry but the action scenes are worth a watch, even though you can tell it's a stunt double. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Leitch, who also directed John Wick and Deadpool: No Good Deed, which was a short for Deadpool. He's know in Hollywood for his stunt work in movies like X-Men Origins, Tron: Legacy, In Time, The Bourne Legacy and many more, so it's not surprising that he spent a lot of the time coordinating the action scenes in this film. Personally, you can tell that he paid more attention to detail in the action scenes, than the actual storyline, because it lacked intensity and the twist toward the end wasn't that great. There are similarities to the great John Wick, in terms of the action, so it gets the thumbs up in that department but you can tell that he hasn't had much experience when it comes to storytelling. Although the movie made a profit, I didn't hear much noise about people wanting a sequel, so I can't see there being another Atomic Blonde anytime soon.Budget: $30million

55,TheMovieDiorama,Atomic Blonde is yet another exercise of style over substance.,6,2 March 2018,"These can be considered masterful for certain films (The Neon Demon) or borderline mediocre for others (Only God Forgives). Unfortunately, I found this to be in the latter category. Yes, I was ever so slightly underwhelmed. I wanted more but everything felt so restrained, like being tied up by Charlize Theron...view that as good or bad entirely up to you. Lorraine, the damn sexiest spy that ever lived, is sent to Berlin to retrieve a list of agents from an individual known as ""Spyglass"" in which she meets up with fellow station officer David Percival. But, as with most spy films, we've got a whole lot of backstabbing and a whole lot of tape recording. Penned the female John Wick, Atomic Blonde has several beautifully crafted action scenes and I'm sure everyone who has seen it will agree that the stairway fight was possibly one of the best scenes this year. Edited to look like one long take, it was flipping majestic to watch. Charlize Theron, as we all know, is sexy, sassy and a badass. She's no different here, it's as if heaven sent down an action Goddess...in the form of Theron. Perfection, this was her film and she owned it. Having said that, her character is either consuming alcohol, smoking or submerging herself in an ice cold bath...so maybe not perfect? James McAvoy and the rest of the supporting cast were good. Adored the 1980's Berlin setting and the soundtrack was ace. I admired David Leitch's style once again, great use of neon lighting. All of this is great but one problem, the plot was so so so dull, monotonous, lifeless and dare I say boring? Urgh, I wanted to love this but I couldn't. It was such a generic boring spy story that I practically forgot about it as soon as I left the cinema. That, is not a good thing...at all. Also the narrative for the first half was all over the place, switching back and forth constantly between scenes was rather jarring. Disappointing in the script department. Apart from those massive blunders, it's actually not too bad. Just...underwhelming.",Atomic Blonde

Because the mentioned movies got more fast action and the fighting scenes are a notch better, I rate Atomic Blonde 6. So all in all nothing new on the Western Front but a good one time watch if you want pop-corn action without using your brain.",Atomic Blonde
57,matthewssilverhammer,Anemic Bland,4,4 August 2017,"On the show ""Cake Wars"", bakers compete in creating elaborate and amazing sculptures entirely out of cake. There's a rumor, however, that despite looking incredible, the cakes themselves don't actually taste that great. Atomic Blonde fits that mold perfectly: stylish and pretty, but mostly tasteless and empty. An onslaught of sight and sound amounting to little more than a hedonistic fever dream, without much meaningful depth or clarity. In this mediocre John Wick / Drive knock-off, Theron plays a spy in the 1980s who kicks butt and doesspy things. It's kind of a woman-empowerment movie, but Wonder Woman it's not. If she's not fighting, she's in various states of undress; it all screams of the male-gaze, and not of sexual liberation. Plastered with distracting modern renditions of 80s pop song, ill-fated attempts at humor, and piles of thriller movie clichés (""Have you noticed how everyone you get close to ends up dead?""), it's more obnoxious than exciting. I've often contended that the biggest sin a movie can commit is being boring, and Atomic Blonde mostly isn't that. One scene in particular, a long-take hand-to-hand fight in a staircase, is not only the best scene in the movie, but maybe one of the most impressive of the year. However, the second biggest movie-sin may be a desperate desire to seem cool over all else, which this definitely commits. The constant neon lighting, the insecure directing, the completely unnecessary framing device, even that one great scene could be watched completely out-of-context and you wouldn't miss a thing. Skip the film, and just google that scene. You'll save $10 and 2 hours that I can never get back.",Atomic Blonde

59,Vartiainen,Charlize Theron as James Bond in the Cold War Berlin,6,20 August 2017,"The directorial debut of a longtime stunt coordinator David Leitch, one of the talents behind, for example, John Wick. And that definitely shows, in good and bad.So the story goes that there's a mole in the MI6's roster of agents and they have gotten their hands on a list, which details the real identities and activities of every single agent they have. The list is currently in Berlin, in days just before the fall of the Wall, and thus they send in their very best to get the list back. That very best being Charlize Theron's Lorraine Broughton.A serviceable plot, I could ask for nothing more. It allows for an exciting location, lots of cool shots and a touch of historical accuracy, which is always a welcome spice in these films. And Leitch takes full advantage of the location, if not the historical event. This film looks gorgeous. Every shot, every scene, is masterfully constructed to leave an impact and to look as stylish as all heavens. Neon colours are in heavy use, the camera angles are inventive and the action scenes are shot in such a way that you can feel every punch, every impact. It's brutal, it's gory, it's absolutely fantastic.Unfortunately the story sucks. It really feels like they wrote a James Bond script and just cast Charlize Theron in the role. Which in and on itself is not the problem. Theron more than convinces as an action star and more power to her for doing these roles and doing them so well. The problem is that her character is dull as cardboard. She very rarely raises her voice, shows any interest or even says anything interesting. All that has been shunted to James McAvoy's local agent, David Percival, a man of complex motives.Which in turn leads us to the second problem the film has. It's convoluted. I don't expect my spy films to be simple romps from point A to point B, there should be twists, but when your twists have twists within twists, and then you throw in some last minute twists, without establishing your locations, character motives or backgrounds properly, it becomes a tad annoying to follow. There's also a completely unnecessary framing story where Theron's character explains the happenings of the film to her superiors. We keep cutting back to this interrogation and it keeps getting duller and duller to watch.I don't regret seeing Atomic Blonde. The action scenes alone paid for the price of admission. Add the gorgeous visuals, the fun characters (not counting Theron's) and the backdrop of late 80s Berlin, and you have something there. The story is not told well, but is still not bad either. A film that is more style than substance, but for me personally it was enough.",Atomic Blonde
60,paul-allaer,The female version of John Wick,7,28 July 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of British super-spy Lorraine. As the movie opens, we are told it's ""Berlin, November, 1989"" (some days before the fall of the Wall). Another spy is hunted down and killed by a KGB spy. We then switch to ""London, 10 Days Later"", and Lorraine is about to be debriefed by her MI6 superior and a guy from the CIA. At that point, things shift to ""The Beginning"", and we learn the full story. AT this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from David Leitch, who co-directed the unexpected box office hit ""John Wick"". Here he takes on a similar type (ultra-violent) movie, but instead with a female lead character. Let's be honest, Charlize Theron TOWERS over this movie. The first shot we see of her is when she rises from an ice-bath she is taking to recover (we're not quite sure of what, at that time), and the shot of her back and arms (also featured in the movie's trailer) is just awesome. And it only gets better from there. Theron claws and kicks and shoots her way out of the most hair-raising binds. She will not be denied! There is a key scene in the middle of the movie where seemingly an army of KGBers are after her, and it just blows you away. Some reviews have referred to Theron ""asserting"" herself as an action star. Did they not see ""Mad Max Fury Road"" in 2015? Theron was so over-powering in her role that she managed to reduce Mad Max as a side kick in his own movie franchise! I was also impressed with Atomic Blonde's production set, as the makers have faithfully recreated Berlin circa 1989 (the movie was filmed in both Budapest and Berlin), down to the last details. Not quite so good is the fact that the script is less than ideal, and also that at no point do we (or at least I) end up caring for any of these characters, and instead we simply stick around for the next over-the-top cartoon-ish (the film is based on a graphic novel) fight scenes. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding music, both the score by Tyler Bates (of Marilyn Manson) and the many song placements, including the key German hits from the 1980s such as 99 Luftballons, Major Tom (Völlig Losgelöst), and Der Kommissar, just to name those.""Atomic Blonde"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how well this plays at the box office. Regardless, if you liked ""John Wick"" or remember Theron from ""Mad Max Fury Road"", I am quite sure that you will like ""Atomic Blonde"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Atomic Blonde
61,GOWBTW,"Charlize Theron puts the ""B"" in BOMBSHELL!",9,28 July 2017,"Charlize Theron really out did herself in this film. Plenty of action and suspense, ""Atomic Blonde"" carried out well. Theron plays Lorraine Broughton, a top level MI-6 agent who goes undercover in Berlin in the year, 1989. 1989 was the year of big changes: The Cold War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, etc. Agent Broughton(Theron) was brought in for questioning about the mission. A fellow agent was killed by the KGB, and the list was out in the open. Her fighting skills are undeniable, and was able to dispatch her enemies efficiently. Traveling from West to East, she meets David Percival (James McAvoy) and a French agent named Delphine Lasalle(Sofia Boutella) they all work together to find the list and the person behind all the killings. It would later turned out to be that Percival couldn't be trusted, and would later pay for his deceit to the MI-6. This movie has plenty to go by. The music of the 80's, the camera shots from different angles, and choreography done. The shots of Charlize Theron are amazing in every way. From her battle scars to her girl on girl action. I also like the hotel scene where her battle against the the rich arms dealer and his henchmen meet their doom at Lorraine hands. Keeping a cold gun is perfect for hot action! If you want to enjoy this movie, hope you like vodka. It's cool and hot at the same time. This movie is not a dud, whatsoever! 4.5 out of 5 stars",Atomic Blonde

If you are a man and you had dreams of being a big macho guy, you were all wrong, you haven't met Lorraine Broughton yet, her character in ""Atomic Blonde"". She's stronger than men, she's fighting with more than one at a time, she's very bad. And, at the end, she kills them. She's gonna kick your ass too, no matter you'll do! Charlize Theron is cool just like the ice cubes in those bath-tube she takes in the movie. The other actors are OK, but due to Charlize's extremely strong personality, they all seem to be just a bunch of extras. Very good action, dynamically, nervously and spectacularly filmed. Good '80s music too, Peter Schilling - Major Tom, Re-Flex - The Politics Of Dancing, After The Fire - Der Kommissar, David Bowie - Cat People(Putting Out Fire), etc. Very good job, Charlize!",Atomic Blonde

The film another entry in the near-indestructible, über-competent female super-agent canon and has little to offer beyond a great retro vibe, excellent 1980s-inspired soundtrack, and a sleek, sexy protagonist. Typical of graphic-novel adaptations, the film is mostly about style (permeating) and imagery (great) with a complex story that is little more than an excuse to string together a series of photogenic set-pieces. Perhaps with careful parsing, the plot would ultimately make sense but at a cursory viewing it does not (it escapes me whether the endless KGB cannon fodder sent against the blond reaper were actually supposed to kill her or just to die trying). The film is bloody and filled with coarse language (often for dubious comic effect) but generally pretty well done. Great for what it is - not art but maybe a reasonable facsimile in this age of media superficiality and nano-attention spans.",Atomic Blonde

But in the world of spies, nothing is what it seems.Action scenes are very well filmed, so where fights scenes that I believe where inspired off of James Bond and Jason Bourne. Charlize Theron at the start is pretty boring, trying to hard to be a female Daniel Craig, I really see it in her performance, but she gets better has the movie goes on, when James McAvoys character comes in the film gets interesting, Theron and McAvoy bring out the best in each other, performance wise. McAvoy simple chews up every scene he's in. The problem here is when there wasn't any action going on, it felt like a promotion for cigarettes, almost every scene, to the point where it was getting repetitive. John Goodman and Toby Jones are good in there roles also. Played a lot of 80's music, just to remind us that it set in 1989, which wasn't needed, I mean 2 or 3 songs maybe.

66,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,23 December 2018,"It SHOULD have been good. It is a spy movie with a basic spy movie plot. It promises double crosses and intrigue.But it never really delivers on the suspense and tension that are the principle trope of good spy movies...and it never really delivers on the empty mindless popcorn stuffing atmosphere that are the basic tropes of action movies.So in the end you're left with a movie that isn't tense and suspenseful enough to be ""3 Days of the Condor"" or ""The Americans"" and a movie that isn't as mindless action packed fun as James Bond.All the elements were there, but they never seemed to pull them off. It's like that old Native American saying, ""if you chase two rabbits you'll lose them both."" And that's really what happened here. it tried to be two different kinds of spy movie in one and never really made it into either.You're left wondering why you bothered. Had they picked one and went whole headlong for that goal, it could have been stellar. Instead it's luke warm at best.",Atomic Blonde
67,stevendbeard,Female John Wick,8,29 July 2017,"I saw ""Atomic Blonde"", starring Charlize Theron-Mad Max:Fury Road, The Legend of Bagger Vance; James McAvoy-Split, Wanted; Sofia Boutella-The Mummy_2017, Kingsman:The Secret Service and John Goodman-Kong:Skull Island, Flight.This is a cold war spy movie that is based on a 2012 graphic novel written by Antony Johnston called 'The Coldest City'. It takes place in 1989, just before the Berlin wall came tumbling down. Charlize plays an MI-6 agent that is sent on a mission to get microfilm containing names of agents that could be put in danger if it gets into the wrong hands. And believe me, there are lots of hands wanting the info. There are Russian agents, British agents-besides Charlize-French agents and there is even a double agent thrown in to make things interesting. James is the British agent meeting Charlize, Sofia is the French agent that is pretty new to the spy game and John is the C.I.A. man that wants to get his hands on the list, just like everyone else. I must admit, I might be a little biased here, because I love spy movies, with the James Bond movies being my favorite. I had heard in the trailers that Charlize might be considered a female Bond in this role but to me, she reminds me more of a female John Wick. The fight scenes are amazing and look great- Big kudos to the choreographer. And Charlize doesn't just win every fight easily with narry a scratch on her. She looks like she takes a beating-And yes, I know it is planned out by stunt men to insure the least amount of actual injuries but it still looked fantastic. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Atomic Blonde
68,meeza,"Great to look at! And the film was pretty good too! Yea baby, Chaaarlize!",8,25 August 2017,"I liked it better when the action spy thriller ""Atomic Blonde"" was called ""Juana Wick"". OK, that was a wicked pun! And I am kidding, because Director David Leitch's ""Atomic Blonde"" was very much fun, especially if you are an aficionado of late 80's New Wave electronic music; which present company is included. The movie stars the ""still stunning"" Charlize Theron as Lorraine Broughton, an undercover MI6 agent who is sent to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents. The movie is filled with intoxicating music from New Wave giants Depeche Mode, New Order, Reflexx, David Bowie, After the Fire, Peter Schilling, and more. But hello! Why wasn't there no Berlin music in a movie set in Berlin! Anyways, Agent Broughton is brought to Berlin to pair up with an insider David Percival to help with her mission. Leitch does not bring an apex of gravitas to the picture and Kurt Johnstad's screenplay does muddle at times, but Leitch does encompass the film with a very stylish look and again sensational music which glued me in. Theron has never looked better and does deliver the ""fem badass"" goods as Lorraine. James McAvoy was solid as the sketchy Percival, and John Goodman continues to prove that he is a good man to see act with his work as a CIA Supervisor. So it's time for you to get ""behind the wheel"" get over your ""blue Monday or whatever day"" blues and get atomized to experience this ""Atomic Blonde"". **** Good",Atomic Blonde
69,alindsay-al,A good unique action film,7,15 August 2017,"The trailers for this film were pretty excellent and I had really high hopes for this film and now I have seen atomic blonde and I did like it. The premise of this film is set at the end of the cold war a British spy is sent to Berlin to track down a stolen list of all agents. Charlize Theron plays the lead in this film and does a really great job, she is amazing in the action scenes and totally sells every hit she takes to make you truly care about her character. Her character has a lot of depth to her and it is really interesting watching her do her job. The supporting cast does a really good job, James McAvoy plays Theron's contact in Germany and he is easily the best part of this film, I think he is possibly one of the best actors in the business at the moment. He was the most interesting character in this film as you try to work out what his character up to and the quality of the performer sold it well. Toby Jones and john Goodman are in the film in smaller roles but they do great jobs selling there performances and there characters. Sofia boutella is also in this film and she does a good job in this film and her chemistry with Theron is good. The story has some interesting moments in this film especially between Theron and mcavoys characters that made me intrigued about there situation. However, this film's plot is very convoluted and sometimes a bit hard to follow. Also the structure of this film's plot bugged me, no spoilers but it just annoyed me. The script has some really good dialogue in it that made these characters fun to watch. However, the drama didn't feel particularly well done or as emotional as it should have done considering the stakes. The style for this film is very lavish and extravagant, the action scenes in this film were pretty incredible. There is a sequence on a staircase that is absolutely amazing that has to be seen no matter what. But I fee like at times in this film it was style over substance and felt like to much of this film was over the top style. Overall this is a decent action film which if you are a fan of action movies it is a film you should watch.",Atomic Blonde

Obviously, if that is exposed, many people's true identities and lives will be in jeopardy. While you follow her investigation, you are accompanied by many entertaining musical hits from the era which, along with the striking styling, overshadow the standard story. The production value was high and the fighting scenes are overtly bloody and brutal. Overall, it was an average yet stylish action movie.",Atomic Blonde

Also excellent was Sofia Boutella in a smaller role. And close to stealing the show was James McAvoy.

73,jimbo-53-186511,"Not terrible, but disappointing",5,3 August 2018,"An undercover agent is tasked with recovering a 'list' during the Cold War, but ends up being 'made' and subsequently killed. When the list ends up in the 'wrong' hands and goes missing it's down to M16's best agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) to head to Berlin to recover the list...In Atomic Blonde it becomes fairly evident early on that the story is a little old hat and that very little has been done to reinvent the wheel, but at the same time unoriginality doesn't always have to be viewed negatively as long as it is taken in context.The good news about Atomic Blonde is that it does have a sort of kinetic flow about it which means that despite its faults it isn't a dull film and rarely becomes boring - it sometimes feels like a female John Wick film although given its female heroine it probably shares more in common with the Angelina Jolie film Salt. The ass kicking aspect of the film is fun to watch, but unfortunately for me the fight sequences form the most memorable aspects of the film. The story is pretty meh and didn't really do much to draw me in - the predictable nature of the narrative didn't help either to be honest.I think what made it worse is the film's lack of humour; it's far too serious for its own good and despite McAvoy and Theron's occasional attempts at interplay the film falls flat in this respect and once again falls back on the fight sequences, which incidentally, are fairly well choreographed, but are not really up there with the best action films.The acting is fairly good and does raise the film up a notch; Theron does a great job as a no nonsense M16 agent, but she's perhaps a bit too no nonsense and more light-hearted relief from her would have served the film better. McAvoy is once again excellent and is probably the best thing about this film. Boutella is also good with a rather limited character and superb character actor Eddie Marsan also shines as well.Atomic Blonde isn't terrible, but it's fairly uninspiring and for me it just didn't do much to set the juices flow. Having said that, it does have some rather nice girl-on-girl action which did offset some of the tedium and resulted in a film that I couldn't entirely hate even though it wasn't all that good.",Atomic Blonde
74,kluseba,Stylish Cold War action-thriller with a strong lead character,8,31 August 2017,"Atomic Blonde is a stylish action-thriller set in the final weeks of the Cold War in the quirky town of Berlin. The movie has its flaws in the first third but gets progressively better and really grabs the viewer's attention by the end. Those who liked films like Hanna or Salt where a clever woman defies dangerous enemies, shady superiors and treacherous partners will adore Atomic Blonde.The movie had a very slow start though. The first third of the movie seems only to consist Charlize Theron's character trying out different stylish outfits and music of the eighties we are all too familiar with. The story seems to go nowhere in the beginning and only gets interesting when the main character meets a French undercover agent.From then on, the movie offers everything you can expect from that type of film. The story develops mysterious characters, offers numerous twists and turns and quickens up pace and tension. The fight sequences are spectacular and particularly authentic. CGI technology isn't overused and even the use of shaky cameras isn't as bad as in many other contemporary action movies. The viewers also get to explore the beautiful and ugly sides of both East and West Berlin throughout the film. It's an excellent publicity campaign for Germany's unique capital. The movie ends with a stunning showdown and once you already think it's all over, the film's resolution offers another gripping surprise.In the end, Atomic Blonde has a few flaws but is overall an entertaining, stylish and twisted action-thriller that will appeal to those interested in the Cold War and in movie centered around strong women. Due to its intense action sequences and very present soundtrack, the film is best enjoyed at your local movie theatre. Even though I'm usually not a fan of sequels or franchises in general, it would be interesting to see other movies involving the intriguing main character in the future.",Atomic Blonde

76,aharmas,Being a spy is hard work,9,12 August 2017,"Charlize Theron shines as Lorraine in this entertaining and intelligent thriller where things are not as they seem, and where surprises are ready to spring at any time. Lorraine is a complex and tortured individual who lives to survive, making a few stops along the way, and these can be sometimes inconvenient and lethal (usually for others around here).Most of the story appears to take place in Berlin in the days before the fall of the wall. The atmosphere and unrest and unpredictability allow the various spies' maneuvers room to deviate from what their original plans were. We get plenty of fights, some of which are awesome and unbelievable, and there is a minor car chase that is nevertheless very powerful, and with a couple of really cool crashes.The story opens as Lorraine is interrogated about a mission that might have gone awry. She is not happy being there, particularly with a couple of people who might just want her to take the fall. She stands her ground and relates everything that happened. There was an original mission, but this changes in the early part of the film, and soon she is chasing new leads, meeting some really hot people, and ultimately playing the game of survival. Soon she's teaming up with a new member of the French intelligence and wondering how resourceful Percival is going to be, helping her achieve her goal.As expected, the intrigue grows, the suspense increases, and the mystery thickens, as people start dropping dead, and she has more than one close encounter with people who work for people who needed her gone. The question is ""who is really pulling the strings?"" In the meantime, she kicks, boxes, slaps, and does everything physical move to keep going. She's also fantastic wearing some really cool outfits and reminds us what a star Ms. Theron is. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and just wondered who else could have done such an impressive and difficult job. I'm still uncertain as to how much of the fighting scenes were done by her.So, the ending will shock a few people, but it ends true to its core. It's always satisfying to see how a piece ties all its strands together, leaving us happy that we have seen an entertaining and intelligent moving picture. Hats off!",Atomic Blonde

Well that's Berlin.""What was the overall feeling after watching ""Atomic Blonde""? For me it was a mixture of confusion and excitement at the same time. Confusion because of the complex story with a multitude of twists and spy related mumbo jumbo. To be honest, I always have that with this kind of movies. So you can assume that I'm not a big fan of espionage movies. Not even James Bond movies. Even though these story lines are rather straightforward and simplistic in my eyes. ""Atomic Blonde"" on the other hand is in a different league. At a certain point I didn't know anymore what was going on and what role the main characters played. I even forgot the main goal. The only things I still could re-imagine in the end, were the fierce action scenes and the appetizing looking curves of Charlize Terron. Should all female spies in a movie use the same wardrobe as Terron did here, I instantly would become a fervent fan of this genre. There's nothing so exciting as a blonde shrew, wearing sensual knee-length boots and sexy suspenders, who gives her male opponents a solid kick in their glockenspiel.Guess what. I was more excited about the soundtrack used here. Perhaps this was disruptive to some but personally I thought this was pleasant addition. Well, maybe it's because I'm a hard-core fan of music from the 80's. And I'm not talking about boys-bands or disco music, but the underground and alternative kind of music. Unfortunately, they had to choose the most annoying song from the entire Neue Deutsche Welle repertoire. During that period I often wished for Nena to disappear with her 99 air balloons beyond the horizon. It would have been way better to include ""Stunde des Glücks"" from Fehlfarben or ""Schlachtet!"" From Grauzone. But besides this weak moment, I was pleasantly surprised to hear ""Cities in dust"" from Siouxsie & the Banshees, ""Cat People"" by David Bowie and ""I ran"" from A flock or seagulls. In terms of mood, this musical framework certainly made for a positive feeling. In retrospect, I'll remember this playlist more than the movie itself.It's all about an ultra-secret list (hidden in a wristwatch) with names of spies who are actively working in the Soviet Union doing  uh  I suppose spy-work. The entire film is situated in dark Berlin of the 80's, where the ultimate symbol of the cold war still stands. The Berlin wall. It's in the shadow of this gray decor where this spy movie takes place. In this post-war city, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) tries to get the list back together with colleague spy David Percival (James McAvoy), who has his own agenda apparently. The fact there are other sharks in this spy-pond who are interested in getting that list, is something Lorraine experiences real soon. The entire story is displayed in flashback mode. The whole story is being told by Lorraine during a debriefing in the presence of Eric Gray (Toby Jones), some superior at MI6, and Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman) from the C.I.A. What follows are some bad-ass action sequences that'll thrill you. Unfortunately, these impressive, action-filled scenes are no guarantee to make it a memorable movie .Perhaps it was the intention to make a female ""John Wick"" spin-off. But unlike the latter, where action scenes followed each other in a breathtaking pace, this movie only contains three (sublime choreographed) violent and action-packed scenes. First the German Polizei notices that the color of their green uniforms is replaced by the color of emerging bruises and dripping blood. And as icing on the cake you'll be presented with a damn elongated scene where KGB agents are being banged up pretty bad. Next you'll see an intense car chase across Berlin. And then you'll get a plot twist involving double agents and counterespionage shizzle. And that's where I suddenly lost the thread. To be honest, that's it in a nutshell. Even the lesbian it's-supposed-to-be-a-hot scene wasn't interesting enough to get me ecstatic. In my view, this was added just so the presence of Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella) seemed functional again.In terms of acting, it was quite all right, although Charlize Theron impressed me more as Furiosa in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"". James McAvoy was sublime. But then again, I thought he was more convincing as the guy with a split personality in ""Split"". Eddie Marsan, John Goodman and Toby Jones complete the rest of the cast and showed once again their acting skills. But despite the brilliant acting, the violent and furious action, the atmospheric images and a soundtrack which made me feel young again, I thought the story-line was incoherent, quite inconsistent and superfluous. You can't call it the counterpart of ""John Wick"". And for those who say this film is amazing because of the fact that it's an action movie with a female action heroine in it, I suggest to look up these movies and re-watch them : ""Alien"", ""Terminator"", ""Salt"" or ""Kill Bill"". You'll also see an action heroine with giant cajones, who's filleting the other sex (or species) without blinking an eye. But still, highly recommended.More reviews here : http://movie-freak.be",Atomic Blonde
79,a_chinn,"Charlize Theron delivers 1980s Cold War badassery from the uncredited co-director of ""John Wick""",8,17 July 2018,"From the uncredited co-director of ""John Wick"" comes an action film of equal badassery. Charlize Theron is dynamite in this Cold War action film, where she plays an undercover MI6 agent tasked with recovering a missing list of undercover agents. The plot is perfunctory at best, but it does serve to take Theron through a 1989 East and West Berlin right before the wall came down, featuring 80s punks, neon drenched nightclubs, and a killer soundtrack that ranges from The Clash, to David Bowie, to Queen, and loads more. ""Atomic Blonde"" would have been a solid action film without the Cold War 80s setting, but adding this retro element turned this film's cool factor up to eleven. Theron is amazingly 80s cool with her short hair and go-go boots, but shines most strongly when she's kicking ass (she actually did a majority of her fighting and stunt work on the film). Enough cannot be said of how much Theron adds to this film. She's an Oscar calibre of actress starring in an unabashedly popcorn film, which greatly elevates ""Atomic Blonde"" from if the filmmakers had simply cast a pretty face like Milla Jovovich or even legit badasses like MMA fighter Gina Carano (everyone should watch her film ""Haywire"" though). It also helps that you have a solid supporting cast that includes Toby Jones, John Goodman, and James McAvoy as a terrifically sleazy undercover agent. The other hero of this film is director David Leitch, who bring the same level of relentlessly intense action he brought to the John Wick films. The fight scenes and shoots outs are as fast as a Hong Kong action film, but also embrace the more muscular American approach to action films, which adds up to a style of action that feels like something wholly new (Kurt Wimmer's ""Gun-Fu"" in ""Equilibrium"" and ""Ultraviolet"" was the last new style of film action I can recall that felt like something new and not tried before). As with the best action films, the action builds, starting smaller at first to a quite impressive climactic action sequence. I think the apartment fight sequence that gives the appearance of being one long continuous shot is the most impressive action sequence of the film, but ""Atomic Blonde"" is filled with memorable action scenes. Overall, even though the script is heavy on plot cliches and is short on character development, who really cares when the you have Charlize Theron taking out rooms full of dudes in knee-high boots to awesome 80s tracks!",Atomic Blonde

81,jadepietro,Illegally Blonde: Spy Edition,8,29 July 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An action packed exercise about a secret agent going undercover, although with Charlize Theron as the lead, who wouldn't notice?SYNOPSIS: It's spy vs. spy with a female twist.JIM'S REVIEW: Charlize Theron literally slays it in David Leitch's Atomic Blonde, a high-energy post Cold War spy thriller proving that blondes do have more fun (and so will most moviegoers). The film is on a continuous loop, one action sequence after another, as the narrative follows our sexy female agent uncovering the traitor within her M16 unit.￼It is 1989, right before the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and some missing microfilm containing a list of agents has fallen into the hands of KGB. Lorraine Broughton (Ms. Theron) is sent on a dangerous mission to retrieve it, plus identify and kill a double agent only known as Satchel. Lorraine trusts no one, not even her British contact, Percival (James McAvoy) as she is immediately put in harm's way while unraveling the mystery. The body count of double agents quickly adds up to double digits as the kills are skillfully scored to an 80's pop soundtrack. ￼Atomic Blonde is one very violent and bloody movie. But its many action scenes are choreographed with flourish and jaw-dropping in their stylish execution. Mr. Leitch, a former stuntman, knows his familiar territory well and stages his action with such a high degree of bravado in his solo directorial debut. (The highlight, by far, is a memorable sequence involving our heroine fighting numerous assailants in a tenement staircase that is photographed seamlessly by Johnathan Sela and brilliantly edited by Elísabet Ronaldsdóttir. This section of the film is virtuoso filmmaking and amazing stunt work, sure to be remembered as a classic moment in action thrillers.)￼Written by Kurt Johnstad, the story is primarily just a mere background for the powerfully staged fight sequences. The plot loses some logical order as the film progresses with one too many implausible twist and our spy becomes more superhero than super human, surviving one peril only to almost directly fall into the next encounter. (One can see she remains human as she is battered and bruised in the course of her assignment. In fact, the only downtime set aside to establish depth of character or relationships is during some flashback episodes and some flashes of a naked Ms, Theron having her ice-cold dips in the bathtub to ease the pain. The gratuitous nudity is, no doubt, an appealing prospect. There is also an added lesbian subplot that doesn't amount to much more than insignificant titillation). The filmmakers seem more interested in the fights and lingering on Ms. Theron's sex appeal, a wise decision. They go for style over substance every time.￼The actors fill out their roles well, especially the drop dead gorgeous Ms. Theron who is perfectly cast as Lorraine. She brings her star presence to this venture and takes her former Mad Max crazed persona, adding the glitz and glamour of the retro 80's to her chic character. This operative operates as a female Bond who knows (and shows) all the right moves. More importantly, the moviegoer completely believes that Lorraine could do these incredible things credibly due the Ms. Theron's grace, beauty, and strength. ￼Along for the ride are Mr. McAvoy (providing some needed charm in his underwritten role), John Goodman, Michael Marsan, and Toby Jones to bring an air of dignity to this espionage caper. But it is Ms. Theron's show all the way (plus the hard working stunt crew). Relentlessly brutal and borderline monotonous, Atomic Blonde is escapist fare, far from unique or original. The film really doesn't make much sense as the story plays out with triple cross identities issues, but it is all highly entertaining in a ultra-violent, retro vibe appealing, action- packed sorta way.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Atomic Blonde
82,rgkarim,Atomic Action!,7,28 July 2017,"Spies, they come in every shape and size from goofy men in naked gun to the suave iterations of James Bond. Yet one thing is certain, they often are involved in incredibly threatening situations that require luck, training, and sets of skills to get the job done. This weekend, a new agent appears in the world of the silver screen and her name is Charlize Theron. This gorgeous actress has been teasing the trailers with some exciting, seductive, and sexy scenes of her movie Atomic Blonde, promising an adventure to be had. Robbie K back with another review, so let's get this mission started. LIKES:Theron's acting: Lead actresses carry a lot of the movie when they are the featured character. Fortunately, Theron nails the role of the spy on all the avenues promised by the trailer. Her physical looks, capable of making people go gaga, are only the superficial wrapping paper for the talent within, as she unleashes her cold ruthlessness with a little twist. She plays the wise and sly role well, bringing a dynamic character who has great chemistry with her fellow cast, crafting a deadly board to run their games on. Theron may be monotone in much of her roles, and often may play the same types of roles, but it works in this setting quite well. Funny: While certainly not the sole theme of this movie, Atomic Blonde is a figurative blast in the laughter department. One of my friends compared some scenes to Monty Python in their comedic ploys of minions constantly getting up. Seeing these stooges fall, dive, and become injured in a number of manners, but have ridiculous stamina is entertaining on many levels. In addition, Atomic Blonde has some well-timed, and well-aimed, lines to relieve some of the tension. Mix all this with the over-the-top shock factor of this movie and you won't help but laugh at the presentation at hand. Action: The trailers painted an exciting thrill ride of death defying battles and spy warfare destruction. And the trailers didn't lie at all. Atomic Blonde knocked hard on the action door as Theron faced the insurmountable odds of the secret army of spies out to hinder her mission and end her beautiful life. The film has a number of styles for you including hand to hand combat, gunplay (and lots of it), and a few car chase scenes to keep things interesting. Each of the drawn-out battles fits into the mission well, and the dynamic setting adds to the heat of the moment that is satisfying on so many levels. The Soundtrack: As Frozen proved years ago, a good soundtrack is something to take notice of. Atomic Blonde's featured tracks are all in the 80s, and the sweet beats are utilized to an excellent level that brings out the spirit of the scene. And if you don't care about a track matching to the movie, but like the synthesizer heavy music of the decade, then good news, you'll be dancing in your seat to the sweet beats of the movie. Whatever the reason, note that Atomic Bomb's soundtrack is certainly a blast to the past of energizing music. DISLIKES:Convoluted story: You may not have expected much of a story, after all most action heavy films seldom have one. Yet, the thin story was certainly a complicated mess given everything packed into the movie and the directions they took to present it. There is a mystery there, but it is overshadowed by the stunts and combat that ring throughout the movie. While the action is exciting, it distracts from the main plot and left little to follow given the shock factor of the series. The dry dialogue doesn't help much either, nor the fact that the movie jumps through so many perspectives in a short amount of time. The bottom line isthe presentation makes for a rather dry story, with only a few emotional oases to breathe life into the film. Violence: Action often does breed violence, but Atomic Blonde's battles are true spectacles of mutilation and torture. All the extras in particular are brutally battered in the fights, bashed in extraordinary detail to turn a few heads or make one of my friends cover her eyes. Theron's character gets hit pretty hard too, painting her a few shades of gore as well. The gunplay makes for a ballad of painting the walls red, and the emphasis of close up, head explosions can be a little overdone at times. However, the most disturbing components are seeing the up and close drawn out deaths of a few character and their agonizing last breath. Keep that in mind before jumping into the theater. The unneeded romance scene: I'm not one for the hot and sexy sequences in bed, but I can appreciate it when either done with class or pertinent to the story. A scene in the trailers, and of course the movie, showed a rather hot moment that just didn't feel necessary to me in the story. Certainly, editing could have left this out, or at least the director's cut, but without the added emphasis of relationships to the movie, I could have done without it. The Verdict:Atomic Blonde held much of what the trailers promised. It is an off the wall, very shocking film that leaves little to the imagination. It is a thrilling, adrenaline pumping ride that felt fresh given the unique presentation and a soundtrack to further add fun. Unfortunately, the stunts, violence, and convoluted presentation derailed the story for me and left me wondering what it is I just watched. There is plenty of theater worthy material to justify a visit, but if violence isn't your cup of tea, pass this mission on to someone else. My scores are: Action/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Atomic Blonde
83,justin-fencsak,"Great soundtrack, meh movie",6,3 February 2018,"Based on a cult graphic novel (what else is new), this movie has sex, guns, rock and roll, and a confusing plot to make this an overrated movie.

85,Kingslaay,What a disappointment,5,4 August 2017,"I had high hopes for this film. It looked like a unique and fresh action film with a bad ass spy, it boasted a good cast and had a great soundtrack. None of this worked to carry this film. The sad part is this plot is quite simple yet the film makes it too complicated and the result is a disjointed film. While nostalgia and showing a film set in the past has a charm of its own, it certainly didn't here. Bad enough we had no great plot or protagonist to buy into but the setting was depressing and out of place. Supposed be occurring in the backdrop of the end of the Cold War in Berlin in 1989 the actors and this list that they were all after seems completely out of place. The significance of this list is poorly explained and film does not harness its context or setting to enhance it. You could have picked any time period it would have not affected the plot. Charlize Theron's character lacked charm, wit and almost anything endearing for the audience to really care or bother with her character. The fight scenes were dreadful to watch and looked unrealistic, the injured henchman fighting Lorraine were waiting for her to turn around and resume fighting? It looked more like a practice session than the final cut. This film also looked like it could have benefited a lot from humor, it lacked it completely. Overall a disappointment for what could have been a unique and kick ass spy film. 5.5/10",Atomic Blonde
86,vengeance20,Mediocre At Best...!,5,13 August 2017,"Having not read, The Coldest City, I saw a trailer/advert for this film on TV & in cinemas! So as per, I added it to my watch list of films to go & see. I read a bit about this film & its rating to see if it was well received. No surprise, it was & to be honest, the film wasn't all that, which was disappointing. The film is like a type of John Wick sort of rip-off. The women in the film are hot & you see some pretty graphic lesbian sex in the film too, politically correct? Hmm. Probably, but hey it didn't bother me. Though I'd like to think not, considering the golden age was far more of a great time without the correctness movement. The action sequences were good as action films usually go, though John Wick will always be better! The story was slightly confusing, but it was alright. But after watching, I found the film wasn't all that, although I liked the graphic art with the spray paint for the credits & what not were good & unique visually, but the rest of the film or parts of it, just didn't cut it for me! The trailer made the film seem more better than it was, which sucked as the film could've been better.So overall, it wasn't great. Though it wasn't crap either. 5/10.",Atomic Blonde
87,bkrauser-81-311064,"A Bruising, Stylish Roller-coaster Ride",8,30 July 2017,"Based on the graphic novel ""The Coldest City"" by Antony Johnston, Atomic Blonde is a tough, bruising, causally smart, infinitely stylish thriller that often times feels like the perfect palette cleanser for an abysmally boring blockbuster season. The film may be set in winter and its hard R-rating may steal away the coveted teen crowd but believe you, me, this thing is a rollicking summer movie attraction. It's the kind of movie attraction that takes the best aspects of glamorized espionage thrillers and adds the pulpy distinctiveness of a Walter Hill movie. And you get Charlize Theron playing a stone-cold killer too?Man, why haven't you bought your ticket yet? The aforementioned Theron plays Lorraine Broughton, an MI6 operative sent on a recovery mission in Berlin circa 1989. Seems a list of every double agent on both sides of the iron curtain has fallen into the hands of a low-level Stazi agent and it's now up to Broughton to bring him to the west. Aiding/obstructing her in this mission are a nest of spies from all corners, including MI6 field head gone native David Percival (McAvoy), CIA envoy Emmett Kurzfeld (Goodman), sultry French secret agent Delphine Lasalle (Boutella) a boatload of expendable KGB operatives thrown in, because who else would be the obvious bad guys? Director David Leitch effortlessly builds on the film's narrative to construct strong visual kinetics and retro-cool gildings that hearkens back to a very explosive place, time and mindset. Whenever we're given a respite from the film's pulse-pounding action, we can drink in the psychology, the sociology and the history of a city torn apart for generations and for which the film cheekily insists is not what it's about. Just like John Wick (2014) (which Leitch co-directed), the mis en scene is a mish-mash of tones, tunes and fashions but here the excess of cool is actually informing something.In all reality a movie of this stripe; i.e. a retrograde spy movie with a name actress playing a sexpot terminator, doesn't need to do all this. Give me a few choice shootouts and a memorable villain saying ""das vedanya,"" and it'd be well worth its Salt (2010). But Atomic Blonde beats out the competition by being an absolute workhorse of cinematography, stunts and tactile special effects. Everything this cast and crew does is just that much harder to pull off and as a result, scenes like the 8-9 minute long-take are just that much better.Of course the movie also doesn't need to weave a web of deceit in the ballpark of a John le Carre novel, which is where the movie wonders into the tall weeds. Most of the story is told in flashback by Broughton to her handlers, post-operation. Halfway through the movie it becomes apparent that everyone's lying - she's lying, the handlers are lying, the characters in Broughton's story are lying and the question remains is about what and why. It at times feels perfunctory and needlessly confusing especially when you consider the film has a set time-clock in the form of November 9, 1989 – the date the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. What's the point in wrapping your head around names like ""Spyglass"" and ""Satchel"" when none of it will matter a month from the film's events? Okay, so maybe Atomic Blonde doesn't have the makings of a true classic. But what it does well it does incredibly, exceedingly, near-impossibly well and offers no less than some of the most punishingly intense, wildly entertaining, hand-to-hand combat sequences since The Raid (2011). If you've been yawning all summer like I have, do yourself a favor and take a bracing ice bath with the rough-and-tumble, hard-nosed, Stoli drinking spies of Berlin. I promise you won't regret it.",Atomic Blonde

Based on a graphic novel, it is a cartoon of spy fantasy with occasional light comedy elements. The director works hard to impress and entertain with a visceral, hyper-stylised romp, neon colour palette, and music playlist of 1980s Western European pop that teeters the border of overkill. Theron is well cast as the beautiful British spy, camping it up, though sometimes to hammy proportions, as does her co-star James McAvoy. Theron walking-away-from-carnage-in-dark glasses-and-pout looks good, if her Kensington accent sounds a little contrived. What raises this film up a notch is its good pacing. The brutal fighting sequences are well coordinated and implausible and yet make revulsive effect.

There's a scene at the beginning where Broughton is getting out of an ice bath. There's a chrome look to it which looks awesome. Much of the film is also viewed with neon lighting with gives a great effect and definitely sets it in a particular time period. When you add in the costumes, set design, and the two main actresses, Atomic Blonde is a beautiful film to look at. The soundtrack which stands out as a particularly strong aspect of the movie. There's a great choice of 80's tracks and they're used to most effect during the fight scenes. Speaking of fight scenes, they were very intense and fantasically choreographed, there's one scene in a stairwell, which unbelievably appeared to be one long shot, was just fantastic to watch. There were plenty of good performances. Theron was fantastic. As well as her brilliant fight scenes she also controlled the mood of the film with her very believably controlled and calculated persona. Her co-worker of sorts in Berlin was agent David Percival, played by James McAvoy. He was an agent who was to help Broughton on her mission to retrieve the list. McAvoy looked like he was having great fun, playing the character way over-the-top; and as a result he was fun to watch. Sofia Boutella was also great, although underutilized. It was quite an interested character she plays and it would be nice to have seen even more of her.

It's one twist after another with some truly impressive fight scenes. The movie is ultra stylish with a great soundtrack but that's really where the goods end. It's a lot of style with not alot of substance. There's definitely a story here but it's executed in such a confusing manner it feels a bit sloppy. But all in all its marginally entertaining and engaging if only for the style, solid performances from Charlize Theron (Monster), sexy James McAvoy (Split), hunky Bill Skarsgard (It) and screen siren Sofia Boutella (Climax) and some unforgettable fight choreography.Budget: $30M

94,Troy_Campbell,A breathtaking action masterpiece.,10,7 August 2017,"This ultra-violent action-fest is not going to be everybody's cup of tea. Its style over substance approach and ballsy visual design could turn off some viewers, for others it's exactly what will make this one of the most memorable films of 2017. Set largely in 1989 Berlin, the week leading up to the wall coming down to be exact, there's a simmering tension permeating throughout that creates a ticking time bomb atmosphere where anything is possible as long as it's backed by a cracking 80s tune. The spy vs spy plot (based on graphic novel series 'The Coldest City') catapults our eponymous kick-arse heroine (Charlize Theron) through a chain of brutal, bruising and bone-snapping melees as she seeks to uncover the identity of a double agent. Director David Leitch unsurprisingly comes from an action background—having plied his business in the stunts department for over 20 years—and his expertise is on full display in the plethora of set pieces unleashed in this movie. Every action sequence provides its own memorable moments; a frenetic car-set fight is an utter adrenaline rush, a hyper-real krav maga brawl complete with bungie jump is electrifyingly manic, and a John Woo-esque pistol face-off is viciously balletic. And then there is the jewel in the already impressive crown: a wildly savage and insanely long showdown presented as a single extended take, albeit in reality a collection of takes cleverly edited together to create the finest action sequence committed to film this year. The ambition it took to capture such a lengthy set piece, with an A-list star at the centre no less, is mind-boggling on its own. The fact Leitch was able to execute it with such ferocity and flair is testament to the ridiculous skill the debut director, and his leading lady, possess. This tour de force performance paired with her virtuoso turn in Mad Max: Fury Road has placed Theron daylights ahead of the pack in the female action star realm. Hell, just the action star realm in general. Many of her male counterparts wish they were as dynamic and charismatic as Theron. A breathtaking roller-coaster ride, Atomic Blonde is a pure cinematic masterpiece; it thrills, it delights, and it shows you one hell of a time.",Atomic Blonde
95,pyrocitor,The Cold War just got cooler,8,14 August 2017,"Following up Wonder Woman in the summer's one-two punch of Hollywood taking note that watching women hit people can be cool, Atomic Blonde effortlessly sidesteps crass attempts to derivatively reduce it to the sum of its male-centric genre buds (Jane Bond; Blonde Wick) with a robust, effortlessly slick sense of infectious cool. Going by the film's trailer, it'd be fair to expect more of a stylized, Suicide Squad grunge cartoon - a scrappy, bloody-knuckled summer blowout as cool to look at as it is utterly brainless. But surprisingly, apart from mischievously dabbling in some Kick-Ass calibre spray paint title cards, director David Leitch keeps things cool and collected with a deceptively old- fashioned, story-heavy spy thriller... that just also happens to have some of the most f*ck yeah fight sequences in the past several years of cinema. If anything, Atomic Blonde works so hard to avoid being brainless and disposable that it almost overcompensates in doing so. Leitch navigates a labyrinthine Cold War potboiler that's more John Le Care than John Wick, with crackling period piece atmosphere that recreates the crumbling muckiness of the Wall about to fall as a shambling nightclub rave full of terse but exhilarating danger. Granted, the script's MacGuffin of a stolen dossier of undercover agents may cause some already well-versed in 007 and Mission: Impossible to roll their eyes from over-familiarity. Otherwise, Leitch crisply plunges into neo-noir 'whodunnit' territory, whisking through the sociopolitical tensions and latent violence at a madcap pace, while utilizing framing flash-forward interview sequences (anchored by the delightfully bemused Toby Jones and John Goodman) as a chance for audiences to catch their breaths. If anything, the dizzying plot has almost one twist too many for following not to feel like having been roundhouse kicked by Charlize, or for plot holes not to pop up like land mines. Thankfully, Kurt Johnstad's steady script keeps things lean and playful, assuring that even audiences left scratching their heads at the surplus of side characters double and triple-crossing will stick around for the fun. And fun there unquestionably is - Atomic Blonde, hands down, boasts some of the best action combat sequences to grace screens in years. Former stunt coordinator Leitch's no- nonsense approach to style and fun is never plainer than in his beat-downs: fast, furious, they erupt unannounced out of the least likely of dialogue exchanges, blisteringly violent without feeling gratuitous, while slick, stylized and impeccably orchestrated without feeling cartoony. Most crucially, Leitch finds a perverse sense of humour in keeping his superhuman spies firmly grounded within the real world - when they're shot, they scream, bleed, and crumple, and when they fight off multiple opponents, they slump with exhaustion so much it's almost more entertaining seeing them grimace with righteous indignation in their fatigue than it is watching them continue the scrap. The showboating centrepiece alone, a nine minute(!) tracking shot scrimmage, will blow your mind as you lose track of how many back-flips Charlize Theron has done down multiple flights of stairs before shattering more glass tables and crushing more larynxes in an uninterrupted take, all while looking steadily more peeved that she's been subjected to such a bother. If there's been a dearth of women headlining quality action scenes, it's exceeded only by action heroes responding with appropriate disgruntled exhaustion at the spectacle feats they're expected to undertake effortlessly. Here, Leitch eagerly offers a reprieve from both, and punching has seldom been so fun as it is with amusing consequence behind it. Still coasting on her Mad Max: Fury Road high, Charlize Theron continues to redefine brawny, take-no-sh*t cool with an undercurrent of eye-rolling swagger. She keeps her icy Lorraine Broughton enigmatic, with only flirtatious hints of backstory or inner pain, but she's effortlessly striking, magnetic and wryly charismatic to the end. Similarly, James McAvoy, has, by now, unquestionably monopolized the niche of 'unhinged, mildly psychotic, but puppy dog emotional and oddly suave in a twitchy way,' and he's never exemplified it more than here, infusing his grubby undercover agent with an exuberantly nihilistic sense of devil-may-care, making him utterly unpredictable but infectiously entertaining to watch scuttle along. Supporting their clumsy 'buddy cops who just might shoot each other' chemistry, Sofia Boutella shines as a fellow spy thick in skullduggery despite a somewhat confusingly painted character arc, while the intrinsically lovable Eddie Marsan is characteristically fine company as a seedy but earnest defector. Atomic Blonde may verge on overstaying its welcome, with a plot as expansive and tremulously rocky as the anchoring Berlin Wall. Still, it's such a breezy, slickly executed spy caper, steered by show-stopping punch-outs, that it just might be the ideal cool sucker-punch to expectations to help counterbalance a summer of CGI-drenched franchise bloat. Brains and brawn - who woulda thunk it. You can practically hear the thunk of a Hollywood mogul's briefing notes hitting the board room table, excitedly exclaiming ""Action movie audiences like ladies AND story?!""

All in all a good action movie that did not live up to its potential.",Atomic Blonde
101,saptesh786,Action spy Charlize Theron !!!,7,29 April 2019,It is a good action spy thriller of Charlize Theron. The plot is interesting about a undercover spy who involved in various spy agencies and has a challenge to find out who is friend and who is enemy within a list of spy agents real identities. Nasty fight scenes are in throughout the movie. All done by charlies theron brilliantly as ever. Smoking scenes of her is perfectly filming gives us a decent look to her fearless style character. If you love spy movies then it is for you. You will enjoy from first scene until last definitely and finding many twits too and I bet you will not judge who is our side and who is not? Charlize Theron is perfect as combat expert spy as well as James McIvor as a suspicious co agent. Another attraction of Sofia Boutella ( Hotel Artemis fame assassin) she is fascinating. Also beware from lesbian love making scenes too. 7 ranking is okay as me.,Atomic Blonde
102,Karl Self,Atomic Cinema,7,24 August 2017,"The most amazing thing just happened to me. I was visiting a city and came by this amazing-looking cinema. So I decided to watch a flick there that evening. I settled on the late show, which turned out to be Atomic Blonde on its opening night. I didn't even realize the film played in Berlin at all. As it turned out, a major action scene actually took place (and had been shot) at the cinema I was watching it in, the Kino International on Karl Marx Allee in East Berlin. It was a totally weird feeling to watch Charlize Theron battle it out with two KGB henchmen between the seats which I sat on, watching ... you get the point.Actually, while I can testify that the outside shots are authentic, I can reveal that the inside of the foyer had been FXed (a socialist mural had been added to the wall), and the auditorium was not that of the Kino International.OK, enough of that. Atomic Blonde is a showcase for Charlize Theron who gets to waste lots of KGB henchmen in high heels (Theron, not the henchmen). Oh yes, and getting more French skirt than James Bond on a skirt-getting mission in France. It's really a pre-feminism Bond movie with a female lead. Never mind the plot, really. If you really believed that Percival was a trouper and that Lorraine (Theron) wouldn't come out trumps in the end ... well, I saw it coming.They caught the atmosphere of Berlin in the late 1980ies pretty truthfully for a fiction film.This is for you if you enjoy wachting arses getting well and truly kicked. With a bit of girl-on-girl action on the side.",Atomic Blonde
103,drjgardner,Atomic Bomb,4,28 July 2017,"If you want to spend half the movie looking at closeups of Charlise Theron's face, this is the film for you. Most of the rest of the film shows you her walking around London, walking about Berlin, walking around the airport, walking up the gang plank, etc. Every so often, but rarely, there is an action sequence that looks pretty staged. If this isn't enough to warn you away, the music is so loud it's a constant irritant.",Atomic Blonde
104,kz917-1,Flash Boom - but not a lot of Bam!,1,20 December 2017,I gave up an hour in. At some point I realized I was only enjoying the 80s music and didn't care about the plot or characters or whether there was a resolution or not. Skip it & listen to your favorite 80s tunes!,Atomic Blonde
105,one9eighty,"Oh, your hair is beautiful, oh, tonight - Atomic!",8,18 July 2018,"This cool, sexy and gritty spy action thriller is set during the concluding stages of the cold war in 1980's Berlin, where East and West are still separated by a wall, the police are brutal, the people live in fear, and poverty is rife. An MI6 spy has got hold of a list from a Soviet defector; the list contains names and information on a whole group of global spies from different countries networks, giving names as well as history. The list would prolong, if not ensure the Western world lost the cold war. Unfortunately the MI6 agent is assassinated. Although there is a theory on who has the list nobody is entirely certain, but it's a race against time to get the list as other countries spies all rush to be the first to claim the list for their country. We follow Lorraine Broughton (Theron), she's called in by MI6 to go to Berlin and retrieve the list. On arrival, she partners up with David Percival (McAvoy), who is an embedded spy in Berlin that knows the lay of the land. She soon discovers she's in a world where you can't trust anybody as she gets shot at, beaten up, drown, strangled and stabbed - but Lorraine is a tough nut, she's ready and willing to do whatever it takes, with or to whoever in order to do her job. I really enjoyed this film, it was stylish and sleek while also being dirty and nasty, it was high octane and packed with thrills and action too, but it also had trudging slower moments too. Based on Antony Johnston's graphic novel ""The Coldest City"", the film really delivers the look and feel of what I have come to expect from graphic novella. It had multiple layers with twists and turns enough to keep me entertained and intrigued. It was refreshing to see a female spy deliver a performance that was probably grittier and more kick-ass than your typical Bond/Bourne performance. The fight choreography is brutal and raw, which is nice to see, I'm bored of perfect fight scenes where wired and roped actors perform a kung-Fu dance rather than try to survive. Yes, it looked like it hurt and it looked like Theron's character suffers - I'd expect this, unlike Hollywood's usual jump out of a 3rd story window and walk away with no cuts or bruises. Set in the 80's the film not just stylized the look and feel of the world being portrayed, but the film style itself, the cinematography followed many a film from the 80's in its set-up. It was like this film was themed 80's throughout but had the intelligence of a modern film. The soundtrack was fun, and it was lovely to see the psychological juxtapositions of generally happy music set against nasty backgrounds or violence - I guess based on other reviews, some people don't understand this concept. Nor do the other reviews do credit to the characters in the film and the performances - this isn't just a vehicle to show how cool and sexy Theron is (and she is); McAvoy isn't just drifting through the film for a pay check - he plays broken quite well; Goodman isn't sleepwalking into a film credit, this isn't going to end Boutelle's career because she plays a naïve French spy really well; Jones is believable as a bumbling office jockey - come on people, open your eyes!! A lot of the reviews I have read about this film really do the film an injustice - avoid the reviews and make your own mind up. When it comes to rating films I'm tight with my stars, I would have awarded this a 7.5, but due to the terrible reviews I've seen I'm rounding up - Atomic Blonde can have an 8 out of 10 for me.",Atomic Blonde
106,sergelamarche,Brutally good,7,13 July 2018,This is your typical spy story but the girl is a serial killer of other spies. All the killing action was super good until the french girl gets it. She was much too easy to kill and the killings after that were not combative. I guessed who Satchel was. The dvd extras of Charlize training for fights were great.,Atomic Blonde
107,educallejero,"John Wick is mindless, the Mad Max is brain death. I don't even know what this is",1,13 August 2018,"There are three kind of scenes in this movie: 1) Action set piece2) A character ""looking cool, reflecting on something""3) A character ""looking cool"" throwing one liners at another character that either ""looks cool"" or ""shows how much power it has while looking cool""It's annoying to watch Charlize Theron being forced fed to us as a force of nature when it pretty much looks her legs would break under the heavy weight of a coat.
 
But... if you like 100000000000 millon double and triple crossing of ""cool characters"" (smoking, most of the time), then you might like this.Mindless action with nothing else is not for my brain though, so it might be that, I guess.",Atomic Blonde
108,phubbs,Atomic Blonde,5,26 June 2019,"Set in the late 80's around the fall of the Berlin Wall, 'Atomic Blonde' is yet another swish spy thriller that kinda rides on 'James Bond' coattails but also throws in some 'John Wick' and 'Jason Bourne' for good measure. This film is actually based on a graphic novel called 'The Coldest City' which is something I never knew. Sounds like all the ingredients for an absolute sizzler.The Twisty Plot: Under MI6 orders and with the help of the CIA, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is trying to get her hands on a list, a list of spies that if it gets out will naturally compromise said spies lives. David Percival (James McAvoy) is an MI6 Station Chief located in Berlin who is assigned to help Broughton. Delphine LaSalle (Sofia Boutella) is a French agent who falls for Broughton whilst trying to help her. And of course there are various other (Russian) characters who are trying to get their hands on said list to either sell or utilise. Oh and there is also an East German secret police (Stasi) agent who originally had the list and also memorised it, so Broughton has to save his ass too.I must also point out that this entire story is actually told in flashback as Broughton recalls her entire mission in a debriefing to both MI6 and CIA heads. Personally I thought this was a daft thing to do simply because it just gives the whole game away doesn't it. Broughton is all beat up so we know she's gonna get into some major fisticuffs. She's alive so we know she isn't gonna die at any point. She also seems to have no major visual injuries (other than cuts scrapes and bruises) so again this takes away from any possible tension. And lastly she's alone so that could indicate no one else survives. Basically this direction kinda takes away the stakes of the plot, cos you know she's OK at the end. These sequences also tend to bring the film to a halt,But the real problem with this film is the fact it's trying way too hard with all its various little branches. There are so many twists and turns which lead to you the viewer not really trusting anyone or anything you see. It sounds devilishly cool but it isn't, it's actually frustrating. Every character has their own basic reason for wanting the list, but you don't really get much beyond that. Yeah some wanna sell it, some wanna use it, Broughton is trying to presumably save the spies on it. But despite all the spy intrigue the characters are pretty shallow. Also, as I said you can't really trust anyone so again you can never be sure what their actual motivations are.The absolute epitome of this is the ending. Spoiler alert, this film has around three different endings and each one makes a complete U-turn on Broughton. It literally feels like the writers and director couldn't decide on which ending they liked best so they rewrote them in order to cram them all in! You think it's over...and it isn't. You think Broughton is on this side...and she isn't, or that side! I couldn't even be sure if she was actually on the side she finishes with, fully expected another twist.Yes all the reports are correct in that the action is superb, what there is of it. Yes the action is very John Wick-esque (director David Leitch directed 'John Wick') when it happens, but this is far more of a complicated spy thriller than 'Jane Wick'. Pretty much all of the action sequences are top notch in execution (except for the odd bit of greenscreen and CGI) and highly savage. Theron trained to do the scenes and it shows. One scene in particular, in a stairwell, seemed to be one long continuous shot of non-stop bone cracking, impossible to live through, carnage. Highly impressive, highly unrealistic if you think about it, but highly engaging. Had this come before the original Wick flick then it would be even more impressive.I don't wanna keep bringing up the 'John Wick' franchise but considering the links here it's kinda hard not to frankly. So yes overall this film does essentially LOOK like a John Wick film only with a lot more neon and 80's nostalgia. On one hand it looks great, on the other hand it again looks like they're trying too hard. Seriously why so much neon?? Its like Leitch tried to make the entire film look like that nightclub scene from 'The Terminator', or an early MTV music video. This also goes for the soundtrack which becomes wholly annoying. Almost every scene has an 80's tune in it for no real reason other than to remind you its the 80's. A lot of this simply felt like style over substance and overall it tries to be too clever for its own good.5.5/10",Atomic Blonde
109,rockman182,Atomic Blonde (2017),8,10 August 2017,"This was honestly one of my most anticipated films of the summer. As soon as I heard about it I immediately thought this looked like a female led version of John Wick. This sounded fantastic. To my surprised, David Leitch was actually an uncredited director of John Wick, which made sense as the films just seem so similar. More on that later. While the film isn't perfect and the plot progression isn't always ideal, I had a pretty great time watching this film and feel like it will continue to grow on me as time passes by/a re-watch occurs.The film is set against a backdrop of the latter stages of the Cold War. Lorraine Broughton (played by a very wonderful Charlize Theron) is a seasoned MI6 agent who is tasked with gaining names of every agent in the Soviet Union. The list is concealed in a wristwatch and is sought out by other parties. She aligns with David Percival (James McAvoy) and as the film goes along she uncovers corruption and kicks the asses of bad guys in very awesome ways. The plot isn't always strong, and isn't always original. Sure, parts of it seems like rehases from something you would see in James Bond or any other Cold War era film but there's many other elements of the film which makes for a pleasant viewing experience.The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Most of all of the songs are 80's songs or covers of famous 80's songs, bringing forth the authenticity of the era. You get blasted with so much 80's New Wave sonic goodness. The camera-work and cinematography is impressive to me. There's a long take (there may have been minimal cuts in between) which presents a giant fight between Lorraine and a bunch of assassins and its fantastic. All of the choreographed action is excellent, hand to hand combat is brilliant. The action never lets up.The picture quality of the film is slightly darker and bluer which really complements the era and the overall aesthetic of the picture. The film is littered with neon lights in clubs, hotel rooms. Love scenes in neon glory? Hell yes! Sofia Boutella (an actress who is really growing on me) in a lesbian relationship with Charlize Theron? Double hell yes. Its very wonderful because of its sensuality and the innocence in Boutella's character.Apparently Leitch was supposed to be a part of John Wick Chapter 2 but dropped out to film Atomic Blonde. This was a blessing because the style and action elements of this film are quite reminiscent of John Wick and also make Atomic Blonde what it is. Apparently, Theron sparred with Keanu Reeves as they were in competition with each other, probably to see who could out badass the other. It would be nice if they could exist in the same universe by the timeline of the films would be messed up.Is this film perfect? No. It could definitely be better. Its a joy to watch though. The more I think about it the more I really like it. Charlize Theron is a great actress no doubt, but now she is a full fledged action star. This film and Mad Max: Fury Road solidify that. I'm going to reach and give this film an 8 because I'm very high on the film right now. We will see what a re-watch does for this film.8/10",Atomic Blonde
110,gilgongo1980,Very weak action thriller,4,25 December 2019,"The story is very short and lame.

111,jon.h.ochiai,Charlize Theron is Awesome Kickass,10,30 July 2017,"While George Michael sings his haunting ""Father Figure"" MI-6 Agent Lorraine Broughton, played by Charlize Theron, mercilessly beats the crap out of five or six KGB assassins with a kitchen sink hose and whatever she can grasp with her hands. She concludes by snapping the wrists of two towering henchmen with clean Aikido kotegaeshi technique. I love George Michael. I love Charlize Theron more. Charlize is awesome in Director David Leitch's ""Atomic Blonde"". ""Atomic Blonde"" is awesome as well. Leitch, the co- director of ""John Wick"", has an impeccable eye for high impact martial arts on screen. The fighting in ""Atomic Blonde"" is amazing, realistic, and brutal. It is among the best in movies. I maybe sexist here. I think the fighting seems so brutal, because Theron is beaten and bloodied so viciously. But as Lorraine she powerfully dishes back her wrath in kind wreaking deadly punishment upon her enemies. Leitch had Theron train in mix martial arts and kick boxing for several months. She is so intense and holds her ground. Theron is fit, lean, and stands about 5' 10"". In the movie she is fighting men over 6 feet and weighing 100 pounds more than her. Leitch has Theron's Lorraine leverage immaculate technique, timing, and quickness in combat advantage. She is fighting bigger, stronger men, so she knows that she is going to have to take hits and keep fighting. Having trained in martial arts for 25 years and being small, I appreciate the fact that in fighting both sides suffer the consequences. In the climatic fighting sequence as Lorraine helps save Spyglass, played by Eddie Marson, who holds the key to the deadly security breech, she endures devastating punches and kicks relying upon all her skill and grit in the electrifying continuous screen shot. The experience is mind blowing. Theron as Lorraine is samurai: singular in focus and all heart. She fights with controlled rage, and an eloquent sense of loss. Her performance rocks ""Atomic Blonde"". ""Atomic Blonde"" is set in 1989 just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Kurt Johnstad wrote the screenplay based on the comic book by Antony Johnson and Sam Hart. Director Leitch captures the period with Lorraine's sleek couture and the music by the likes of George Michael, David Bowie, and Queen. The music is my era and great. ""Atomic Blonde"" is perhaps the coolest movie of the year. The movie opens as naked stunningly beautiful Theron as Lorraine emerges bruised and bloodied from the ice bath in her tub. Later she is interrogated by her MI-6 superior Eric, played with brilliant uselessness by Toby Jones, and CIA Head Emmett, played by strong reliable John Goodman. Apparently, they wish to know what happened to Lorraine's mission that went unhinged.Eric sent Lorraine to Berlin to retrieve the body of murdered Agent Gasciogne, played by Sam Hargrove. Gasciogne possessed the classified list of all MI-6 and CIA operatives that was stolen when he was murdered. The list is now up for highest bid. That list also revealed the identity of the Satchel, who is the traitorous double agent. Lorraine chooses not to disclose that Gasciogne was her lover. Her MI- 6 contact in Berlin to assist in her mission is David Percival, played with charismatic zeal by muscular James McAvoy. David knows about the list and he also knows mild mannered Spyglass, unassuming Marson, who memorized the list and the identity of Satchel. Upon her arrival in Berlin Lorraine literally disposes KGB assassins with her stilettos in a limo. Perhaps, she has been set up from the beginning? By Satchel? During her investigation into her lover's murder, Lorraine becomes involved in the sensual tryst with beguiling French operative Delphine, played by seductive Sofia Boutella. Is theirs the genuine romantic diversion or a clumsy plot device? Maybe both. However, in a nice character unconceal Delphine tells Lorraine that her eyes change ""when you tell the truth"". Melancholy Lorraine admits, "" and that could get me killed one day."" We empathize with Theron's Lorraine because of her touching sadness. Theron poignantly plays dispassionate and oh so cool, masking Lorraine's profound suffering. Her curse is that the people she loves die violently for no good reason. In a sense Theron's is the existential hero fighting to define and discover purpose. At times the narrative plot of ""Atomic Blonde"" betrays the hero's intentions in lacking some gravity or clarity. However, Theron's courage and display of human frailty move and haunt. ""Atomic Blonde"" works, because we all wish for Theron as Lorraine to find that measure of justice she so deserves. And our hero also deserves her own measure of peace like we all do.",Atomic Blonde
112,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another niche comic book adaptation with some unique aspects.,7,8 March 2019,"If there was one thing this movie excelled in, it was the advertising leading up to its release. I saw video ads on Facebook, trailers on television, and all sorts of viral marketing. Consequently, while the film looked neat, I didn't really know what it was about. Fast forward to months later when it arrived at the cheap theater in town and I decided to go see it. Within the first few minutes, I was somewhat surprised to learn that this movie was based on an obscure comic book series. Not that this really surprises me any longer.Sure, the superhero comics are bringing in big money at the box office, but the more ""adult"" comics (also sometimes known as ""graphic novels"") have been seeping in over the years as well, in part due to adaptations like V for Vendetta (2005) and Watchmen (2009). Even in this year alone, we've seen Valerian and Laureline adapted into Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017). With this fact in mind, I saw many scenes and shot compositions in Atomic Blonde (2017) that could have easily been pulled from the panels of a comic book. In this way, it was likely successful for capturing the same feel as the comic.With the rarely seen setting of Berlin at the end of the era of ""The Wall,"" Atomic Blonde brings espionage and brutal violence to its message about being unable to trust anyone in the spy industry (kind of a no-brainer). The addition of catchy 1980's music over the brief spurts of gratuitous violence made these sequences bearable. That being said, when it goes full-bore John Wick (2014) with a steady fight sequence that seems to take forever, there's no music to help the audience get through it. At times, the plot was a little hard to follow, but the twists at the end (while being semi-predictable) were well done.Another niche comic book adaptation with some unique aspects, I give Atomic Blonde 3.5 stars out of 5.",Atomic Blonde
113,carbuff,I'm all hot and bothered.,8,11 July 2019,"I think we've just found the next James Bond, or should I say Jacqueline Blonde. ""Atomic Blonde"" is a film that looks great, has a super twisty plot, and never slows down. Yes, if you're going to be really deep and difficult, it's a vacuous action flick, but then it's a blonde, so what are you expecting. It's utterly ravishing from beginning to end. The cinematography is spectacular with a color palette that'll leave you drooling. We're talking high-voltage, non-stop, sex and violence (well, mostly violence). Cool music too. I prefer films that offer some kind of insight into life, and this one pretended to be trying to do a little bit of that, but we all knew it was actually no more than a fig leaf covering the nuts which were about to be kicked in. I should note that while the essentially continuous violence is extreme, it's of the cartoonish kind that doesn't seriously engage your emotions. This is another excellent example of a woman carrying an action film at least as well as any guy ever did. I guess I'm only giving it 8 instead of 10 stars because while it looks absolutely stunning, it's also fundamentally totally empty-headed. But then it's a blonde.",Atomic Blonde

118,dave-mcclain,"Forgettable plot, unforgettable action.",7,28 July 2017,"The plot of the action-spy movie ""Atomic Blonde"" (R, 1:55) is set against the historical backdrop of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989, so here's a summary of the historical context: As World War II was ending, distrust between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. grew, along with an intense competition for political, economic and military influence in Europe (and elsewhere), which became known as the Cold War. Part of the post-war agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the other Allies provided for a ""temporary"" division and occupation of Germany as American, British, French and Soviet sectors. The same was done with the capital city of Berlin, which happened to sit in the middle of the Soviet zone.In 1949, the American, British and French areas united to form West Germany and their sectors in the capital became West Berlin. The U.S.S.R. remained in control of its areas and refused to allow the planned reunification with the other zones, thus creating East Germany and East Berlin. Over the years, distinct political, governmental, military, economic and social systems developed in the two parts of the divided Berlin. So many East Berliners preferred the western system that a massive exodus from East to West turned into a logistical and propaganda nightmare for the Soviet and East German governments.In 1961, the East Germans literally cemented the long-closed border between East and West Berlin by constructing a concrete barrier the length of the city, erected guard towers and put in place obstacles, all of which made it nearly impossible for vehicles or people to cross from East to West, except at certain tightly-controlled checkpoints. So, for the 28 years that the Berlin Wall stood, it symbolized the Cold War and the ""Iron Curtain"" that had descended across Europe between the western democracies and the Eastern Bloc countries controlled by the Soviet Union. That is, until 1989, when a series of liberation movements swept eastern Europe, toppling governments and leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall. That moment in history provides the setting for the fictional Cold War cinematic tale ""Atomic Blonde"". Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton, a skilled and lethal secret agent working for the U.K.'s MI6. Cut, bruised and battered, she sits in an interrogation room at MI6 headquarters being debriefed by her boss (Toby Jones) and his American CIA counterpart (John Goodman). Always calm and collected, while often also being dismissive, secretive and mysterious, Broughton tells the two men (and those standing behind the two-way glass) what happened on her recent mission to Berlin. MI6 sent her to a city about to undergo a political sea change to retrieve a stolen dossier with a list of double agents, a list especially valuable in light of the ongoing transformation of eastern Europe. As important and dangerous as this assignment was to begin with, it became more so (on both counts) but didn't quite go according to plan.Broughton was ordered to work with MI6's Berlin station chief, David Percival (James McAvoy). Percival is eccentric and just as mysterious as Broughton, leading her to believe that he might actually be working against her. After being (temporarily) captured by some bad guys, the first order of business seems to be finding a contact known as Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), who has gotten a hold of The List and is willing to exchange it for safe passage out of East Berlin for him and his family, and maybe a few other perks thrown in for good measure. Of course, just finding Spyglass turns out not to be enough to get this List, especially with all the guys trying to kill Broughton, and a French agent (Sofia Boutella) showing up all over the place including in bed with Broughton. Besides being loaded with intrigue and packed with intense fight scenes, this movie has a good bit of nudity and sex (such is the life of a spy) and a soundtrack full of well-chosen 1980s pop tunes (some original and some covers) that entertain and illuminate in this twisty Cold War espionage thriller.""Atomic Blonde"", like many action movies, isn't going to be remembered so much for its story or its acting as for its boundary- pushing action, but this one raises the bar to a whole new level. Adapting Anthony Johnston's graphic novel ""The Coldest City"", Kurt Johnstad (the ""300"" movies, ""Act of Valor"") gives us a fairly engaging but unremarkable spy tale in which Movie Fans are led to wonder who is working for whom, what is really happening and why, throughout the film and indeed right up to the last scene. But what makes this movie special is the innovative direction of former stuntman and (uncredited) co-director of ""John Wick"", David Leitch. His fight scenes are highly stylized and also more brutal, more realistic and more creatively photographed than in any other action movie I can think of.Theron's line delivery is too understated (Angelina Jolie played a similar character better in ""Salt""), but she completely throws her body into those action sequences (after having worked out with her ""The Devil's Advocate"" co-star Keanu Reeves, as he was training for ""John Wick 2""). The combination of Leitch and Theron gives us some of the most exciting fight sequences ever captured on film (especially in the already-legendary stair case scene). Theron's character would give Jason Bourne all he could handle. (And am I the only one who can't help but dream about the cinematic nirvana of Theron's Lorraine Broughton going up against Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow?) ""Atomic Blonde"" is an otherwise forgettable movie with unforgettable fight scenes and is worth a look for those moments alone. ""B+""",Atomic Blonde
119,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,A favorite,7,7 August 2021,"This is how female led action films should be made. Charlize Theron gives as much as she takes to her face. She is no Mary Sue.

120,swilliky,Decent spy thriller with great action,7,28 July 2017,"Charlize Theron takes on action once again as she plays Lorraine Broughton, a vodka drinking, chain-smoking, British spy that is sent to Berlin right before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Director David Leitch uses his experience with fight scenes and car chases to make this espionage thriller more exciting than a usual Cold War film. After James Gascoigne (Sam Hargrave) is murdered, Lorraine is brought in to find out how he was exposed. The film plays out with Lorraine being debriefed by Eric Gray (Toby Jones), her superior and Emmett Kurzfeld (John Goodman), a CIA agent. The story flashes back ten days to when Lorraine receives the mission from Gray and C (James Faulkner). She is exposed immediately upon arrival and has to fight her way out of danger to finally meet her contact David Percival (James McAvoy). Percival has grown wild as the station leader in Berlin crossing under the wall to deal illegal product in the East where he established contact with Spyglass (Eddie Marsan), the informant who gave a watch to Gascoigne that contained a list of secret agent identities. Percival promises to smuggle Spyglass and his family over or through the wall but wants the watch first. Hunting Spyglass is the German officer Aleksander Bremovych (Roland Møller). Lorraine investigates Gascoigne's murder by going to his house only to find that Percival has called the Berlin police on her. She proceeds to beat down the officers in a cool action piece featured prominently in the trailer where she ties a rope around a man's neck and flings herself down several stories to escape.

WOW BEST IV'E EVER SEEN, EVER! The soundtrack is definitely better than Baby Driver!!!!!

123,bob-the-movie-man,An Atomic Blast of a Movie,8,17 August 2017,"Ever wanted to know how many punches and kicks a Russian thug can take and still get up again?Ever wanted to find a place to store your keys so you won't ever lose them?Ever wanted a perfect chat-up line at a bar?Ever wanted to see Charlize Theron naked in an ice bath? (This is – ahem – a rhetorical question!). This film provides the answers! Atomic Blonde lives up to its name by being a blast of violent action from beginning to end. What rather let the air out of the James Bond franchise's sails in the late 80's was Glasnost, the fall of the Iron Curtain and with that all of the cold-war related plots. Atomic Blonde sensibly avoids all such problems by pitching the action into Berlin in late 1989, with uprising and wall-falling being an integral part of the plot.Ms Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road""; ""The Fate of the Furious"") plays Lorraine Broughton who sounds like she should be a librarian in Milton Keynes, but is actually a top super-spy for British Intelligence. A renegade Stasi officer, codename Spyglass (Eddie Marsan, ""Their Finest""), has got a hold of a comprehensive list of the West's operatives (like the 'NOC list' in ""Mission Impossible"") and wants to use it to get his family out of East Berlin. Anyone and everyone is after the list including the Russians (the sadistic Aleksander Bremovych, Roland Møller), the French (sultry Delphine Lasalle, Sofia Boutella (""Kingsman: The Secret Service"")), the British (MI6's po- faced Eric Gray, Toby Jones (""Hitchcock"")) and the CIA (a well-bearded Emmett Kurzfeld, John Goodman (""Patriot's Day"")). All will stop at nothing to get it. In addition, with such a valuable asset in play, individuals are also not necessarily batting for their country's best interests and cross and double-cross is rife. As James Faulkner (""Bridget Jones Baby"") playing the the British MI6 chief ""C"" (and ""we know what that stands for"") comments – – ""Trust nobody"".Central to the intrigue is ""our man in Berlin"" David Percival (James McAvoy, ""Split"", ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", having great fun) who has rather ""gone native"" in burying himself in the Berlin underworld to get things done by unorthodox means.In true Bond or Bourne style, a lot of the action is ludicrously unbelievable. If I stub my toe I am hopping around for five minutes: there is no way a body can take the sort of abuse metered out in this film! But it's all good dirty fun, and Charlize Theron is a force of nature in the movie, becoming (no doubt) a lesbian icon for the ages. Also excellent in his normal quiet sort of way is Eddie Marsan: an actor who nearly always plays supporting, rather than leading, roles, but always delivers with excellence. Here as ""Spyglass"" he continues to impress as a man caught in the middle. Sofia Boutella is also far better here than she was in the woeful ""The Mummy"", restoring some acting credibility. The nuclear reactor at the heart of the film is the screenplay by Kurt Johnstad (""300""), based on a graphic novel by Antony Johnston called ""The Coldest City"", which rockets along almost without pause and includes twists and turns almost to the final frame. As suggested above, the only fault with the complex script is that some of the action scenes stretch credibility to breaking point. This sometimes threatens to turn tension to inappropriate laughter at the absurdity of it all. What's clear though is that Theron must have trained for many months though to be able to execute some of the moves she does, in some of the most impressively choreographed fight scenes since the Bourne movies. It might all be movie play acting, but I would suggest all the same that this is not a lady anyone should consider trying to mug in a dark alley!The direction is by ex-stuntman David Leitch, and this is his feature film debut (although he did direct some second unit stuff on ""John Wick""). He must have been delighted to have such an impressive team of A-listers to work with. He does a good job too, with many of the shots and graphics having a panache that drags the film out of its potential B-movie status. At times though, some of the stylization rather smacks of 'trying to hard to be cool'.Another key contributor to the film is music coordinator Tyler Bates who pulls off the same trick as he did with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" by stuffing the film full of late '80s classic tracks. Bowie, Queen, Depeche Mode, George Michael, Nena – all make an appearance. It's also the second film this year to feature the Flock of Seagull's song ""I Ran"". For those who revel in high octane violent action of the ""Taken"" variety, with much bad language throughout, it all adds up to a great escapist night at the movies. The ladies I went with were trying to edge UP my rating below. so boys, it turns out that this is possibly a chick flick after all fill your knee-length boots!(For the graphical version, go to http://bob-the-movie-man.com ... or not... your choice, it's a free world!).",Atomic Blonde

The rest is lots of dollars burned to create a moving copy and hope it generates lots of profits. Make no mistake, it is that cynical.So Atomic Blonde watches like a comics without the pleasure of scanning and turning pages. The story rhythm is set by the director and the editor: moving pictures draw real characters, and it takes a fantastic director and a top-notch editor to add a layer of fantasy. Not just a nice DP and set decorator. So if you take a competent director who my be good at shooting commercials or music videos the comics adaptation looks like a comics adaptation and the good actors in it only look like cartoonist characters.The premise of Atomic Blonde was a good starting point for a dark stylish thriller. Lazily adapting the comics treatment was lame and instead of an edgy flick we get a continuous stream of visual and situation clichés.",Atomic Blonde
128,DarthVoorhees,Super stylized action cannot make up for a boring pretentious mood,4,21 February 2018,"'Atomic Blonde' is a very mixed experience. It isn't so much that it's best moments do anything new with the action genre but they do return to a grittier action film. I like these aspects of it the best. Action sequences have become so impersonal and boring that it seems as if the fights have no stakes. 'Atomic Blonde' kind of works in that it has action sequences that are extremely well choreographed and have a sense of weight to them. We believe that even though our spies are fighting with quick karate that they are human beings moving at a human speed. I also have to give it props just for being an R rated action film that earns it's R rating. It isn't as if the gore or violence is a childish attraction. It adds stakes.That's really all I can compliment the film on. The problem is the story and world are pretty boring after a while. It's a movie that for better or worse religiously sticks to it's aesthetic of 80's neon awkwardly juxtaposed with it's grim grey Cold War era Berlin. It sort of works but definitely overstays it's welcome.The problem with the film is the espionage aspect. It's convoluted to the extreme with traitors and secrets and twists that are odd and that you have to piece together to gain an appreciation of where the plot wants to take us. This never sought out to be a thinking person's spy film so I really think they overdid themselves here.The characters are all such a bore too. Charlize Theron looks cool and does breathtaking fight scenes and stunts but when she talks it is nothing but gratuitous foreboding. (Also, the tobacco people must have paid hard for product placement in this. I'm a stickler but in almost every scene a character has a cigarette hanging from their mouth. And Theron is shot in such a way like an old starlet with her cigarette. It's the little things that irritate us)",Atomic Blonde

Produced by and staring Charlize Theron, who portrays a British spy with an authentic 'Joanna Lumley' accent. Her mission is to fly to Berlin and bring back her dead colleague (who we see killed in the opening sequence), and recover a microfilm containing secret agent details hidden in a C.F.Bucherer watch. The plot narrative is a little clichéd but that didn't bother me.While in Berlin she works with another field based agent though she's never sure if he can be totally trusted. Our heroine is intensely physical, smart and beautiful, even after suffering a black eye and heavy bruising from fights with dozens of big, strong, armed enemies.

The movie stars Charlize Theron as a spy assigned to extract someone from East Berlin. Along the way other spies and contacts played by James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella have plots of their own.The movie has incredibly well done action scenes and well choreographed fights. Each action scene has a lot of effects and focus put into each scene. The stand out is the apartment fight and ensuing getaway. This scene was almost perfect in its direction and editing. The scene flowed incredibly well and the audience can see the desperate struggle she found herself in. This scene warrants a watch and was well worth $10.The rest of the movie did not feel as well done. I felt that the plot was overly convoluted with characters motives not being clear. Although I enjoyed James McAvoy's character, I could not understand him. The movie did a poor job on any of the quieter moments of the movie. It felt as if the movie was trying to be more intelligent that it really was. It tried to be more than a summer action movie and it really did not do well with its poorly depicted plot.Overall, I would not recommend Atomic Blonde.

134,Andres-Camara,How different is at each moment,7,30 December 2017,"¿A qué me refiero? Pues a que la película va cambiando desde el punto de vista de puesta en escena y dirección a medida que avanza la película. 
La película va a más, eso es innegable. Empieza como una película de acción sin más, pero a medida que avanza la acción cada vez es más espectacular, está mejor hecha, mejor rodada, con sus fallos, ese coche que desaparece en una calle recta pero, da igual, con unos planos secuencia así, se lo perdonas.El guion es muy enrevesado, si, es un thriller político de acción y son así. Pero tiene sentido y es lo importante. Es una pena que los momentos de interrogatorio, hacen que la película vaya más lenta. Pero le sirven para meter una voz en off que de otra manera no se entenderían. Eso sí tiene un fallo de guion enorme con la voz en off de James McAvoy, él no está contando la película y no tiene que oírse.Los actores están estupendos, para ser una película de este tipo es difícil y lo consiguen.
No sé por qué mete sexo en la película, no haría falta, bueno si, para llenar salas de cine. Pero no hace ninguna falta.La fotografía es espectacular. Es bonita, y te ayuda a meterte de lleno en la película. Parece que estés realmente en ese momento y lugar. 
Maquillaje, peluquería y arte cumplen su función estupendamente.La dirección si al principio es un poco simple. No pasa de hacer planos simples. Imagino que querían dejar el presupuesto para los planos secuencia. Estos son espectaculares. Podría haberlos aprovechado más todavía, pero tal y como son impresionantes. ¿Por qué son impresionantes? Por qué no son los típicos planos que tienes que esperar a que terminen para ver quien ha ganado. Incluso cuando no planos secuencia, los planos te dejan ver la lucha. Si bien, podrían estar más aprovechados y colocar la cámara mejor y que no vaya solo a veces.

135,Alexander_Blanchett,Atomic Charlize Theron as Jane Bond,9,26 August 2017,"Now this was good and refreshing. Not your standard kick-ass action flick. This had such a cool style, cast and atmosphere that it totally worked on every level. And that soundtrack. Oh that soundtrack. This must be the most perfect and fitting soundtrack in a long, long time. It added so much to the whole end of the 80s atmosphere and the film perfectly reflected the Berlin Lifestyle of that time. I loved that this was basically a ""James Bond-esque"" story mixed with so many different elements. Charlize Theron was a perfect Jane Bond so to say. Perfectly cast and she seemingly had a lot of fun playing that role. Sexy, cool and full of adrenaline. But she did not forget to show us the inner world of her character Lorraine. That combination truly is atomic. James McAvoy was also good and well cast. Like Theron he had a lot of fun playing that crazy and unpredictable character. Very similar to his turn in ""Filth"". Loved Toby Jones and especially John Goodman and very decent supporting turns. I was also positively surprised by Sofia Boutella who gave us more than just a sexy object of desire. Good job as well. Oh and Eddie Marsan really had some good moments. Great direction by David Leitch. There were several action sequences that were so well executed that you really felt like you are in the middle of the scene. Fantastic. It is a film that deserves to become a cult favourite and hopefully will be followed up with several sequels as I really want to see more of Lorraine Broughton's missions in the late 80s, early 90s.",Atomic Blonde

137,CANpatbuck3664,"Atomic Blonde's Narrative is Overstuffed but it Compensates With Cool Action, Solid Acting and Enough Style for Days",8,29 July 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a short historical montage, Atomic Blonde begins in 1989 East Berlin, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. An unnamed agent is running through the streets from an unnamed threat. He seems to get away until he's run over by a Mercedes. A Russian agent steps out and strips the watch off his hand. He shoots him to finish him off and dumps the body in a nearby river.Ten days later, British MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is getting out of a tub full of ice. She's beaten and bruised and is definitely trying to rehab from a stressful workload. She also seems psychologically distant. She cleans herself up though and makes her way to MI6 headquarters. She steps into an interrogation room with MI6 executive Eric Gray (Toby Jones) and CIA agent Emmet Kurtzfeld (John Goodman). They want a rundown of the 10 days since the assassination of James Gasciogne (the man from the beginning). Lorraine was sent in by MI6 to retrieve a microfilm list of all active allied agents in the field from the KGB agent who killed Gasciogne for it. Just because she's there talking to them doesn't mean the mission was successful. After she begins to talk, we realize that she's been through a lot both at the hands of the KGB and her fellow spies which includes David Percival (James McAvoy) the MI6 top man in East Berlin.One of the big reasons everyone was so excited to see this was because of who was behind the camera. Having David Leitch behind the camera (one half of the team that directed the original John Wick) guarantees some exciting action set pieces. Atomic Blonde delivers in that respect, it doesn't quite reach Leitch's previous efforts but Blonde packs far more than the required punch. Everything can be used as a weapon and they film the action in a way where there are only as many cuts as they need to have. Some hits have so much impact, you can't help but cringe watching them. What makes it even more impressive is how you can see that Theron is involved in a decent amount of the stunt work and it makes the movie better to see her in this more than most A-list actors/actresses.Atomic Blonde was advertised as a similar film to John Wick and that's not the whole truth. John Wick and John Wick 2 are straightforward action movies, Atomic Blonde is a spy thriller with John Wick style action thrown in. The biggest problem with Atomic Blonde lies in the story and plot progression. Where the Wick series was much more streamlined, I found Atomic Blonde really interesting and the characters were fun to follow but the narrative is crammed too full of twists and turns. It's almost impossible to keep up with the plot and when the movie was almost over, I was still having trouble discerning who was working for who and who had come out ahead. I don't know if it ended up being this way because of the source material or they just bit off more than they could chew. The central core of the story (retrieving a list of active agents) has been done many times before but that didn't bother me. There aren't many truly original spy plots out there and this movie isn't the first one to borrow that conceit.Getting back to the positives, the movie does feature some pretty stellar performances. Theron dives into this with all she's got and this shows how versatile of an actress she is. I don't think there's anything she can't do and this movie wouldn't have worked without her. James McAvoy hits the right notes as the enigmatic James Percival. I admire McAvoy's willingness to play strange and scummy roles, he chews the scenery but he almost always makes his movies better. It was nice to see Sofia Boutella getting a little more acting to do and I liked her a lot. Her big scene with Charlize is steamy but she brings a vulnerability to her character. John Goodman, Toby Jones and Eddie Marsan are all appropriately cast and do good work.I also really enjoyed the period piece details Atomic Blonde included and the unique visual style the movie had. They really capture the uncertainty and tension of the winding down of the Cold War. They also paint a pretty bleak picture of the conflict in Berlin which give the movie an interesting setting. The movie doesn't leave it there though and stuff like the colour scheme (the movie is bathed in neon blues and pinks) and the camera work is top-notch. The cinematography is excellent and I was continually impressed by how the movie was filmed from scene to scene.Atomic Blonde isn't John Wick but it shouldn't be cast aside because of that simplistic expectation. This movie has a complex plot, fun characters, an exceptional lead performance and visual panache to boot. It doesn't clear every hurdle but as long as you're willing to ride out being a little confused (all is revealed in the end), Atomic Blonde definitely has it's strengths. I'd actually rate this an 8.5/10 but because of the narrative short-comings, I'll roll it back to an 8/10. There's been rumblings of a sequel and I'd definitely be willing to drop another $10 for another adventure with Lorraine/Charlize.",Atomic Blonde
138,Jithindurden,Great action thriller that got under the shadow of John Wick,9,14 November 2017,An ultraviolent action-packed thriller that doesn't give a second to breathe. Charlize Theron is brilliant in both acting and action sequences. James McAvoy plays a character who is almost as crazy as his roles in Filth and Split with perfection.

It's hard to imagine anyone else who could do it. The music and lesbian themes were appreciated.The backdrop is late-1980s Berlin just before the Wall fell. That part felt less credible to me. They were apparently spies who could walk easily back and forth between East and West.This is an OK movie, especially if you like martial arts and shoot-em-up action.

When a bruised, battered and naked Charlize Theron then brings in scene two, downing vodka in the bath as Bowie kicks into life, the picture is painted pretty clear before the opening credits even roll with their spray-painted neon kitsch. STYLE. Sleek, composed style. A world of spy's, espionage, a truck load of tropes and exposition. With a cracking cast of genuine brilliance (Toby Jones, James McAvoy, Eddie Marsden), it should be amazing, it, is, not. It's like someone's watched Run Lola Run, Snatch, The Bourne Identity, The Matrix and tried to smash it all together. It's hyperreal with zero grit and therefore zero investment, interest or point. The cold characters feel like cartoons, it's like a 90s student film with a budget, a really really big budget. There's a heavy male gaze throughout, which I suppose should come as no surprise, it's called Atomic Blonde after all!

142,trinaboice,Hot and ice-cold Charlize Theron,8,31 July 2017,"Grade: BRating: R, 115 minutesIn a Nutshell: Payback goes atomic. Based on the 2012 graphic novel Atomic Blonde: The Coldest City , this stylish spy flick takes place in 1989 when the Berlin wall fell.Charlize Theron is gorgeous, stylish, and cold as ice. She is why you see this movie. Her character and John Wick would be the ultimate power couple in the spy world. In fact, one of the directors of John Wick also worked on this film.Uplifting theme: Umm....not sure. Don't trust anyone?Things I liked: Charlize Theron is stunning. With flawless skin and a body with practically no body fat, she looks amazing in this movie. Her clothes, boots and shoes are smoking hot. She did some solid stunt training to prepare for the movie and it shows. I couldn't take my eyes off of her. James McAvoy is also fantastic, as always. He was so fun to watch in the movie Split and may earn an Oscar nomination for his impressive work on his role in that film. Well, at least he should. Amazing stunts. The action scenes are intense and impressive. Sofia Boutella and Charlize Theron make-out. This movie is steamy, along with the brutal storm. Sofia also stars as the seductive mummy in this summer's The Mummy (2017). Good for Sofia for having two movies in theaters at the same time! I love a twists and turns. This movie has several.Things I didn't like: SPOILER: The storytelling could use some work. When you see Charlize being interrogated in the beginning, the film then loses some of its tension, because you already know she survives the whole ordeal. There are some subtitles you need to read quickly. Everyone smokes a LOT of cigarettes. Yuck. Everything looked real, except for one scene where the fire looked totally fake on a green screen. Sometimes you can't understand what people are saying because of their thick accents. The music choices are fun 80's hits, but don't always fit what's happening on the screen. The movie Baby Driver nailed that concept!Funny lines: ""Don't shoot! I've got your shoe."" – David Percival (James McAvoy) ""My G-d, I think I F-en love you."" – David ""That's too bad."" – Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) ""If I had known he was going to call the police, I would have worn a different outfit."" - Lorraine Interesting lines: ""I chose this life and some day it's going to get me killed, but not today."" – Lorraine ""Women are always getting in the way of progress, aren't they?"" – David ""The world is run on secrets."" – David ""It's a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver."" – Lorraine, DavidTips for parents: This is a true rated R movie that children should not see. Even the trailer is super violent. Charlize is naked in a bath tub full of ice and then she walks around naked in her bathroom. She looks great. If I looked like that, I might be tempted to walk around naked too. Cultural slurs and crude language, including a zillion F-bombs. Lots of violent, brutal fighting. Some bloody, gory deaths. Lots of destruction and car crashes. Topless girls in bed during a threesome. Talk of pornography. Smoking, drugs, alcohol, sex, dangerous and bad behavior.@trinaboiceMovie Review Mom",Atomic Blonde
143,kaefab,Atomic bore,6,5 August 2017,"This movie a part from the soundtrack of the eighties is really a mess.Not sure what they wanted it to be, smoking drinking and lesbian Charlize Theron that is what we get. Clubbing, she is looking for information on a stolen list and she has an English accent she is a British agent, and they say the firs female James Bond well you got that right she sleeps with women.The movie is a tad to long, it should have been cut to 1:30 like almost all movies at some point you seem to lose interest.The action scene are good but over the top exaggerated, Charlize gets hit a lot and bruises but even against all odds bigger stronger men she makes it on top.

The fighting was good and it looked good but at the same time it's always hard for me to get into a 100 pound girl throwing around guys. Shooting them? Sure. Kicking them? Sure. Punching? Sure. But at times she's throwing these 200 pound dudes over her head and that sort of takes me out of it. The story seemed decent but I kinda lost track a little bit in the middle. I watched it over 3 viewings so that's partially my fault but partially the films fault for not keeping me engaged. It was an acceptable movie though and I don't want to take away the acting, the acting was pretty good.",Atomic Blonde
145,PyroSikTh,More than just John Wick in the 80s,8,15 August 2017,"John Wick in the 80s with a female lead? That's pretty much the only pitch anyone needed to see this. And unlike John Wick's sequel, Atomic Blonde is every bit as engaging, both adrenally and emotionally, as the Keanu Reaves actioner that seems to have kick-started a new era for action movies.What surprised me about Atomic Blonde was how in-depth the plot actually was. For this, John Wick is not a valid comparison at all. It starts with the death of a loved one that kicks off the protagonist's story, but that's where the comparison ends. A more apt comparison would be to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Atomic Blonde revolves around a list of operatives, and reveals the identity of a leak in MI6, in a cold war era framed by the bringing down of the Berlin wall. The story is full of intrigue and mystery as to who the identity of the leak is, and the revelations come thick and fast at the film's close, twisting and turning expectations at every opportunity. I've heard complaints that it's a little hard to follow, but honestly I managed to keep up just fine. It just requires a little more focus than the typical action movie does.Atomic Blonde is super stylistic though. The late 80s seeps through every frame and every sound. Everything from cars, technology, and fashion is typical 80s without going overboard and turning it into a parody of the era. The general visual tone of the movie is bathed in a cold blue hue, emphasising the cold of a wintery Berlin, as well as the bleaker tone of a city divided at the end of the cold war. But every now and then we get shots lit in neon blues and pinks giving a pastel 80s vibe and injecting colour into an otherwise visually muted film.Theron's Lorraine capitalises on this stylishness as well, without compromise to her character. Her clothing is always very fashionable for the 80s, without drifting into stereotype, even when she's wearing nothing but her underwear (which happens a lot). Theron plays her with a hard-nosed nuance and gives her a steely gaze as impenetrable as the Berlin wall, while also managing to tap into her more vulnerable side from time to time.I wouldn't be much of a reviewer if I neglected to mention the ""Stairwell scene"", a ten minute composite longshot that starts in the streets of Berlin, scales up and down the stairwell of an apartment, and ends with a car chase, with every cut and edit flawless stitched together making it hard to pinpoint exactly where the cuts are. But this isn't what struck me about this scene at all, what struck me was the brutality of the fight. Gunshots, knife stabbings, wire stranglings, and good-old fisticuffs all feel real and relentless. There's a moment late in the fight between Lorraine and the head Russian muscle man where they've both been battered to such a pulp that neither of them can stand up, losing their balance and footing thanks to the number they've done on one another. No-one in this film can just tank a series of punches and kicks and come out of it without a scratch, not even Lorraine.Finally the soundtrack. Oh my the soundtrack is glorious. This year has been a strong year for movie soundtracks, and Atomic Blonde's is definitely up there as one of the best. It uses a large number of licensed 80s tracks, from everyone from New Order, to Nena, to David Bowie, to The Clash, to Siouxsie and the Banshees. There's also a fantastic remix of 99 Luftballons by Kaleida, and Tyler Bates' score blends in so effortlessly that sometimes it's hard to tell what's an 80s pop track and what's the score.Atomic Blonde is more than just John Wick in the 80s, a lot more. It oozes 80s style from every pore. Every frame is full of 80s nostalgia. Theron's Lorraine is as engaging a character as she is beautiful, the use of colour is smart, the fight choreography hits like a literal punch in the face, the plot is complex and full of twists and revelations, and the soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks of the year. While not a perfect movie by any means, it ticks all the right boxes and then some. I give it a solid 8/10.",Atomic Blonde

150,Offworld_Colony,What an ugly movie.,1,17 February 2020,"Concerned with only jumping on the John Wick bandwagon but bringing with it none of its own lore, creative action or charisma. It's another one of those terrible movies like that one Salma Hayek was in and before her Zoe Saldana etc etc. It's got some superb set design but inconsistent and not at all pleasurable photography, script, or action. The worst thing about it is it's completey boring. The soundtrack is cloying and in your face, the fight scenes sparse and with no unifying style or no character consistency. It's all smokey with a dodgy Suicide Squad graffiti graphic and impresses in virtually nothing. Mcavoy plays the same character he has been doing for the last five years. Charlize Theron is chewing on a dodgy British accent and stripping down constantly. I'm not sure these films have figured out how to show strength and vulnerability and charisma and ability and sexuality without it seeming cheap or gaudy. The film pretends to be knowing and winky but it's totally cliche, old school in a bad way, and it's 99% pop tunes and high heels. And possibly wigs. All as hollow and artificial as the film itself.",Atomic Blonde

It's got a good sense oh humour beneath al the violence but there's nothing terribly original about it or any of the characters. It hits the marks with the sex, the violence, the Illuminati symbolism and the many, many closeups of Charlize. She's 45 and looking good and desperate that we see it. We do but I can't say it starts far from the genre. People compare it to Red Sparrow but I'd say Salt though that film was far more relentless.

152,estreet-eva,"Closer to Daniel Craig ""Skyfall"" Bond than Archtypical Bond",7,9 January 2018,"Theron's polymath, polyamorous, maybe poly-nationalistic Lorainne winds up bruised and is probably an alcoholic. This makes her much less the spy-as-superhero of the early Bond franchise and much more the ""Skyfall"" vulnerable and brutish spy-as-again-government-asset. Unfolding as the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the plot also recalls ""Skyfall"" with its mixed motivations of the good guy and sympathy for the bad guy. The plot also blatantly recycles the plot of ""Goldeneye"" and dozens of other stories by having the spies competing for a computerized list (which was a big deal in 1989) of the world's double agents (an ""atomic bomb"" of info that gives the film it's name). Having said all that, the movie isn't about what it is about. Like the recent ""Baby Driver"", it's about atmosphere, action, tone, noir and sophistication. Like the practical effects in ""Baby Driver"", the practical fight sequences are breathtaking with stuntpeople being (seemingly) openly kicked down flights of stairs without an editor to rescue them. In short, a good movie to go into with one shaken and not stirred martini working against you so you let the proceedings wash over you more than think about them.",Atomic Blonde

I am very skeptical. And for those of you not alive in 1989, not all of the music was as bad as the songs featured herein! Oh, and FYI, if you want to be a spy, in any time period, platinum blond hair is not very subtle! Just sayin.",Atomic Blonde
154,CineMuseFilms,more heroine-inflicted casualties per minute than some war movies,5,14 August 2017,"It's strange logic to think that hyper-violent female stereotypes can make up for decades of weak or absent women in movies but that seems to be the current thing. Opinions on this will differ of course, as they will about the spy-thriller Atomic Blonde (2017). If you like frenetic pace, classic noir-espionage styling, and more heroine-inflicted casualties per minute than some war movies, this one is for you.Set in 1989 against the backdrop of the imminent collapse of the Berlin Wall, the convoluted hall- of-mirrors storyline is framed as a series of flashback episodes. Heroine and M16 top spy Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is being interrogated by several bullying male superiors about an apparently failed mission to recover a microfilm list of undercover spies in Berlin. After the ultra- cool Lorraine recounts each separate phase of her mission we return to the interrogation for more questions which also help the audience make sense of it all. Narrative confusion is nothing compared to life in Berlin where nobody is what they appear to be and every spy she encounters is a double or triple-agent. The once trusted M16 operative in possession of the list has turned feral and Lorraine must get it back to London through a wall of Stasi, KGB, and French agents, and still finds time for a heart-warming lesbian encounter to show the softer side of a super spy. Along every corridor there lurks a gunman and every stairwell presents another opportunity for Lorraine to throw an enemy agent tumbling down in spectacular fashion. But who does what to whom is and why is not as important as the car chases, explosions, shootouts, and a neat finale twist that even Hitchcock would have enjoyed.While the narrative is stock-standard espionage and not a single character is vaguely likable, the standout features of this film are the cinematography and choreography. A lot of the filming is on location in Budapest and Berlin, and the free-range camera-work is superb in capturing the frenzied atmosphere of Cold War espionage. The fight scenes are notable for more ignoble reasons: they are incessant, repetitive and possibly among the most inauthentic seen in recent times. Not only is it a stretch to see Lorraine take massive blow after blow without smudging her makeup, it can be tiresome to watch the heads of bad guys begin to turn a split second before the heroine executes another textbook martial arts strike. Many agents take a full barrel of bullets to despatch, but others keep popping up like the decapitated Monty Python knight who will not lay down. If attention wanes at any point, the ear-splitting soundtrack lifts the heartrate to required levels. As for the CGI and those bright red head explosions, don't even ask.For many, the phrase 'Hollywood genre films' is not complimentary and films like this show why. Maybe filmmakers need reminding that there is more to the portrayal of strong women than making them more violent than men. The gratuitous non-stop carnage at times brings this film closer to a gore mashup than a serious spy thriller. Some people will love the action but apart from great camera-work, this writer found little to commend.",Atomic Blonde

Ten days later, Emmett Kurzfeld, a CIA agent working with MI6. (John Goodman) and (Toby Jones) as Eric Gray, Broughton's MI6 superior Lorraine Broughton, a top-level spy for MI6 (Charlize Theron) the story is more of back story of what happened a week ago in mission to Berlin so basically it's them sitting in room and action is so good this movie is complete watchable of Chazile Theron character she has a lot charisma and a lot dark attitude she has on her character complete badass to see in this movie and yeah she has a lot great fight scenes like john wick and similar to James bond scene when she gets rope puts it around it on police officer head throws him out of balcony and picture of movie is so familiar like to only god forgives expect that was a bad movie this was a badass this had something it then only god forgives it's because in this movie has colors of it if you seen only god forgives you will see colors in some scenes of movie. David Leitch eventually left John Wick Chapter 2 reason is to make this movie witch OK something different maybe he will be sharping his pencil for john wick 3 ? also it is same trainers to helped Chazile to fight it's same trainers from john wick chapter 2 helped her in this movie As Theron's training for the movie overlapped with Keanu Reeves' training for John Wick Chapter 2, the two developed a competitive relationship, which included sparring together. jeez pretty good for that i highly recommended this movie it has great story, great action, The soundtrack uses a combination of 1980s songs the 80's feel and no Atomic Blonde is not going to meet john wick because the setting in movie is set in 80s john wick is like nowadays so she would be 60,70 years old but this movie highly recommended go and see it if you love john wick as in female spy version.",Atomic Blonde

Based on a series of novels and set around (but not about) the fall of the Berlin Wall, there's a brilliant soundtrack which is sometimes too ironically on-the-nose. The fight scenes are astonishingly staged; one sears the memory, staged almost as a ballroom dance; another appears to be a (very) long one-take tracking shot. Theron is a brilliant leading lady; with a likely sequel, this franchise has the capacity to give John Wick a run for his money.",Atomic Blonde
157,stevenrotherforth,The thing about a brilliant action movie is that you'll want to see it again and again.,7,5 December 2017,"Atomic Blonde There was a time when the term Action Star was commonly used. It referred to an individual who specialised in movies of the that particular genre. Hollywood was ripe with them in the 80's. The very same decade Atomic Blonde takes place in. These superstars were type cast in this kind of role. You wouldn't find Chuck Norris dabbling with a little Shakespeare or Arnie playing a chap called Harry who happens to meet a girl called Sally.Fast forward to 2017 and such a credible and talented individual as Charlize Theron has turned her hand to the Action genre. The same fantastic actress responsible for the Oscar winning performance in Monster. In today's world of Cinema this has become the norm. Matt Damon and Liam Neeson are prime examples of well seasoned performers bridging the gap from drama to action.If anything Atomic Blonde is an average action flick that is elevated by Miss Theron's involvement and extreme commitment. She is marvellous as MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton who is tasked with recovering a list that contains the names of double agents from an individual known as Spyglass and also to investigate the murder of a fellow agent in Berlin. The plot is similar to that of many other spy movies but due to the soundtrack and the important time in history in which this film takes place, Atomic Blonde has its own nostalgic flavour. There's splashes of neon colour to brighten the dull environment of 80's Berlin. The opening titles are particularly colourful.There's strong support too from the likes of Eddie Marsan as Spyglass, who has taken time out from playing Ray Donovan's brother to star in this action romp. James McAvoy is very good as Station chief David, a character that keeps the audience guessing just where his loyalties lay. There's also good support from Toby Jones and John Goodman who interrogate Theron's character. Despite there fine efforts this is where the film starts to fall down. The interrogation scenes destroy all suspense as we clearly see that our heroine obviously makes it out alive. Also the scenes with Jones and Goodman disrupt the movies pacing.Ultimately it is Charlize Theron that carries this movie. Her action scenes are superbly choreographed and it is visible that she is the one performing them and not a stunt double. The action is shot with wide angles allowing the audience to see all that is going on. After all director David Leitich is also the man responsible for helming John Wick and we all know how well that turned out. The highlight action scene is a stairwell fight reminiscent of the one in Daredevil. This then evolves into a one on one brawl with action veteran Daniel Bernhardt star of Bloodsport 2, and countless other action B movies. This guy knows his craft and Theron holds her own against him on screen. The only criticism I have regarding the action scenes is the accompanying soundtrack. It reminded me of Jaws. No wait let me explain. Whenever the shark in Jaws was about to attack we would first hear the famous score strike up. It is the same in this movie. Whenever Theron's character is about to kick ass we firstly get an 80's pop classic burst through the speakers as indication that something exciting and is about to happen. This though is not my biggest gripe with this potentially brilliant action movie. The biggest problem is that the movie doesn't know at what point to end. Just when you believe it's time for the curtain to come down there's more. This film doesn't flow. For all it's well constructed set pieces and masterful performances, the movie fails at being a fluid like piece of entertainment. I will admit I did enjoy Atomic Blonde but unlike all good movies of this genre, this fails to make me want to watch it again. That's why I regard Atomic blonde to be potentially brilliant. But in all honesty it turns out to be potential that is wasted.",Atomic Blonde
158,diac228,"A delightful cocktail of female Bond, crazy violence, and cool 80s vibes",8,8 August 2017,"If Bond had a spiked martini with ecstasy in an 80s European nightclub, the result would be Atomic Blonde.After years of having to catch up to Indonesia (The Raid/Raid 2—still the best action movies this entire decade), England (Kingsman) and Australia (Mad Max: Fury Road) on the action cinema landscape, it's nice to see Hollywood getting slightly closer to the mountaintop of quality action filmmaking. Between the surprise-surprise John Wick flicks and now the stylishly sinister Atomic Blonde, America now has a team learning from the mistakes of the blockbusters and the disappointments. Being an action movie fan, it's good to be in this era.Charlize Theron has become an underrated action goddess over the years with an intriguing display of action flicks ranging from the forgotten (Aeon Flux) to the underrated (Italian Job) to the spectacular (Once again, Mad Max). Although being considered a female Bond is a bit of a stretch, Atomic Blonde seizes the opportunity to take advantage of Theron's skillset of physical toughness combined with the ability to display emotion whether there is tons of dialogue or no dialogue at all. Similar to how it's impossible to separate Bruce Willis' performance from Die Hard, it's impossible to deny Theron any sort of credit to the film's overall enjoyment.Based off a graphic novel The Coldest City, Atomic Blonde is an espionage flick with an abundance of twists and turns, which under the right writing/directing combo could have made for intriguing look at the spy life during a lesser-explored timeline in global history. But the John Wick crew isn't fully interested in the story, and treats it mainly like a backdrop while delivering a fistful of action sequences that ranges from short and exciting, to the downright intense and breathtaking—including an insane tracking shot that delivers the best hallway fight since the epic hallway showdowns from The Raid. This is where the movie falters and shines, the see saw here is completely uneven, so if you are here for good storytelling move on. Otherwise, stay put, and watch some of the best action all year.Atomic Blonde also carries a cool 80s aesthetic that you never see in a Bond film, another reason why the comparison is inaccurate, even if it was meant to be a compliment. Between the Cold War setting, the killer Vice City-like soundtrack, the surprisingly-good costume design, and the muted tone, Atomic Blonde looks and feels like an expensive hipster film made in the basement of a Euro-techno nightclub. Theron might run the show, but the background work is stellar, and gives the film a different tone you generally don't see outside spoofs of 80s culture. And everyone is in on the Raegan-era glee, including James Mcavoy who gives yet another understated performance, this time as Lorraine's partner/mysterious renegade, in his remarkably hype-free career.Carrying the typical clichés of your normal actionaire, Atomic Blonde is a bit lacking in character development and storyline. So usually, you need to recover with ridiculous action, and enough popcorn entertainment to disguise the screenplay shortcomings. Thanks to the amazing Charlize Theron, David Leitch, and the John Wick stunt team, you won't leave this movie disappointed even if you might be confused at the twists and revelations.",Atomic Blonde
159,p-jonsson,Good solid cold war spy action,10,30 January 2018,"This is a good solid cold war spy story with plenty of action. I have to say that I liked this movie a lot.I expected a fairly shallow over the top action flick with a sexy but not very bright kick-ass chick as the main protagonist. To my surprise I got something quite a bit more than that. Sure the movie is quite ""Hollywoodish"", it is supposed to be a action movie after all, but it is surprisingly well done and Charlize Theron is great as the sexy, not at all stupid and very much kick-ass chick.As a bit of a twist the story is told in the form of a debriefing at the MI6 headquarter. This type of storytelling can be a bit miss or hit since, unless the writer is good at it, it has a tendency to spoil the movie and the events already when the movie starts. I would say that in this one they got it right.The movie is frequently quite dark and gritty which of course is fitting with the former East Germany setting. To my great delight they did not stoop to the usual dark, almost black and white, boring type of footage that you too frequently get. Instead the dark and gritty scenes are filmed in a ""darkish"" blue hue and the scenes actually have a lot of color in them.The story is a fairly standard spy-is-given-a-mission-behind-the-wall-and-it-all-goes-to-hell one. As a story goes it is really not much to write home about and it has the usual plot holes and illogical twists. What makes this movie good is how it is implemented.As I have already mentioned Charlize Theron is great in her role. She is sharp tongued, hot and kicks ass. Unlike many protagonists in movies like this one she not only administers pain but she receives it as well. Actually the movie starts with scenes of her showing off bruises all over her body (yes all of it).To fill out the picture we get some brutal, and I mean brutal, KGB agents, the traitorous colleague, the defector and a few other characters. Together they embark on a roller coaster ride of spy work, chases, (brutal) ass kicking etc. All of it very well done as far as I am concerned. It is not the silly fx loaded blow-everything-up kind of action but instead up-personal-beat-them-up action.I have to say that I quite liked the end of the movie as well. The twist at the end was maybe not the biggest surprise of the year but I definitely liked it. I really do not like movies that fizzles out with a bunch of loose ends and objectives not achieved. This movie is, to my great enjoyment, not one of those.To me this movie was really good. Certainly better than I expected.",Atomic Blonde
160,EthanBJones_03,Recommended,7,16 September 2017,"​'ATOMIC BLONDE' - 2017Directed by David LeitchStarring Charlize Theron, James McAvoy and Sofia BoutellaPlot Overview: ​Sensual and savage, Lorraine Broughton is the most elite spy in MI6, an agent who's willing to use all of her lethal skills to stay alive during an impossible mission. With the Berlin Wall about to fall, she travels into the heart of the city to retrieve a priceless dossier and take down a ruthless espionage ring. Once there, she teams up with an embedded station chief to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies.Atomic Blonde is two movies meshed into one. One of the films is an action film with great camera and stunt-work. The other film is a nonsensical spy thriller that makes no sense and isn't interesting in the slightest. It doesn't take a genius to figure out which side of the film is good. When Atomic Blonde is being a cool, stylish action movie, I was on board. It was immensely entertaining. But when this movie tries to plot, it fails. I like it as a whole but not as much as I hoped.I have a very basic grasp of the rough plot but what I don't understand is the what, where, when, why and how. With the 'Why' being the key word. None of the character's motivations in this movie make sense. They start of with a reasonably simplistic motivation but as the story develops, they all become muddled up and it's hard to understand what is going on. And then there is the ending. Screw. This. Film's. Ending. Screw It!. It is truly awful and tries so, so, so hard to be unpredictable and clever but it just fails. It tries to do a 180 flip and turn off a diving board only to land in the pool with no water.One thing that has been criticised about this film is the way they tell the story. They begin with Theron in a room, telling the story of what happened. And to be honest, I don't hate this method of storytelling. Does it neutralise the stakes? Yes. Is it a blatant rip off of 'The Usual Suspects'? Absolutely. But I do definitely think that this method of storytelling works in the film's favour. I think it suits the style of film.Something I am sure nobody was unsure off was Theron's performance. She was excellent in the movie. I admired her commitment to the stunts and action set pieces and will honestly say she was legitimately great in the film. I do have issues with her character. Her arc begins and ends with badass. This is fine for the likes of 'Kill Bill' but for a film like this, I think that more information was needed. Withholding crucial information doesn't work in a film like this. I had no reason to care for her and I didn't really connect to her in any way. Sure she was a badass but what's the point in that if I don't care about her as a character?James McAvoy is one of my favourite actors working today. I'm serious. He's awesome in most of the film's he's in and he continues to impress me to this day. His performance in this film was a highlight for the film but this character isn't a highlight for his career. McAvoy's character in this movie is so uninteresting and bland that even McAvoy couldn't save him. Once more, I did not care about the character; it's hard to feel invested, if you don't care.Sofia Boutella was great in the movie. Her performance was good but her character boils down to waste of time. She didn't need to be in the film. I just did not care for her character. John Goodman plays Emmet Kurzfeld who is in a similar boat. His performance was great but the character is uninteresting, bland and it still alludes me as to why he was even included in this film. He has a role to play but not one were it mattered.This is a VERY good looking movie. The cinematography, editing and lighting are all excellent and the film has a very cool aesthetic. It is technically impressive; I will give it that much.Another big strength of the film is that when it goes down, it GOES DOWN. The action in this film is exceptional.There is ONE sequence in this film that is probably 10 minutes long and features NO noticeable edits. That's impressive. That shows commitment to the set piece, incredible cinematography and admirable editing. That said, I think the action was in too short of an amount. Sure it's awesome to see unfold when it happens but there were perhaps two or three action scenes in the film. With an average length of probably 8 minutes. That's just about 24 minutes of a nearly 2 hour movie.Most of the jokes at least elicited a chuckle from me but they didn't do so well with the audience I was with. That suggests that the majority won't find the film funny and, while comedy cannot please everyone, I do think the goal is to pander to the majority or at least a wider scope than what this film did.Now for something I do take issue with. The Boutella/Theron sex scene. There was NO need for it other than to pander to the majority of males. It adds no character depth/development and the only thing it does is pander to a section of their audience. That's all. And that is really annoying. Don't call me homophobic, I'm not. But I would have much rather they left this scene out of the film. It didn't add anything.Overall, I did enjoy the film and I'll recommend it. I'll rate this film 7 'SHOES' out of 10!",Atomic Blonde
161,room102,Disappointing,4,1 August 2017,"Late 80's. Charlize Theron is a British spy sent to East Berlin just before the fall of the wall. I wouldn't have mention it, but the wall takes a dominant part during the entire movie and everyone who grew in the 80's would have a great nostalgia, mainly due to the wonderful 80's songs played throughout.The movie starts well, but unfortunately it's tedious. I expected a light action film, not an over-complicated story that tries to outsmart itself every ten minutes. Combine that with the fact that I was tired and you get me dozing several times in the middle.The action scenes are long, violent and brutal. They are realistic and the camera-work is original, replacing the now-formulatic hyper-cuts with long continuous shots, which is a good thing, although some of it is just too shaky and/or rapid for a cinematic viewing. One scene stands out as very impressive: It's one long shot that takes place outside and then inside a fast moving car while the camera travels inside the car. If it sounds familiar, then yes, it's definitely similar to the scene in CHILDREN OF MEN and it's just as impressive.The movie is just under 2 hours, but it felt a lot longer and more than once I thought the credits are about to roll.I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately I didn't.With James McAvoy, John Goodman and Toby Jones.",Atomic Blonde
162,Mike_Devine,'Blonde' can't decide if it's beautiful or brutal,5,22 April 2018,"David Leitch's 'Atomic Blonde' is billed as a white-knuckled Cold War spy chase thrill ride, but its grittiness is over-exaggerated. The Charlize Theron-starrer tries to tell the story of an MI6 agent who is dispatched to investigate the murder of a fellow agent set against a backdrop of East Berlin circa 1989. While it's supposed to be this shoot 'em up stylized action flick - and it kind of is - it never takes itself seriously and comes off more comical than anything.Theron's Agent Lorraine Broughton is a devious, savvy, unpredictable agent who has no trouble navigating the grimy streets of East Berlin, making frenemies with the likes of fellow agent David Percival (James McAvoy) and seductress Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella) while also evading and engaging numerous KGB agents. Sure, it's action-packed, but some of the scenes are just too over the top even for this kind of film. Stunt doubles must have made a fortune making this movie, and the damages from all of the glass tables that were destroyed must total half the overall budget.Despite the campiness and the carnage, 'Blonde' also has some redeeming qualities. One of these is the almost endless '80s soundtrack that stitches the scenes together, churning out hits one after another. In some scenes the songs actually become the main attraction, or at least take on a person of their own (the ""Father Figure"" scene comes to mind). But this only can take a film so far.'Atomic Blonde' is a messy, run-of-the-mill spyfest that seems to be a rehash of many films that have come before it, and even with a proven A-lister at the helm, it collapses under its own weight.",Atomic Blonde

As for the film, it was fun to watch but the quality was a little disappointing. Interesting scenes with the Berlin Wall, a few nice twists, hot lesbian love scenes, some intrigue, a few suspenseful moments, some unnecessary violence; this was all overshadowed, however, by the cliché characters and story (cold, calculating agents with no character depth and trusting no one, not even whoever have your that advice) and the fact the the pacing and structuring was all over the place, making it rather confusing.",Atomic Blonde

166,coreyjdenford,Blonde Fury,6,9 August 2017,"This review of Atomic Blonde is spoiler free*** (3/5)IF YOU GO into an action film with a tick list of good points to see then look no further than the hyper violent action thriller Atomic Blonde, from the opening there's a lot on offer here - there's city nightlife, guns, blind punches, high kicks, car chases and spectacular stunts to behold. And, no wonder it comes from David Leitch the un-credited co-director of 2014's John Wick. Adapted from the Oni Press graphic novel series The Coldest City the plot is essentially John Wick meets James Bond, and it delivers - mostly. Charlize Theron plays Lorraine Broughton an undercover, unhinged MI6 who is given a mission to Berlin here she meets with David Percival (McAvoy) a FBI agent who teams up with her in her mission. From the off she's a bad-ass mercenary who punctuates in calculated kills, she comes equipped with a fabulous extensive wardrobe looking fantastic as she delivers every killing blow. In the film's spectacular action set-pieces it's almost too hard to keep your eyes off her, as she fs, she blinds, punches, kicks and shoots with excellent calculation and accuracy, she is incredible. Though she's not exactly sympathetic toward her enemies - mainly due to her eyes being hidden behind a glorious showcase of sunglasses, it's a de-humanizing element which changes the premise slightly. Albeit, Atomic Blonde is flawed, there are a fair few plot devices used that sadly fall flat and is often seemingly difficult to follow. Especially with Broughton sitting in an interrogation room telling her story to a CIA operative (Goodman) and a MI6 superior (Jones) in a de-briefing type conversation, which gradually becomes unnecessarily, bland and overly empty.Happily, as you'd expect from Leitch who used to work in the stunts department, the stunts are impeccable - a one take wobbly shot going up stairs, through to an apartment, to a car chase is a particular standout. Throughout Theron is essentially the female John Wick (Jane Wick perhaps?) with her opponents being mostly men - it's that rare case of a woman top lining an action film which feels much more pertinent today, though with the looming shadow of Kill Bill it's not exactly revolutionary. In the basis of it, it's a more violent version of 007, if of course James Bond was indeed a woman which overall manages to help it flow. So, in short it's a flawed action thriller which is successful in the spectacular action set-pieces but ultimately fails in the many uneven plot devices it desperately tries to convey.VERDICT: A sexy, stylish, yet uneven thriller made better with Theron's strong performance and thrilling action set-pieces. But not much else is on show here.",Atomic Blonde
167,Intermissionman_,Sofia Boutella,7,8 December 2020,I have watched this Movie bout 3 times now. Very Sexy Film that kinda Grows on you. Charlize is awesome as always and thumbs up to her co stars !! I graduated from same college as John Goodman and I like to see his roles. Maybe a bit to Violent for me but James McAvoy is a great Heavy 😟 Soundtrack does its Job too.,Atomic Blonde
168,DeBBss,Could Have Been Something Special...,5,14 November 2017,"Although Atomic Blonde has amazing visuals and good fight scenes, it's missing something, a good story. Yes this movie is an action movie and it does it great, but the mystery and story is missing. This could have been a great movie if the story was on the same level as the visuals.Story: 4/10Agent Lorraine Broughton, an agent for MI6 is sent to investigate the murder of another MI6 agent in Berlin. She was also sent to get a list of agent spies. Simple story, not much about it. The problem I have is that so many movies had the same plot, but did it better. This plot is confusing to me because the writers didn't make it clear about it. I didn't know why these people wanted to kill her. Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention to the story, rather than the visuals. The pacing is very off, and I don't think this movie needs to be almost 2 hours long.Characters: 5/10Lorraine: I thought Lorraine was going to be a rather interesting character with a deep past, but we don't get that. Instead of giving Lorraine a past, we get to see her skills with fighting, and that's a good thing and a bad thing. David: I suppose David is a corrupt cop, I really don't know. We see that David was supposed to help Lorraine get the list. But if there was supposed to be a shock that David was corrupt, then they did a bad job.Delphine: Delphine is a mysterious character. She stalked Lorraine for a bit, then got in a relationship with her, then she helps her. I really don't understand why this character is even in the movie.Action: 10/10The action is by far the best part about this movie, it's so brutal and realistic, like the movie Logan in a way. There is an overuse of blood, every time Lorraine shoots a guy, a gallon of blood goes shooting out. The action is a mixture of Jason Bourne and John Wick. Overall the action makes the movie better with it's brutal realistic style.Atomic Blonde has great visuals and action scenes, but a weak story and characters. Atomic Blonde is like a mask if you think about it, what you see is what you get. Overall it could have been better.",Atomic Blonde

170,Tak005,Let Down by the End,5,28 June 2018,"It's not a bad attempt at a spy movie taking place in 80's Berlin. Suspense and action aplenty. However, it is let down by its ending. In typical Hollywood fashion whenever they produce a spy movie with the British involved. You can guarantee that the Brits will be stupid and or the traitors. This film is no exception. It's a tedious trademark of Hollywood in this genre.",Atomic Blonde
171,thebricks,Soundtrack was literally from one of the Best of the 80's CD's,1,30 July 2017,"Seriously, that's how bad this movie was. Make a bet with some friends as to which corny 80's songs will be heard in the movie. You have a good chance of getting quite a few. If you're a big fan of corny 80's songs on the radio or 80's night at the bar, you'll love this film. Worse yet, they don't even match the soundtrack appropriately to what is happening in the movie.Charlize Theron is a good actress, but man, she whiffed in this. Her character is an insufferably boring, pompous Brit who has no personality. Sofia Boutella, this could be a career ender for her. John Goodman is just phoning it in. James McAvoy does his best to save the whole thing, but the entire project is a big fat mess.The twist at the end is bad, so confusing, so out of left field, that it's not worth even worrying about.

173,Rendanlovell,Charlize Theron showcase.,6,19 August 2017,"Ever heard of 'John Wick'? Yeah, well this is 'John Wick' except John Wick is a girl and it's set in Russia. The interesting thing is that this isn't exactly a bad thing. I actually want to see more movies like 'John Wick'. I want to see the quick cutting and shaky cam action go away. And this film along with the 'Wick' movies will hopefully push more action in that direction. When I was watching this movie all I could think during the action scenes was how great they looked and how nice it was to be able to see what was happening. Then I switched over to the 'Taken' films and was immediately met with the worst headache of my life simply because the film was so nauseating to watch when compared to 'Atomic Blonde'.The action is easily the highlight of the film. Every single sequence was thrilling and brutal. But what makes this stand out in the action genre is that this isn't just a shoot 'em up type of flick. In multiple scenes, the environment is used to Theron's advantage. Pots, pans, fridges, hoses, ovens, the list goes on and on. Doing this makes the action feel more visceral and real because it looks as if she's improvising.Speaking of our main character, Charlize Theron is awesome in this film. She is so cool and collected while kicking the crap out of anyone and everyone. If this marks a new wave of action films for her I would not be disappointed. I mean the things she pulls off in this movie would be exhausting for a stuntman but she does it without breaking a sweat. Aside from her we also have James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella in leading roles and they do a good enough job.Neither really standout because they honestly don't do much, especially when compared to Theron. This is a shortcoming with the other leads in this movie is what signaled to me pretty early what I was getting into. While the film is certainly well shot and well choreographed, it feels like a rookie effort as far as storytelling goes. Specifically in its nonlinear approach.The film is told as Theron relays a series of events to her spy superiors who want to know what happened in Berlin. As she tells the story we get a series of flashbacks detailing the events of her operation. This style of story works very well with certain films like 'Usual Suspects' where we get a series of secrets revealed through the nonlinear nature. Here all it does it continually tell me that Theron makes it out of every single encounter she has. The second she starts knocking people around there's a little voice in the back of my head telling me she'll be fine.It's sad to say but the way the film is structured completely and totally cripples it. If you know ahead of time that the main character is going to make it out of a brutal fight it's hard to get invested in it. Sure it's well done and fun to watch but the tension is completely gone. There's never a point in the film where I cared about what was happening. Not only because of the storytelling but because of the story itself. The story is probably more simplistic than most action movies but it's also one of the more convoluted. There is so much going on and so much to keep track of that I often found myself lost, wondering why or what was happening. There are so many side characters and side stories to keep in line that It's nearly impossible not to get them crossed in the wrong way. You'll be thinking one thing is happening then a voice over will tell you that something else entirely is. It's difficult to put my finger on how much I liked this movie. It's often overly convoluted and trying too hard with spray paint like text popping up on the screen every now and again. This feels like an unfinished film. It feels like a grim R rated movie that was changed at the last second to be lighthearted. But the R rated script is still there, so it too often clashes with itself with an overuse of pop songs and an under use of interesting visuals. However, the traditional shooting style, action, and Theron's performance are just enough to keep this film afloat.",Atomic Blonde

Smh.Her character stays cool all the time and she acts well, but it's just the latest ""tough heroin"" flick with no reason or substance (see ""Red Sparrow"").So, it all unravels as a boring and confused sequence of encounters, one spy after another, with hazy motives that you can't guess because the writer is not good enough and he has to keep every avenue wide open; a plot (?) to which you should pay a lot of attention nontheless, but the movie just doesn't earn that. This is the mortal sin of spy stories! Keep it simple and do it well, work on characters and atmosphere, and you'll get Ipcress instead of Red Sparrow.Then there's a laughable and unnecessary twist, because you know, spy stories must include triple and quadruple agents!Oh, and make no mistake, there's a brief lesbian love story with no real relevance to the plot, because you know, it sells.",Atomic Blonde
176,Mcduff3601,Dissapointing,5,5 February 2018,"This movie had so much potential. It had a great cast (that James McAvoy so hot right now...). Great visuals. Amazing soundtrack.But it feels like it fell flat of it's target. The 80's backdrop for some reason just... distracted me. I think part of it was it didn't ""feel"" 80's. The only reason it seemed to take place in the 80's because people would say it was. Like TV announcers saying things like ""Oh man isn't it awesome to be alive in the 1980's and to watch the Berlin wall come down?"". After all was said and done with some small tweaks this whole thing could have taken place in modern day with not much affect to the overall movie (you could still have an 80's soundtrack without it being in the 80's)I love Charlize Theron... just not in this role. Her accent bugged me a little bit. I guess she had to be British to make the twist at the end seem bigger than what it was (it wasn't very big, at least not for me not that I saw it coming I just didn't care). There was nothing really special about the fight scenes or maybe not enough of them, can't really put my finger on why the action felt lacking in this movie.Most of the movie takes place in an interrogation room with flashbacks to fill in the story. I did not like this at all, I felt those were boring parts and cut the momentum of what little story there was all to pieces.For an action movie the action wasn't enough to carry it.
For a drama it wasn't interesting enough.",Atomic Blonde
177,ayoreinf,Charlize Theron gets her own super action flick,8,3 August 2017,"Charlize Theron has already proved she can be an action heroine, but after Angelina Jolie got to star in Salt and Scarlet Johnson made Lucy she had to get an entire movie revolving around her skills as an action heroine. And in fact it did borrow heavily from Salt and it's ambiguity between good and bad/ In fact I would even say that it borrows a bit from The Long Kiss Goodnight with it's indestructible super-spy. Both characters get their ass kicked all across the screen, and still get up and continue fighting.As a story, the only rule you follow is trust none, and you soon learn that each and every character cheats everybody else. Even the director does his bits of cheating, revealing parts of the story when it suits him best, and not when they really happened if we were to follow the narrative in a straight forward manner. So the main plot twist of the movie is clear about twenty minutes before we see it on screen plain and simple, maybe even more than twenty, I wasn't looking at my watch at the exact minute. And that's the main plus of the movie, it might not be surprising but it's still suspenseful. The superb cast has a lot to do with it, namely it's Charlize Theron and James McAvoy carrying this load on their very capable shoulders, but the supporting cast is doing a very fine job when they get the opportunity to do it.Altogether, it's a very professional film with two superb actors, both worth seeing. Just don't expect too much originality or any real surprise, it's not part of the bargain in this movie.",Atomic Blonde
178,themadmovieman,"Takes a while, but ultimately a huge amount of fun",7,20 August 2017,"Although it doesn't quite manage it straight away, Atomic Blonde is (eventually) an absolute barrel of fun. Despite struggling early on with a slightly try-hard and overly serious atmosphere, the film ultimately bursts into life with massively entertaining action, great twists, incredible cinematography and a whole host of fantastic performances, ultimately making for the action-thriller extravaganza that the film should have been all along.But we've got to go things chronologically, so we'll unfortunately have to start on the downside. As brilliant a setting as Berlin weeks before the wall came down is, the film goes a little overboard in trying to make the sumptuous 80s experience.Yes, the visuals are excellent, and that pulsating disco vibe really shines through in the same way David Leitch managed with the brilliant John Wick. However, when it comes to placing you firmly in the time period, Leitch unfortunately goes a little too far, ultimately proving frustrating and a little blatant when showing off late 80s tropes wherever possible.The biggest offence is definitely the soundtrack. Although the music chosen for the movie is amazing, it's not weaved that well into the story, and when we get no more than 15 seconds or so of some hit of the decade or other before a large crash brings it to an abrupt end (on several occasions), things comes off as far more manufactured than an organic use of the music of the era to reinforce the time period.What's more is that the movie doesn't really know how to have fun in its first half. Again, the visuals are slick and cool enough to bring some life to the story, but the film as a whole takes itself far too seriously early on, with too much emphasis on Charlize Theron's calculated and cool persona to make her genuinely convincing or even that likable, as well as getting a little too bogged down in the nitty-gritty of an espionage thriller.Fortunately, things turn completely around about halfway through the movie, with a spectacular action sequence that involves one of the most entertaining punchups you'll ever see. With newly raised stakes, no pushy 80s backing music, and brutally violent fighting all shot in one beautifully long take (plus the film's first bit of humour), the entire movie bursts into life and sets up for an amazing run to the finish line.From then on, everything becomes so much more fun, as we see Theron's character occasionally on the back foot as she comes up against all manner of villains, whilst the story goes overboard into cramming as many brilliant Cold War spy movie tropes in as possible, with double double double agents all trying to do the double on some other double agent.There's also a load more action in the film's final act, and with the fantastically energetic performances from Theron, James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella, you can't help but have huge fun with the brilliantly exciting and humourful finale to the film.And although I feel as if the movie's first half lets it all down a little bit, I have to say that what does work is the film's narrative structure. Not only does it play out following our main hero on her mission in Berlin, but we get a post-mortem discussion from her with some rather angry-looking MI6 and CIA agents, meaning that you've always go that intrigue as to what happened or went wrong to cause this meeting from the start.Overall, I did enjoy Atomic Blonde. Yes, its opening half isn't exceptional, but there's still a well-written screenplay and excellent visuals to enjoy throughout. However, once it all bursts into life halfway through, you'll be hard pressed not to have brilliant fun with and endlessly action-packed and almost tongue-in-cheek espionage thriller as we dash to the finish.",Atomic Blonde
179,kaptenvideo-89875,"An ""John Wick"" style action movie that looks great and is great at serving ass-kicking too",7,14 August 2017,"Film industry really loves spy action these days. They have produced tens and tens of them since 2002's Jason Bourne"" kickstarted the current wave. These kind of movies appear in seemingly every possible genre from superserious John le Carré adaptations to mainstream comedies a la Spy"" starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Statham. Atomic Blonde"" is one of those ass-kicking ones, direct descendants to Jason Bourne series, where there's a lot of Eastern European locales, moody lightning, serious important people discussing serious stuff which will remain largely mysterious to the viewer, bone- crushing fighting which still never knocks the main character out for good, shooting, hurting countless evil henchmen and so on. You know the drill. The selling argument here is that there's never too much female heroes in movies, especially action movies, so you get one in the form of Charlize Theron who has proved her fittingness for the genre many times already. For a famous and beautiful actress, her screen career has been surprisingly varied, and she doesn't disappoint in ass- kicking department also. IMDb says she had eight personal trainers to make her ready for the role, and she managed to crack two teeth while filming. So, Atomic Blonde"". It is yet another comic book – OK, graphic novel – that needed to be adapted to the big screen. If you can bear with the pretty generic story full of usual spy action clichés from everybody being hardass and drinking and smoking too much to series of twists in the end that are the substitute to real character and story-building, you won't go away disappointed. For one, the movie looks amazing. It takes place in 1989 in East- Berlin just before the wall separating two parts of the city was taken down, and people behind the camera have used this exciting place to the maximum effect. It has enough of tasty 1980's and Soviet nostalgia but also enough sense of place to woo us to just enjoy how everything looks. Cinematography is so artistic and striking here that it deserves an Oscar nomination: all the shadows, lighting, and dark and ominous atmosphere Spy action fans have seen lots of exciting hand-to-hand fighting since Bourne"" raised it to new level in movies, but Atomic Blonde"" excels here also. Especially the long brutal seamless battle near the finale where the heroine tries to keep both herself and the colleague alive, is so inventive, exceptional, and downright brutal that justifies seeing the movie alone. (It was actually made seamless with the help of CGI, but who cares.) David Leitch has done a lot of work as stuntman, stunt coordinator and second unit director – used to make action look good in movies -, so it does not come as a surprise that his first solo directing gig would turn out to be so adrenaline-pumping. He was the uncredited co- director of John Wick"", too. The surprising part is that the budget was only 30 million US dollars, which seems way to little for action movie this awesome. Next up, he's directing Deadpool 2"". The cool cast of actors is doing their best to enliven the story and dialogue, including John Goodman, James MacAvoy, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan and Sofia Boutella. But it's not really an actors' movie – their first and main order is to keep it cool. Which they can and will. Atomic Blonde"" looks great and is only let down by ho-hum story which is just an amalgam of genre clichés. For 115 minutes, it overstays its welcome a bit, at least for anybody who's not madly into the particular genre. But it's every bit watchworthy for bloody action lovers.",Atomic Blonde
180,Miles-10,This is Entertaining Though Not Everyone's Cup of Tea,8,2 December 2018,"Stylish, eye-popping, bouncy. The story, acting, music are energetic and fun. The plot is not realistic even though it references some of the realities of a time and place: Berlin, Germany, 1989. (I like the disclaimer at the beginning that gives the historical background and then says, This is not that story.)What this is, of course, is an adaptation of a graphic novel, ""The Coldest City"". The title ""Atomic Blonde"" is rather campy, though it suggests the nuclear threat that was on everyone's mind at the time.Reality, also of course, need not apply here. I agree with those who say that this is the answer to the call for a female James Bond. This probably better than the Broccoli people would do it. It is amusing that people - including me - pair this movie with ""Red Sparrow"" because the latter movie is actually more realistic than this one in its use of a female spy who uses sex first and violence sparingly because she knows she can't sustain a physical fight with ten men (or even one powerful man) without a gun or at least sharp objects.Charleze Theron is a kick-butt fantasy. She can do anything physical that she has to. Not only fending off multiple male attackers but jumping off of balconies with makeshift ropes and pulleys and counterweights made out of bad guys.I liked the twists in the plot and the surprise ending. It is part of the fun.Loraine Broughton navigates a world where she quickly realizes that everybody is out to betray everybody else, and somebody has decided to have everybody gang up on her. Does she whine about it? Only a little. Mostly she just deals with it by shooting or kicking somebody in the head.The spycraft is a bit contrived not to say outright laughable. Somebody does not understand that the purpose of a code name is to obscure the person or thing the spies are talking about. So ""Spyglass"" is a very bad code name for a spy or asset. And ""the list"" is a very bad code name for a maguffin that is, in fact, a list. (I recently read a spy novel by a real life spy in which an operative's code name is ""Tulip"". See the difference?)My pet peeves with some critics are that 1) The present generation did not invent feminism. That is not necessarily a thing that is anachronistic about this movie. In the 1980s, women were already making headway into previously male-dominated professions. 2) This movie was not an ad for tobacco but a reflection of how much a lot of people still smoked in the '80s.",Atomic Blonde
181,jb_campo,Charlize Theron kicks butt and takes names,7,7 December 2018,"Atomic Blonde is the story of a British secret agent (Theron) who gets sent to East Germany around the time of the Berlin Wall removal. Her task - find the list of British agents that is apparently for sale and will endanger all of Britain's undercover agents.The storyline is a bit hard to follow, purposely, which is the biggest negative. You are unsure who is a good guy or bad guy or something in between, or both, or neither. The mystery is supposed to build intrigue but it also builds confusion too.It is clear that the Russians are the bad guys. James McAvoy delivers a great portrayal of the British agent on site who has the most info of anyone about the truth. But can he be trusted? Americans are involved, as well as the French. John Goodman also delivers as the CIA head, with Sofia Boutella (Star Trek Beyond) playing a sexy junior French agent.The acting is outstanding. McAvoy seems crazy. Goodman is secretive. Theron is inspecting and questioning everything as she tries to discover the truth.There is terrific use of colors and David Bowie music. The highlights are the fighting scenes that show just how tough Theron really is. Watch the Extra Features to learn all the training she put in to get in shape to kick butt. There is one long fight scene that spills into the stairway that will blow your mind.The ending is a pretty good twist, which you may or may not suspect, since there is such big confusion about agents' loyalties. The director also leaves open the door for a sequel which I believe Theron has signed on for.If you like a sexy, strong, somewhat violent spy movie, Atomic Blonde will blow you away. Enjoy!",Atomic Blonde
182,WalkdenEntertainment,Talents can be overrated (Boom!),7,9 January 2019,"Based on the graphic novel The Coldest City, a top, undercover MI6 agent ""Lorraine Broughton"" (Charlize Theron) is sent on a mission to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate a horrible murder of a fellow agent, an agent Lorraine once worked with. Her mission is to also to recover a missing list of double agents. Lorraine is ordered to partner with a state chief, David Pervical (James McAvoy). The year is 1989.While the film might have been completed by a first time director ""David Leitch"", David's resume here also includes having previously worked as a film producer in the recent (and successful) action flicks, John Wick 1 & 2.Visually, Atomic Blonde is stunning to watch. From the film's introduction, the director has made a major focus on every shot being conducted well. Actress Charlize Theron is also a stunning highlight in every shot, deliberately made to ""stand out"" in every scene. The camera work for most of the basic shots has been done with such creativeness and it was refreshing to see multiple moments that were different and creative. Visually this is a true credit to the director and Charlize Theron as she once again proves to movie goers that she can provide an outstanding performance. The movie includes some of the most hard core action sequences, even resulting in me clenching my teeth together in a similar tradition to John Wick or perhaps even Jason Bourne (this is a good thing).If you enjoy 80's music then you will also love the film's soundtrack. Not only does the film provide thrilling music from Tyler Bates, Atomic Blonde is absolutely jammed packed and loaded with many well known 80's music throughout the film. The way the music is used is also very clever and a blast to see. Watching key characters turn on a loud radio during a fight scene can lead to the music itself being a bigger focus than the normal punching and kicking sound effects. For some viewers, this type of style and soundtrack could be a little too much. For me, it was welcomed and embraced. I mean who doesn't love the 80's?While Atomic Blonde has plenty to praise, it does sadly have a few issues relating to the plot and story. This hurts the final results of this film. Throughout the story there are many mixed genres and topics, meaning that at times it felt like I was watching multiples films at once. This is also due to the way the film is paced, going back and forth. By the third act, I felt the film was really starting to drag and struggle as we approached the ending. To top it off, the film also has an unexpected (and what I felt was a unnecessary) same gender sex scene and nudity flashes (all involving actress Charlize Theron). In my option, these scenes should have result the film's overall cinema rating being R 18+, not MA15+. Regardless of my opinion of ratings, I found this type of content felt out of place, hindering the story line and I feel it wasn't required.Overall, Atomic Blonde is a mixed bag, loaded with incredible visuals, a fun soundtrack and action sequences, (including one that lasts one screen for a full 8 - 10mins!). Its major letdown for me was the film's overall plot and the paces it takes to tell its story. Charlize Theron proves to the world once again that she is not to be messed with and continues to provide an expected and outstanding performance.7.0/10

183,srdjan_veljkovic,It's hard to find anything worthwhile in this movie,3,13 August 2017,"The story is weak and doesn't make sense. There's no special style to it (like, say, John Wick). The protagonist is not charming or sexy (maybe she was ~20 years ago). Laws of physics are ignored but it doesn't bring anything interesting to the table (like, say, Fast & Furious). It's not funny or fun.It's basically a piece of feminist propaganda. ""Men are incompetent and/or crooked, women fix up their mess and are stronger and smarter than them"".Mind you, it's not _terrible_. With all its flaws, its decently done. Sometimes it actually does let Charlize Theron do some sensitive stuff a skilled woman fighter would do against bigger and stronger men (use leverage, weapons...). It has elements of spy movies (everybody betraying everybody else, secret drop points...). It keeps moving, it's not boring. Misandry is actually quite minimal for such a premise.But, when Theron, a 40ish woman, gets up a second after being hit hard in the head by a trained man twice her size, it all just comes crashing down (like she should have). Or where she says that she basically ""manipulated everything from the very beginning"" to get the main villain, which is like 10 years younger than her and for it to work out, it would take more than 10 years to set up, so, he was still in high school when she started... you feel like the author(s) of this movie should go back to (high) school before someone lets them make another movie.About the only way you can like this movie is if you like Charlize Theron kicking ass, or like feminist propaganda movies in general. Otherwise, there's nothing to see here.",Atomic Blonde
184,trublu215,Gives Off the Feeling of Pure Redundancy,6,22 July 2017,"Atomic Blonde pits an elusive and brutal MI-6 agent, Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) against hit men, secret agents, dual agents, thug after thug and (very briefly) James McAvoy. Directed by John Wick's David Leitch, Atomic Blonde is just what you would expect out of a close-to-August release. It is bland storytelling mixed with truly impressive action sequences. When the chips are down, it makes for a VERY frustrating film. While the film is supposed to be somewhat of a period piece with taking place during the Cold War, it adopts the flaws of a handful of 80s and 90s action films in the worst ways possible. It is dull and tries to make sense of itself. Instead of embracing what could be a fun corny romp, Atomic Blonde tries being as realistic as possible despite never really challenging the characters. We never feel like they're in real danger. We never feel like there is anything at stake outside of a mysterious dossier and it translates to a pretty flat film. Leitch abandons what made John Wick so fun and it quickly turns to a drab and dull experience just after the opening sequence. With that being said, despite the film being more of the same, it still features some incredibly impressive choreography in its fight sequences. Leitch is known for impressive stunt work and it doesn't change here. You just get to thinking: had Leitch dedicated the same high standard to the story that he did for the stunts, we'd probably have a better film.The film, however, is not all bad. The cast is exceptional. Charlize Theron and James McAvoy are incredible together. Theron's determination to deliver a strong female character is abundantly clear and it pays off. Lorraine is such a great character for Theron and allows her to continue to deliver strong women on screen. Despite the story being weak in its knees, the characters are strong and the performances are even stronger especially Theron. Overall, Atomic Blonde is a let down when considering the talent behind the camera. While Leitch hits nowhere near the mark that John Wick hit, he still hits in certain spots by delivering awesome action and a strong character.",Atomic Blonde
185,williampsamuel,"A Heart Pounding, If Somewhat Confusing Spy",7,15 March 2019,"Atomic Blonde is what you get when you mix James Bond and The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, with fight choreography from John Wick. Like a Bond film it's stylish, action packed, and filled with gorgeous women, none more beautiful than the lead. And like the classic Cold War drama it's tense, cynical, and filled with twists and betrayals.Charlize Theron is an absolute force of nature as agent Lorraine Broughton. Smart, beautiful, and intensely physical, she's as badass as they come. This is a woman who knows how to throw a punch. And an elbow, knee, head-butt, and every household object except the kitchen sink. What's even more impressive is that Theron appears to have done most of the fight scenes herself. And her aura of sheer awesomeness is matched by the sex appeal she exudes throughout. She is absolutely stunning and she knows it. Whether chatting up club patrons or cooling off in an ice water bath she is an utter treat for the eyes, and incredibly spicy- and explicit- scenes with her French counterpart rival those in Black Swan.Yet she's not just a one dimensional male fantasy or feminist icon. She's a fully developed character who can be as vulnerable as she is strong. She doesn't have all the answers or know who she can trust. At times she's deeply scared; both for herself and allies. And as tough as she is she's far from invincible. Seeing her bloodied and bruised in the later scenes you can't help but feel for her.James McAvoy also shines as eccentric MI6 station chief David Percival. He manages to come off as charming, witty, sleazy and slightly unhinged all at the same time, all without appearing to give a single damn. He clearly knows the lay of the land, and he's certainly not the drunken fop he pretends to be, but you're never quite sure what game he's playing, or who for.In the tradition of the best spy thrillers, this is a very clever movie with plenty of twists that will keep you guessing until the end. But perhaps it's a bit too clever for its own good. Most of the time events aren't too hard to follow if you're paying close attention, and if something isn't clear that's because it's meant to be ambiguous. However towards the end the twists come too quickly and with practically no explanation, leaving you to wonder if you understood everything.But what really makes the movie isn't the pot; it's the fight scenes. They're less stylized than the trailers would suggest, but even more brutal. Eastern Promises or The Raid level brutal. Some fights are fast paced and slickly choreographed, while others are knock-down, drag-out slugfests. But either way they are incredibly violent and extremely realistic by Hollywood standards. These aren't martial arts matches or superhero brawls; they actually look like real people desperately trying to kill each other with their bare hands or whatever objects are in reach. It's graphic, bloody, and so believable that you almost feel the blows.Although Atomic Blonde isn't trying to be a hyper realistic portrayal of the espionage business, it's quite commendable in its accurate depiction of basic field craft and frequent reminders of the moral compromises inherent to the spy trade. And it so perfectly captures late Cold War Berlin. The drab, decaying apartment blocks and stacks of black market goods are a constant reminder that we're behind the Iron Curtain, while the gangs of pierced, spike hair punks gathering under the cover of darkness to skate and play rock music, the boisterous underground night clubs where drinks and drugs flow freely, and the news reports of marches and mass unrest drive home that this is a city on edge.Atomic Blonde is not a movie for the faint of heart or the easily offended. It won't win any awards for coherent storytelling. In fact you'll probably walk out of the theatre somewhat confused. But if you want a heart pounding, atmospheric thriller, it delivers.",Atomic Blonde
186,austin0731,Looks amazing but completely lacking in story,6,28 July 2017,"Brilliantly styled, great acting but an unnecessarily convoluted and confusing plot that leads nowhere. Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton an agent working for the MI6 as she attempts to recover some list while other people also come after this list but you don't know who's behind who and who actually works for whom and just why exactly all of this is happening as the film tries to create an overly complex story. Charlize Theron's performance itself was really good and the film captured a great atmosphere and had a style that clashes the dark and shadow with splashes of neon lights and colours. In fact across the board there was great visuals and acting from, Charlize, James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella. The fight scenes were choreographed brilliantly, they were gritty relentless and absolutely kick ass however this film unlike John Wick as I have thought it would be like is a lot more of a spy film then an action jam packed fighting streak. Though when there is action Atomic Blonde certainly nails it. So, the character of Lorraine was certainly intriguing and I was indeed curious and interested in finding out just who she is and who the characters are associated with but in the end it seems that all of these questions are unanswered and it just seems that there is a complete lack of motivation on the part of the many parties involved which is a result of trying to be 'too smart for its own good' and to use an extremely messy and unorthodox way of storytelling. Atomic Blonde could've been a great stylistic action film like John Wick so long as it drops its choice of presenting the timeline of the film and its choice to involve so many damn double crossings! Just spend some time developing the characters and their motivations and why exactly everyone is after this 'list'. There is a great film buried in here and I did enjoy certain parts for what it is but the lack of proper narrative and storytelling this film's style and character intrigue can only take it so far.",Atomic Blonde
187,asifahsankhan,"Charlize Theron, in one of the most brutal action sequences of all time!",8,5 February 2018,"Atomic Blonde - Starting with the beautiful lady Charlize Theron in the bend, attracts every scene, every shot, incredibly - this is one of her finest films. Only never a female lead action movie a la Angelina Jolie or Milla Jovovich was this good. And yes even better so to speak. And also: WHAT-A soundtrack!Like Wonder Woman, Atomic Blonde feels like a solid beginning. The movie's spectacular violence begins to wear a bit toward the end, and its lead character-British Cold War spy Lorraine Broughton, played by Charlize Theron-is a little too enigmatic even for a straight pulp exercise such as this.Charlize brags like a consummate Martial Arts action hero literally through Berlin, during the Cold War, just before and during the fall of the Wall. So if that city and that time draws you, watch this movie and immerse yourself in that zeitgeist. Helped by a super 80s New Wave soundtrack (with Queen, Depeche Mode, New Order, Bowie, the Clash, Nena, Falco, Sioux and the Banshees, Joy Division, the Cure, the Cult - and you never heard Cat People from Bowie as bold as in this 2002 remaster)Stuntman and John Wick co-director David Leitch does an awesome job and Theron and McAvoy overall, bringing this emotional hook: Atomic Blonde to the scene. The setting of this film (1989 Berlin), allows Leitch to partake in the biggest trend in modern cinema - 1980s nostalgia. Guardians of the Galaxy, Stranger Things, Ready Player One, The Hitman's Bodyguard - everyone in the industry seems to be looking back. I wonder why. However, in this film, Leitch does make appropriate music choices which fit the blackly comic tone. Any film that uses 99 Red Balloons as a grieving song is alright by me. The cinematography and lighting is sensational and Leitch uses camera movement to create a visually stunning film.This is a fun popcorn thriller, full of action and style but of course if not much beyond that since it's not John Wick, but you would be lying if you've said you didn't have a lot of fun watching it.",Atomic Blonde
188,Eddie_weinbauer,Really bad& over hyped,2,28 October 2017,"It can't decide if it should be drama, thriller or action. First of there's no character development,it just sort of jump right into it with both feet.Which again doesn't really help the movie.Cause you are giving no reason to sympathize with any of the characters.It get told mostly in flashback,So it switches a lot between a debriefing in the present,and the past where all the action take place.Some of the shooting and stunts are great in terms of effects,but nothing more.The biggest problem it has, is story development and pace. The pace is way to slow to keep you interested,or for you to invest in any of the different agents. And it's full of illogical plot holes the size of grand canyon.Especially when Charlize's character is suppose to be super pro.Agent. They all act like amateurs,instead of the pro's they suppose to be.But they seem to have done a great job of recreating Berlin,as it was during the cold war.Maybe that's where all the effort went,cause it sure didn't go into the storyline or the script.A good portion of the bad guys,survive way to much.Even for Hollywood bad guys. It get to the point were it's simply too much for a serious movie,and not a comedy",Atomic Blonde
189,skip-98756,Brutal and Cool Action Thriller,7,10 March 2019,"This was cool flick with atmosphere and a vibe of the era.
Charlieze did her fight scenes well with brutal realism and relentless intensity...This movies is one of few that shows fight scenes done well and in a realistic manner, where the
hero is not ending fights with a single punch or kick ,and then finishing a fight with no signs of injury to themselves..Look an a typical Arrow fight scene and you will see this comical way of fighting where the villians are hit with a kick and drop unconscious and are done...Thats Not how real fights go down! People dont fall down easily and even if they are knocked down, they get up and keep coming so you gotta deal with that..Daredevil tv series had some brutal one take scenes that portray this well and seeing the main character beaten ,bruised, battered and breathless exhausted ,yet victorious, is the way to do it!

190,Lewis_Heather787,This film is trying to many things at once!,6,5 August 2017,"The only thing that personally interested me about this film were the trailers, which were extremely well cut together and did its purpose which is to get people to see the film. Even though the title of this review may seem as if this film is not good, there are plenty of good elements to the film. Firstly the cast, all of which gave good decent performances but however nothing mind blowing or outstanding which is a real let down considering the talented on display in this film. Charlize Theron is good in the film, was easily able to carry the film by herself but however never progressed as a character as the film went on, she was just the same throughout. Her portrayal of the character was no different from the beginning of the film to the end, which is bizarre. James McAvoy was again good in the film but again was nothing special, not to say he was bad but just lacking that extra bit of magic, to take the character to the next level. Sofia Boutella, John Goodman and Toby Jones all gave solid performances but I believe they were all told to have the same tone in there voice or to have the same feeling in their persona's. This film is crying out for one of them to just be different or great, however even though there is nothing wrong with their performances they all just well a bit flat. Next the directing by David Leitch which is interesting, quirky and with a hint of the John Wick to it, some of the camera work in this film is very nicely done. The camera work during the intense action of the film is real good makes you feel as if you are in the room at the same time as the events unfolding on screen. Even the more conventional shots of wide angles or close ups all seem to have some sort of quirk to them that is nice to see that level of detail be put into their craftsmanship. All in all decent directing.Another positive of the film is the stunt choreography in the film is at a very high standard and definitely is a highlight of the film. Along with the close quarters camera work putting you in the situation, as the audience, the level of stunt fighting is brilliant and a brutal joy to watch. As an audience member I can definitely tell the inspiration and ground work made by the John Wick films which is added upon in this film with a different technique. It helps for a film like this to have someone like Leitch who was involved with other projects like the John Wick films to bring there expertise. The final positive is the soundtrack to the film, which strangely for me really worked in the context and background of the film. With 99% of the film being dark, grey and depressing looking an up beat soundtrack offers a rather strange but brilliant dynamic to the film. Also unlike other films that just shove greatest hit after greatest hit in our faces this film didn't to its credit. Now unfortunately lets turn our attention to the negatives of this film, the first being quite a strange complaint. My personal biggest complaint with this film is the fact that it is trying far to hard for its own good. I believe that the creators of the film really thought that this was going to be a cult classic or a stylish indie action flick. Whilst being a spy, thriller, action, comedy, drama, music video all at the same time there are just to many directions at once. However I believe that they have focused so hard on the image of the film rather than the content of it, they have tried to grasp far ahead of their reach. If they had focused a bit more on making a more interesting and complex story then they can worry about the image of the film. Another negative of the film is it can get a bit bland now and then due to the constant dark and grey colour palette the creators went for, it can get a bit much at times. I do understand that you can't really make West and East Germany during the Cold War really colourful and joyful but a little more colour would not go a miss. The final negative of the film is the performances even though I did say they were a positive as well, this film is crying a lot for just one of either Theron or McAvoy to just be a bit more to there characters and this film could've been so much more enjoyable and entertaining, the acting even though it was good can get very bland. All in all this film is good 65% of out 100 or 6 out of 10 whatever way you like to look at it, there is nothing wrong with this film however there is not much great about it at the same time. Acting for most part is good, directing is interesting, soundtrack is great, action is great. However this film is trying so hard to look good that it fails to meet up to the trailers that are made for it in terms of story, scope and scale, its a shame. However I personally have a strange wanting for a sequel in a different era and a new mission, this will not happen though because box office does the talking.",Atomic Blonde
191,blrnani,Charlize Theron has carved out a Bourne-like niche,8,11 January 2018,"...to rival that of Angelina's Lara Croft. I've heard people are confused by the plot. Well it is complex and maybe some moviegoers have difficulty following it, but it is clever and, just as it is for most people working in the spy game (no wonder they get paranoid) one is left in doubt about what is 'actually' really going on until right at the end. The fight scenes are very realistic. McEvoy plays an interesting role and John Goodman also plays a part that gives him a change from the usual fare. I put this on a par with another very underrated Charlize actioner 'Aeon Flux' and Angelina's 'Salt'. Imho it merits a 7.5, but a film has to be really special to get 8 or more from me. Nevertheless, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and would welcome a sequel - or prequel - if it were as cleverly conceived as this one.
It is ironic that I used to get so concerned about Charlize in her early films as she was always so badly treated. But since she's become an icon I get kicks from seeing her in deadly encounters, but at least she gets to kick some butt too! :)

The fight scenes were impressively realistic, as was a lesbian sex scene (for those who like that sort of thing), but what I was most taken by in this film was the way it captured the claustrophobic and paranoid atmosphere of the Cold War era.

Ones where I never saw any advertising or trailers or even interviews with the cast, and then I come across it somehow and just get COMPLETELY blown away. This is certainly one of the best films I've seen in 2018, although technically I think it's a 2017 release.The movie is a gritty , suspenseful cold war spy film set in the late 80's right around the time the Berlin wall came down and the cold war ""ended"" (which, of course, it didn't really but that's another topic). It stars Charlize Theron as Lorraine Broughton, a British super-spy that would seriously give Bond a run for his money.Lorraine has been sent to Berlin to contain a situation in which a list of undercover agents (i.e. spies) has been stolen and a British officer was killed. The list is now going on the market and everyone is desperate to get their hands on it. The situation is, and this is a massive understatement, volatile, and Lorraine is in the thick of things almost from the word go.The movie is incredibly atmospheric, bot visually and aurally with its 80's soundtrack, and features a sophisticated plot that is one of the best ""spy movie"" stories I've seen in a while. But the wow factor comes around 70 minutes into the movie with a stunningly choreographed scene that lasts something like 15 minutes in a single long take. They probably used some editing tricks to pull such a long one-take off, but if so it wasn't obvious to me how exactly. The end result is breathtaking; it just blew me away.The movie is very well balanced between action and quieter moments, so I was riveted the whole time. It also does an excellent job of weaving scenes together in such a way that you can grasp the whole convoluted story, which is important since spy movies generally have complex plots almost by default.

Personally it's not my favorite genre , I loved the message in V for Vendetta and its cult has lived on in the mask of subversion - Moore's book predates this so ironically the film could have featured the mask in the protests the East German youth however not even the 2005 film V4V inspired protesters around the world to emulate the scene of protest outside Parliament it took the market crash of 2007/8 and the occupy / anonymous movements What we have here is a Debbie Harry looking Lorraine Broughtin in the coldest city searching for a double agent and trying to stop a list of allied spies falling into the wrong hands . Like any good spy film there are twists and turns keeping you guessing who's on who's side . The debrief in the dimly dungeon where lecherous men gawp from behind two way mirrors at the seemingly demure blond had all the hallmarks of the Sharon Stone interrogation in Basic Instinct with the same feeling of who's fooling whom . The constant flashbacks and brilliant supporting cast including James Mcinvoy ( might have spelled that wrong ! ) looking incredibly like Jude Law . The well publicized erotic scene between Lorraine and her French counterpart gave a modern day twist to the macho Bond image supplied by the ever smart 007 . British intelligence has never looked so sexy and cool . The fight scenes although hard to take at times particularly seeing men hitting women so violently but that in itself has a modern day twist and we have a heroine who can give even better than she gets . Playing both Producer and main character Charlize Theron has pulled off a near masterpiece - like the classic film The Warriors it's a film you walk out of feeling great and wanting to walk back in watch again - I've seen it twice in three days and I'll happily watch it again - rarely does a film come along and provide so much entertainment . For a film to get 10/10 it has to make me cry and that was it's only failing although there were scene Lie that should have touched an emotional nerve they didn't so it's just missed 10/10 . It will be a huge summer hot blockbuster but I doubt if it will linger long enough to noticed by the academy when it comes to the Oscars next march But I highly recommend it **go see it twice ** you'll love it 😍 :)",Atomic Blonde
200,js-66130,DOUBLE UH-OH,8,21 March 2020,"You need this movie. Trust me.In the best James Bond tradition of kick assert, ""Atomic Blonde"" is a dizzying international spy caper brimming with gorgeously ripped leads, despicable bad dudes, windshield popping car chases, harsh European accents, neon lit sex scenes, a record body count, and a ridiculously twisty plot. It's a Moebius striptease.Charlize Theron is perfect as the bleached Blondie in chest puncturing stilettos, who likes her foes much like her vodka: on ice. Bathed in black and blue hues, bouncing to a pulsing soundtrack of eighties new wave nuggets, our rogue heroine lays waste to an endless stream of thugs in stunning Bourne-like combat, snap, crackle and popping her victims in sharp, angular choreography.Bruised, cut and battered for the duration, our badass icy cold super heroine tries to make some kinda sense of a convoluted Berlin story line based on East West cold war manoeuvres, so we don't have to. Thanks, we're here for the action. The suspension of logic. The escape. The ride. Buckle up!Fast food espionage cinema at it's most delicious, surely this is the start of a long, long series. So yes, spoiler, our heroine survives her many perils. Sorry, not sorry.hipCRANK",Atomic Blonde
201,arabnikita,"Its different, that's why its good",9,1 August 2017,"Different, different and different...Finally a spy action movie not set in America or during the 60s which is a big plus by itself as we are all tired of clichés...This movie reminds me of the original Jason Bourne. 1989 Berlin provides the necessary setting for the film to look old school with the a theme that is depressing and bleak while still remaining realistic. Great work by cinematographers and camera crew to capture the setting with many small nuances. Oh and the music was fantastic too which adds more depth to the whole theme.Charlize Theron is female Jason Bourne, minus the amnesia, and she delivers what was required of her. The action scenes are well shot and are CREATIVE with a bunch of new elements that are not overused in all other action films. Violence is not over the top and is suitable when needed.Oh and I loved this even more being a Russian for small parts like a car chase involving all Russian cars, Stalker movie playing in the cinema and the little things that only Russian gangsters would say.Overall, if you are a fan of Jason Bourne, you should definitely check out this film.",Atomic Blonde
202,mgruebel,La Femme Nikita in Berlin,7,25 November 2018,"Leitch as director and Theron as producer really concocted a nice spy action film with Atomic Blonde. Set around the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, it traces the attempt of a British agent (oh wait, or is it a CIA agent?) to prevent a list of friendly agents, available only engraved in a watch and in the mind of a German collaborator, to fall into the hands of the Russians. The film is framed by a debriefing, where Theron recounts her tale of sleuthing and mayhem.The film bears much resemblance to Nikita, Luc Besson's female assassin film of 1990. Not coincidentally, Atomic Blonde is based on a graphic novel, and Besson was also a big fan of adapting graphic novels, as in ""The Fifth Element,"" for example. Both films have a stylized touch, that works given the graphic (in all senses of the word!) theme.One aspect where Atomic Blonde rises above analogous efforts such as the Bourne series, is that despite all the action, some of the relationships can be worked out a little, like the one with her nemesis double agent, which turns from mistrust to respect to hatred, or the lesbian relationship with a French agent who is in over her head and pays the price. Even the relationship with semi-competent Russian agent Bremovych gets its full arc in the story. There's not much time to do it in an action film like this - what time is spent doing it, is spent well here.McAvoy's take on the double agent is great, especially once it becomes clear why he would be motivated to make the list disappear - for exactly the opposite reasons the British and Americans would want to keep it out of Russian hands.The film captures Berlin well (I have a flat there and my parents live there), from its punk-grittiness to the fancy but somewhat clinical looking bar, to the pre-war construction that's left in many parts of the city despite the destruction of WW II.The film does not have too many plot holes, but Theron's habit of spending 5 minutes dismembering enemy agents while getting seriously hurt herself, before just picking up their gun and shooting them (which she could have done right away) becomes a little forcé.A fun spy flick that's a cut above similar efforts in sophistication: 7/10.",Atomic Blonde
203,lediscipledessocrates,The Soundtrack Wins Again,8,13 August 2017,"Action movies always need to tread lightly. And what with all the gore that is casually spilled these days, there has to be enough directorial foresight to draw the thin red line. Atomic Blonde, while not the most original movie, either in storyline or settings or even direction, is not a boring one either.The movie is pretty violent and laden with unusual sexual overtones. Instead of experimenting with narrative techniques or characterization, the director simply installs gender substitution props.In this regard, the movie breaks the fold, and differentiates itself from the more cosmetic female- centered spy movies like Salt (2010) or the Charlie's Angels series.Charlize Theron does a good job , but James McAvoy is without doubt the best performer among the cast. On the whole the acting is not fantastic but good enough for a typical action flick.What, however, steals the show, is the movie's soundtrack. In this regard one could compare it to Spy Game (2001) , with the team reviving an entire era of music in a movie, only this time we are talking about 80's synth –techno . To be sure this is my favourite genre and I can't see why it shouldn't be.The music infuses energy and the necessary insanity, touching up up the darkish scenery of the Cold War.With a good assortment of solid action sequences and enough intrigues to hold one's attention, Atomic Blonde is really a decent action flick and one of the better movies to have been released the first two quarters of this financial year.",Atomic Blonde

208,bastille-852-731547,Entertaining but imperfect spy thriller with great action scenes,7,5 July 2017,"Charlize Theron stars as Lorraine Broughton, an MI6 agent stationed in Berlin as the wall is about to fall in ""Atomic Blonde."" This white-knuckle spy movie brings the action, and we would expect nothing less given that it is from the director of ""John Wick."" The film's action scenes are intense and brutal, and are staged expertly. A (filmed as to appear to be) one-take, several-minute-long scene involving Theron fighting on a stairway is choreographed particularly impressively. This scene occurs about 80 percent of the way into the movie. Theron does a very fine job playing the gritty, sometimes tired Broughton--and also manages to make her stunts look easy in the process. The film's aesthetic qualities are stylish, as is the unique and nourish depiction of Berlin in 1989. The soundtrack--an eclectic ensemble of 80's rock and pop--is great as well.While ""Atomic Blonde"" has plenty of strengths, the film does contain a few structural flaws. The film seems to have a bit of a pacing problem. For example, the film takes time to get going (despite never feeling tedious,) which is fine until one realizes that the last act of the film is almost shockingly overstuffed. After the well-shot stairway action scene, viewers have plot twist after plot twist thrown at them almost relentlessly for the last twenty or so minutes of the film. This is a bit of a problem because these plot 'twists' start feeling quite rushed. Additionally, the plot as a whole is rather predictable, and character development could have been improved.At the end of the day, though, audiences will most likely be thrilled by the visceral action on display in this film--while also managing to sing (or hum) along to its soundtrack and take in Charlize Theron's strong performance in the lead role. While they will recognize that the story and structure of the film is imperfect, they likely will forgive the movie for much of that given the high entertainment quotient. Recommended. 7/10",Atomic Blonde

The soundtrack with the 80's music was very cool. The ending had a twist and was unexpected. The one thing that I found very distracting was Charlize Theron's British accent!

210,hoernkeem,"Atomic Blonde (2017, David Leitch) Bad ass female lead in combo cold war spy thriller meets Jason Bourne action",7,19 February 2021,"Atomic Blonde (2017, David Leitch)
The trailer for this film got me very excited. In broad strokes I was thinking a possible female James Bond. Charlize Theron is wonderfully cast as the resident badass secret agent Lorraine Broughton. She can be equal parts sexy and seductive as well as tough and violent. There are some witty one liners tossed out in a very James Bond way. Color me mildly surprised when the show launches and it is not set in modern day but in Berlin right during the fall of the Berlin Wall so all that cold war tension just escalates a city already wired pretty tight. Although 80's set this did not really exude 80's nostalgia, but it wasn't any lesser for it. Theron's character is sent in to attain a list that has fallen into a nefarious person's hand which contains the real names of every covert operative in Europe or something like that. Seems quite reminiscent of the premise of 'Mission: Impossible'. Theron meets her contact in Berlin played by James McAvoy who is described as having 'gone native' and Sofia Boutella is also thrown in the mix as a French operative and all the while they are trying to find the list while avoiding Russians and Germans and some super secret double agent known only as Satchel (who picked that name?). This sets up a fairly epic game of cat and mouse trying to figure out who is doing what and who is aligned with who and what everyone's motivation is so naturally there is action, betrayals and some surprises. Actually for how much they attempted to set up a complex game I was surprised how it all played out fairly predictably in that they go right where they lead you. All along I expected some fairly chaotic twists but as stuff is laid out you get a sense of where they are going and that is pretty much where everything goes with a slight exception right at the end. So while entertaining the plot didn't do as much as it could have or should have to elevate itself. It had a very good look and as in the trailer they emphasized the neon lights in numerous scenes which provided a dark, sultry, exotic effect. I am torn somewhat on the action fight scenes. On the spectrum of film fighting you have extremely stylized on one end and on the other you have very realistic and visceral and this film wanted to do a mixture with elements of both. That can work at cross purposes. Some fights feel very choreographed but then they really emphasize the fact that as a woman she is smaller and can get rag dolled around a bit and as a result you get that gritty more realistic turn of violence. From the outset they ensure that you feel Theron's pain by showing some pretty stark visuals of her busted up post skirmish. Another odd plot point was how Theron kept going along with McAvoy when he clearly had another agenda in mind. She knew something was up based on some actions but it was very odd how through most of the film he stayed one step ahead of her despite her knowing something was rottenin Denmark (or Berlin in this case). All of this leads to a very obvious conclusion for the most part. I think Charlize Theron has enough panache to carry off this role in multiple films but unfortunately they don't set her up the best with a somewhat convoluted yet still derivative plot which maintains an obvious trajectory. That combined with the odd disjointed action style don't give me high hopes that this has legs beyond this film. For this film itself I did enjoy it overall but just wish I would have seen something beefier with better action set pieces. Put forth something to give women a true counterpart to the modern James Bond.

211,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,6,5 August 2017,"From the director of John Wick 2 comes Atomic Blonde. Me and Nick were incredibly excited to see this film and went in with high expectations, but sadly left with ""meh"" expectations. The plot involves a trained female agent (Charlize Theron) to find a retrieve a list from a pair of bad guys. She gets the help of another foul mouthed agent (James Mcavoy). While not saying that it's universally bad (unless it's The Emoji Movie in which we don't plan to see very soon), it does offer some neat stuff that saves the film from going dull all the way. The action set pieces are all entertaining, with one sequence in particular going for a 10 minute run in a one shot camera take. With blows, bullets and broken limbs, the action style is very brutal but not as brutal as JW, but it does feature some impressive cinematography work and camera handling.The faults of AB are very easy to see; the plot suffers from weak writing though the concept/backdrop was good, setting itself in the closing days of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, adding to that the pace was on and off so the wait for action and such was slow at times but it was good when it something suddenly happened and lastly there was very little character development, no further background to the characters of the story or to show what made them that way to play part of the story.While we won't give it a bomb rating as the action sequences, music and Theron are all worthwhile and saved it, it does feel like an average film that does feel like a slight step down from the superior JW films but it does want to go somewhere. All in all it was an okay film. The acting by Charlize Theron, James McCoy and John Goodman were fine, and the direction was fine, but with a more interesting plot line, better paced film and character development this could have been so Great! See it for the 10 minute fight scene right at the end! 3/5",Atomic Blonde
212,danielharden,You can't unf*ck what's already been f*cked...,6,16 August 2017,"Hollywood has gone nuts for 1980's nostalgia ever since Guardians of the Galaxy's soundtrack became a hit. It's now a staple of James Gunn's superhero series and even Edgar Wright has jumped on the bandwagon, with his 80's and older music soundtrack in Baby Driver. As well as this, John Wick has become a hit film series, with its brilliantly framed and choreographed fight scenes, making waves with their return in John Wick: Chapter 2. Now, from the uncredited director of John Wick and the credited director of the upcoming Deadpool 2, David Leitch, we have Atomic Blonde, a spy film set in Berlin 1989 with a soundtrack full of 80's hits, complete with neon lighting and an unstoppable, kick ass hero(ine)... As much as the marketing wants you to think this is John Wick doing the 80's, it is actually more of a classical, convoluted spy thriller, but one that is oozing with style.Atomic Blonde is a beautifully shot and a superbly directed film. The neon lighting of the film makes every shot look gorgeous, while also establishing the films neo-noir tone excellently. The cinematography as a whole is simply mesmerizing and thus makes Atomic Blonde an absolutely beautiful film to look at. David Leitch himself is an experienced stuntman, and similar to his co-director of John Wick, Chad Stahelski, that experience shows in his film. The films stunt choreography is outstanding throughout and makes the films action sequences extremely gripping and entertaining. Although, these scenes aren't as impressively shot as John Wick: Chapter 1 and 2, they are far better than many action scenes put to film in recent years. Atomic Blonde has a couple fight scenes throughout which are great, but there is one which is simply extraordinary and puts together everything that makes this film great. This scene involves a flight of stairs and takes place near the end of the film. The scene is long and obviously features a lot of choreography and stunt work, to which the director puts together in what seems to be one take, I am unaware if it is one take or not, but i doubt it actually is. Nevertheless, this scene is the heart of the film, this scene is the treat the audience get for choosing to watch Atomic Blonde. It's the absolute highlight of the entire film and makes the film worth watching, despite its weak narrative. Which brings me to Atomic Blonde's major flaw, it's story. Whereas John Wick's story is simple, a retired assassin gets revenge on those who killed the dog his late wife left him. Atomic Blonde's story is far more complex. What we have is a classic spy thriller filled with countless double crosses, plot twists and a convoluted web of relationships that most audiences won't follow. The film tries to do a lot and be complex with its story driven narrative but just comes off stale and hard to follow. Atomic Blonde tries to be more complex than it needs to be and is more likely to lose people along the way than grip and impress them. As well as being confusing, the film makes several bad choices in regard to narrative techniques. The idea to have Lorraine (Charlize Theron) recount her story to Kurzfeld (John Goodman) and Gray (Toby Jones) takes a lot of tension away from the film. By beginning at the end, we already know about 50-60% of the characters will definitely survive, or at least survive the majority of the film. Thus any tense scenes featuring these characters lose their impact. Also, the film features little to no character development, leaving you with characters you don't really care for and whose actions you don't care about. It's hard to follow a convoluted film when you don't know or care for any of the characters, their actions or motivations. The film does feature a dream sequence and photograph to provide some backstory to Lorraine's character, however, this attempt is all we get and it simply isn't enough to deliver what it intended. All in all, the story just gets boring, but thankfully the film's style is good enough to compensate for its lack of substance.Atomic Blonde is not the lighthearted and fun, female John Wick film I was made to believe it would be, it is instead a highly stylized, if rather boring spy thriller. Its script makes many wrong turns and narrative decisions, but fortunately, the excellent cinematography, lighting, choreography and directing, make up for the films hollow and lacklustre story, but then again style will only take you so far. The film should've been character driven, here's an idea for the sequel, put Lorraine in a no smoking zone and see how long she lasts Better make it a short...",Atomic Blonde

These young pukes on their way up in Hollywood have no idea how to make a good spy film.First, real spies don't go jumping from bed to bed all the time. (Unless they are East Germans). Real spies don't run around 'hunting' for information. Anyone who has to adapt their techniques is at greater risk of being caught, because one slip-up and you are dead. Real spies stick to one area of expertise, and Western spies especially didn't usually leave a trail of bodies like their KGB counterparts did. The methodologies between East and West were entirely different.For a real spy film (not totally, but a bit better at least), see The Fourth Protocol, with Pierce Brosnan and Michael Caine. That is much closer to how real spies operate.There isn't usually such a thing as a double-cross in real life. Needless to say, there IS a traitor in this film, and it is obvious who it is if you know who the actor is (ahem.....) Another good spy film: The Good Shepherd. Although it received poor reviews, much better.There are numerous nude shots of Charlize Theron but are usually too brief to be gratuitous.

217,joshbarton15,Decent action film but I just couldn't understand the hype while watching,6,12 August 2017,"Charlize Theron kicks ass, we all know that. Ever since her performance in Mad Max: Fury Road, people have almost been campaigning to have Theron lead an action film or franchise. Pairing with David Leitch who co-directed the first John Wick film, which Atomic Blonde owes a lot to, Theron certainly packs a punch however, does the film follow suit?Undercover MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is sent to Berlin to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of every active field agent in the Soviet Union.Unfortunately I found Atomic Blonde rather disappointing but there's certainly enough entertainment value left in the film for me to enjoy it. The main problem I had with the film was its narrative, which was far too overstuffed and overcomplicated compared to what it should have been. I just didn't really care for much of what was going on at all, meaning the action sequences weren't as impactful as they could have been.That being said, the action sequences, just like John Wick, are insanely well choreographed and shot. You know it's really great to have walked out of an action film after knowing exactly who each person was in a fight scene and it not being edited beyond comprehension. I'd heard about the stairwell sequence before seeing the film and it definitely did not disappoint. Filmed in one long take, Lorraine takes on a number of enemies down a flight of stairs before taking it to the roads in a car. It's breathtakingly shot and the choreography of it all shouldn't be underestimated because that is not easy to execute. It's almost worth the admission price alone.I enjoyed the score and found it to be similar to John Wick, which comes as no surprise seeing as Tyler Bates worked on both films. The soundtrack however I was not such a big fan of, feeling intrusive and random at best, a bit like the songs that were picked in Suicide Squad.Charlize Theron was a bit of a disappointment for me in Atomic Blonde as well. On one hand she's incredible at all of the action and delivers plenty of ferocity to the film but on the other hand, I just didn't find her character very likable at all, which becomes a bit of an issue for me when watching an action film. James McAvoy felt more like an irritant than a supporting character while Sofia Boutella is utterly wasted as a French agent, disappointing as she's displayed her skills in action films over the past few years.While it never quite reaches the quality of either John Wick film, Atomic Blonde is a film that shows Charlize Theron is a genuine action star not to be messed with. If it's true that Theron sparred with Keanu Reeves while in training then I'd love to see some form of collaboration between the two in the future, something along the lines of Mr & Mrs Smith.",Atomic Blonde

219,barbagvido,"Great direction, poor script",8,13 September 2017,"Atomic Blonde is a spy action thriller set in Berlin in 1989 and stars Charlize Theron as this agent Lorraine who is sent to Berlin on a mission to get this list (right before the Berlin Wall comes down), but she doesn't know who to trust when she arrives there so it gets intense pretty quickly.The problem, though, is that the plot is so bloated, so complicated (needlessly) and it wouldn't be that hard to understand if the script gave the plot some time to breathe and introduce the characters a bit more and explain the whole thing a bit further, so it doesn't turn into a convoluted mess that it is. It's not one of those movies that make you think in a good way, it just pointlessly confuses you. So many stuff to remember at once and it doesn't hold up. A lot of spy movies in general are a bit complicated, but here it's like they never bothered to explain anything, particularly the characters.But thankfully, that's the only flaw I've had with this movie. It's a big one, for sure, but I guess we can say this movie is a lot style over substance and style is amazing. If you like neon-drenched movies with a synth pop soundtrack like I do, do yourself a favor and watch this. It's gorgeously shot and the bombastic soundtrack consisted of a lot of hits of the '80s plays a huge part in the movie. The action scenes are a thrill ride and some of the best all year. Lead actress Charlize Theron, even though there's little to her character, is such a charismatic presence that you can't help but root for her while she storms through these scenes. The whole action, mixed with the style and direction of the movie, then with an awesome soundtrack, is sure to excite you.Still, the whole experience would be way more satisfying if we the plot was handled a bit better and we were better introduced to the characters. This way, we can say that the director did a great job, but the writer? Not so much.",Atomic Blonde
220,paulijcalderon,A stylized spy thriller with sensational action,7,14 August 2017,"Everyone has already said that this movie is style over substance. I have to agree, but you can't deny that it's entertaining. It's starts out following the classic spy film formula and I was enjoying that. The mission briefing, meeting the contact, setting up the bad guys etc. But, then it began to add more twists and new layers of mystery to the cake. I think it would have benefited more with a simplified plot because it gets more complicated than what it needs to be with all the double or triple agent stuff. Still, it's full of energized action sequences which are all sensational. I got ""Children of Men"" vibes watching a certain long-take fight. The choreography and camera-work is masterful. So if you have trouble keeping track on the plot you can at least be immersed by the spectacle.The song choices were alright, but somewhat distracting. It's a gimmick and not so much of a plot point like it is in ""Baby Driver"". The bright neon colors spark up the scenery even more, which adds to this otherworldly feeling. There are instances where I think they wanted to show off the R-rating way too much. It came out as if the movie was bragging for attention when it didn't need to in the first place. Just give me some nice characters to care for instead of waving for attention. Charlize Theron and James McAvoy both do their parts well. I'm especially impressed with how realistic the action looked. Charlize's character finds herself in so many intense situations and she did an excellent job handling it. There may not have been that much backstory to our main hero, but she oozes with intrigue which does keep your interest. It's a perfectly alright action movie. Just be prepared for it to get brutal and stylized.",Atomic Blonde
221,bravesfanc,Brilliantly filmed action movie,8,9 August 2017,"Some action movie directors don't know how to properly film an action sequence. The camera is too shaky or they use to many cuts and edits to try and blend the fight together. It's a big pet peeve of mine. Needless to say, the director of this film knows his s*&^! And that to me, made this movie so much better and enjoyable.Set in the 80s, Charlize Theron's character is sent to Germany to find a ""list"" which is hidden inside a watch. But from the moment she touches down in Berlin, she has other assassins trying to kill her. Because this was set in the 80s, the music used in the film cater to the decade which was awesome.Towards the end of the movie, there is a 7-10 minute action sequence that was one continuous shot. It was amazing to watch. One of my favorite sequences I've ever scene in an action movie. All the fight scenes were done perfectly. My only complaint with this movie was the end when there were one too many twists. But just a small complaint for what was a great action movie. A solid 8/10",Atomic Blonde
222,themovieparadise,"Excellently Made, With Visceral Atmosphere and Killer Action",9,30 June 2017,"What stands out most about Atomic Blonde is just how well made it is. The technical aspects are far above average for a simple action movie. The cinematography is beautiful. There is great use of rule of thirds, creating gorgeous on screen compilations. The editing works hand-in-hand with this, making for really spectacular transitions that only enhance the overall film. David Leitch does a brilliant job directing. Just in terms of the style and the atmosphere of the movie, he really nails a strong position, and never lets go of it. This world that's created feels like the real world, and yet it also feels enhanced and ultra-real, which just makes it all the more interesting to watch. The soundtrack and the score really worked in tandem with all the other visual elements in order to really draw out the atmosphere, and to make it this pulsing and vibrating world of darkness and bad-assery. Also under Leitch's jurisdiction were the performances. The cast across the board was really good, but Charlize Theron and James McAvoy really stood out. Theron obviously plays the cold, calculating bad-ass, while McAvoy goes for the more psychotic, manic killer. They play well off of each other, each with their own clear and distinct personalities. Toby Jones and John Goodman were also good in their roles, but their characters' screen times were so minimal that really anyone could have played them. There was no true shining moment for either of these actors in terms of their performances, just due to the lacking nature of their characters. But this was ultimately fine, as it meant we got more screen time with Theron and McAvoy...",Atomic Blonde

225,annuskavdpol,No guns but weapons and hands,8,30 July 2017,"This movie is about a woman who is a spy. She operates in East Berlin, before the fall of the East Berlin Wall in Germany. This movie has pretty good outside scenes which show the contrast between East and West Germany. It also explains the corruption in the East Germany sector. Everyone seems to double-cross everyone else and this flick keeps you on your toes until the very end. There are some very exceptional fighting sequences and the hardcore music background makes for a fun action set. Charlize Theron is a South African actress, and perhaps it is her Afrikaans mentality and toughness that contributes to the character of this movie. In a way this movie is a very modern idea of the woman who can take care of herself and outsmart even the smartest of men. The action fighting was not like the Matrix, instead it was more like Rambo except it was a female lead. This movie was a very good distraction from life and it did have an ending in which the West beats the East. It seems to be an age old tale of Capitalism versus Communism; and America versus Russia - which like fairy-tales has something very comforting about it.",Atomic Blonde
226,mitchell5954,A Fun Stylized Spy Thriller,8,5 August 2017,"Atomic Blonde is a spy thriller starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. Spy films at this point are a dime a dozen. Practically everything has been done already in terms of stories that can be told. Unless you're James Bond or Mission Impossible it can be tough for a spy film to make it. You either have to have very interesting characters or a unique style to separate yourself. Atomic Blonde has a bit of both.The general story is very simple. The film takes place in 1989 at the fall of the Berlin Wall. A list of many undercover double agents from many nations is up for grabs. Charlize's character, Lorraine, an MI6 agent, is sent to recover this list before falling into enemy hands. It's a basic plot that's been done in many spy flicks before. As in typical spy films Atomic Blonde does try to through the audience some curve-balls towards the end; some work and some do not.What truly saves Atomic Blonde is its style. It's very much like Kingsman or John Wick in that it presents a very stylized world and action set pieces that are very heightened that they feel straight out of a comic book. It also takes some points with Guardians of The Galaxy with its fancy text sprinkled throughout, and the many songs playing in crucial moments. Unlike something such as Suicide Squad however, it actually fits with the rest of the movie for the most part.The characters are standard, but decent. What elevates them are the performances. You have a lot of big talent on this film, but the standout performances are definitely from Charlize Theron and James McAvoy, which they should as they have the lead roles.The action is another major plus for the movie. One action scene in particular feels very much like a scene from Netflix's Daredevil. However, it's different enough in that they did not directly copy the fight, though it was clearly inspired.The film does have couple hiccups. The main villain is a bore for one thing, as is the general plot. Some of the plot twists they throw are very predictable and really expected. Also, the movie is told mostly in flashback and periodically fast forwards to real time where Lorraine is telling the events to her superiors. That depletes some of the tension because we know she's going to make it out alive in the end.Overall, Atomic Blonde is a fun spy action movie with good characters, great acting, entertaining fights, amazing atmosphere, and fun music. It has its issues, like some of the twists the film throws and the basic plot and villains, and the somewhat lack of tension. However, the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me.",Atomic Blonde

Impressive performance by Charlize Theron and interesting storytelling in flashback mode, playing with the spectator's beliefs and disbeliefs.

When I cam out this film I came out feeling okay about it, but I didn't love it like I thought I would. And then I realized something. I disliked the first John Wick and this movie had a lot of shades of the first Wick and none of the fun that the second one gave me. David tries to give a more interesting story in this one, but it just doesn't work at all. The story instead becomes confusing and it drags a lot. It feels dull and uninteresting. It not into the second act that the movie really heats up and becomes a somewhat competent action film that I started to enjoy it a bit more, and that is the reason I am still giving this film a positive score. But for the most part I am really disappointed in this film. It feels more like it wasted its potential than anything else. It could have been something truly engaging, but instead it feels half baked. The main character is quite interesting though and Charlize Therron does a good job with what she is given and all the fights are good.

234,M_Exchange,Good movie. GREAT spy movie.,8,19 August 2017,"Charlize Theron is outstanding in this film. She put in a lot of work offscreen to make her action scenes convincing. She pulled it off. Unlike many recent action/spy films, there were no shoddy action sequences that took me out of the movie. It elevated Theron to the status of my favorite actress-- she can do action and drama very well.When scorching hot love scenes between Theron and Sofia Boutella seem almost forgettable compared to the substantive content of the main plot, you know that director David Leitch has succeeded mightily. I have minor complaints about this film- mostly that unless you know Theron's character's actual identity, some parts of the film-- especially the ending-- might confuse you. But if I had a choice between recent lowbrow nonsense that requires zero thought during your viewing experience or afterward (""Suicide Squad,"" ""Guardians of Galaxy 2"") or this recondite film, I would choose it every. single. time.",Atomic Blonde

It was definitely better than I thought it would be! The choreography was really on point and the stunts and car crashes and what not were that of a super high budget movie so I was surprised they were able to get such a great looking film on a relatively low budget.It's told in the same sort of style as the movie ""Spy Game"" with Robert Redford where it's back and forth between her today and then flashes back to the story that she's telling. While that is a really cool look it takes extra mental effort to stick with all the details and plot turns through the back and forth.

237,yellowmarlin,"A flawless, stylish thriller",9,12 October 2018,"Well... almost flawless. For the most part, there's very little to criticise about this movie. The 80's aesthetic switches back and forth between the neon of West Berlin and the grunge of East Berlin effortlessly. The plot skips along at breakneck speed with the flash forward to a debriefing session helping to provide exposition for those struggling to keep up. The cast are uniformly excellent, split evenly into star names (Theron, McAvoy, Boutella), character actors (Goodman, Jones, Marsan) and relative unknowns. The fight scenes are equal parts stylish and punishing. A particularly brutal one in an East German stairwell and flat is followed immediately by some extraordinary camerawork during a car chase. My first, less important, more subjective complaint is that the French agent seems woefully out of her depth in the Berlin setting, and it seems implausible that so chaotic an environment would have been chosen as a junior officer's first assignment. Additionally, being used to seeing Sofia Boutella playing such strong, self-assured characters, it is grating to see her playing a passive, naive character when her usual character would be more appropriate. My second, more objective criticism, is that the movie is five minutes too long. If the movie had ended when the debrief ended, the ambiguity regarding which of the characters was Satchel, the double agent, would have made for a more powerful ending. Instead, a clumsy epilogue is tacked on to clarify everything and add in an additional twist, and it only serves to weaken an extraordinary neo-noir female-led spy thriller. Almost flawless.",Atomic Blonde

The Russians lose, the Brits get embarrassed and of course, the U.S. wins. Crap! They should've ended the movie in the interrogation room. This would've been a clear 7.5. Now it's a 6.4/10.

239,jasontheterrible,Sensational,10,30 July 2017,"Everything reviews said this was, it wasn't. The plot is not convoluted, but highly intelligent with great twists and turns. It is not feminist or political (left or right), but realistic. Hollywood race-baiting and politics had stopped me from going to the movies. Before 4x/week and now 1x/mo if that, so if I get a whiff of that stuff, I stay home. This was more like 3 days of the condor or the first Bourne film. The acting is supreme with Charlize extra spectacular. I have not seen fight scenes this well executed since Braveheart (1995). She did all the moves, and mostly without the typical editing that can make any woman a wonder.I only took a chance on this because of the 80's sound track. That was also not as represented. It is more of a Bowie-Devo sound track and almost unnoticeable, well-placed intermittently, and not overpowering.As far as it being hard to follow, it only starts out that way. The focus and clarity becomes pristine and the ending is very satisfying. I will see it again next weekend.",Atomic Blonde
240,MovieGuyFunTime,Charlese Theron is Great,5,12 March 2018,"The most impressive thing about this film is the fight scenes. I believe Theron is doing the actual fights and not a stunt double. If this is true, it is pretty damn impressive. The tone is a little odd at times being very stylish and almost Blade Runner-ish and at other times very raw and gritty. I think it should have stuck with raw and gritty as it worked best and the seeming arbitrary mix of the two styles was distracting. Ultimately the story, while acceptable, felt like it was not central enough and disappeared into the background serving only as a framework to hang all the style on to, including a soundtrack of great songs but again, didn't seem fit. Not bad. But I never felt emotionally connected with most of the characters as a consequence. Even Theron's character came off as very one-dimensional... while admittedly, that one dimension was pretty bad-ass at times, it wasn't enough to make me care as much as I wanted to. She rather feels more like an infallible do-good superhero character, written into a conventional period spy film. It also feels like just another take on the ""angry woman beats up men twice her size"" trend to appeal to the feminazis. Good movie but not great.",Atomic Blonde

Apart from the fact characters no longer speak a line, they mumble it, whisper it and unless we have subtitles we miss a big part and have to guess what was said!As for the movie, not sure there was an actual story, a lot of action by Charlize is about it, plus unnecessary sex scene by herself and some other bit part actress. Not appealing to men, at least not to me but seems women like that sort of stuff. A lot of blood ""splatter onto camera lens"", as if the camera man was actually in the scene/room or place! She is bruised and battered during the interview by her superiors, 3 days later doesn't have a mark on her! Get real! If you ask me, it was a stupid movie.

It has a little bit of everything that you would want to see in a good movie. From start to finish it has that tone that i love, the music choice is great and goes well with the movie and i love the feel of all of it. The lesbian sex scene was unnecessary and i felt a little uncomfortable but i managed because its not the first time ive seen this, especially not in a movie, if you know what i mean. James Macavoy was great and its always good to see him pop up here and there i films like this. The whole tone and theme is just like john wick so if you cant get enough of john wick then you need to watch this NOW!!!! My parents loved it and so did i.

For anyone that knows Berlin , they do a good job of hitting the trendy, alternative vibe of the period. Theron is a proven competent actor but I'm unsure she has anything deeper than what she's already shown. The problem the movie has, is that it wants to retain graphic novel punk and speed and oddity - but was weighted down by having to explain a fairly pedestrian multi-spy intrigue plot. And, there's Goodman, who is a lightweight and does not help any movie. Still it's all very stylish and Theron is extrordinarily physical - bordering on Bourne levels of violent invention The film is worth anyone's time.

246,Jim-Eadon,Most annoying movie I've seen in a long time.,3,14 November 2017,"The problem with this movie is the protagonist. She was 100% irritating. I was rooting for the bad guys in this one like never before. Most of the irritation stems from her moronic whispery voice. If this was supposed to be a sexy femme fatale imitation it failed, it was the opposite of charming, it was excruciating. Trying to give out the cool vibe with the smoking and vodka made it worse, though that would be down to the director. The second most annoying thing about the pic were the fight scenes, the most ridiculous scenes in any movie, including spoofs. The men in this movie were the worst skirmishers imaginable. A ten year old with a gun could defeat this woman. Just point and shoot. And as for hand-to-hand combat with trained professional combatants, she would have zero chance. Zero. She would have zero chance in a pub brawl. That's the weak-woman-defeats-hard-men feminist fantasy that always pisses me off when I see it on screen. The 3 points awarded are 2 for the setting, and oen for the villain, whos scenes were by far the best in the movie, though his death scene was ridiculous. I miss the 80's when they made action movies written for men, rather than in-your-face PC fantasists and propagandists. Seriously, in the real world the actress wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes against Eastern European and Russian agents, nor the villain come to that. An so the movie was doomed from the start.

A spy movie set in the late 80s, the end of the Cold War, or kind of with a woman in charge of the story and the action, and boy there is plenty of action to enjoy this movie made in the old spy style.We are presented with a typical situation during Cold War, having to recover something that is on the other side while you need to collaborate with someone. Nothing new here. What is kind of new is the style. Above all the movie reminds us of the old spy movies and specially the JAmes Bond ones. Where he, and in this case she (always with style) does whatever it takes to get to their objective while seducing someone on their way. And Charlize is brilliant in this role. After watching her in Mad Max, all action movies suit here specially if she plays a badass character like in this one. Simply fantastic.Besides how the movie is made and how good the actors are, there is another main character that gains the audience attention: the music. Pure 80s music that will take you to your childhood or to a previous life, or if you weren't alive then, you wish you had been. You won't be able to replay the songs one after another in your head or in your Spotify list.A really enjoyable movie, that now is getting some copycats. A movie that will let you forget about everything else and will make you want to travel back in time into Cold War Berlin to have some adventures of your own.

Kudos to Charlize Theron for her performance, I think she really nailed this one. The story itself is not moving as fast as all the fights but it is enough to keep you hooked. Another positive thing in my opinion is the soundtrack. If you like 80's music, you are definitely going to enjoy this film.

I also liked Theron and McAvoy and think they did a good job portraying their roles. The action sequences are nice to watch and for the most part very well done but still something holds me back to give this movie a higher rating. I found it a little hard to bond with the characters. Maybe that's why I couldn't enjoy the movie as much as I wanted to but that's not the fault of the actors more so of the script I think.
So I would say it's a movie you can watch if your looking for a easy-to-watch-nice-to-look-at movie with some good action and a badass female main character.",Atomic Blonde
255,jeroen-106,Uneven,5,5 March 2018,"Uneven film with confusing direction. Style over substance, not quite knowing what it tries to be about. The Cold War 80s nostalgia is too obvious, too much on-the-nose. A film I couldn't decide to love or hate, but ended up being disappointed with. It fails at being a Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy style film, Jason Bourne, or a feminine John Wick movie. If only it was clear what this was supposed to be.Half way the film's screen time we are presented with an absolutely brilliantly choreographed fighting long-take scene that despite being so great eventually feels totally out of place with the rest of the film, as if it were a technical exercise instead being part of a broader cinematographic vision. Which is very frustrating as a viewer: why deliver something so great that is so inconsistent with the rest of the film? One thing is sure: Charlize Theron is an extremely talented physical actor. She's totally badass. Phenomenal.",Atomic Blonde
256,caramia2002,Don't Make My Mistake...Alcohol/Tobacco Commercial,1,25 March 2018,"But luckily I didn't waste much time on it. I won't watch obvious tobacco/alcohol funded movies. Period. This one was easy to turn off. Main Problems: It started with the clip of Reagan acting like he was responsible for the Berlin Wall coming down. He had ZERO to do with that, other than make sure to film that clip when he knew time was up for the Soviets. Plot, character, and WHY?: This plot was for grade schoolers. No mystery, nothing but spoon fed nothing new. Why would Charlieze Theron even do this movie? Must have been some good money! Bigger mystery is why she produced it. For the credit? Ego? She worked so hard to get a role like in Monster, for which she won an Oscar, so did this movie, which, btw, is not feminist, by any stretch. Her character, what there is of it, was bland, one dimensional, and unrealistic. This movie is just lots of tropes and stereotypes and not a good representation of its time period. Have we not come any farther than this?Silliness: Theron's character walked away from a very nasty car crash because she grabbed the seat belt just in time. What a concept! I think I shall quit wearing that perky thing and just grab it when I need to. Graphics Issues: There are some obvious graphics issues early on. CGI people in non-human positions, obvious edit mistakes, etc. If you are going to do an action movie, at least do the best CGI and editing that you can. NO excuse for this, it is an ACTION movie.Soundtrack: The 80's playlist is mostly silly pop. The only song I heard with any creds is Bowie, at least the first Bowie, as I heard there is more than one Bowie song, although I think it was a remix. Maybe the playlist got better, but I seriously doubt it. I don't understand the raves over it. If you think this is good retro music, either you weren't there, or MTV was your first memory. ""99 luftballons""? Really?Actual 80's/90s action movies: While there were some regrettable action movies, of course, there were many which pushed the envelope of action, stunts, and film in general. The Matrix? Total Recall? Terminator? I would even watch Jupiter Ascending 10 times, rather than this mess. Plus the wit in Atomic Blonde is so buried that it is gone. These movies have to laugh at themselves. When they stop, we are all doomed. Comics as film: DUH, this trend of comic book based movies has been mostly a failure. If you adapt a book, you have to go from 'more' in the book to 'less' as a screenplay. With a comic book, you start with 'less', so where can you go? This movie is a great example. I can't believe I gave in and tried to watch this...I won't be making the same mistake again for quite some time...",Atomic Blonde
257,a_sad_cow,Fun and well paced,8,6 August 2017,"Some minor plot holes, but what really shines through is a truly fantastic performance from Charlize Theron. We chose this movie without knowing the synopsis purely because she did an awesome job in Aeon Flux and Mad Max. This was even better. I was even going to compare her moves to the outstanding work Keanu Reeves has done with John Wick, only to see in the trivia here that she did train with him. Charlize Theron is the greatest female action star we have seen to date. Rather than break up the pace with bad jokes, they interjected an outstanding retro soundtrack that is highly likely to be true to Berlin in 1989. I'm sure they took some historic liberties, but largely this was very well done. Well cut, well directed, well acted, definitely chasing related works for more of the same.",Atomic Blonde
258,jcallows,it dragged,6,4 December 2017,"The style and action will remind you of John Wick. This should come as no surprise as both this film and John Wick were directed by the same guy, David Leitch, a stuntman turned director. Kinda cheapens the title of director, doesn't it?Actually, Leitch is a capable director and better than a few others out there. This former stuntman's specialty is, of course, action. It's the action that highlighted Atomic Blonde. Unfortunately, everything else was just filler.Despite some cool, although unrealistic, action sequences, this film dragged. The plot seemed simple yet difficult to follow. Perhaps they were trying to follow the book but some of it could've been cut out. All I got was our protagonist had to retrieve a stolen NOC, er, I mean, secret agents list before it became public. And there was this whole interrogation bit to sort of narrate the film and some mumbo jumbo about a double crossing. But none of this mattered and should've been left out for pacing. This 2-hour film could've benefited greatly from a nice trimming of about 30 minutes. To be honest, after a dull first 15 or so minutes, I simply fast forwarded to the action scenes, including the lesbian scenes, and I suggest you do the same. You won't miss anything and you'd greatly enhance your viewing experience.",Atomic Blonde
259,mcleanmuir,Not a blockbuster but one of those films that are worth a look when nothing else is on. I would not pay to see it.,6,24 May 2018,I felt that the overkill soundtrack spoilt the film to a certain degree. Plenty of action.,Atomic Blonde
260,slicedbread117,Go Blonde or Go Home,7,16 August 2017,"There was some talk a while back about changing the iconic 'James Bond' franchise to instead star a female lead, which made many fans of that franchise (myself included) pretty disgruntled. I thought, ""why can't Hollywood just put together an original, bad-ass female-lead action film to stand on its own name""? Well, besides some minor setbacks here and there, Atomic Blonde captured that thought, and better than expected.Though not the strongest pillar of the film, I like to start most reviews discussing the narrative. Atomic Blonde's story is pretty straightforward; MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is tasked with going to 1980's Berlin in the midst of the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a vital list of information. The majority of the film is set as a flashback, with previous events being replayed through the memory of Lorraine, a safe play to develop an action-spy-thriller story, but one that takes a little too much time to get into, leaving the pacing a shade off. There's not a whole lot of deep character development to leave you feeling connected with any characters, which was a little disappointing, but at least the movie keeps its focus solely on Lorraine throughout. While a little too generic and slow at first, to my surprising delight, the narrative really picks up in the third act, with a couple twists and turns that left me intrigued and excited. The immediate story presented won't leave you in shock and awe, but it's enough to help support the true star of the film, the action.Atomic Blonde's action sequences are the bread and butter of the film, and rightfully so. The film is highly stylized and brimming with fantastic action. There's deliciously violent and bloody scenes of combat, and some outstanding fight-choreography, all backed by the use of practical effects and stunt work, which is always appreciated in action films to provide a grittier, more realistic feel. There is just enough slo-mo to hit that sweet spot, and the film's score is packed with hit 80's music that helps create that fun, stylized tone. Simply said, the action gets down to business, thriving on intensity and wonderfully entertaining hand-to-hand combat, the highlight of the movie.Charlize Theron is cementing herself as a legitimate female action star. Her roles in films like Fate of the Furious, Mad Max, and even The Italian Job have helped paved the way for a role such as this; a bad-ass, enticing female-driven action character who isn't muddled down by stereotypes or low quality action. Theron really stands out in the lead role and even though, as previously mentioned, her character wasn't as developed through more background as I'd hoped, she is able to capture the demeanor of a great action star and make the lead role very entertaining.The supporting cast was good enough. James McAvoy is always a delight to watch and did quite well in this film and some other larger names such as John Goodman and Toby Jones helped give a solid set of secondary characters to keep the talent level on par with Theron's. There's basically zero character development for these characters either, but with the main story set up as a flashback and the focus on Theron, it wasn't too expected.James Bond might not ever get a female in the lead role, and you know what, that's a blessing to us movie goers. For as long as we have some Hollywood talent that is willing to get original (yes this film is based of a series of novels but I'm talking reboots, etc.), we'll have surprisingly sweet outings like this flick. Sure it's not perfect by any stretch but with intense, stylized high-octane action and an excellent performance from Charlize Theron, Atomic Blonde proves that a female-lead action movie can not only work, but that it can thrive.7.5/10",Atomic Blonde

The Wick films are about a 7 out of 10 for me so I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but I was hoping for some semblance of a plot. For the first 45 minutes I had absolutely no idea what was going on. There was just a succession of scenes, each about 30 seconds long and none of them seemed to be connected. Characters just kept going to places, talking for a bit and then going somewhere else and doing it again. I haven't struggled to stay awake during a film so much since I saw Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.Plus points - the soundtrack is brilliant. Charlize Theron is decent too and is quite believable in the fight scenes which are well choreographed. And there is a 20 minute sequence about an hour in when Theron is trying to save another character from a bunch of assassins. That was the best part. But everything else was just impossible to follow. I actually don't know what the plot was, other than it involved everyone looking for some sort of ""list"". I don't even know if it was even explained what the list was! This was such a big disappointment because it had the potential to be great. But it really wasn't at all.",Atomic Blonde
266,scottingram,Atomic Blonde Film Review,8,15 August 2017,"The new action spy thriller film Atomic Blonde starring Charlize Theron, James McAvoy, John Goodman, Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, Sofia Boutella. In Atomic Blonde Oscar® winner Charlize Theron explodes into summer in Atomic Blonde, a breakneck action-thriller that follows MI6's most lethal assassin through a ticking time bomb of a city simmering with revolution and double-crossing hives of traitors in Berlin the capital of Germany in 1989. The crown jewel of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service, Agent Lorraine Broughton (South African actress Charlize Theron - The Devil's Advocate, Mad Max: Fury Road) is equal parts spycraft, sensuality and savagery, willing to deploy any of her skills to stay alive on her impossible mission. Sent alone into Berlin to deliver a priceless dossier out of the destabilized city, she partners with embedded station chief David Percival (Scottish actor James McAvoy - Welcome To The Punch, Filth and who use to be married to English actress Anne-Marie Duff who met and crossed paths when they both starred in the UK TV Series Shameless back in 2004 but they both divorced each other last year meaning they are not together anymore) to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies. Atomic Blonde is a blistering blend of sleek action, gritty sexuality, and dazzling style.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Atomic Blonde includes English actor Eddie Marsan (The World's End, Mission: Impossible 3) as Spyglass, American actor John Goodman (The Flintstones film from 1994, Patriots Day) as Emmett Kurzfeld, English actor Toby Jones (The Hunger Games films, Captain America films) as Eric Gray, Algerian actress Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Star Trek Beyond) as Delphine Lasalle, Swedish actor Bill Skarsgård (Allegiant, Anna Karenina 2012) as Merkel, English actor James Faulkner (Bridget Jones films, Hit-man) as Chief 'C', Danish actor Roland Møller (Undercover, Land Of Mine) as Alkesander Bremovych, Sam Hargrave (Acts Of Violence, Once Fallen) as James Gasciogne and Icelandic actor Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson (TV Series Game Of Thrones and The Last Kingdom) as Yuri Bakhtin.Filming locations in Atomic Blonde include cities, places, countries like Berlin the capital of Germany, London the capital of England, Brandenburg, Germany, Budapest the capital of Hungary.Overall Atomic Blonde is a good action spy thriller film filled with action, spies, snipers, guns, weapons, gory violence, shooting, chases on foot and in vehicles like cars, fight scenes, on the edge of your seat stuff, swearing, catchy 80's music, people drinking, smoking, taking drugs, tongue and cheek stuff, some funny moments, fast and furious stuff, interrogations, nightclubs, dangerous criminals, foreign languages being spoken mainly German, explosions, things getting wrecked, destroyed, blown up, weird looking characters, outrageous clothes and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Atomic Blonde an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Atomic Blonde is worth seeing if you like action spy thriller films like the Mission: Impossible films, The Bourne films, Spy, Taken films, Jack Ryan films, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., the James Bond films, Survivor, Ronin, Bullitt, Eraser, True Lies, Enemy Of The State, Hit-man films, Red films, John Wick films, Haywire, Kingsman: The Secret Service, Our Kind Of Traitor amongst others.So if you get the chance to see Atomic Blonde in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Atomic Blonde

Soldiers trade in uniforms for wires, and ammunition for information. When terrorism hides, spies dance. Loraine waltzes cautiously through a town split by an iron divide. She was sent to extract hard data, but then again maybe she wanted to come here all along.Loraine has a kiss of death and many suitors. Being a maiden of her own will, she protests aggressively and has the skills to resist. High heels become lethal in her palms, and lipstick doubles as urban camouflage. She is a student of her environment and commissions the most unlikely weapons.Her partner, David, passes from being reluctant to being obstructive. She acknowledges his handsome operations, but barks at his careful composure. A tedious game of cat and cat ensues, and claw marks rip into each other's confident facades.Espionage unfolds like a cracking ice sheet on a pond. Very slow all the way until the critical moment, then all the weak points sojourn to the barrier's demise. Loraine watches this deterioration, sunk at the bottom of the pond. She is in the information business, and her competitors have caught all the gossip. Her battered bones attest to brutality of discovering intel a moment too late. In this foreign pool of entropy, she entwines herself with Delphine, a poet turned informant. Delphine speaks in prose, but observes in stanzas. Rarely enthused, Loraine is tackled by this woman's fearless ignorance. They find themselves wrapped in a mortal coil, a professional love with ulterior motives. Even the purest connection must be scrutinized when your head contains lethal secrets.Privileged knowledge breeds death. ""Top secret"" folders are the plagues of elitism. Chairmen look for red flags, but their agents have painted their entire existence red. Uncertainty is a government's biggest fear, and their employees carry out terrorism in the name of obscurity.",Atomic Blonde

270,SweetWilliam63,Atomic Bomb,5,19 September 2018,"I had a hard time trying to figure out why I didn't like this movie. Yes, it has a confusing plot but so did the first 'Mission Impossible' and two of the four Bourne movies. The fight scenes are spectacular, realistic and gritty. (Even better then the Bourne movies) The cast is cool. I guess I didn't buy Theron as a British special agent. It didn't help that her British accent was hit and miss (mostly miss). Or that her obvious beauty and high end style is almost never used as an asset to her job as a spy. Yes, sometimes you have to kick a bunch of ass but also, if you look like Charleze Theron, sometimes you can just walk into the room and say ""Hello!"". I also thought it was strange that the Russians didn't have any kick ass female agents. In the end it seemed like a big slug fest to demonstrate that a women could carry an action movie. Except we already knew that. Didn't we? Emily Blunt in 'Edge of Tomorrow', Chloe Moritz in 'Kick Ass 2', Uma Thurman in 'Kill Bill 1 & 2' and Halle Berry in 'Catwoman'. Okay, just kidding about the last one. Look, I get it. I'm ""woke"" as the kiddos like to say. Action heroes are male because guys go to action movies and it's more relatable. Blah, blah,blah.

Those scenes are sadly reminiscent of Angelina Jolie's ""Hey fellas, look at these cheekbones"" scenes in the incredibly dull The Tourist. James McAvoy is splendidly seedy as her British contact.

That I did not really mind but the big question is how Spyglass was able to make up the list of double- agents.... The other big flaw in this movie were the fighting-scenes. Theron is being hit on and on but is still able to kill her enemies. Ever seen a boxing-match? One good blow and a well-trained boxer goes down but not Charlize! She really is the true wonder woman in this movie. Also some of the opponents are shot and/or stabbed but are able to keep on fighting. Absolutely overdone and absolutely unbelievable. Also the lesbian scene, which apparently is a wonderful scene for a lot of people, did not contribute to increase the value of reality.

274,Toph-22,Convincingly good fight scenes,8,24 October 2021,"'Atomic Blonde' is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and it just doesn't lose its impact. When I saw the movie for the first time I had no expectations and I was more than convinced. Since then it is one of my favorite movies and that although it is certainly not a masterpiece.In the intro, you already get a foretaste of the direction the movie is going to take, which is then consistently followed through. The movie doesn't lose its pace over the entire runtime. There is no real hole.The entire atmosphere feels incredibly authentic. The whole thing is underpinned by a really stylish, cool and coherent soundtrack, which strongly underpins the images shown.The only point of criticism is the plot. It seems a bit confused and essentially serves to explain why a character gets from A to B. The story isn't really complicated, but you still think to yourself at some points, just accept it and don't question it.But you can turn a blind eye to that, because the actual plot is in the background for me here. The overall look and feel paired with the really strong fight choreography let you quickly overlook it.And that brings us to the crucial point. The movie has incredibly strong fight scenes. The camera is close up throughout and all the fights look handmade. That's what I want to see and not cut-up action where you can't see anything or which is just bristling with GCI. Some action movies can take a leaf out of this book. Showing and not hinting is the motto here. One of the best scenes of the whole movie is a several minutes long plan sequence in a house. I find this impressive every time. In these moments, the movie reminds me of a reduced, well dosed John Wick, only the setting and the framework story appeals more to me personally.All in all, 'Atomic Blonde' is a solid agent thriller, which can more than convince with its atmosphere, look and fight scenes. In terms of plot, familiar structures, motifs and sequences are used. If you can overlook that, then you can really have fun with the movie.",Atomic Blonde

276,rnixon1974,Atomic Blonde could have been much better,4,27 October 2017,"I have seen a few action movies with a female protagonist. Going back to 1986's Aliens. The original La Femme Nikita. Terminator 2. Many Michelle Yeoh flicks (she has done better than Crouching Tiger in her career; Supercop and Wing Chun, for example). The Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis. Kill Bill. Salt, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Bone Collector with Angelina Jolie.Atomic Blonde does not compare with these films for a few reasons, but I think the primary reason is Ms. Theron.She can act, as seen in Monster from 2003. In that very jarring movie, she physically transformed herself into Aileen Wournos, and convincingly portrayed the woman, as she was depicted in the news, a feat most actresses could not have accomplished.In Atomic Blonde, Lorraine goes through Berlin like General Grant through Richmond, maiming and killing every bad guy in her path. She is that determined, that smart, that tough, that ruthless. Seeing this, about halfway through this film (which, as another reviewer mentioned, must have been sponsored by Marlboro) I realized that Lorraine could not, and would not be allowed to fail. Of course, the character is giving her account in her debrief after the events, so the audience knows her fate, in any case. I'll call it the Parker Lewis effect, for lack of a better term: Lorraine Can't Lose. In many films, the audience can see early on that the protagonist is going to prevail, and this fact does not render the movie unenjoyable. Here, it causes me to wish that the director would get on with it (the film is about 20 minutes too long, and slows to a crawl in more than a few places), as I cared very little what happened to the list of spies, or to Lorraine.Anne Parillaud, Linda Hamilton, Michelle Yeoh, Uma Thurman and Angelina, in the movies I mentioned earlier, gave much stronger, and sometimes nuanced, performances. Theron in this gives the audience very little except steely-eyed, unrelenting mayhem. She has ice water (and Stoli) in her veins, and it does not work well here.One comparison to show the lack of much of anything from Theron (including a sense of humor; I do NOT find her funny, in this or any other movie in which I have seen her). When Salt's husband is killed in that film, Angelina Jolie reacts with palpable grief. As she moves through the White House in the finale, her righteous, cathartic anger comes across very effectively. In Atomic Blonde's conclusion, Lorraine's countenance is a near-still mask of arrogance laced with no small amount of contempt. I have a feeling Theron was trying to show confidence, but her delivery was wide of the mark. Possibly, she may not be able to discern the difference between confidence and arrogance. Many people in Hollywood apparently cannot, in front of or behind the camera. See this on cable, if you feel the need to see it at all. As an aside, this film was, before its release this year, apparently on the shelf for a couple of years after it was completed. After watching it, would that the studio had left it there.There are plenty of decent action films that feature female leads. Don't spend money, or two hours, on this extended cigarette commercial.",Atomic Blonde

And then Atomic Blonde plays some of my favorite 80's tunes throughout. What's a boy to do? It felt like I was watching a music video the whole time. By that I mean I was tapping my toes, but not really connecting with the story.If I thought Emma Watson looked bored in The Circle earlier this year, Charlize Theron was absolutely catatonic in this one. Maybe she was just trying to focus on her English accent, something I've never bought from her in any of her films.All too often she is attacked by two guys at once, but one of them is essentially just waiting his turn to get beaten up, not actually engaging. They also attempt to do the stitched editing a la Birdman during these scenes, but fail miserably. The cuts are so noticeable that I'm left wondering why they were even trying to disguise them. Would it really detract from the scene to cut away to a different angle or take? One attempt is a transition from an exterior shot to an interior, but someone forgot to tell the hairdresser. Much like plot holes in other movies, you're just creating your own inconsistencies. Stop outsmarting yourself!James McAvoy of course kills it in his seedy supporting role, but I'm impressed yet again by Sofia Boutella. While she wasn't given a lot to do as the titular character in The Mummy, she still brought what she could to that role. She's given much more to work with in this movie, and ends up out-performing the lead. I hope her opportunities keep coming.A little Jane Bond, a little Joan Wick, but there's nothing really original here. Once again it's the overall vibe and the performances by the supporting cast that make the final score higher than it would have been otherwise.

Am I the only one who is just tired of these movies. I mean, come on.In this movie, Charlize Theron plays a super spy hired to recover a list of CIA under cover agents and ops. Isn't it interesting that the CIA maintains a list of all agents and ongoing operations in one place that can be stolen? While trying to track down the list, she comes across heavily armed bad guys who try to beat her up, but she uses her superior skills to beat them all up. The most lethal weapon she carried was a pencil eraser.Does she recover the list or does it fall into the hands of terrorists or bad guys? Who really cares?",Atomic Blonde
281,northernpaladin,Utter Hogwash,3,6 July 2019,"Why anybody got involved in this affair I have no idea. The plot is both incomprehensible and predictable showing all the bad tropes of cold war set spy movies; the double agent who is revealed to be a triple agent, the doomed love affair (a bit more 'edgy' because it's lesbian), the public school MI6 bosses, the gruff cynical CIA boss, the burnt out agent, the smarmy KGB handler and the awful KGB goons. Everything stinks about this film and not one actor does anything other than walk through it and take their money.

282,sampah70,Better than my expectation,8,10 November 2017,"This movie is based on graphics novel, and like any other movie based on comic, I expected it to be uh- surprise- comical (Sin City, Dredd, Aeon Flux etc.). Turned out the action is even more realistic than Sin City, Kill-Bill or Dredd (though still less than Bournes or The Raids, for sure). When I saw a skinny, bruises Theronz, I immediately get images of dedicated actress like Sigurney Weaver (Aliens 2) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2) who worked out rigorously for their movie sequel they turned muscular, manly and physically strong, although again, not to that extent, it's clear that Theronz also has got quite a training and exercise for this movie.Actingwise is as good as you can expect from recognized Hollywood stars. I'm not a fan of over-acting -ish of Mc Avoy, but in this movie he was also quite good regarding to his character (David Percive). Sofia Boutella (Delphine Lasalle) was a bit out, but still acceptable.Story, with a bunch of strange names with their different interests and goal introduced, it's like the movie expecting that you've already known them (or read the comics). This is the area when you might get lost in ambiguity, maybe second viewing (or subtitle if you into it) will help. Some clichés here and there, but not a stupid ones, or brain insulted coincidences. Actually taken for granted for an adult (not a kid/teenager) materials, as long as director/script writer didn't make sloppy additions, which usually is stupid.The big blooper actually is the list itself, how can it be made up in the first place? Well- maybe director of M16 and KGB had a crush with their shared 1st cousin-in-law who wrote it for fun.The main character (Lorraine Broughton) actually has a clear ultimate goal: to get the list of enemy (read: soviet/east-Germany) spies.The movie started with the scene of how her college agent (also presumed as her lover): Gascoigne, who had the list of double agents, was killed by Alex Bremovych, a Russian arms dealers/KGB Intel who plan to sell that list to the highest bidder. In particular, included that list, is the real identity of most wanted double agent: Satchel, who has leaked intelligence to Soviets for years.She then sent to Berlin to get the list and kill Satchel, with the help of British agent in Berlin: David Percival. She was targeted to be killed as soon as she arrived, of course. Along the way she make a romantic (lesbian) relationship with naive French agents: Delphi Lasalle, also unexpected dangerous errand which nearly cost her life: she has to deliver a Stasi officer with photographic memory to the west, code-name Spyglass, he's actually the original source of the list. Found out later that David is a corrupt agent and suspected as the main antagonist: Satchel. He planned Spyglass extraction, but actually tipped it off to KGB, when Lorraine come-up with improv plan preventing KGB to kill Spyglass, he shot Spyglass himself. He also killed Lasalle, but failed to destroy the hard evidence: photos taken by Lasalle about his betrayal (the evident ultimately get into Lorraine hands).It was not her original intent to screw up British' Berlin operative network under David control. This movie mostly is about Lorraine reporting/answer the questioning about her mission to Berlin.A solid 7/10. +1 for being unexpectedly good/enjoyable.",Atomic Blonde

A bad spy movie is too cryptic or overstretched, like this one. Although I liked the pace and the flow of the action, I felt let down by the lack of character definition. At the end of the show, you are left empty, with little clue of what each character was made of in terms of personal profile or motivation.

284,regula1,Comparing this to John Wick sells Atomic Blonde Way Short,9,27 July 2017,"David Leitch co-directed John Wick before directing Atomic Blonde, and based on the trailers that were released there was a definite comparison in terms of the action scenes.I love John Wick, it's action scenes are superb and the quality of the film overall is excellent. However, if John Wick is a perfect solo violin performance, Atomic Blonde is that solo violin with a perfect concerto on top.Seriously, aside from the obviously great action scenes, which just goes to show how it's done in terms of quality over cheap thrills, Atomic Blonde improves the one thing that holds John Wick back: its plot.Let's face it: for all of John Wick's technical greatness, the plot was a little shallow at times. Not so for Atomic Blonde, which populates the screen with rich and layered characters even beyond Charlize Theron and James McAvoy's awesome performances. I would single out Sofia Boutella, who if you were let down by her turn as the latest Mummy, will be genuinely surprised at how compelling she can be as an actress.The plot, in short, revolves around spy craft in Cold War Berlin, with the events framed in the week before the Berlin Wall was opened. A crucial bit of information has fallen into unwanted hands, information that would be devastating if it got out, and Theron's character Lorraine is sent in to retrieve it by any means necessary.However, not all is as it seems, and that is as far as this summary will go, because the previews for Atomic Blonde gave very little indication as to what direction the plot would go, instead banking on the awesome action scenes. I'll admit, I went into this expecting somewhat shallow plot but great action, and I was better off for it and you will be too.Seriously, AVOID SPOILERS before seeing this film, you will be rewarded.If there are any faults to this film, I would have to point to the soundtrack, for while it is a great collection of '80s era songs, it almost goes into Suicide Squad-levels of overboard, at one point a new song is played every couple of minutes. Most of the times it worked, but it toed the line in spots.Nevertheless, in the category of movies that blew my mind, just for surpassed expectations, this film rockets to the top of the list.",Atomic Blonde

287,TheJediWay9,"Despite Some Narrative Flaws & Technical Issues ""Atomic Blonde"" Is An Enjoyable Thriller",8,28 June 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"" is based on a graphic novel and in ""Atomic Blonde"" MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is sent on a mission with her contact David Percival (James McAvoy) in Berlin to recover a list of double agents that are defecting to West Berlin during the height of the Cold War. I'm gonna cut right to the chase. The performances in this film are really good. Ever since ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" I have been on the Charlize train. Everything before that was really hit or miss with me for her, but she has really come into her own and delivers a great performance. She looks physically fit, she nails the British accent, and conveys emotions very well. James McAvoy does not need to be talked about. He is a great actor and delivers yet another great performance. One that surprised me was Sofia Boutella. I have been wanting to see what she is capable of ever since I saw her in ""Kingsman,"" and everything she has been in she has impressed me, and this is not different. Her role in this is a little smaller than her previous roles, but even if she isn't amazing or great, she's still fine and I enjoy watching her performances. The action sequences in this film are really great as well. They are violent, they are brutal, they are bloody. Watching them is almost like watching a bare-knuckled boxing match, with one boxer having brass knuckles to knock the other one out. The scenes are choreographed very well, which makes sense since the director used to be a stunt coordinator, and the stunts that result are really cool. One thing that impressed me with the action sequences was the very minimal to no use of a musical score. I'm not sure if that was on purpose. To me, it added a sense of realism to the scenes. There is also an action scene towards the end of the film that is filmed to look like one take, and it is noticeable right away, but halfway through the scene you are just in awe that the camera hasn't cut back to anything else yet. The camera-work in this scene is top notch, and throughout the entire movie for that matter, and when this scene reaches the halfway point to see just how this one take is shot and what exactly is being shot. It is a really impressive scene and I would say that this scene lasts for about seven to eight minutes. You almost believe that the camera isn't going to cut to anything for the rest of the movie. The rest of the camera-work is spot on throughout the rest of the movie. What made me happy was that there was no ""shady cam"" in these action sequences. This is a far superior story than I was expecting. The tone of the movie is very dark and brutal, and the movie conveys perfectly. There is almost no humor in the film, and I think if that were added it would have felt out of place. The story really suit the tone the director was going for and was enjoyable enough. I really like the way the story is conveyed in this film, told as a flashback narrative, which added a deeper layer of storytelling to the movie. However, that story feels very unoriginal. This is a plot I've seen done to death so many times already. The story also tries to do too much towards the end. It throws plot twist after plot twist at you and I didn't buy any of it. It became too predictable towards the end. You knew who was gonna be who, and when people in the theater are turning to the person next to them saying ""see I told you,"" that's a problem. And is just me or is the editing in some scenes really shotty? It could be because I saw this at a press screening a month before release and the creative team is still working on technical issues but there were two or three scenes where technical issues sprung up, one of which was noticeable. This scene involves characters talking but their lips aren't moving. Was ADR edited into the movie? It seemed a bit odd to me. And when we see characters talking and they are shot from the side, you can tell that their lips aren't moving. The characters in this movie feel very non-existent. They are not fleshed out at all. I could not tell you a damn thing about any of these characters other than the fact that they are spies. Despite some narrative flaws and technical issues, ""Atomic Blonde"" was still an enjoyable enough movie. The action, performances, camera-work, directing, violence all really worked. I feel like this is a film that audiences and critics will be divided on. I am going to give ""Atomic Blonde"" a B.Check out my video review of ""Atomic Blonde"" here on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4oNmIqEMes",Atomic Blonde

So that was all great, the story was fine, the cinematography worked, I liked most aspects of this that could be mentioned.Except the CIA glorification.

292,fbmike,Cigarettes and not much more.,2,17 October 2017,"Who still thinks smoking cigarettes looks cool? Now it just looks weird. Hollywood sure still does and smoking in movies/TV is as prevalent now as it ever was (or even more so). The cigarette companies can't make TV commercials anymore but they don't need to when they have Hollywood to do it for them. Anyone who doesn't think the tobacco giants are paying big bucks to Hollywood is nuts. Dunno when Hollywood is going to get in sync with what's really going on around it. Now on to this movie if I can see through all the cigarette smoke. Charlize really missed the mark on trying too hard to be cool in this flick. If this is what feminism is, I'll walk to the other side of the street when one walks by. She just comes across as typical of Hollywood arrogant and not at all likable. I like her in some movies but not in this one. Her beating up McAvoy and sitting on him while he is talking with a cigarette hanging out his mouth for a minute or two, and then taking the cig out of his mouth to take a cool hit just about sums up this movie. Whatever message Hollywood and Charlize were trying to project in this movie was sure lost on me. Movie was just boring to me in spite of the not believable fight scenes by a skinny blonde chick. ""Yeah right"" was all I could come up each time she kicked someone's butt. Just glad I don't see as many disgusting cigarettes smokers as I used to. Lots in Hollywood though.",Atomic Blonde
293,iamjacksmoviechannel,Bisexual Wonder Woman,7,24 July 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"", or as it may come to be known as ""Bisexual Wonder Woman"", is a pretty good bookend to a lot of the bigger action movies this summer. Again we have some stellar action sequences accompanied with an awesome soundtrack. Charlize Theron plays an MI-6 agent sent to Berlin on the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall to work with the Station Chief (James McAvoy) there to figure out who killed one of their own and recover a list of undercover agents. This is the action film Theron deserves. A fantastic action actress in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", she again shows there are few situations where she doesn't seem like one cool customer totally in charge and living by her own rules. She's like a female James Bond combined with the physicality of a Jason Bourne combined with one of those French chicks from ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" because she goes lesbian on Sofia Boutella in a couple scenes here. But yeah, the movie was directed by David Leitch, who was one half of the directing team behind ""John Wick."" He's also directing the sequel to Deadpool, which I like because you can see a director whose good at adding levity to dark tones. The backdrop here is pretty clear and sets the mood perfectly. Basically Berlin in the 80's is a cold hell hole, accompanied by neon interior bars and dark alleys and some ugly dark green lighting thrown in there too. It's a perfect place for a spy thriller and Leitch does an admirable job of making sure things stay dark while throwing in some comic moments, a lot of which come from the musical choices themselves. Another summer flick with a great soundtrack guys.There's nothing better than when he and Theron join forces though. The gun battles and fights are incredible; the things she does with an extension cord or the heel of her shoe are awesome. Leitch for the most part stays away from camera tricks and instead opts for tracking shots that perfectly keep focus on the action. He succumbs to slo-mo in the end fight but up until then, there's really no one better at filming fights than the ""John Wick"" guys. About the only thing wrong with the movie other than slo-mo is the plotting. The cliché of recovering an agent list didn't really bother me but what did is that there seems like a lot going on with the wall coming down, side characters, and whose setting up who and for what reason. Don't go in expecting to follow much. But the stars here are Theron and Leitch, who together are nothing short of dynamic and exhilarating. The rest of the cast, which has Toby Jones and John Goodman in addition to McAvoy, are fine but pale in comparison. This is just a cool action flick. So I go 7 out of 10.

The 80s disco dance tune soundtrack never manages to congeal this film into narrative totality or wholeness. Much impressive and fine action is on display, but edited with frosty detachment verging on disinterest...and an extra camera angle or two thrown in to foment the violence would better engage viewers. Segments of good narrative try to take flight here, but never achieve altitude. The viewer tries to bond with Theron's strong lead character but the presumptuous production values, pacing, cutting style and vague borrowings from other genres (Bond, Bourne, Le Carre epics,, Eastwood, ""The Departed"") keep this film from ever becoming its own thing.

298,tyingling7766,"The Good, the Bad, the Ugly: Atomic Blonde",7,20 August 2017,"First off, let me say I have not read the source material for Atomic Blonde. This is actually one of few comic movies I have not read. I stopped reading comics in about 2005, with exception to a few choice titles, and I didn't even know this was a comic. So, I am basing this review solely off the movie.Synopsis: Sensual and savage, Lorraine Broughton is the most elite spy in MI6, an agent who's willing to use all of her lethal skills to stay alive during an impossible mission. With the Berlin Wall about to fall, she travels into the heart of the city to retrieve a priceless dossier and take down a ruthless espionage ring. Once there, she teams up with an embedded station chief to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies. Starring: Charlize Theron, James McAvoy Director: David LeitchThe Ugly: Where have we seen the storyline of a list of agents being sought after? Oh yeah, almost every spy movie known to man. They have to stop using that for spy movie plots. Sorry, that's what needs to stop. Been happening for years.The Bad: Well, I'm not saying this is a bad scene by any means what- so-ever. The scene is a complete stylistic dream. If you have seen the movie then you know the seven minute non-cut scene I am referring to. The problem with the scene is the ""shaky-cam."" You have to remember, Mr. Leitch is one half of the directors of the first John Wick. Shaky-cam has become so synonymous with action movies that it's become void. The ""shaky-cam"" should not have been used for this part. It only hurt the movie.The Good: One would want to say the music. I'm not going to say the music. The music was awesome. I'm going to mention that the acting was on point here. John Goodman, even though he hardly did anything here, shines once more. But you want to know something? That even isn't the best part. The next thing I'm going to mention is the action (minus the shaky-cam) was believable. The apartment fight scene was the best one. Still not the best part. I bet you're wondering what could be the best part. That being the style and attention to detail of the movie. Mr. Leitch's vision with the movie was amazing. I may have only been six at the time of the setting of the movie, but this made me want to go back to that time. Just amazing.Final Thoughts: I'm not going to tell you to go see this movie for the lack of clothing Miss Theron wears throughout the movie, but you should go see it for the points in ""the good."" It would be worth it.Rating: 7 out of 10",Atomic Blonde
299,nandidot,Mad Fun Powered by a Kickass Performance by Charlize Theron,8,29 July 2017,"Atomic Blonde is a spirited spy thriller powered by an incredibly badass performance by Charlize Theron. I was intrigued by the trailers but also feared that this could go horribly wrong. Fortunately, it doesn't. Yay! The movie is part John Wick, part Bourne, and all parts rollicking fun!Based on a graphic novel this is a colorful and in your face movie that's hardly subtle. But subtlety be damned because when such a brilliant cast is having as much fun on screen as you are watching them you care very little about anything else.Lorraine Broughton, played by Charlize Theron, is an MI6 agent sent to Berlin during the Cold War to find a list of double agents in the field. Never one to shy away from using her talents to complete a mission, Lorraine utilizes everything at her disposal. This includes her literally killer instincts, extreme hand-to-hand combat skills, her sensuality, and anything else that her sharp mind can come up with.Lorraine is joined on this mad journey by David Percival (a wonderful James McAvoy). Together they wreck havoc and it's so entertaining to watch. The action is non stop and awesome in every sense of the word. There's a particularly delicious sequence on a staircase that had me and much of the audience in stitches. David Leitch has put together a firecracker of a film. The plot has its share of flaws and holes but if you don't nitpick at the details you can overlook much of the bad and enjoy the good.And the good is great. Charlize Theron's performance in particular. She's fully immersed in the kickass-ery of it all and doesn't hold back. What a joy it is to watch her in action movies like Mad Max: Fury Road, The Fate of the Furious, and now Atomic Blonde where she's a shining star. You keep doing what you're doing, Ms. Theron.

It's kind of a chick John Wick with a rad soundtrack and cool attire.Essentially, Charlize Theron is an MI6 agent in the Eastern Block in 1989 and James McAvoy is her handler. In you've seen any episode of MacGyver or any spy movie set in the 70s/80s Cold War era, you know the deal.Good: The action in this film is incredible. The fight scenes are shot cleanly choreographed well. It doesn't do that Paul Greengrass bulls*** where the camera is shaking like an ex-gridiron player with CTE and it doesn't cut every 1.2 seconds to hide shoddy stuntmanship. The music is pretty rad.The clothes are fantastic.The Bad: Ironically, one of the bad things about this movie was also one of the good. Without getting into spoilers there is one specific fight scene in this film where the music cuts, and its presented as a ""one GIANT take"" with no cuts, which is fine, but I feel that someone saw Daredevil on Netflix, and basically lifted it shot for shot, because it's virtually the SAME EXACT THING.For a film of this ilk, it also tries to get a bit too clever for its own good, tossing in a couple of cheap ""switcharoos"" at the end that left me feeling a bit wonky.Over all this was still supercool and you should see it.",Atomic Blonde

You open the film with a guy dead and they show you a photo of that guy with the main character. And after that... nothing. The dead guy turned out to mean nothing to EVERYONE. That's just one example of the crap script.Characterization is non-existent. There is NOT a single character in this movie that you care about. None. Not even the main character. Really, they could kill her at the end of the movie and you'd just go ""Oh, okay.""Storytelling feels disjointed. It doesn't flow from one scene to the next. And in the middle of the movie, you get McAvoy giving narration as if the story is his point of view.The action that everyone seems to praise is TOTAL crap. I know it's a movie, it's fantasy, it's not real. But how you set up the level of fantasy should go hand in hand with how you follow-up with the action. Thor punching Hulk to fly off and shatter a brick wall is ""realistic"" in that level of fantasy. This movie actually has real life background of the cold war and the Berlin Wall being emphasized to death, yet you see a woman beating up men (not ONE man) with muscles three times the size of hers in brute force style fighting that you saw in Daniel Craig's James Bond movies. I mean, come on, did I miss the scenes that explained she has super strength somewhere?Really, despite the violence and action, this film was so boring that it felt two hour long when I reached the first hour of the movie.

308,ChocOrange_,Misguided attempt at a comic adaptation,5,28 October 2017,"Misguided attempt at a comic adaptation.It sports a dreadful script that doesn't involve you with a single character.Very slow to start for a film promoted as an action movie. And please, if you have a snow scene like at the start, don't use such shockingly fake snow which looks like a mix of paper and plastic. It actually lifts off the floor as they move. How to break atmosphere from the start.The 'neon' lit photography looks cheap even though it's really trying to look stylish. A poor attempt at looking like a coloured graphic novel.As for the music, truly horrific choice of 80's hits that are so out of sync with the events it's untrue. As for the action, what little there is, is mostly well shot. The famed 10 minute 'single' shot action scene really isn't close to a single shot and the edit joins are so obvious a 5 year old could see them. However, it is mostly well done although the lack of viewer investment in the characters leaves it feeling flat.Way too long, a mushy uninvolving script leads to a disappointing experience.",Atomic Blonde

""This is almost like John Wick"" - another heavily stylized action-movie with a generic script.

Slow-motion scenes, well choreographed fight scenes, colorgrading to set a certain tone etc are all fine with me. But as icing on the cake (the Bourne movies for example).

312,travishouze,"""Atomic Blonde"" Has Sparks and Fizzles",6,12 July 2017,"I always felt that Charlize Theron had a powerful presence on screen after seeing her as the villain in Snow White and The Huntsman. Her dominance was undeniable in her eyes, and when I found she would be in Atomic Blonde directed by one of the directors of the first John Wick movie, I walked in with excitement for a thrilling ride.Charlize plays a spy stationed in Berlin days before the Berlin Wall is torn down to find who is searching for the murderer of a close co-worker after searching for a MI6 list of secret agents. As she steps into Berlin, she realizes her trust becomes minimal and has to be prepared to defend herself at every given moment.David Leitch's direction feels very similar to John Wick in visual style using neon lights and smoother camera movement to feel the impact of every hit each character lays on another even to the point of showing even the strongest fighters get exhausted in battle, and in many cases, makes their own wounds worse which is a great and fun detail to the fights. The film never takes itself too seriously either as most of the fights are placed in between 1980s synth pop and even George Michael music.There is a fight in a hallway which is presented as a single take, and it's as AMAZING as people have made it seem and is worth the price of admission. The moment goes on for about 10 minutes, but it feels the film around it was tailor made for this moment.However, the rest of the film doesn't have that grip even in the downtime when action isn't happening. There are times when the film is explaining the plot, and since the script lacks sharpness, it feels like it's a blur to keep up with what exactly is happening and who to be aware of for the protagonist's sake.If you are a fan of John Wick or just hard hitting action movies, Atomic Blonde will absolutely spark your excitement. It just hurts that the plot surrounding is when the film fizzles before it hits the fuse.",Atomic Blonde

316,mt-95256,"Although overly complex with some cool characters that we'll sadly soon forget, this is still a stylish and cool movie with a thrilling plot and incredible fight scenes",7,20 August 2017,"Even from just a brief glimpse at the career of Atomic Blonde's director David Letich, his speciality for action jumps out like one of his stunts. With such a strong and pervasive background in stuntwork for a range of big-name films, it's no surprise that his next big gig is helming the director's chair for the highly anticipated Deadpool 2. Yet before that, we have his directorial debut Atomic Blonde to see what he might bring to everyone's favourite Merc with a Mouth. Fortunately it all bodes very well, as luckily this film is more than just slick, exciting action; it brings with it a complex yet enjoyable plot that keeps you guessing while simultaneously shocking and delighting.There seems to be roughly three types of spy films nowadays; camp and silly action with self-deprecating humour; serious and down-to- earth drama/ thrillers; and dour, noir-esque action thrillers. Atomic Blonde falls into the last category, striking a perfect balance between action film and thriller; almost Jason Bourne meets John Le Carré with a touch of Bond-like style and glamour. The John Le Carré similarity is one of the most striking elements with a story that can pride itself on such complexity. As an audience, we are constantly kept guessing all the twists and turns that are thrown our way. While a deep story rife with detail and nuances is a joy to watch, it's not flawless and doubtless has some plot holes if you look into it enough. It's also inevitable that you might get lost along the way if you're not careful. As interesting as it may be, if you lose track and lapse concentration even for just a few minutes, you'll find yourself spending the rest of the film playing catch-up, trying to understand the details you will have missed. It can be exhausting to keep the mind whirring in order to keep up with the ever-kinetic and complicated plot, but it's ultimately very satisfying in the end.Fortunately where it differs from Le Carré-style spy stories is where it also excels and keeps the film refreshing and more fun to watch. Throughout Atomic Blonde we are treated to a plethora of amazing fight sequences, each one unique, different and equally exciting to watch. It's clear Leitch is very focused on action since the choreography is second-to-none; expertly choreographed, performed and shot, we do feel as though we're constantly in the middle of the (sometimes gloriously gory) action. In particular there is one scene in the second half where we are treated to an insanely long hand-held tracking shot – one shot following this incredible, brutal fight sequence, going from stairwell to flat to streets and finally to car chase; it's long, unrelenting, immersive and very impressive – an absolute joy and blast to watch the creative fight moves fit seamlessly and naturally together. Aside from this brutal, all-out fight sequence however, many of the other action scenes have the soundtrack blared loudly over the top – it's an effect I'm very fond of (Matthew Vaughn in particular being the master of this, especially in Layer Cake and Kingsman). Still, it's done so frequently to the point where the effect almost loses its potency – only almost though. Bookended by Bowie songs, it's a top- notch soundtrack which really adds to the cool style of the movie and aids in the complete 80s immersion, as well as adding a touch of style to the fights.More than the catchy music and elegant fights though, the style is epitomised by Theron's portrayal of Lorraine. Beautiful, sexy and as cold as the Berlin snow, she's a stern, icy character, difficult to read and hence full of an undeniable intrigue. Held together by medicine, alcohol, cold ice baths and hot cigarettes, she's a strong yet silent lead, more than a match for fellow male spies in cinema. Yet unlike Bourne and Bond, there's not a great deal that sets her apart and can make her memorable. McAvoy too plays his part well, his character perhaps being the most interesting. Never knowing whether to like him, hate him or even trust him, he brings some much needed charisma to the film, epitomising the complexity of his beloved Berlin at the close of the Cold War. Secondary characters too make the film's story more deep and engaging, bringing a wealth of intriguing characters that more than push the story forward. Sofia Boutella's Delphine and Eddie Marsan's Spyglass especially are worthy of mention.Though at times the story becomes overly complex and exhausting to keep up with (no doubt with plenty of plot holes if you question everything) and despite Theron's kick-ass female spy Lorraine sadly unlikely to linger in our memories along with the likes of James Bond or Jason Bourne, this is a solid, action-packed spy film that's sure to impress. Imbued with style and coolness and with incredible fight scenes that are expertly shot and performed, Atomic Blonde is as fun for the eyes as it is for the brain.",Atomic Blonde
317,coolliegal4,So close,4,29 March 2018,"Almost had a good one here and a possible classic but they killed it with the constant music. This felt like you were constantly in a music video with almost every scene. The 80's music was great but do you have to use it ALL the time? The fluidity was also missing, badly. The plot was easy to follow but the way they told the story was choppy and pretentious. They really tried too hard to make this movie cool, what a slap in the face for movie lovers. This felt like it was made by a 10 year old who loves spy movies and violence. Cinematography was good but that will never carry a story if it's not told well enough because I had to end it even before the lesbian scene I hear people talking about. I wasn't interested in seeing that with all the silly scenes being thrown at me with loud music. And what a waste of good actors.",Atomic Blonde

The film basically lost me in the first 10-15 mins, despite good acting and well shot action scenes.

320,mark-durfor,Atomic Blonde Falls Short of Bond or Bourne,3,13 July 2017,"Undercover MI6 Agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is described as an expert in intelligence collection and hand-to-hand combat. In Atomic Blonde, Broughton is sent on a mission to Berlin on the eve of the collapse of the Berlin Wall to take down a ruthless espionage ring that is responsible for killing her boyfriend and fellow MI6 undercover agent. He was killed for an important document referred to as ""the list"" that contains compromising information about undercover agents and missions. There, she is forced to team up with embedded station chief David Percival (James McAvoy) who is not always on the same page as far as information sharing. Once in Berlin, the mission quickly expands from just finding ""the list"" to also revealing and eliminating the double agent crossing the KGB, the Royal Crown and the United States.Atomic Blonde is the full length feature film realization of the graphic novel titled The Coldest City. Written in 2012 by Antony Johnston and Sam Hart, The Coldest City chronicles the adventures of a spy sent to find a list of double-agents being smuggled into the West.An early review described Theron as ""bigger and bolder than Bourne"". Many have compared her character to the first real female James Bond. I found a couple problems with those comparisons. First, the action scenes and driving sequences in the Bourne movies were believable and flawless in their execution. While Theron was more than able to pull off the realistic and graphic fighting scenes, the driving scenes were enhanced by a computer in post production. And you can tell.Second, Broughton, like the 007 Agent to which she is compared, has a love interest in the movie. Bond is known for being quite the ladies' man with not-so-subtle innuendos and a PG to PG-13 scene of intimacy before getting back to the action and gadgets. Broughton engages with a female French agent named Sandrine (Sofia Boutella). This affair was not in the 2012 graphic novel, but the writers of Atomic Blonde felt it would set their spy movie apart from other ones and it would be an unexpected twist. Their affair was graphic, intense and gratuitous. While the Bond scene of love is titillatingly playful, the scenes in Atomic Blonde hinted at by the preview leave s little to the imagination and something that I feel works against solidifying Broughton as a viable contender to be in the same class as a Bourne or Bond character. Though I can excuse the affair itself as being a means to and end (information gathering), it still could have been done with a PG to PG-13 ambiance about it.All the things that are wrong about Atomic Blonde are showcased in the first 5 minutes of the film. The MI6 Agent is killed by the KGB in an unrealistic computer enhanced car hit, the first line of the movie drops an F-bomb (the first of many), and the next scene is Broughton naked in a tub and around the bathroom. I supposed the point of that was to show a bruised and broken Broughton; but, again, that could have done without the nudity.Atomic Blonde looked interesting and I agree we are overdue for a female version of a Bond or Bourne, but I do think they could have done so with more attention to the plot and the action and less on the nudity and sex that didn't make the movie any better. I went in with low expectations giving a timid 2 Star Prediction. I will say this, as the movie progresses, it does get better for me. The fighting scenes (and you can tell Theron is actually doing most of her own work) are quite realistic. The story is not unique. It's a spy movie, so the one you think is the traitor isn't, and even when you think you figured out the twist, there's another one.It's entertaining, but not innovative or new. Because of the fight scenes alone, I'm bumping this up to 2.5 Stars. Still disappointing, especially when it could have been a solid 4 to 4.5 stars had it not been for the car chases with computers, the nudity and sex, and the foul language that just wasn't necessary to put Atomic Blonde in the same league with Bourne or Bond. I think this is one to wait for on cable, but might be worth renting, but not spending the big bucks to watch in theatres. marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",Atomic Blonde

As far as the movie, it appears to be one long music video advertising cigarettes. Apparently there is a storyline in there somewhere if you can keep yourself awake and have the determination of a real spy, but I'm afraid I don't.

The actions scenes were good, but if a real woman was hit like she was hit, she'd be in a coma. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that a person can get hit that often and, not to be sexist, and in the places she was hit, to actually survive. If she could have avoided being hit, I could get behind that, but she was hit in the stomach at least 3 times (that I noticed). A 115 pound woman CANNOT and WOULD NOT be able to sustain hits like that and still walk away. I know it's only a movie, but let's be real here. It took me completely out of the movie.

The amount of neon lights and unnecessarily dark blue cinematography was jarring to look at. Such ugly cinematography, some of the ugliest cinematography since the John Wick films. Apparently, Leitch hired Johnathan Sela again. Probably the crappiest cinematographer working in Hollywood today. The script is awful as same goes to the original source material. It's derivative, contrived, boring, and predictable. I cannot believe Fox would hired such a crappy director. John Wick 1 and 2 were already awful enough and they go and hire this guy. I don't understand. Now Johnathan Sela is the cinematographer for Deadpool 2. So, brace yourselves. Deadpool 2 will be a total piece of trash and will look like one as well.

327,reoroy,Rarely have I seen a spy film that is so fashionable and stylish,8,28 July 2017,"I loved the camera filter director David Leitch and his cinematographer used for Atomic Blonde. It was reminiscent of the atmosphere in late 1980s Germany when the Berlin Wall was about to be razed down to the ground. The lack of ""brighness"" worked in the film's 'spy-centric' plot. The film is interspersed with neon-lit sequences which reinforces the purpose of this film. The music that accompanies this film will remind you of the underground music scene in the 1980s when people were experimenting to come up with revolutionary melodies.Charlize Theron is perhaps one of the most fashionable spies I've seen on the big screen in recent times. She looks so ethereally pretty and when she exhibits aggression like she did in this film and also in the latest Mad Max film, she looks even more beautiful. This film is replete with well-choreographed action sequences, bits and pieces of stylish sensuality and an amazing amount of twists and turns that might make your head reel with curiosity.David Leitch has constructed a labyrinthine plot and you will certainly want to be a part of it. As its name suggests, Atomic Blonde is a chic and sophisticated film that reaffirms my faith in David Leitch who impressed me with the first John Wick film.

328,eden-rabatsch,Theron brilliant as action star of Atomic Blonde,8,1 August 2017,"It is not often that an actor is ushered into the pantheon of great action stars, on top of that, the list is infinitesimally small when it comes to women. All Hail, Charlize Theron. The film is based on a graphic novel called ""The Coldest City"" which has the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 as the backdrop to a spy thriller. The cool factor both in tone, in the illustrations, the Cold War itself are all filtered through to the film. It has a steely blue undertone, similar to the work of Michael Mann, which allows the city and the cast to somehow become a hyper-realised version of itself. David Leitch, who built his action chops as a stuntman for decades before breaking out as co-director of ""John Wick"", knows exactly what type of film he is making. Leitch borrows the tropes of the spy thriller but uses John Wick hyperviolence when the film ups a gear. However, as opposed to the Wick films there is an actual story, with a convoluted plot as befitting a spy thriller and here the film struggles at times. From the 80's soundtrack, to Charlize Theron's thigh high boots and McAvoy's punk buzz cut, this film nails the style of the graphic novel. It looks beautiful. Layered on top is the spy plotting but the cream are the action sequences. There is one scene in the middle of the film which runs for five or so minutes as one take ( sure there are some sneaky cuts) but it is impressive choreography and really levitates this film to the highest level of action films. The film is in every way Charlize Theron's as MI6's Lorraine Broughton. The training is evident in how her body looks and moves – all ivory skin, tendons and elbows. There is an intelligence akin to the Bourne films in how practical these amazing people are in using everything around them as a possible weapon. The cast elevates Theron with nice performances from James McAvoy as David Percival, the English head of the East Berlin office and superiors played by John Goodman and Toby Jones. The scene stealer is Sofia Boutella as the French operative, Delphine LaSalle but all fade around the Amazonian. SPOILERSThe film has attracted criticism for not making sense but I think once you piece together that Theron is a TRIPLE agent posing as a MI6 and KGB operative but actually working for the CIA it makes more sense. Broughton was in Berlin BEFORE the film began and kills Gascoigne (her lover) because he is close to getting the list of agents which lists her as Satchel and not only will it blow her cover but the CIA have ordered her to get it for them. This is not completely successful and I can understand people getting confused. A murky film can leave a bad taste but though the story could have been told better the film itself does make sense. There is no decision to be made here. If you like action films especially the Wick and Bourne universes then this film has to be seen. However, I would also argue that anyone looking for a different type of action hero should also check out the amazing work of Ms. Theron.",Atomic Blonde
329,sunheadbowed,Atomic bomb.,4,16 December 2017,"Some thoughts after watching 'Atomic Blonde':The phrase 'all style and no substance' has taken on new meaning.On-screen lesbian action only ever exists to titillate heterosexual men that don't have any exciting sex in their real lives.When anything desperately attempts to be seen as cool, it rarely ever turns out looking very cool.Charlize Theron is extremely beautiful and talented, she deserves so much more than this; I guess she was just born too late, she would have been a sensation in the 60s and 70s.Despite hosting the dumbest people on this planet (Trump voters, for example), America has the most brainy, brilliant secret service ever; in fact, it's so awesome it can outsmart both the KGB and MI5 at the same time! The film takes the cynical 80s nostalgia trend to new levels, even emulating the Cold War propaganda of the era. I'm afraid it will take more than this film for the world to think America is cool in the era of Trump.Having unrealistic, underwritten characters partaking in realistic scenes of extreme violence seems to have the 'entertaining film' formula backwards: characters that people can relate to beating each other up in amusing, OTT fight scenes would seem like a better idea, surely, it has worked for Tarantino for decades. I absolutely enjoy violence (except for when it's happening in the real world, obviously), but the staircase scene was presented realistically, with one long take and no music (in a music-heavy film), which made it come off as rather unpleasant and completely lacking in any entertainment value, and it didn't fit at all with the comic book tone of the rest of the film.If you can't make a film that comes close to Tarkovsky's standards, just have people beat each other up in front a big screen playing his films. I'm fine with mocking classic art-house, or your own film, or whatever the idea was -- everything is fair game when it comes to parody -- but having people think about a superior, more creative film during a dull action flick that has zero depth doesn't seem like a good idea, you just wish you were watching 'Stalker' instead!",Atomic Blonde

333,writeguyr,Cold cold heart,2,14 December 2017,"""Atomic Blonde"" is great on cinematic action for almost the full length of the film. Yet it grows to be a little too monotonous and predictable. The problem with this film it has no heart or soul or no humor, it is as cold as the novel that inspired this film ""The Cold City."" Charlize Theron as Lorraine Broughton has the clout for the main character of this film, the physical stature and the energy. Yet her cold heart and vendetta attitude becomes tiring after seeing her repeatedly beating and killing dozens of male thugs and villains. All the while her expression is one of either anger or boredom. The similarity to the film ""Salt"" is very obvious, starting with the opening interrogation scene and the suspicion of the central character Broughton here, as it was for Jolie's character in ""Salt."" But the similarity ends there. For we had empathy and cared for Jolie's character in ""Salt"" for she had many human issues the audience can relate to. Jolie's character did have revenge in her heart but she also had visible pain from betrayal. The pursuit scenes in ""Salt"" were amazing. In ""Atomic Blonde"" Theron spends most of the film hunting down the bad guys, kicking their butts and or killing them with ease. There are some unusual twists in this film. While most action films with a male lead have him have one or many female love or sexual interests. Here, Theron's character is interested in men only to beat them or kill them. Theron's character has a sexually charged affair with the only other female major character in this film Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella.) Their attraction sparks into a sexual encounter in the ladies restroom of a bar. Hmm? It seems very familiar to the sex scene between Theron and Christina Ricci in the film ""Monster."" Where Theron pinned Ricci against the women restroom wall and gives her a hot mouth to mouth passionate kiss. Theron repeats the same scene with Boutella in this film. Theron in ""Atomic Blonde"" is also a bit of monster, she shows no feeling, she has the heart of a heartless android robot. The graphic lesbian sex scenes in bed also may turn off many. It is perplexing that Theron and the producers for this film chose this course for Theron's character. Why not make her more like a female James Bond? Having her have affairs with many men, a love them and leave them type attitude like 007. Have her have the wry humor like 007 also. And perhaps a love puppy guy who is in love in love with her, with Theron's character having to save his life repeatedly. Atomic Blonde has the sex appeal with Theron and she is the actress that could carry this film into sequel territory. But for this to happen Theron will have to give her character more warmth and melt the Cold City atmosphere.",Atomic Blonde
334,gfarrell0,High hopes for great movie turns out a mess,4,14 October 2017,The only thing this movie has going for it was marketing and casting. The story is not compelling. The cinematography is annoying. The movie is sometimes almost black and white other times it has color. Everything is a stereotype in the movie. You never care about any character. There is a fight scene every few minutes where the small female has to beat up many thugs. The film never shows why any emotion is called for. The lesbian scene dose not add to the story. Lastly pacing is terribly and the dialogue is unbelievable.,Atomic Blonde
335,satilla,"Great action , very realistic fighting scenes",7,14 August 2017,"Although I openly hate the recent years woman hero flood on the movies , this one was different. Lead actress was very good , fighting scenes were really amazing ( may even match the john wick ) , although stunts were not good ( especially the first car hit on the agent with the watch was really carelessly shot ( with that kind of effect on a human that car should have hit the car in front ) ) . Also the last umbrella scene , plus mcavoy dying was really simple. Anyway great acting from mcavoy also .",Atomic Blonde
336,screenotes,Stunt-ed,6,10 June 2019,"Adapted from the graphic novel ""The Coldest City"" and helmed by one-time Stuntman David Leitch, Atomic Blonde (2017) sends Charlize Theron's Badass MI6 agent to Berlin to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents.Set against the backdrop of the fall of the Berlin Wall the soviet-era spy plot is all but subsumed by a soundtrack of garden variety Eighties Singles found on any mass-market compilation. While the aesthetic is largely true enough of the era, Theron's outfits themselves often seem to leave as little to the imagination as possible without heed for retro trends. The dramatic question of Atomic Blonde is not so much ""will Charlize succeed in her mission"" as which will win, style or substance.This film is not without merit, however. Theron is engaging as an action hero, albeit not a British one and the fight scenes are well choreographed and believably perilous for the female lead, standing out not just for the fact that they are mercifully free of music but they are perhaps the only element of the film without a hint of pastiche.The thin spy plot is would have been serviceable for the film the filmmakers seemingly wanted to make but style 'uber alles' only really works if the style is consistent and the soundtrack builds or at least contributes to atmosphere, rather than containing 'on the nose' musical choices. No prizes for guessing which Nena song plays over scenes in Berlin or which Clash song plays over scenes of London.
In the end, the film doesn't quite hang together and is more exploitative than engaging with disparate elements fighting each other for second place behind action set pieces.",Atomic Blonde
337,JasonR77,Nuclear Blonde,8,4 December 2017,"One of the things about this movie that I found particularly interesting was the absence of a nuclear threat plot line. Spy movies over the years have taken after the more cartoonish Bond movies and made everything about the end of the world. David Leitch slows his roll in that regard, narrowing his focus and telling a better story as a result.The search for ""Satchel"" and the recovery of a list of double agents is more than good enough to draw a solid plot, which is then packed with keen spy action, with some terrific fight scenes thrown in to even it out.Charlize Theron, now a bonafide action star, shows her talents in the fight scenes, and doesn't rely on the typical female action star tropes; strong legs and agility. She's just simply better than the men around her, and she can take a licking with the best of them. She's not a goddess like Wonder Woman, but she's a perfectly good Cold War, female Bond, if one is apt for such comparisons.Leitch successfully captures the time his story is set in, both visually and musically, bringing along some classic 80's hits to set the mood. The stylish way he approaches each scene, and the little things that he takes the time to do, like having the East Germans wanting Jordache jeans, make the film that much better.It won't blow your mind, and though original in its approach, its subject matter won't break any new barriers, but there's enough fun, and a couple good twists that make it worth it. Theron and James McAvoy have a terrifically twisted relationship, and the treatment of a lesbian character is done much more evenly than in many other films.8/10, Genre fans should enjoy it.",Atomic Blonde
338,rogerhwerner,"a very intriguing, exciting, even brutak film with a surprise ending",7,30 January 2021,"The storyline of this film is as complex as any Le Carre novel so don't let anyone convince that the plot is a simple spy film. It's far more subtle and complex than a typical modern Bond film, harking back to Ian Fleming's novels. Charlize Theron and James McAvoy are believable spys and they receive plenty of support. This film is likely to require at least two viewing to catch all the details but especially the plot twists, with most of the spys not what they appear to be.",Atomic Blonde

340,lvanderwindt,more interesting in the beginning and simpler in the end,7,24 November 2020,"This movie does its job to be a descent action movie. The storyline itself is quite ordinary but very well executed. In the end it was a bit confusing with the whole Perceval stuff. But with some thinking I think I got it. The main character Lorraine, Charlize Theron, could step on me. I'd say thank you very much but that's not the point. I loved that storyline was like 'I'm telling the story as if it already happened but while I'm telling the story it happens on screen' it's a thing that directors use sometimes but is hard to keep interesting. In movies by David Leitch the main character is, most of the time, someone we get to know throughly during the movie. I like this aspect a lot. Other movies by him that I really liked such as 'The Mechanic' and 'Escape Plan' all built up during one big thing in the end. With Atomic Blonde this chaos was going up and down in hills. We did have a climax but also smaller 'incidents' that made the role of the main character not go without scratches. I loved that the fighting scenes were real. No music, loads of grunting, small pauses from both sides to catch their breath etc. Sometimes I felt like these fighting scenes were a bit too long. The whole side story with Delphine didn't really do it for me. I get that there was supposed to be a side story or something to do with a significant other to keep it interesting. But Delphine didn't match Lorraine's lane at all. Lorraine was like this perfectly planned power woman that knew each and everyone better than they knew themselves. Every plan she set up worked out the way she had it in her head and she was so intimidating. Delphine on the other hand, was giving of vibes like she was kinda new to this all. She didn't work with the precision like Lorraine did and lived way to long in my opinion. Overall opinion is that they should've made the storyline a bit more interesting in the beginning and a bit simpler in the end. Great actors and overall a great movie by a great director!",Atomic Blonde
341,trpnallday,The best spy movie that I have seen,10,2 May 2018,"This film has a great story that seems confusing at first, but comes together toward the end.The actors all do a great job, and the fight scenes are some of the best that I have ever seen. It really seemed like the characters were actually duking it out in a bitter struggle for survival. I also appreciated that it didn't seem like the main character magically had everything planned perfectly and that she succeeded at everything. It really seemed to me like she was a trained agent who was dropped into a situation that was too much for her and so she was just trying to get out alive.The visuals and the soundtrack were awesome and really helped to set the mood and to make for a different experience from most cold-war era spy movies.",Atomic Blonde
342,cutesd,Poor storytelling ruins what could've been a great film,5,30 July 2017,"Atomic Blonde starts out strong with a compelling protagonist heading into Berlin just as the wall is starting to come down. It's visually beautiful contrasting harsh, stark, nearly monochrome scenes in East Berlin with rich, jewel, neon accented venues in West Berlin. The action scenes are well planned and have a Tarantino-slant making you laugh at the most inappropriate times which helps lighten the extremeness of the violence. Add to that a cast of incredible actors and a decent story to build on and the film should've been fantastic.Unfortunately it was told in a horribly messy, confusing, and muddled way. From the very start I somehow missed the entire point of her mission ... basically the crux of the entire plot was lost in the middle of a bunch of flash backs and cross scenes. At 30mins-1hour in I was so lost and bored I nearly fell asleep. Then some crazy action happened so that woke me up but I spent the next hour trying to figure out what the hell was going on amidst a bunch of names I couldn't connect to actual characters and characters who weren't even introduced let alone explained. I wasn't given anyone to invest in and so by the time I did figure out what was happening I didn't care. And when the big AHA surprise of the double agent is revealed ... I hadn't been successfully sold on his primary allegiance so the ""twist"" failed miserably ... actually all the ""twists"" were miserable fails for exactly the same reason. The film failed to establish any of the characters enough for there to be any twists and the plot ended up just a horrid mess.I didn't leave the theater saying ""what was that?"" I left just not really caring about anything I'd just seen. Which is a shame because with better writing, direction, and editing I could've really enjoyed this film.",Atomic Blonde
343,Yee_Reviews,A promising cast and trailer turns into a big disappointment,5,14 June 2017,"A very long and bland action movie that goes over its time limit. As excited as I was to see this from the fast paced and well edited trailer, I left the theater disappointed and expecting more.Good: Charlize Theron and James McAvoy were great in this film and worked well with the role given. The movie has a vibrant and appealing rock star style with bright neon colors. Bad: The action sequences lacked innovative and new stunts and were not entertaining at all except a one-shot staircase scene. The story and plot of the movie were not interesting or intriguing. Also the movie seemed to jump all over the place going from one setting to the next. Also the addition of Sofia Boutella was not used effectively. A lack of comedic moments.Overall: This movie was a let down and a movie that I prefer more is John Wick which understands what it is and entertains the audience. As great as the cast was, the plot and action sequences lacked creativity and stylistic moments.2.7/5",Atomic Blonde

345,hnapel,I liked this movie for its strange mix of glamour and dread.,8,25 October 2017,"This is a movie adapted from a graphic novel and it shows. It looks like some of the sarcasm, cynicism and general dread in depicting Berlin (East and West) before the wall came down found its way into this movie. The setting is classical: the debrief in the current time where the actual movie is in the flashbacks, a construct that is often used probably because it works so well. The hero is ambivalent, she is the 'Atomic Blonde' that is supposed to be a bombshell and don't get me wrong she's pretty tough but at the same time with a waning appeal and a vulnerable side also. There's a nude scene in the beginning of the movie that shows her from behind, not your perfect body but more like an average woman her age would look, this scene actually won me over to consider it more interestingly, and made me realize Atomic Blonde is actually deliberately camp with a more hidden gritty message that is not at all glamorous or fashionable, I guess a point that more cursory reviews seem to miss as they describe it more as a vehicle for a bunch of over the top action sequences. I see more and I can't help it. To begin with the story that develops is overall a disaster, everyone dies and the worst is the death of her love interest, a character you were not supposed to trust until you realize she was OK. The story is tragic with hardly any winners and the goal is just to survive. You should understand the final over the top action scene was shot for the trailer, as most of it is in there but that's not the one that is most interesting, that is no doubt the fight in the stairwell which is very raw and violent, the cinema's are the modern arena's and a fight to the death has as much appeal as it had two-thousand years ago, this is what we want and so it is delivered. It's not to say the plot is not predictable, you see it coming from a mile away, but still I liked this movie for its strange mix of glamour and dread, more in the tradition of Sin City than those Marvel superhero flicks.",Atomic Blonde

347,MyContribution,Turned it off half way through,2,21 January 2020,"Just a lame attempt to be an edgy spy thriller. The story line was trite. The dialogue was boring. Apart from a minor role played by John Goodman, who did a good job, the acting was overdone. The action scenes were of the Steven Seagal/John Claude Van Damme style of over-the-top pointless. And the characters were superficial. There was little rapport between any of them, leaving the viewer not caring whether their mission was successful or not.

During watching it, I heard a song that I hadn't heard in a looooong time: After the Fire's Der Kommissar. I actually paused the movie to listen to the full song online, and then I listened to a whole bunch of other 80s classics and only then did I go back to Atomic Blonde. This tells you I didn't care all that much about the movie itself, but I sure appreciated the music and also the setting. I'm from the 80s myself. How nostalgic.I didn't care for the story. The fight scenes were done well, however. The movie has style. Never mind that it's not believable. I could suspend my disbelief for a while.The movie could work for you, so give it a chance.

A few lesbian sex scenes to keep the lads happy and that was it. A total vacuum. Don't even bother to rent it.,Atomic Blonde

I would like to warn prospective viewers that it is based on a comic book, so some may not like the feel of the movie.The fight scenes in the movie were uniquely awesome in my view. Though this is based on a comic book, the fights felt very real(which is rare) and their depiction honest, without any of the over the top, populist kind of sequences!All in all, you might like this movie on the surface(you would probably appreciate and enjoy the style and atmosphere), but if you think about it, the movie fails to make sense. Not that it's totally absurd, but there are some serious plot holes/questions which remain. Add to that, the plot seems much convoluted/confusing.

351,keniwhat,Out of kilter 80's homage.,5,9 November 2017,"What is Charlize Theron doing in this? Having said that, what was she doing in Mad Max? The movie looks like it was made by a young male who just discovered 80's music and spy films and decided to combine the two into a movie. The fight scenes suggest the whole thing is tongue in cheek but if that is case the character direction/acting undoes it all. Why does Charlize Theron whisper all the time? And why do characters speak facing away from the other spy. That hasn't been done since the Pink Panther and that was a spoof. Each scene is started with an 80's 'classic' which has one thinking that a record company is behind the whole thing. On the whole, an empty experience but the fight scene on the stairs is mega. Even though I'm only giving it 5 stars I'd nearly sit through the whole thing again just for that.",Atomic Blonde

Whoever doesn't think this movie is at LEAST a 7.5 has not understood the purpose of this movie.In here we are welcome by a super fun, bloody, extreme, humorous and contemporary action movie. We see Charlize Theron at her best as an impeccable anti-heroine. James McAvoy one more time gives an amazing performance and proves to be a versatile actor, and undeniably one of the best actors of his generation. His interaction with Eddie Marsan - which was a delightful surprise for me - made me feel nostalgic about ""Filth"" in a very good way! Needless to say, photography is on point, the neon colors perfectly portraying the decaying beauty of 80s Germany. The soundtrack plays an essential role to make this movie even more lovely - I was thrilled to listen to Falco, Nena, Siouxsie and the Banshees and ""Under Pressure"" to wrap up the epic finale of this film.

356,carnagecarney,"Confusing/unbelievable plot, gratuitous nudity with great action scenes",5,4 August 2017,"This is the first time I have felt compelled to compose an IMDb review although I have been using this wonderful site for many years.Atomic Blonde has a bit of everything. As other reviewers have stated, there are certainly comparisons to other iconic silver screen spy characters; both Bourne and Bond certainly come to mind. Theron certainly holds her own in both acting and stunt/fight sequences. She is a gifted actress as is McAvoy, but neither can save this mess of a plot. On the bright side, the cinematography was top rate, the action sequences very believable and the 80's soundtrack along with neon drenched atmosphere certainly make the viewer 'feel' they've slipped back a few decades into the late 80's in East/West Berlin.Add't, I disagree with others that the action/fight scenes were not believable or too CGI - they were top notch, simple and very realistic.As eluded to earlier, where the movie falls absolutely flat is in both direction and plot. Others may disagree but both my GF delight in cerebral action films which force the viewer to pay close attention to both dialogue and subtlety in advancing character development and stratagem. You never really care/empathize with Theron's character. Nor does the audience EVER understand what motivates her. Past love? Patriotism? Revenge? We never know...so we never really care.The result is a haphazard, confusing and frankly unbelievable story in every way. There were SEVERAL times where my GF looked at each other with very confused expressions. It is obvious the director's intent was to keep the viewer guessing but when the credits roll, looking around the theater, many were looking at each other and silently mouthing ""WTF"" to one-another.Up-and-comer Sofia Boutella holds her own as does Goodman (as usual) and great leads in both Theron and McAvoy but... unfortunately for all of us; even they were not able to save this confusing and truly unbelievable mess of a story (you will agree when it wraps).5 out of 10 apples for great acting and cinematography but a big zero for story and direction - the result is just a horrible movie.

358,moonracer0120,Lesbian Sex Scenes Unrealistic and Looks like Bad Porn For Men,6,19 August 2017,"This film's fight scenes are visceral, brutal, intense, and feels incredibly real. The lesbian sex scenes unfortunately are about as unrealistic as it gets and easily fall into tired cheesy porn clichés directed at heterosexual men who have no knowledge of what real sex looks like between women (hint: it does not involve one woman lying on top of another woman like she is the living room couch). As a woman who has dated women the sex scenes were very disappointing; these sex scenes are just awkward and fake. Some advice for Ms. Theron and director David Leitch: if you want to sell a film as feminist, actually find out how two women have sex before trying to film a sex scene; otherwise, it looks really silly and betrays your ignorance. As it stands this film just caters to boring hetero male fantasies with no grounding in lesbian reality, which makes it not much more unique than your run of the mill action/spy thriller geared towards the average straight male",Atomic Blonde

And this is not actually ""my kind"" of movie. It was dated, but pleasantly so. The music was spot-on 80s emo. Charlize Theron is hypnotic. I really found the action sequences excellent, and difficult to watch in some cases -- they were that realistic. There was no score, if I remember correctly; just well-placed 80s songs. It was not high-tech and glossy like a Bond flick; it was just extremely gritty.Now, my husband disagreed on every bit of this, so check it out for yourselves.

I wanted several times to leave, as I was bored out of my mind between action scenes, the characters had no traction, you just wanted to end.Go if you are nostalgic and want to see Berlin in '89. Don't go if you want entertainment.And in the end, you wonder, a double, triple or quadruple-agent??",Atomic Blonde
369,dariansdad,"Starts great, gets weak and then finishes with a quiet bang",8,28 October 2017,"I could have gone as high as '9' in the rating if not for the poor editing and cinematography in the middle of the movie.I am not a technician, I just know what I think is good work and what is bad. Charlize is a screen force to be reckoned with but her British accent was horrific. McAvoy was brilliant beginning to end.This film starts with very harsh and choppy cuts to bring your pulse up to speed and takes a few minutes to deliver anything of substance. Not a bad thing really.After an hour or so, the characters seem to be 'phoning it in' or the editor left the best parts on the floor. Maybe the director got distracted. I'm not really sure but I could have shortened the movie by 15 minutes and been better for lack of disappointment.Things got better after (no spoiler) the scene in the stairwell. I feel as if I watched one movie produced by three different teams. Or, three different movies on the same script. Weird.Loved the ending.

370,elale-573-971300,Bond. Lorraine Bond.,7,4 August 2017,"The fighting is really realistic street fighting. There's plenty of it, and features lots of improvised weapons. The movie promised ass-kicking, and it does not disappoint. The plot wasn't too confusing for me because I studied cold war politics (I actually have a degree is Soviet Political Analysis) and I understood all the Russian dialogue, some of which was not subtitled. It was a fairly complicated plot, though, and people less familiar with the history might have gotten lost. I was in the Soviet Union just a couple of months off of when this story takes place, and I can well imagine everything that happens in this story really happening and just sort of being folded into the general confusion and violence taking place at the time and passing without a ripple into history. Lorraine could have been me, if things on the world stage had happened just slightly faster or slower, so I really identified with the main character. I liked the nostalgic music. Combined with the sets, costumes, props, etc., it really provided the atmosphere of the times. I also liked the Lesbian scene. Even though I liked all those elements of this movie, I still didn't find it that exciting. The frame story structure ruined the tension. I get that the frame story served several purposes: 1. to provide an excuse to show the lead actress in the bath. 2. to introduce Goodman's character so the audience will understand the ending 3. to sort of explain the plot a little. However, all those things could have been handled a different way. As it was, knowing in advance that the main character made it out of there alive spoiled it for me. When she was fighting her opponents, I wasn't afraid for her, because I knew she was going to make it back to London. When she was in the sinking car, I wasn't afraid for her, only for her passenger. I could not get emotionally involved in the main character's struggle for survival because the opening scene already told me she would succeed. So, I'm giving this a 7. It's watchable and has many enjoyable elements, but I could neither fear for nor cheer for an outcome I knew in advance.",Atomic Blonde

In the 2000 movies I've seen, I'd say this has the best background music selection, ins, and outs. The heavy techno bass mixing really does theater viewing justice vs home options. I can also listen to Kaleida's downtempo 99 Luftballons on repeat, so thank you to the movie for that.Then there is the fight choreography and fight cinematography; perfect. No hard to comprehend shaky cam masking a lack of actor skills or composition.

379,esthercross,Atomic-I don't understand what is going-onde,6,3 September 2017,"I was VERY intrigued about seeing David Leitch's Atomic Blonde because the trailer was a scrumptious collection of garishly coloured and edgy shots and my artists beady eyes zipped straight down to my nearest big screen.-However- My experience of the film felt very much as if I was wondering round a retro-contemporary art exhibition, thinking; ""ooh look at the cool vibes from this bathtub full of ice, still why are all the information plaques in Braille?"" I had no idea what the plot was doing one minute to the next. As far as I could understand the premise of the film is this; a spy agent called Lorraine is on a mission with James-rogue-chic-Mcavoy to retrieve some codes in Berlin, before the baddies did bad things with them. There where so many stylistic visual moments that I strongly appreciated but I felt isolated as a viewer because I was constantly confused by what was happening. The stakes didn't feel high enough to be able to experience the tension of the action that makes you urge the protagonists to succeed at their mission. To be fair, I didn't fully understand what they were trying to succeed at. I did think however that Charlize Theron, Sophia Boutella and James McAvoy had a great energy to their performances and were very watchable start to finish. I think Theron tackles the action sequences very masterfully, she has an incredible ability to draw your full attention. The costumes and design of the film were bold yet minimalist. I thought Therons' edgy renegade look was well curated so much so it culminated in me purchasing a black p'leather skirt on my way home. There were a few definite moments of humour in the film and when they happened the frown of confusion on my face settled briefly. I thought the comedic moments seemed to be much more coherent then the plot in general. One section of the film I was impressed with however was the long shot of the stair case fight scene, It was complex and evidently took a lot of skilled choreography and filming techniques. My ambition now is to be as athletic and unstoppable in heels as Charlize Theron.",Atomic Blonde
380,SenorLengua,"Bond meets Bornewith a better soundtrack, too.",7,11 August 2017,"Saw this about a week ago and wanted to let it sit for a bit before writing this review. The reasoning is that this is not the typical James Bond movie, or even Jason Borne. Nor is this a Jon le Carre capture, either. The difference? The kick ass spy is female. But you already knew thatBefore watching, I had seen a trailer and a clip, and the combination seemed like it would be a 120 minute 80s music video, with car chases, fights, and, yes, a little lesbian action. And, yes, this movie provided all that, but those few words are too simplistic. To give an idea of what to expect, almost the first scene we have Theron (Lorraine Broughton) emerging from an ice water bathtub. My first thought was ""Would this be done to a male?"" But then, as the scene progressed, Theron is seen to be beat up, and she downs a shot of alcohol, and the visual is about the unfolding brutality show on her body. Along with the lighting, and Theron's acting, it is obvious that something f***ed up happened. At this point, we should remember that Theron has been in movies that range from Mad Max: Fury Road to Sweet November to The Italian Job (2003) to North Country. And Monster, of course, which won her an Academy for best Actress. This movie is all Theron.From the first moments, we learn this is Berlin in 1989, as the Wall is about to fall (The chaos of those few months are captured in the 10 day time span of the movie). But it is 1980s, and throughout there is a great soundtrack (caught myself singing out loud a couple of times), even if it does not directly match up with the time frame (as a reviewer reminded, Eastern Europe tended to be several years behind in music, style, etc.). There are even a couple of songs in both German and English. And man, is Theron dresses impeccably. One thing that I liked throughout the movie is the way the fights are choreographed. They are dirty, messy, and anything within reach can be used as a weapon. Think the use of the pen in Borne Identity fight scene in the Paris flat. Yet, in this movie, there are far more. Heels, lamps, corkscrews, just to name a few. The fighting, though, is a bit cartoonish, a bit over the top. So much so, that the director, David Leitch, seemed to making fun of this genre and how ridiculous some of the fight scenes could be. Think of the ridiculous fight/chase scene at the beginning of Casino Royal (2006). In the theater I was in, some of us even laughed at a couple of the over-the-top moments. But it was not Kill Bill over the top, just enough to be playful, yet not lose the overall Female- kicks-ass vision. The final 45 minutes pull back on some of that over-the-top aspect, and there is a bit of tenderness. The salacious lesbianism that was provided in the previews is rather more restrained and tender in the actual movie, and there is nothing made of that fact that there are two women in bed rather than a woman and a man. And there is a turn from the blunt force of the fight to a more subtleness of asking of what was said was truth in line with the fighting, or misdirection in line with the spying. The fighting, too, is also somewhat restrained, not as comical, though the brutalness keeps going, Theron keeps getting beat more and more. It is that cross between suspension-of-disbelief and will-she-ever-die? But we ask, will she? As for the acting, there is an admirable cast other than Theron, but only Jon Goodman (Emmit Kurtzfeld) is up the same level. Much was made of Sofia Boutella (Delphine Lasalle, lover) being in the movie, but I found her inconsistent, and James McAvoy (David Percival) seemed like he was trying too hard (which is a shame as I really liked him in Trance). Still, this is a good movie, and if not seen in the theater, it is a must rent – though it has brutal/violent (not gory) fight scenes, so parents be warned - the movie rated R for a reason. With that note, though, there is going to be one fight scene, known as ""Stairs Fight,"" which will go down as one of the best fight scenes in movies. I thought it was a mildly off when first watching, then I learned that Theron did all her action (and really did get beat up during the movie) so it may have been just a single take (as it was a single shot) – and the scene really starts a few minutes earlier in the flat she exits. It is brutal, and it looks like it really hurt, and she gets up anyway.",Atomic Blonde

384,crberme,Captures the essence of what a good spy movie is,8,3 December 2017,"Atomic Blonde sets during the cold war, when Lorraine, an undercover agent interpreted by Charlize Theron, is sent to Berlin to investigate a murder of another agent related to a list that would compromise the cover of a number of double agents.Despite the plot seeming a little common for the genre, this movie is able to capture the essence of what an spy movie is, filling this two hour long set with twists, small details and awesome fight scenes. You will feel confused - in a good way -, as in this movie no one is genuine, yet everyone gives little drops of truth in a attempt to keep their cover, save their assess and be helpful when it comes to resolve this situation. The plot is actually developed while we watch Lorraine be interrogated after all happened, so we also discover why she end up in that situation while we watch the plot, something that at first I didn't like but ended up growing on me. Also, as you may noticed, there's a lot going on at the same time in this movie, so you maybe want to keep your eyes glued to the screen, or even watch it twice, because there's things you can definitively miss or not really get on the first view.The movie is mostly well adapted to the late 80s and delivers some really good visuals that contrast between a predominant cold looking scenes and scenes full of neon purple or red lights. The change between predominant colors, camera movements and spaces used leave no room for boredom and make the movie flow in a nice way. The soundtrack is also good, with some big names like Queen and David Bowie. I wouldn't really paid attention to it - since it's not my style and I don't really know that artists songs - if it weren't because it kicks in the best moments possible, making some iconic scenes.Talking about memorable scenes, Charlize Theron stands out in her performance, making Lorraine a mysterious, tough and independent woman. She also shows a range that goes from vulnerable to fierce, always being realistic. Unfortunately, she completely shadows James McAvoy performance as David Percival, who ends up being a disappointing and a plain character that should've delivered more, both in the acting and plot sides.Atomic Blonde is not a transcendental movie, but a good movie to spend your time if you like thrillers with some action or movies inspired in the past decades.",Atomic Blonde

Theron is a butt-kicking spy who does most if not all her own stunts. A good supporting cast with John Goodman and the girl from the mummy remake.

388,Ska4Live,Blonde Wick,7,28 July 2017,"For me David Leitch is first of all director of action movies. His well-known 'John Wick' gave a new look to fight and actions scenes for whole industry. Also David known for his stuntman's\coordinator jobs years ago. In these few sentences I am trying to acquit minuses of Atomic Blonde. OK, so 'Atomic Blonde' return us to 1989 in a time of cold war and the period when Berlin Wall lives last days. Spy games are still running between Commies, US, UK,French. We see the story from UK agent eyes, told by agent Lorraine (C. Theron). I will not give you any SPOILER about all scenario aspects. Let's just say scenario is normal,have interesting intrigues. It is not masterpiece from spy detective stories and novels, but for such movies it is OK. The story itself interesting, but at the end, when all cards are being open, you still did not understand what happened 'who is who', ' how he\she did everything' etc. I believe that director and editor did not showed, all explanations and all moments in order to finalize story. Let's say 7\10.Now lets talk about cast and their acting. You shouldn't expect many dramatic acting in movies genres like this. But in nowadays every blockbuster\Action\Fantasy\sci-fi has these moment in scenario where protagonist has some dreams or love\lover and in some part of movie it's all ruining. And this is a moment when acting skills should be using. However, in Atomic Blond main character ('Atomic Blonde'\Lorraine) always wears pocker face. We are talking about Oscar winner C. Theron! I don't know maybe she was acting like this according to scenario or narrations from Director. Her previous role where she played strong female queen Furiosa (Mad Max:Fury Road) and that was really amazing, powerful, charismatic, and deep personage. In 'Atomic' she is only strong and confident, and that all! Truly, J.McAvoy (UK spy\ 'Percival') character is way much more charismatic, interesting and emotionally deeper then 'Blonde'. Once again, maybe this way of acting from James and Charlize, were requirements from director  We have also additional characters, like J. Goodman, T. Jones, E. Marsann, S. Boutella and some guys who portray stupid Commies KGB agents (like always Hollywood does). From these persons, 3 persons has about 15 min on screen, from these three only 2 give you some important information regarding all aspects of story, from these 2 only 1 has direct connection with Charlize Theron character, another one has only physical connection (guess who :) ). There is 2 antagonists in movies, KGB agents and double spy agent, whose identity is very interesting for UK and French side only. About Commies as a villains, they are absolutely stupid and useless in shooting, like Storm troopers against Jedi's. All explanation above will cost 5\10, where 5 – is only because of Hollywood names. Stunt job. Here is where David Leitch can beat some asses. And he beat them using amazing C. Theron. What did Ms Theron is very very impressive and everyone should applause her. And each stunt person did a great work during this project. In John Wick most of action scenes from Keanu Reeves was based on 'gun fight' sometimes with using hand2had fights, in 'Atomic blonde' everything is reverse. But, in the same time here is difference between John and Blond. First personage was beaten and sometimes crawling saving his live, female character win all fights, and even after 100 kilo man throw her twice at the floor she can beat him (without breaking any of her bones) and in few minutes later take a deep breath and swim 50m underwater in cold water. What I mean, if David Leitch want to bring some realism and brutality in his movie fights scenes, he shouldn't make his main character - unbeaten. That is why -9\10Cinematography is very important and very different during film. 3\4 part of movie use short shots for scenes, in the last quarter, when we saw adrenaline action scenes one by one - cinematography takes a long shots.Production Design, Music, Costumes are awesome you feel yourself back at end of 80 s.

389,dermobreen,Debbie Harry never looked this good.,7,28 July 2017,"Atomic Blonde is James Bond and Mission: Impossible for the 21st century and instead of Messrs Craig and Cruise we have Charlize Theron, a female spy. It's ironic then that this post-feminist adventure is set in the late 1980s around the fall of the Berlin wall.An undercover MI6 agent (Theron) is sent to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents. Her contact in Berlin is the city's station chief (played by James McEvoy). John Goodman and Toby Jones round out the cast as a CIA chief and an MI6 spy-master respectively. The story features the usual plot twists and turns as the double-agent is eventually revealed.The script could have been lifted straight from any number of spy movies however it is presented with a style and panache that brings new life to a jaded trope. The use of classic 1980s songs, with particular use of German synth-pop, bridges the gap between nostalgia and this 21st century update.The fact that director David Leith, who brought us V for Vendetta and the Bourne Ultimatum, made me curious to see how he dealt with this story based on the graphic novel series ""The Coldest City"". Leith is accomplished in this action genre. He continues his ability to bring tense, action-filled scenes to life with gritty realism, this time with 6"" red stiletto heels.Theron is believable as the action hero and delivers a sexy yet cruel performance. She is clearly enjoying herself. McEvoy is her equal and he too is revelling in the role of spy.

After 2-3 seconds of this, her killer comes up behind her and garrotes her.This scene deserved another take.One other scene is awful for other reasons.McAvoy's character shouts ""The shop is open!

If this body is the best she can do with that many different trainers than she is LAZY. During fight scenes she at one point can barely get up on her feet to 10 seconds later running. The new action movies are trying to overdue everything by so much that the actors practice everything so many times that they are moving to block punches before the opposition is starting to throw the punch.

Honestly I didn't even care for that long straight couple love making session they had in Deadpool.Half the movie could have been cut out if you removed all the smoking and lighting up scenes. The constant need for a drink. Then remove the whole lets see Charlize Theron naked and taking a bath. Maybe it turned some people on or maybe just the film staff don't know but only made us roll our eyes at not one but two ice baths. Then a night club scene where Charlize Theron wore a cut down the middle dress. Honestly when she wanted to wear disguises she could have dressed like a boy and passed. She doesn't have it to make a dress like that work at all.I admit that the action scenes weren't horrible. They were action packed. If you don't mind the constant blood and sometimes gore they weren't bad.Overall the ending was only sad knowing had they hid for 24 hours they could have all made it out.

402,bevinchu-1,Salt was better than Atomic Blonde,5,22 October 2017,"Rating: 2 for the first half, 8 for the second halfI was puzzled by other reviews of this film. The reason several reviewers gave for their extremely positive or extremely negative ratings was the alleged feminism, lesbianism, and misandry. Some films have indeed hit moviegoers over the head with Politically Correct SJW messages, making them every bit as unwatchable as the typical heavy-handed ""Christian film"". For me, ""Atomic Blonde"" did not fall into that category. For me, the deal-breaker was the ""my eyes glaze over"" pace of the first half of the film. I almost gave up on watching the film to the end. Fortunately I persisted, and was rewarded with an above average, kick- ass second half.I suspect the flashback structure of the film had something to do with it. One too many flashbacks killed any vestige of forward momentum. The slightly lower rated 2010 spy thriller ""Salt"", which had a very similar plot/theme, was actually a better film from a story-telling craft perspective. It moved along nicely from beginning to end. I wanted to like this film. Charlize Theron is one of my favorite actresses. Angelina Jolie is not. But ""Salt"" was actually the better film.",Atomic Blonde

I love Charlize Theron but she can not do a credible English accent and that in itself was a deal breaker.

The irony of the struggle, while the symbol of the division between east and west is destroyed, is ripe with possibilities. In the case of Atomic Blonde, too many possibilities. This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It is a kitchen sink of a spy movie, that can't decide whether it's John LaCarre or an MTV video. The best thing about the movie are the fight scenes, which are simultaneously outrageously improbable and thuddingly realistic, bordering on fetishistic. The scenes are choreographed so that the fighters are given impossibly convenient amounts of time to recover from seemingly fight stopping injuries time after time. But as bad as the rest of the movie is, give Charlize Theron credit for putting some serious work into her action sequences. If you like 99 luftballons, Charlize Theron, action sequences and don't care about plot, give it a whirl.

The film feels long even though the running time is well under 2 hours.If you want to see Charlize get the snot beaten out of her before she slams a guy's head with a fridge door or stabs him in the face with keys, then this will have something to offer you - one sequence during a street protest is very well choreographed - but otherwise this is a forgettable bore.",Atomic Blonde

Charlize Theron plays agent Lorraine Broughton in this film and she does a outstanding job with this character. She was in many action scenes and she must have been through extreme training to pull of some of the stunts she did in this film. That takes me to the action scenes. All the action scenes was great but one was simply great. The scene were she was trying to keep Spyglass safe was great. This action scene was a good 10 minuets long and is one of the best action scenes I have ever seen. Charlize Theron was great in this film and another agent was very good in this film. James McAvoy played another MI6 agent in this film and he was great as usual. So that's the good with this film, but there is also the bad. This film has NO character development. After this film was over I had learned nothing about any of the characters in this film. Another thing I do not like in this film is that they show Charlize Theron talking to her superiors in the beginning of the film. We know that she lives because of this and during the film it routinely goes back to this room and Theron and her superiors talking. This takes some of the edge out of the movie.

First let me say there is one good thing about the movie, and that is the backdrop, which is the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. But that's all this historic moment is, just a backdrop. Frankly the background could have been the Mood landing in 1969.The point of the movie is really just to show how awesome fighting is, how tough the lead female character is. Same old story, the hero can't be beat, the hero has attained some kind of immortality. Thus the movie is one-dimensional beyond belief. And that's about all you get, except the (and I will admit this) somewhat well-done lesbian sex scene(s), though the lines between the two females are very poor. There are many scenes where the ""heroine"" takes on 10(?) or more men, and she always wins, and of course who cares what the body counts are? There's no character development and not much of a plot; the movie is what it is, as I already wrote. I really have to lower my opinion of some of the fine actors in the movie.",Atomic Blonde

Even Sylvester Stallone in Rambo 2 would say: ""Stop, this could never happen in reality"". Wonder woman is a pussy compared to the lead character, which can kill more people than James Bond, and get away with even less scratches than him. Charlize Theron, a weak woman, can beat up and kill tons of professional agents in a row, and avoid all the bullets like Neo in The Matrix.Except that Wonder Woman and The Matrix are fantasy movies, while this one should be realistic.People who practice shooting all of their life can't hit her from 3 meters distance. They shoot the sofa and bullets are everywhere around her body, but none in the center. What's this, a cartoon?This movie isn't for teenagers and young adults, because it talks about politics and history, which is boring for younger audience. It's also not for normal adults, because it's too fake and impossible.So I guess this movie is for brain-damaged adults. Maybe after all the producer was far-sighted.

417,shoutingagain,"so, is lesbian ""context"" novel anymore?",3,5 August 2017,"First, let me preface with saying, I KNOW I won't be PC & get all ""not helpful"" but that's all GOOD by me as I'm still all RIGHT, so being on side of truth works for me. I won't bore you with rehashing reviews already having stated plot-narrative better than I. But, I WOULD like to speak about the obvious sexist plot device (who better than just act as a sex object than she?) So yeah, I will ask you to consider THIS: Imagine the screenwriters decidedly scripting Jason Bourne, James BOND or any of the men gay (or bisexual)? Or better put, engaging in homosexual action. Think that would've won over reviewers & critics? My guess is, no, it would've kept many from the theater or IF attending & surprised to learn it there, I see response going somewhat THIS way---speaking out LOUDLY, something like...""NO way, NOT James Bond, he's a real ladies-man stud!"" OR I suspect they just UP & leave. Before I get violently accused of being homophobic (I am not), keep reading. I don't care what anyone does, truly I do not. What I DO CARE GREATLY about is using lesbian action to sell tickets. Been years now that it's ""trendy"" and cool to throw in Lesbian scenes when NO......it's not anywhere NEAR accepted to do the same for men. Don't even try to PRETEND it is, your nose will be growing the second you do. There's NO way anyone would accept anything less than a FULLY straight James Bond! Or any character resembling him. And you know WHAT ladies (and men!)...this is intentionally crafted & manipulation by MEN as they make more than 80% of our movies. So no..they don't wanna see gay action with men, only HOT women. They also know other men enjoy this (c'mon now.. BE honest, most of you do)Well you know what? Screw that!! It's about as overtly sexist, misogynistic, and offensive as any other decision can be. I've had ENOUGH already. And NO....I truly do NOT care about gays one way or another. You might guess I'm straight & it's true but this is also true: I'd feel even MORE passionately if I were some gay woman witnessing my sexuality preference being USED to ""entertain"" men. You don't like truth, then go ahead & try to state otherwise, give it your best shot to make cohesive, cogent argument. I know you cannot. DO accept the challenge, I'd love to read & laugh!Because like it or not, you ALL know I'm totally on target here. Men's homosexuality is not as acceptable as women in film. Here's another that proves my point: I literally watched on as, at least, half the African American theater goers hastily, angrily got UP & walk out at ""Moonlight"" during the ONE short scene they couldn't manage seeing (with any simple tolerance). It was one ---kinda amusing, VERY surprising-- incredible sight to me. I sat there witnessing such stunned. And obviously thinking... did they NOT read beforehand? Who goes into any film totally blind? Why do that, particularly if SO sensitive? ALSO--and this is VITAL---anyone having knowledge of this film knows that VERY story necessitated this tasteful scene. More than necessary part for this plot & finally, again, large part of what the MOVIE WAS about. And even THERE, nothing gratuitous about this ONE scene incorporated into the movie. There was NO mistaking filmmaker chose to CUT AWAY so as to not offend --I suppose!!---straight MALE audiences!! We can't have that, can we? Yet still I watched parade of them march out the door. Insane!What the heck's going on out there? Ladies, just THINK!! WHY do we let MEN call the shots & manipulate our film industry? WHY is only female ""gayness"" accepted, heralded, encouraged, even championed (and by men, rather, more like, drooled over) as being progressive? Do you get YOU are not such? NO...you are NOT> Also do you NOT get that MOST gay women look NOTHING like what you see in the films? STOP your delusion & open your obtuse eyes!! (sorry lesbians, just being candid there).MOST of all, lastly, why do these idiot actresses (each & EVERY one of them, sell-out doormats) continue to allow MEN to call all the shots? No matter what you might suspect (not that I care, truth is truth!) I again, frankly, do NOT care a hill of beans of anyone's sexuality, doesn't involve or concern me but I have ENORMOUS concern when LESBIAN depiction is used to titillate. When it's as exploitative, manipulative & obvious as it's been for years now. Yep, where THAT is concerned, I have a HUGE problem. But hey, I'll just wait on the MALE James Bond to have gay action & see how that goes over with audiences!! OH that's right...we will NEVER see that. The outcry would be heard around the world. Hypocrites, you all make me sick. Lesbains do NOT exist to entertain men, get that thru your thick skulls!! I wish these simple-minded, money-grabbing exhibitionist- actresses would assert themselves with these very common devices used in scripts to entertain GUYS.... they are as much as the problem as the MEN who orchestrate this ridiculousness.

From an action point of view yes its rather similar to John Wick which is a great thing and it's a rather enjoyable film- Charlize Thereon proving once again how much of a badass she is.Where the movie kinda falls is the story for such a basic spy vs spy story its oddly confusing and requires probably another viewing to fully understand- which was one of the high points of John Wick; they killed his dog and stole his car thus killing spree.Another slightly jarring portion of the film is the soundtrack its very in your face and screams at you to remind you this is the 80s. Oh I quite moment... Nope, there's no such thing as a quite moment in Atomic Blonde because 80s music.But nonetheless Atomic Blonde is an enjoyable action movie with a great kick ass performance from Charlize Thereon. The story is where the movie lunders and lacks the same oomph as the action itself, but the stylish nature of the movie lifts it up again.

Maybe one or two good moments of that music, would have worked well; but all the time? The lesbian scenes are also, insipid and unnecessary. But the worst is that in the end, the two final twists of the plot fail, because we never really believe anything Charlize Theron does or says. Besides, at this moment we are just expecting that the film ending in a not so obvious way, and soon. But this does not happen. In short, that movie is only like a beautifully wrapped gift, without nothing inside, innocuous, and with several rather tedious moments.

No spoilers. Liked it a lot. Action/thriller. Plot: Set in 1989, British MI6 agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) on a secret mission to retrieve a valuable intelligence asset from East Berlin before he's located and eliminated by the KGB. The screenplay is based on a series of graphic novels, 'The Coldest City' which I did not read. It is fast paced and fun to watch. EZ to connect the plot dots without being too obvious, nice job so kudos to the writers. The score is period and I thought worked exceptionally well with the action on the screen. Thought the director David Leitch did an all around excellent job. Would love to know how they filmed the action/fight sequences, rates a 10/10. The cast was great. But in this film Charlize is the film... and she smokes it. Also looked to be well beyond just a physically demanding film, looked seriously painful. 
I've seen a few fairly negative reviews which surprised me. This is a well-done action/spy/thriller with no weak areas; it's pretty violent yet as I mentioned before, a fun watch. No, it's not Bourne, it's not supposed to be. Overall this is a 7 to 8 out of 10 stars.",Atomic Blonde

430,kamenhaven,"Boring, confusing and pretentious, more like Atomic Bland",2,3 August 2017,"Atomic Blonde isn't really an action movie. It's more of a spy movie, with some action in it. Is the action any good? Yes they are. Too bad there's barely 10 minutes of it. And the problem is, it isn't even a good spy movie. The plot is so convoluted and confusing, good luck trying to explain the story to anyone. Tonally the movie is all over the place. The soundtrack, costumes and feel of the characters are so comic-book-y but the story surrounding them is so grim and taken way too seriously. The characters are constantly posturing and trying so hard to look cool with over-the-top-affections that just grate on you. Like, how many glamour shots do we need of people smoking in slow motion? This movie made me yearn for an actor like Keanu Reeves who has a blank but empathetic face that you can project your own feelings onto the actor. In this, everyone is so try-hard and smug it's hard to care for anyone.As the main lead, Charlize Theron is pretty convincing in the action sequences but all her talking scenes are pretty horrendous. This is not a problem with the actress but the horrible script. You never understand what her motivations are for doing anything and at times, she doesn't even seem very smart for a spy. This means that whenever she's engaged in any kind of action its hard to root for her coz you don't know if she's in danger or if she's a good person. McAvoy pretty much recycled his unhinged performance from Split. But the biggest sin this movie commits is casting Sofia Boutella in an action movie (Kingsman, Star Trek Beyond) and not giving her any action scenes. That's like casting The Rock and he doesn't fight. Instead she plays a lame character that could have been played by anyone.The 80's soundtrack starts out strong but slowly becomes unbearable like nails on a chalkboard. As for the action, they are so few and far in between that it's not worth sitting through 105 mins for 10 mins of action. There's a somewhat impressive single take setpiece that goes through multiple storeys in a building but because you're confused by the story and not rooting for anyone that scene lacks tension and suspense. Overall this movie was really disappointing and overrated. Any comparisons to John Wick is seriously overpraise. Atomic Blonde thinks its cleverer than it actually is. For suggestions of similar films that does this way better, I highly recommend Hanna (2011) and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) instead. The latter has great lighting and sharp writing by Shane Black while the former is incredibly stylish with great action and a phenomenal score by the Chemical Brothers.

The daily reality was that crazy: playgrounds next to The Wall and 50 meters of ruined ground with guard towers and autonomic weapons pointed in wrong direction (most east Germans wanted in, not out). I remember riding the bike over the small bridge, and waving to the Eastern German guard in Zehlendorf. Usually he waved back. I remember stark, showy, EMPTY, bloated modernism of Alexanderplatz. I remember a feeling of living on the island. This film managed to bring it all back expertly.Even spy story follows its own logic: certainly there was a melting pot of Soviet, British and American interests.

I liked the sound track, it really enhanced the mood and the underground mystery, a lot like Quentin Tarantino does with his productions. It should be rated about 7.5 out of 10.",Atomic Blonde

Well, my wife left after about five minutes due to the excessive (and standard) Hollywood violence.

I would say this is the best she has ever looked but Theron has proved time and time again to be one of the most talented and gorgeous women in the world. Her character has so much depth to it.

It doesn't matter if it's a comic book movie. Or if they had to cram in a lot of non consequential plot. The film is ultimately boring and without anything to say. Even the lesbian scene was pretty tame for 2018 standards. Not to mention cliched as hell.
Maybe the point of the filmmakers was to make it as shallow as possible, reflecting on the times the movie is based on and if that was the point then bravo! You did it. If that was only accidental then what can I say that hasn't been said? It looks good, it gives you that Eastern Europe 80's feel and.... that's it.One salvageable scene was the fight in the stairs, it was very well choreographed although ripping off Old Boy... To the filmmakers: We have seen films as well. You do know that, right?By the time the final twist comes you just don't care anymore.It had remarkable potential. And Theron is a delight as always, but why did she look like she was on Valium the entire time?I'm sorry not only if you wasted your money on this.

451,henryluck,Atomic Blonde Review,8,18 August 2017,"Atomic Blonde is what you get when you mix the Cold War, James Bond, John Wick and a hint of Scott Pilgrim. Being based off  of the 2012 graphic novel: ""The Coldest City"" by Antony Johnston, this colourful yet bleak world has a great stand-out personality with neon spray paint that sprays the intro and credits as you enter the end of the Cold War, but the beginning of a new threat that emerges when the KGB get their hands on a list of every active MI6 agent in the Soviet Union.  Enter Lorraine Broughton, a A-class MI6 spy with icy blonde hair and a habit of taken constant baths of water and ice as she's held under interrogation about her last mission in Berlin. The story is very complex with a ton of twists and turns so I won't write anything spoiler related here but I can say this, be ready for one roller coaster of a story and the need to rewatch this title twice or maybe even a few times more.Action in Atomic Blonde makes James Bond look like Mr Bean. Gun shots and punch impacts feel really beefy and many of the fight scenes keep you on your feet as Lorraine and her foes have the endurance of Olympic athletes rather then the latter being rag-dolls. Fight scenes are also just the right amount of bloody and brutal and definitely warrant the 15 rating. The use of sound is absolutely the winner in this film.Music in Atomic Blonde does work in the moment with music like ""99 Red Balloons"" in German playing during an interrogation scene to add some light-heartedness to the graphic beat-up of a captive under the KGB. But the film was so fast-paced in it's action that I couldn't keep track of the music all that often as it was like a raging buffalo rampaging past a talented Mexican band.I had (excuse the pun) a blast with Atomic Blonde thanks to it's balls to the walls action scenes and captivating in the moment music. Like I said before, the film may need a few rewatches to get the plot but this is one film that should metaphorically be the next film you see next in your film watchlist.",Atomic Blonde
452,film127,Last third was okay,3,15 February 2018,"We rented this for the infamous fight scene. And it was really good. Music was good, too. The first two thirds just drag. I have a high tolerance for lower quality stories, but I started checking my phone, walking out of the room and not worrying about pausing the story, etc. As someone else said, being cool isn't just being moody and serious-looking. Between fight scenes there's not a lot here for Theron to do except glower and look too attractive not to be noticed. This is a shiny box with tissue paper in it.",Atomic Blonde
453,mnugent-74580,Cat People Behind The Wheel,7,12 July 2019,"This is a sassy fun action movie with a relevant and kicking soundtrack. You put Bowie's 'Cat People' alongside Depeche Mode's 'Behind the Wheel' and you deserve 7/10 for sheer style.Okay, the fight scenes are many and ask us to accept the impossible, but no different from any other movie. And movie viewers should not go searching for the deep and meaningful behind titles such as 'Atomic Blonde'.Sit back, leave your brain in its box, and just enjoy the great cast fighting, spying and smoking their way through a devilishly good Anglo-German playlist. Berlin Rock!",Atomic Blonde
454,cmtrisket,Blast From The Past!,8,25 April 2018,"Lets start off with some specifics. This movie is 115 minutes in duration, which I think is a nice length for movies of this nature, coming in at just under two hours. It is rated R for I can only assume, vulgar language, violence, and nudity. (All the things I love in a movie) This movie has a few more 'big' stars than you would initially think. You clearly see the leads, but if you look a bit closer you see names like Toby Jones, Eddie Marsan, and Bill Skarsgard. This movie is listed in the genres above in that order, but I would re-arrange them. I think I would put action last. If you are looking for your typical action movie this isn't it.Lets dive in, shall we? I felt pretty good about this movie going into it. Badass women in movies have burst onto the scene and I for one love it! Seeing that Charlize Theron was playing a double agent by the name of Lorraine got me hooked. The main story line is set in 1989, a year after I was born, Berlin Germany. This would put us in the Cold War era. Lorraine (Theron) is working as an agent with MI6 and tasked with figuring out who murdered another agent and recover a list containing all the known double agents. Without spoiling anything I really can't go into much more plot detail.Like I stated earlier I was really looking forward to this movie, but in some spots, for me, it fell flat. In a movie like this, that has multiple lines going on at the same time, you have to somewhat clearly have something defined to let people know. In this movie in particular they were constantly going from East to West Germany, due to the Berlin Wall. Most of the movie, except for a literal couple times, did they let you know what side they were on. I spent far too much time trying to figure that out while also trying to enjoy the movie. To me that is a bit of a negative. I get that the movie is in a mystery genre, but the East/West current location doesn't play much of a part in the story line.In the same regard, if you are someone like me, you may be confused in general, if you aren't familiar with the Cold War, and the split German country. That can be kind of hard to follow. You are constantly seeing agents from USA, UK, Russia, and France throughout the movie and it can be hard to follow it. I know this does play into some of the mystery of the story, so this isn't the worst thing going on, but it is worth mentioning.One thing I loved about the movie is its sound track. This movie did a great job following the 80's stereotypes, when it comes to the music, cars, and fashion. I applaud them on that. You can hear artists like, Queen, Depeche Mode, George Michael, David Bowie, The Clash, and more. Some cars that make appearances are an 89 Audi V8, 91 BMW 5 Touring, and a very sleek 89 Porsche 911 Carrera.The other thing that I found pretty great about this movie were the fight scenes. There are about 5 pretty great fight scenes throughout the whole movie. This is also why I don't think the action genre fits too well. There are no explosions and super fast car chases and other things you would find in a true action movie. There are only a few great fight scenes that really give this movie any real action. But let me tell you! They are some damn good fight scenes. Lorraine is a true badass.This movie has plenty of curve balls and will keep you thinking long after it is over.In summary this was a lot of fun to watch. It was casted well in most cases. There is a very real mystery about this movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the very end. Like most movies it had it's short comings, but kind of , for me, made up for them in other aspects.This all being said I would recommend giving this movie a watch! I would personalty give this movie a 7.5/10",Atomic Blonde
455,lowgunberry13,Atomic Blonde Logan at the Movies FB,8,16 November 2017,"A lot of cool cinematography here with unique shades and hues to reflect different scenes to really make them pop along with some great 80s music. It's nice to see a decent female spy lead her own espionage flick, like ""Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation's Rebecca Ferguson but with more screen time. John Wick co-director David Leitch's boldly over the top ""Atomic Blonde"" is stuffed on plotting and heavy with neon lit visuals, but it will satisfy your craving for woman powered heroism. There is no Bond humor here the film draws parallels to Angelina Jolie's ""Salt"". While ""Atomic Blonde's story is more ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" than actually ""Salt"" Allow the icy, unbeatable Charlize Theron and her ""Fury Road"" certified action chops to escort you through a maze of devious Cold War intrigues in a movie filled with high wire fights and high end fashion. John Goodman plays the CIA spook, James McAvoy and Sofia Boutella are involved in a love triangle with Charlize. All parties are after the Magoffin in this case a list.

To hide the absence of a real, coherant plot, the movie leaps from cross to double cross, red herring to double red herring in a desperate bid to give it grvitas beyond it's comic book roots. Bill Skarsgard is again totally miscast - there cant be many 15 year old spies knocking about. Ms Theron adopts one of those clipped perceived english accents that all Americans seem to use (think Angelina as Lara Croft) but her role, as is the whole movie really, is one cliche after another. Overal I suppose it's a way to pass time, but mainly for the younger audience who think they're clever and hip.",Atomic Blonde
460,argento6,A female John Wick? Great acting and cast but sadly far from an heavyweight of an action flick,3,29 September 2017,"I heard, and read that the sex scenes between Charlize and Sofia were hot in this film, helping a marvelous movie, yet i was rather disappointed with everything but the cast and acting.For a little fun it was an action flick, so watching the stunning Charlize fight ridiculous amount of men, way taller than her was charming. But considering that John Wick is such a good and accomplished effort, this Atomic Blonde didn't have much to offer in terms of script and plot was in fact a total letdown. I did enjoy the soundtrack and yes, i'm not a woman, i'm a guy and loved the sex scenes between the 2 actresses (Dear god! Toxic macho man!) But those who almost lost their socks due, in part to these scenes and found them extra-hot have not seen many R rated and Unrated movies that came before, in the 80s and 90s decades!

461,dj-lord,Overrated much?,5,29 January 2018,"Had a bit of adrenaline, that's about all it had going for it. For some reason this has been gathering some decent reviews but sadly it's very average. I can only imagine because it's basically copied the recent Superhero trend of having 80's music banging in the background during action scenes, which people have been tuned now to accept this as a viable reason to give good reviews. Albeit the music is good, there's the small matter of having a decent film/story to go with it sadly lacking. Charlize Theron is completely mis-cast as an a$$ kicking agent, James McAvoy is wasted, it's like a mash-up of xXx trying to be the female version of John Wick. Nonsensical plot too, which doesn't help matters. You could be forgiven for wondering why this wasn't made for Milla Jovovich, the action breaks down just like Resident Evil/Ultraviolet ... or in fact that awful Aeon Flux movie that Theron herself was in (where she proved action wasn't her genre at all).",Atomic Blonde

But i have to say really fan of James McAvoy, he really played his role perfectly. That madness, that craziness and that recklessness was really portrayed perfectly by him. Charlize did good too but she was a bit lacking if i compared her to James in this regards.
The moment James was dying and Charlize called him Comrade Satchel i had an inkling that she might be the one who is the real Satchel but never thought that she was triple spy. Sofia Boutella's role as the French spy was nicely played but to be truth i really didn't like it that much.

467,Prolecenter,American Action Porn,5,5 January 2018,"This is another one of those America-saves-the-day films with obscene amounts of action and violence. It was shot well and it has a great 80's new wave soundtrack. There is a fairly interesting plot with twists and turns worthy of a spy action film, but the KGB guys are stereotypical Russian brutes while the Western agents are charming, sexy, flamboyant and uber-cool. It's trashy, but I found it to be fairly entertaining nevertheless. The thing that bothers me the most about this movie, is that it is so nauseatingly propagandistic, but then again, so are practically all Hollywood movies, especially action movies and ""historical"" dramas. What sucks is that this movie will reinforce in most Americans, and others under the American spell, a false understanding of Cold War history. People need to always remember that the victors write history and it appears that the Americans are still fighting the Cold War in the minds of men (and women).",Atomic Blonde
468,ThomasStone,Only for the meek,2,7 October 2017,"This movie is not only a collage in its soundtrack but also in the way the camera moves, how the scenes are edited and finally a chopping block full of lumps of which only a few contain good acting. I never lived in the eighties and obviously this movie is directed to those people by the choice of scenery, everything about this movie screams Cliché Cliché CLICHEEEEEE!!The only thing I found interesting was the last fighting scene in Berlin which I'd seen before in a video essay on how to effectively edit action. The second star I give for the effort the director and actors put into this movie. I was very excited to watch this movie, hoping it would be something more than another Bourne ripoff and perhaps something more inspired like Old Boy and The Raid. What came out of it was not only a Bourne ripoff but also just a bland story that is put into scene by a director that simply doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make. The diversity in how the action is captured doesn't feel as focused as it could be, starting off with very choppy editing and ending in longer takes that actually draw you into the intensity of the moment. Then we didn't even talk about the backdrops, the unnecessary lesbian love scenes which were just obvious (and seemingly effective) fan service. This movie isn't worth your time if you know what defines good action movies.",Atomic Blonde

Something needs to motivate all the rest, and that's the script's job, a job that's largely left undone.

Most films show someone getting stabbed once and they fall down dead. The truth is it takes several minutes for someone to bleed to death from stab wounds. There are exceptions to this but I don't want to spoil anything. Sofia Boutella is delightful and charming. James McAvoy uses his beefed up ""Beast"" body in this film. Charlize is an amazing strong, brilliant, clever MI6 agent. She is also flawed, fragile and vulnerable. As Lorraine, Theron carries herself with so much confidence it is almost impossible to take your eyes off of her. And the soundtrack is so awesome.

If that's all you want from a 2hrs long movie, go for it, but I really suggest that you google ""lesbian porn"" instead, if that's your shtick. Oh yeah, there are about 4 cool songs from the 80's. And one fight scene at a stairwell which is well shot with a dynamic camera that's really in the mix of things, with some nice cuts between the scenes making it look like a really long shot filmed from the shoulder.--On a more serious note, the pacing in this movie is terrible. The photography is completely forgettable. The plot felt contrived because we never see what motivates the characters. I was hoping for a reveal at the end which would save it from being grossly thin, but there wasn't one. The ending just made the characters in the movie even more trivial. The acting also feels very flat, but to be fair, the actors didn't really have much room to show off. Still, fake sounding accents, not showing a sensation of pain or fear where appropriate; these things made the already seemingly impossible suspension of disbelief even harder to achieve. (it wasn't achieved, for me at least)--I guess there will always be room in the theatre for movies about tits, explosions and people getting punched in the face.

The characters were interesting and I want to know more about them. I definitely want to see this become a series.However it was a little slow to start, but even once it did it was a little underwhelming.

And that's what I got - nothing but cartoon-ish, over-the-top violence and ridiculous acting. Charlize Theron's role was absolutely silly, but I was hoping that James McAvoy, Toby Jones, and Eddie Marsan would make it worthwhile. They didn't. I was even willing to tolerate John Goodman's being in the film, but it was all to no avail. A movie for 14-year old boys. Maybe that was it's target audience.",Atomic Blonde

479,Mark-457,Not what you expected and that's a good thing,9,16 October 2017,"As greginess7878-already noted, there are a lot of brief generic disparaging reviews for this film, and I strongly suspect it is anti LGBT trolls.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the only criticism I would make is the catchpenny title change from the original Comic and with the trailer and marketing. This was hyped up to be a distaff Bond/Bourne with a streak of Terminatrix. That's not what it was and an honest ad campaign would have served it better.As it is, it owes more to LaCarre than Fleming. I found it more realistic than most of its genre, a real spy movie set in the turmoil of the Berlin wall about to fall and the impact that would have on the new world order. Parts of it captured the grimness and the cold war lack of trust between allies and dark deals of real politik with adversaries.I think the trouble with some of the reviewers is they are a generation that doesn't have the frame of reference to comprehend this film. They didn't experience the cold war, the threat of nuclear war or how much the European allies thought Reagan was an out of his depth populist who was going to get us all killed. How times have changed, eh? I am not a fan of Theron, I've not understood how she got credibility as an action star since Aeon Flux. But she does actually a do a pretty good job of this. The acting is good, I would have criticized her too generic English accent if it hadn't been for the reveal. Her story makes sense, in the context of the cold war coming to an end when a lot of people liked it just the way it was. The fight scenes are realistic, she is not superhuman, she can only take so much of a beating before being exhausted, she relies on brief impactful viciousness and improvisation. But she doesn't just shake it off by the next scene like they do in so many action films where the baddie goes down with one punch, one stab or one shot. She's convincing as a spy the way that Bond isn't, she changes her look, she sexes it up to manipulate, she acts and manages her emotions. It's not clear initially if she play the lesbian seductress because that the way she is or as another spy tool to get information. I take it as presented that she does grow to care in a way she knows she shouldn't.It has the right look for the time, the right music and nothing is as it seems, which is also right for the time.This film has more layers than it appears, they should have kept the original title, it's a great spy film in the tradition of Harry Palmer and Smiley. Personally, I'd love to see a sequel.",Atomic Blonde

The storytelling scenario (switching between two scenes is good too. So what's wrong? Well everything else. The characters are flat, no depth at all, villains are stupid and behave stupid without s reason. The action is somewhat cool but not believable. The story has numerous logical errors.

482,RunRabbitRun87,Bland spy noir spiced with intense action scenes,5,18 August 2017,"Charlize Theron plays Lorraine Broughton, the titular Atomic Blonde, and slips comfortably into her role as a suave, brutal, manipulative super spy. Unfortunately, the film as a whole falls into many of the graphic novel-into-film pitfalls of over-stylised action and undercooked characters.The film takes place in Berlin as the Wall comes tumbling down and the USSR slowly crumbles with it. Broughton is assigned by MI6 to travel to the German capital to retrieve 'The List' of all double agents in the spy network, and the Stasi agent responsible for leaking it (Eddie Marsan). While there she will make a contact with fellow spy and renegade David Percival (James McAvoy), and sultry French femme Delphine Lasalle (Sofia Boutella).Atomic Blonde takes a smug pride in a noir genre trope of the plot making less and less sense as the climax edges closer, but what could be a subtle study of murky character motivations at a convulsive time in the spy game instead often feels convoluted and uninvolving.If the plot of the film leaves something to be desired the setting and action both have their saving graces. Berlin 1989 is a fun place to set a movie, and Atomic Blonde features it all from strait-laced Stasi to underground punk hedonism.While this is a fully realized environment it never completely integrates into the film, most notably a great 80s soundtrack that feels layered on top with a wink and a nudge. Watching a Russian beat an East German with a skateboard to the sound of '99 Luftballons' is certainly fun, but Atomic Blonde never captures the courage and wit of say Reservoir Dogs use of 'Stuck In The Middle With You'.Charlize Theron is a solid performer as ever and exudes a charm and intensity whenever she is on screen. Unfortunately, her character feels a little too cryptic to connect with fully, and it's sometimes hard to care for her plight when she seems so uninvested herself.The hyperactivity of the fight scenes displays some superb choreography (especially in one long take as Theron takes on a pack of KGB agents) but coupled with the film's use of a flashback conceit give Broughton an aura of invincibility that again takes the viewer out.McAvoy is able to have a little fun, but alas still in a two tone way. Something that could have added a little to both his and Theron's characters is if the sexual tension between the two was explored more fully. As for supporting, Eddie Marsan is great with what he's given, while Toby Jones and John Goodman are spectacularly underutilised (I assume the latter was cast for his role in the classic satire of this genre The Big Lebowski).I take no shame in calling the lesbian sex scene my undisputed highlight of the film. Theron and Boutella drink up the screen together, and when sparks do fly it is brief but shot so as to visually engage without vulgarity.This directorial debut from David Leitch certainly shows action film potential. Hopefully, his is a future film career in which the conflict can keep its frenetic pace while presenting the viewer with characters and scenarios they can really care about.",Atomic Blonde
483,thom-mac,Good for killing time,6,18 October 2017,Good cinematography and great action fight scenes but mostly an underwhelming movie. I agree with one of the other reviewers and think the one star ratings are bogus but don't think that this is anywhere near a 9 or 10 star movie. It actually got pretty boring in parts and I had to watch it in two sittings.It wasn't a very coherent plot and it seemed the main focus was just creating situations that Charlize Theron could fight her way out of.I was really looking forward to seeing this move and while I am not disappointed that I watched it I don't believe it came close to the pre- release hype.,Atomic Blonde

John Wick 2 for me is a masterpiece and a movie that will be remembered for a long time. My mistake that is I thought Atomic Blonde will be kind of the same. But it wasn't. It's not a bad movie at all. In fact, it has a decent story and some good action parts. And I really like Charlize Theron, it is perfect for her role (though I liked her a lot more in Mad Max). The problem is that the whole espionage story doesn't get too serious. Maybe that is the point, but for me it tried to be a modern espionage movie that just doesn't know what wants to be at times. And the action moments were way too few, it's not much difference from what I saw in the trailer. So yes, maybe it's just me, but I'm disappointed of it and very sad because of that.",Atomic Blonde

But what's really genius is that sly, subtle, sexy way she delivers in the still moments too. She deserved way more recognition for this movie.

498,kinsmanivan,A definitely over-rated film in my opinion,6,23 August 2017,"I think many reviewers, including the mainstream media, have been far too generous to this film.Basically, the plot line is rather thin so there is a lot of emphasis on style. Charlize Theron ponces around in a lot of different designer outfits - she seems to be wearing a different one for each scene - and, despite knocking back bottles of Stolichnaya vodka and chain smoking, she still seems to be able to beat the crap out of every man who tries to kill her.Percival, the British agent heading up Berlin, is another hard boozing, hard smoking spy who likes to drive at top speed around the city in his Porsche (wanting to blend into the local environment apparently, plus his short haircut).The film does have some good fight scenes and what makes it credible is the West and East Berlin backdrop that is very authentic and captures the mood of the time, and I also enjoyed the 1980s background music. However, the whole film is a bit of a tongue-in- cheek romp that has a very thin veneer of depth to it.",Atomic Blonde

501,ralph-67198,"Good action, but not too much else.",5,17 December 2018,"I recently purchased the DVD for this movie expecting a stupid action movie that might slightly entertain me for an hour and 45 minutes before I forget about it within the same time period after I watch the movie. It was for the most part that except 80s.So good things first: the action is great. It is wonderfully shot, and the effects in these scenes are fairly good, and there are no specific action sequences which I have to complain about. One scene in specific was a masterfully done long take that lasted a very long time (it seemed like 6 to 10 minutes, maybe more). It is one of the best actionsequences I have seen in a very long time.Another thing I can complement the movie for is the visual presentation. The cinematography over during the film is relatively good and the color palette is very cool and fits the film completely.The characters are also Decent, although not great. They don't have much depth, but are interesting enough and enjoyable to watch on screen, especially the main characters. Speaking of characters, the actors we're also quite good. Almost every one of them poured there heart and soul into the role and I bought them as the people they were.Now, the negatives:
The story not very good. The dialogue isn't great, but isn't terrible. However, the story just feels so bland and uninspired. It isn't a crazy enough to be a fun in the same way the mission impossible movies are fun, but it also isn't realistic or gritty enough to be enjoyed in the way some of the darker action films are (if that makes any sense). Also the twist is boring and kinda dumb. You could see It coming easily. Overall the story of getting a list of people could definitely get some work.The music: the music choices for songs that weren't made for the movie are standard 80s songs and that's whatever, but it is the OST that I had problems with. It is bland and intrusive. It can feel very inappropriately used at points and is often just the average low volume until the action starts and then it's high-intensity fast and loud stuff that you could hear at any other standard action movie.The ending felt quite lazy. It didn't feel very natural, and the twist was predictable. I won't spoil anything, but just don't except too much when it comes to the ending.Overall, it's fine. Don't except an amazing oscar worthy film, and you should have fun with it as long as you like action.",Atomic Blonde

James McAvoy is superb and Charlize Theron's character was not as cliched as I thought she'd be. There are some fantastic fight scenes and the heroine is not unstoppable which made it more believable.

Some deaths felt contrived, like they happened just because the characters who died were unlucky or incompetent.The romance was shallow and underdeveloped.The plot was sometimes confusing, and the reasons for some characters' actions remained unclear. The plot was also quite thin.The main character should have had a knife or another easily hidden weapon so she wouldn't have had to fight using furniture.Most of the movie was a flashback.

The title Atomic does not even get played and surely there is a plagiarism law suit pending?Anyway, this is a Berlin spy movie more than anything. Charlize Theron is even hotter than she usually is, and I didn't think that was possible. The movie is probably worth 2 stars more from just how she looks - am I even allowed to say that? No, probably not - she does, none-the-less, have great screen presence in this movie. However, if you ever were lucky enough to take her out one night, she's not one to get into a quibble about paying for the restaurant bill - if this movie is anything to go by - unless you want a stiletto in the eye. Probably the same thing can be said for the two extra stars comment. It's a watchable movie with well choreographed fight scenes but the plot seems too Mission Impossible One to me. In fact, the title seems apt considering the plot - maybe just drop the word Atomic and avoid the plagiarism law suit.",Atomic Blonde

The time of the story was chosen just right, a few weeks before the Berlin Wall was pushed down. This big event is not too strange for most young viewers.2. The suspenseful color of the story is strong, and it can be said that it is interlocking and fascinating.3. The film adopts a mode of alternating drama and martial arts. The literary drama refers to the self-report of the heroine when she is interrogated. This is true and false, real and boring, but it seems boring, but with the continuous reversal of the film ending, it can be said that the content of the film is further improved. The martial arts is the most brilliant part, especially the long-range fighting part of the film, which is both cruel and bloody, making people recall that the era of the US-Soviet Cold War shuddered.4. The interpretation of the male and female protagonists is in place. In particular, Theron, originally thought that the film would be a low-cost and boring Cold War movie, but because of her wonderful interpretation, the film really has a big feeling.

The neon is there, that alone is worth it LOL.The plot is nothing super new, the twists are OK and add to it.The soundtrack is absolutely bonkers, can´t go wrong with New Order, Depeche Mode and the rest. It´s a bit of a too-perfect playlist though, feels like they tried too hard to stick the 80´s mood by music choice. So my DJ side can imagine a more underground and less obvious playlist that would´ve added a spice perhaps made it more moody. But OK the flick is dark enough and sure it´s great to hear all these hits all the same, so I´ll slap a 10 for music.The whole crazyness of the period is there. The Berlin wall, the collapse of the URSS, the feeling of a new era in the air, the abrupt changes everwyehreand the creativity that all that can inspire in people. Those were hard yet great, great times.

The movie follows the same rules of action movies from the 80's and the 90's: you have the problematic mission, the good ""guy"", the bad guys, the questionable guy and the sexy girls (women). But because a woman is in the lead role, Charlize Theron (instead of Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis or Silvester Stallone), the dynamic of the movie is a fresh breeze. She's not clumsy or in conflict with her abilities, (like most of the female agents in movies) she is a great agent send to deal with a problem and in the processes stumbles with an another problem that she handles in the best way, she knows possible. The thriller/mystery plot stumbles a little bit in the narrative, but that doesn't spoil the thrill of the action sequences, the beautiful choreography of the fights or the great music, and fixes some of 80's and 90's problems, like only strong and intelligent men, only silly sexy girls, no women, racist and sexist jokes, all of that without being boring.

Can't tell if this is feminist chic noir, but if it isn't, it sure could mask at it. Well worth the watch with multiple, interesting twists.

The acting was great but I didn't like Lorraine at all. I don't know if this was due to the directing or the acting. Lorraine talks constantly in a whispering tone to make her seem more cool and mysterious. But it only makes her really distant and I couldn't relate to her at all. This was also because there was just no depth in her character. There was no connection so I didn't care at all about her story. I also didn't like the lesbian sex- scene because it felt like they only did this to make her seem more interesting and, to me, they failed to do that.",Atomic Blonde

Which just isn't realistic. This woman does! To the point that she is barely able to stand! This Adds to the realism and visceral experience enormously! You feel every blow that she takes! The lesbian scenes were not needed (not that I minded, I'm lesbian myself), it just added sexual fantasy for the male viewers, but didn't add to the plot.

It just seemed like another spy movie with a great cast, but nothing unique. I was extremely wrong. I was completely unaware of how stylized this film would be, but man was I surprised; in a great way. The film is set in the 80s, and so the whole film is stylized as so. The least I could say is - it's damn beautiful. From the neon to the soundtrack, it's an experience. One that shall not be forgotten. Oh, and by the way, the fight scenes? They're incredible. I will say that I couldn't quite tell what the plot was during the first 20-25 minutes, but it was eventually resolved, and I had a fantastic experience viewing this film.",Atomic Blonde

520,BrinaCary,Best spy movie in quite a while,10,13 February 2018,"I absolutely adore this movie! It's got all of the traditional spy motifs and a unique ending! I loved the concept of Satchel as someone that's been engrained in the major players of the time period! Charlize Theron was amazing! It was very refreshing seeing her as a take charge, confident spy traversing the world of intrigue and deception. I hope she takes more roles like this.
The guy playing Comrade Bremovych is also an amazing actor; however, the skate board scene was a bit... unexpected... It goes to show he's a very cruel man, but I'm really curious as to how that scene came about.
Percival's character was very unique. It makes it seem like he's come to love the place where he's stationed; however, at the same time it seems like he relies a bit too much on being an outsider. It's hard to see him as an agent because he lacks the charm associated with most agents. At the same time once the movie ends I was like ""Awww, Percival...""
Overall, I highly recommend this movie because of how they filter in all of the answers and make you second guess yourself on how it will end. They used traditional spy techniques and modern, for the time period, technology to further the plot. The funny thing is that most people don't realize exactly what the true plot of the movie is until the ending. Personally, I think this was very well done and I hope there is a sequel that's just as good, if not better.",Atomic Blonde

522,thisemailisforcrap,"Exciting, fresh, realistic - only negatives were dialogue, pace, and Bury Your Gays",8,30 July 2017,"This movie was great. The one scene in the stairwell where Charlize Theron beats up a team of men and gets beaten up in the process is a real game-changer for action cinema - she doesn't power through them without taking a single hit like in most male-led action movies. There's no unrealistic one-hit KOs that leave men immediately disabled, because that's not how real life works. The action is superb. The beginning scene with the ice bath is superb. The aesthetics are beautiful and the characters are well-played.My only main complaints are the pacing of the movie (they could have cut many scenes shorter, and transitions between scenes seemed excessive/heavy-handed at times), the dialogue, and the Bury Your Gays trope.For people unfamiliar with the trope; the vast majority of LGBTQ characters on screen are murdered. It is damaging for young LGBTQ people to see the only characters they can relate to be violently murdered again and again, to the point where they expect it to happen. Delphine's death was not only needless but also excessive. I get it, she's a naive spy, everyone Lorraine loves dies, and the original character in the source material dies. But to have her murdered in her lingerie, on her bed, being strangled to death in an unnecessarily protracted scene, is pretty awful. And in the end, her death served no real purpose.I think writers need to consider the background of the trope before they write this kind of character death, and also before they pat themselves on the back for championing bisexual/queer representation. Even from a monetary standpoint, I know that many, many queer women have refused to watch this movie after learning about Delphine's death - so you guys are just shooting yourselves in the foot here a bit. Using queer rep as a way to draw viewership doesn't work if you kill off your queer character, and believe me, we can see right through it.Other complaints: Charlize could work on her British accent a bit and the dialogue at times tried way too hard to be deep/edgy (especially the monologues about truth). The cigarette smoking fit with the genre but also seemed like it was trying too hard to make the movie cooler.Anyway, all said and done, this is still an enjoyable, action-packed movie. I had a good time.",Atomic Blonde

I was only 15 in 1989 so didn't much cared for the Berlin event.

525,aliceflupper,Is Atomic Blonde the New Bond?,6,7 August 2017,"Impressed by the scope of the film - a spy operation set in London and communist Berlin, led by a cold-blooded, impeccable Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), I asked myself: is this going to be a female James Bond? Charlize Theron's lead in Atomic Blonde is an outstanding portrayal of a complicated character, a passionate female, a feminist and a perfectionist who preserves her humanity in the world of espionage, not traditionally associated with that particular quality. This memorable performance is sadly devoid of Bond's iconic charm and effortlessness which made his feats so iconic. Charlize is partnered by James McAvoy in the role of David Percival, a flawless flawed rebel, whose skills match hers, and controversial opinions incite her sharp observations, not only intriguing the spectator, but also providing another layer to the deceivingly simple spy story. On a human level, their relationship is one of equals, even if they would prefer to think otherwise, which makes their interactions all the more compelling. Both of them are professionals; both are cunning, skilled, and highly dangerous, but each reaches their aim in a different way, and neither can deny any of the above. Sparks fly. Lorraine Broughton and David Percival are worked-out to a tee. Even the interiors of their houses serve as extensions of their characters. The brilliant acting brings their full potential to life and turns the film into a memorable spectacle. The two protagonists share the spotlight, which provides a nice alternative to the Bond- centered universe. However, that is all the film is - another sparkling spectacle. Realism suffers a terrible blow with Lorraine executing the most intense fight sequences, and fighting multiple men thrice her size in stilettos which would be worthy of a 007 feat if not for the impracticality of the costume, which seems completely out of place... Where Bond relied on his physical prowess, Broughton's relentless devotion to stilettos makes her strength and agility seem like super-powers. A detail like this undermines the, otherwise carefully-constructed, persona of Lorraine and anchors the film somewhere in the thriller genre, far away from the top, meaning that the world will need to wait yet a little longer for the next James Bond.",Atomic Blonde

In fact, all the actors are great and the only complaint is the directing. It could could have been shot more fast paced. But the movie does correct this through the second half, so that makes it worthwhile. I didn't expect any twists in this story but towards the end, BOY, nailed it. In the end Atomic Blonde is charlize theron's movie whose kicks and punches are too prized to be missed. So bring the popcorn and get an Atomic Blonded experience.",Atomic Blonde
534,alinstroming,"Stylish, gritty and watchable multiple times",10,14 October 2017,"This movie is awesome.Plot: A M16 spy Lorraine Broughton portrayed by Charlize Theron is sent into Berlin, in the wake of the Berlin Wall's fall to retrieve a list containing the names of every double agents' identities. The concept is not entirely original, since the movie is actually based on Anthony Johnston's graphic novel ""Coldest City"". I don't care if the narrative isn't intuitive enough, because the movie was through and through very enjoyable Acting: One of the strongest and best aspects of this movie is the acting. By far, I think this is THE most impressive presentation by Charlize Theron. Not to mention, James McAvoy nails in a enigmatic yet charming performance. Sofia Boutella is also here, and after that not so appealing Mummy reboot, her character here is much more tolerable. Charlize shows some naive and seriousness, which sparks some James Bond vibes in some scenes. Also people saying she's the female Bond are totally right: this one's just a bit more cooler and fancier.Oh and yes the lesbian sex scene used as a marketing scheme does appear in the movie. For those interested, it's pretty sensual.Cinematography: Nowadays action movies just create the illusion that something intense and exciting is happening. Not Atomic Blonde. The fight scenes are one of the best in a while and pepper the movie just fine. The camera actually stays still and captures all possible angles. One of the fights is actually an about 3 minute long take. 3 minutes non-stop one take fighting. And that is Charlize Theron doing all of that. Superb commitment.Score: Yeah you heard it probably. A mix of 80's hits with Tyler Bates' original tracks. There's George Michael, Re-Flex, Depeche Mode, David Bowie and many more. The music might sound wrong in someone's ears, but didn't for me. I enjoyed it, and even now I'm listening to the soundtrack as I'm writing this.Ending: I was disappointed, but let it slide. I was expecting much more. If there's an alternate one, I'd stick with that.Overall: One of the most best action movies and movies of 2017. Easily goes into my Top 10 list. I had to go into a morning showing to actually see it, and it was damn worth my beauty sleep. I give it 10/10. Masterpiece.",Atomic Blonde
535,shaughne1,"Lots to admire, but kinda nonsensical.",7,29 October 2017,"Some parts of this movie were really fun: great Bourne-esque action sequences, Charlize dialed up to 11, kitschy 80s soundtrack. That said, the plot was convoluted, and even once I checked wikipedia to make sure I understood, still not that interesting.There were some things this movie did so well. Well, basically it did action sequences really well. The stairwell scene that everyone was talking about is basically something out of The Raid, but with at least some plot and acting behind it. Even though the movie takes itself really seriously and wants its audience to devote a ton of energy into understanding what the hell is going on, it's more fun if you just don't pay that close attention. My recommendation is to accept that it's too much work to justify keeping track of who's double crossing who and what's actually going on, forget James McAvoy exists, and just enjoy all the fun songs and absolutely wild action sequences.This was a tough pill to swallow, but if you just take the good parts at face value this is an extremely entertaining action movie.",Atomic Blonde

538,iamdraygoes,Good movie to rent if you cannot find anything to watch...,7,15 November 2017,"I would like to start by addressing two criticisms that I keep seeing in reviews often. The first is that it is too much like John Wick with a female lead, and the second is that it is an example of Feminism gone crazy in 2017. Addressing the latter first, I do not see much in the way of feminist propaganda throughout the movie. I am usually one of the first to pick up and point out political agenda in movies, and I am just not seeing it here. It has a strong female lead with plenty of strong male supporting characters. Not so much in the way of ""Girl Power"" that others seem to notice. People seem to forget that there where a lot of female spies during WWII, and I find it kind of nice to see this one picking that up as a story. As for the former (being a ripoff of John Wick); Sure, I guess you could say that it takes some tips from that movie, but with a radically different style. I only see a slight connection.This movie plays off of the WWII spy theme that is often over used by movies these days, but with a refreshing take. It is also filmed in a style reminiscent of movies like Sin City, and Watchmen (both movies I would recommend). It can be a bit slow at times, but it will keep you entertained throughout and ends pretty nicely. Still the story does leave a bit to be desired, and the writing is pretty much the normal for a lot of movies these days. Not fantastic, but not terrible. The lighting could use some work, but they where trying to set a tone for the movie and accomplished it marginally well. Special shout-out to the camera work during the fight scenes, which are themselves fantastic.Overall, I would defiantly recommend renting this one if you cannot find anything else to watch. Don't get your hopes up, but don't expect to be too disappointed either. 7 out of 10 from me.",Atomic Blonde
539,borkodechev,"Atomic entertainment, but not as atomic plot",8,27 August 2017,"'Atomic Blonde' is David Leitch's directorial debut and stars Charlize Theron as Lorraine Broughton, the main protagonist, and James McAvoy as David Percival, the baddie (with John Goodman and an impressive ensemble on the supporting side). Basically the movie's about a British smoking-hot agent slash spy thrown by MI6 in Berlin amidst the fall of the Berlin Wall to retrieve a list of missing double agents and to beat up some really bad people. What shines about this movie is, of course, the acting, its overall stylish and original look, its score, the directing of the action scenes and cinematography - it certainly was a well-looking movie. What I found lacking, though, or simply not as good, was the plot.What I absolutely loved about this movie were the astonishing and stylistically awesome visuals. It's like the gorgeous cinematography, the intense and well-made action scenes, the thematically appropriate soundtrack fusioned together to make this piece of original modern day film art. I enjoyed the movie a lot. It was a very fun ride, propelled by the fantastic acting and well- chosen cast members and great directing.Another thing that shines about the movie are the action sequences, which at some points during the movie are really long, intense, and breath-taking, and not the usual shaky cam that many action films make use of these days.I really don't get why are some people slamming this movie down so hard. Yes, the plot isn't exactly great and the movie gets confused what's the main plot goal in all the action, but that doesn't hurt the movie a whole lot and I think that people should just calm down and enjoy the movie, because it isn't a genius masterpiece with some kind of world-changing message, it's a goddamn action movie and it's very entertaining the way it is, despite the weak plot. And about the lesbian sex scenes. I think they were very fitting for the movie and contributed to the movie's cool atmosphere, putting emphasis on the personality and feelings of Theron's character.I enjoyed this movie a lot and instead of complaining people should just learn to enjoy a fine film, rather than doing their best to find every flaw they can.

But it's not just brainless action, it's some of the best brainless action you'll ever see.Absolutely everything here is stylish and entertaining. The directing is marvelous, every action scene is so thoroughly shot, combined with the wonderful cinematography of cold colors and bright neons, combined with the amazing soundtrack that brings the best that the 80s can offer, combined with the soul of the movie, Charlize Theron, that plays a woman that can be a true badass at the same time that is a great character with so many layers, seriously, how can someone not like this movie?I admit, there are some problems of substance here, the story is a bit confusing sometimes, has too many twists and lacks a dramatic link between the audience and the conflict. But still, watching Atomic Blonde is just so fun, that you can't help but forget this kind of stuff for a couple minutes and enjoy the awesome ride you're taking.I must say this movie is not for everyone, if you like the cold war theme but look for something smarter or dialogue driven, go watch a movie like Bridge of Spies and you'll be glad you did.

What could have been an awesome soundtrack became annoying and obnoxious after the first thirty minutes. It felt as if they were trying to use great songs to distract from the fact that the plot was extraordinarily confusing. I had a hard time keeping up with what was going on and left the theater still scratching my head trying to piece it all together. It jumped around too much and felt very chaotic. Also, although the acting was great, the characters themselves weren't relatable whatsoever. I couldn't tell who I was supposed to be rooting for. In the end I wasn't invested in any of the characters and didn't care what happened to any of them. The plot was just too vague and didn't explain who the protagonists or antagonists were supposed to be. The movie had such good potential with amazing actors, design, and action sequences, but all the great things that the movie had to offer were ruined with a vague plot and confusing characters.",Atomic Blonde

571,dmanchon,A two hour long tobacco commercial within the Ms. Theron personal show (Borinnnng),2,29 July 2017,"Disclaimer: I saw this movie in a secret screening in Barcelona's Phenomena theater. So i really didn't have any preconceived idea about it and i wanted to like it, but...Did i like the movie?Short answer: No, its pure crap, well its more like a really shiny polished turd, its very shiny in the outside, but still disgusting. Long answer (no spoilers): This movie is one of the laziest productions i have seen this year, and boy, its wrong at so many levels:The script is based on a graphic novel titled 'The coldest city'. I haven't read it, but i hope its better than this. The history tries hard to be twisted and convoluted to look smarter. What writers created in reality is the most generic spy history that you could think about. The twists are obvious, the characters are poorly defined, almost ridiculous, the dialogues feels out of place, trying to be smart but sounding hollow and superficial, bringing you out of the movie, plot motivations are just insulting excuses, you don't care about the double agent and 'the list' after 10 minutes into the movie. I have read in one of the comments here that this movie is 'feminist', come on, Are you kidding me?, this is the opposite of feminism, or maybe the commentator thinks that being feminist means to be lesbian and manly, the representation of strong female characters in this movie is a complete disaster full of stereotypes.Insulting use of references: Don't use the name of Tarkovsky and Stalker in vain! Its like having a reference of Citizen Kane in a Rambo movie, it just don't feel right.Use of music: After the success of Guardians of the galaxy seem that everyone wants to replicate the formula by including a nostalgic soundtrack full of old hits. Here its annoying, every two minutes, before every scene, we have this little music clip, performing Bowie, Depeche Mode or a couple of creepy covers of ' 99 red balloons'. The first and second time, its OK, after that its really annoying and its a sign of laziness and lack of resources of the film. Directors, editors, JUST STOP doing this please, its not cool.Action scenes: Probably the producers love movies like the ones in the Jason Bourne franchise and the 2006 Bond's 'Casino Royale', they also most likely admire the work of Tarantino and Guy Richie, they thought that the long sequence shots of 'Children of the men' are super cool and ... you get it, right? They try to emulate all the nowadays trendiest action movies, rough, physical violence, but they end up being dull, boring, foreseeable and ... arg i just don't care, spectator will be trapped between horrible dialogues and plot, and boring/cliché action scenes.Smoke: They should allow smoking in theaters. At the movie ending i was craving for a smoke, and you know what? i don't smoke!! There are so many scenes involving smoking and shot of cigarettes, that its difficult not to think about product placement. Talking about this theory of tobacco industry marketing, also the length of the movie seems weird to me, its very long (115 minutes) but it feels longer (i was praying for it to end), and that is a trend that we are keep seeing more and more, and my theory is that this movie is targeted directly for the Chinese market. Lower income population in highly populated areas of China seems to consider the cinema as a pure entertaining, and going to theater as a 'full day' activity, so movies should be 2h or more in duration to be considered by the Chinese audiences, and of course they want 'easy' and highly stylized action movies, what in other words is called, garbage. This is of course my opinion, but i think that trying to market the blockbusters to the Chinese audiences is damaging the quality of the movies, the 'Fast and furious' franchise and this very movie are clear examples.",Atomic Blonde
572,bowiekid,"Had high hopes, total let down",3,28 July 2017,"3 stars for the fluid direction, the setting, and the gorgeous outfits. The cinematography goes beautifully with the OST - a collection of original and remixed new wave/dark wave 80s hits - which I really enjoyed. It's unfortunate that the director couldn't elevate the film into something more sophisticated. Charlize Theron is stunning and has talent, but not even she could save the mess of a script. Her character Lorraine's bland personality made the plot even more cliché than it already was. Lorraine is the stereotype of a classic spy: cool, collected, and emotionless. 'I don't show emotion on my face because one day it'll get me killed'...you get the picture. Obviously, that lack of vulnerability and greater dimension makes for a very boring protagonist. Lorraine simply became a vehicle to carry out the plot, not a person I could relate to, care about, or even hate. By the latter half of the movie, I knew what to expect: Lorraine dressed to the nines and fighting with a straight face, taking a shot of vodka, and then smoking alone in her room. That's about as much variety as we get. James McAvoy, her partner, is her male counterpart - though he enjoys saying 'fuck' twice as often as she does, and his drink of choice is a shot of jack...Delphine, Lorraine's lesbian lover, is actually more interesting and likable than Lorraine herself. Unsurprisingly, the Lorraine/Delphine story line is given little to no depth and comes across as fan service. While I feel the director was going for sexy, sleek and mysterious, many key details were lost in translation. Rather than building on the characters and focusing more on delving into the story, like how Spyglass fits into the plot, the director shoves one GORY fight scene after another down our throats. If violence disturbs you, don't bother with this one. I left the theater asking myself: why did I just sit through 2 hours of seeing people brutally strangled, violently stabbed in the head with a screwdriver, knifed repeatedly, bleeding out, stabbed in the face with keys, and shot at point blank with their brains all over the wall? The brutality left me uncomfortable at, and times, nauseated. I guess it's a matter of what you find personally entertaining. But this isn't an action flick I would call 'fun', not by a long shot.",Atomic Blonde
573,michaelpaice,Dialogue Disaster,5,29 May 2019,"I expected so much more of this film. The cast and the reviews suggested that the film would be a well crafted piece of entertainment. Indeed, it was well shot and reasonably well acted. The story line was was not particularly challenging. But the dialogue - just truly awful. I cannot understand why the actors were happy to deliver the unrealistic poorly written dialogue that plagues this film almost to the point of making it unwatchable. Nobody talks like that - NOBODY. Thirty minutes in and I was struggling with it but I stuck with it to the end. My only other complaints are that the soundtrack just strikes the ear as wrong and you may end up wishing that the Soviet goons would just finish off our dreary western heroes/heroines. Not up to much but worth watching if you don't want to rewatch one of your action/spy movie favourites (something this movie is unlikely to become).",Atomic Blonde
574,sarahbesic-06842,Pretty wretched opus!,3,20 June 2019,"One can make a great motion picture based on a graphic novel, however, one can as well make a pig's ear out of it, as happened here. A printed comic strip is something totally different than a feature-length big-screen epic. Specious and superficial characters, played barely convincing, a possibly substantial plot, sadly completely over-dramatized, at times implausible and embedded in a (for no reason and roughly negligently) historical incorrectly shown environment, a washy blend of hardly recognizable climaxes, in contrast a needless series of revelations, meant to be a stylistic device and almost childish, clumsy dialogues which try to impress the audience and, last but not least, a technically poor adaptation of the original visual aesthetics.

The best thing about the movie was the action hands down but good action doesn't equal good plot.,Atomic Blonde
578,krapfhomes,Wish There Was an 11th Star,10,1 October 2018,"This film is almost too good, if that's even possible, but it is. Start to finish the actors and director just crushed it. Its extremely rare when a graphic novel adaptation is as good as the source material, let alone surpasses it. The only other instance I can recall is V for Vendetta. Well, Atomic Blonde is better than The Coldest City. The source material is great, but so much more can be done with film, and this one does all of it very, very well.People have compared it to James Bond or Jason Bourne, but honestly, its better than any of them, if for only one simple reason: its rated R. There is a degree of realism that can be dialed into an R rated movie that just typically goes out the window in a PG-13 film. Life isn't typically rated PG-13, and consequently there are places you just can't go in such a film that life often leads.As a period piece, its spectacular. If you grew up in the '80s you'll certainly appreciate it. It was a killer decade for music, and some really great songs are incorporated into this film to an extent that they become an intrinsic part of it. The use of 'Til Tuesday's Voices Carry is particularly well done, because the lyrics work on so many levels. She's having a relationship with another spy, she isn't who you think she is, the relationship is with another woman, etc.As a spy film it does subterfuge really well, and if you don't think so, you missed it the first time, so watch it again. Little gestures, looks, etc. take on new meaning once you know what's really going on. Was she taken aback by the information she was just given, or was she worried she'd been found out? It also does what all good spy movies must do: there's a big unanswered question at the end. Did she knowingly get Gascoine killed? BUT, its not so steeped in subterfuge that it becomes hard to follow, as some spy films do (Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy comes to mind). As an action film, people compare it to John Wick a lot, but honestly, its better. The action feels more realistic and less rehearsed. I really liked John Wick, but it takes a backseat to Street Kings as Keanu Reeves's best performance I think. The continuous shot stairwell fight scene is one of the best ever caught on film, maybe THE best. It is absolutely brutal, and likely the most realistic portrayal of a life and death fight where nothing is off limits, and the heroine does whatever is necessary to win and live. Charlize Theron 1,000% sells herself as a badass. Its easy to pretend you can fight while taking no real damage; its quite another to get beat up so bad your hair is tinged with blood from how many times you got hit in the face. Crawling across broken glass to pick up a corkscrew you're going to use to stab a man to death pretty much sums it up. This is a must see, and likely you'll want to watch it a couple times. I'm tentative, but psyched for the sequel. If they don't fall into the typical sequel trap (more action, bigger, badder, etc.) it could be awesome as a '90s period piece. The combination of David Leitch's directorial skills, Charlize Theron's acting & fighting chops, and a great supporting cast seems impossible to go astray. Here's hoping lightning can strike twice.",Atomic Blonde

And if you think it's nothing to do with misogyny, you're either ignorant, a liar or a misogynist. It's just like when the Star Wars fan-boys got their Y Fronts in a twist over Daisy Ridley. They can't accept a strong female lead in an action movie. No spoilers here, but those who say the character Lorraine is written as ""one note"" and ""typically cold as ice with no emotions"" and :a sub-par James Bond"" (things I've seen written on this very website) either didn't see the same movie I saw today or simply weren't paying attention. Plot points aside (you can read the entire plot on other websites, which, if I were you, I wouldn't do) Charlize Theron just kicks all kinds of ass, physically and metaphorically. If you loved her, as I did, in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (which, let's face it, she carried on her shoulders), you'll love her even more here. She's sexy, she's dangerous, she pulls you in. And damn it, this woman can ACT. She's an Oscar winner, for God's sake. I can't say enough good things about this movie.

585,greginess7878-1,IMDb Schills are at it again!,8,13 October 2017,"Okay, so I just got done watching this film. I usually don't make it a habit to leave reviews on here, but what motivated me this time was the result of reading a slew of suspicious 'one star' negative reviews from people who have left extremely vague comments.I found it very odd (to say the least) that on all of these so-called one-star negative reviews, nobody bothered to write any specific information concerning the plot of the reason for the negative reviews on these critiques, but merely just wrote generic insults such as 'this was a waste of time', or 'two hours I can't get back', etc. what's even odder, the vast majority of said reviewers have only been IMDb members for about a month. Funny, that! Now, I'm not saying that 'Atomic Blonde' is on par with Citizen Cane, but it was written well enough, had a lot of tense action-packed moments to keep one interested throughout, and in addition to this...had a lot of twists and turns to the plot to make the story very engaging! Any review on IMDb that tries to malign the film without providing specific enough examples that actually proves that the writer of said review actually saw the film should automatically raise red flags. So what was it this time? Some sort of anti-lesbian cabal who have made it a mission to lower the IMDb score as much as they can in order to preserve the traditional family ideals? Seriously, this is getting to be a joke! So for those out there who want a genuine review from someone who actually saw this... I think that this film is a breath of fresh air. This is one of those rare films that had truly mastered the art of suspense. Not only that, but it was so well written, that the end reveal of the true antagonist packed that final unexpected blow that I very rarely get from the plethora of predicable plots that are floating around out there.So to all of you mysterious 'anti-Atomic Blonde' crusaders/Facebook group/posse out there: chill out! Just have faith in the fact that there are intelligent people out here in the world that can make up their own mind when it comes to film critique, and that don't need to be influenced by some bizarre propaganda from people who have never even watched this movie.

Unfortunately the rest of the cast was disappointing within this simple plot. you will enjoy some nice cinematography during the intense combat fights, which is the gem of the whole film. overall acting was bad, mostly overacted either bei the actor or the screenplay itself. 
They obsiously didn't have anyone for research, as I noticed the horrible way they implemented german language into the film. The german speaking by english actors was bad and barely understandable. Also the german writings on the protesters signs were wrong and awful. if a movie is happening during a historical event, why are we seeing a german population based on 80% punks?! And by the way, punks don't usually dance to american rap music.
So what else do we get? For our ears, we receive some cheesy 80s music, which doesn't really show off what germans actually listened in the radio.

603,vintagewhatever,Atomic Bomb,2,30 July 2017,"From the first scene of the movie it is clear that this will be more about Charlize Theron being hot that it will be about a female led action movie. She is in a tub naked icing herself down. She is slightly battered and slightly bruised. Nothing that would indicate serious injury or more important make her less attractive. I have no doubt the executives told Charlize that she could be the lead of an action movie, but she would have to be naked throughout the movie. The script itself is dull and unoriginal. The movie is stylish and Charlize is naked often, has naked lesbian sex scenes and she wears thigh high boots and garter belts in the fight scenes. It is more porn than plot. Rather than show a woman using intelligence or creativity to fight men, it rather implausibly has you believe that a woman would have the same strength as a man. It is almost comical to see this slight woman take a punch from a man or knockout a guy or have the strength to choke a guy or throw him. The fight scenes have a lot of Charlize grunting and sickening violence to make you forget how unrealistic it would be even for a male action movie. The film is meant to be more porn than ""girl power"" including the scene where a woman is strangled to death on a bed in lingerie. If this is what female led action movies are going to be like, I hope they fail.",Atomic Blonde
604,lizztiff-61683,Wasted almost 2 hours of life on this stinker,1,6 August 2017,"I can watch 1980s music videos without going to a movie theater. Charlize Theron was made up to look like Debra Harry's twin, but for all the music from that era that was included in the film not one Blondie single & the film was filmed in the style of a moody 1980s music video, think Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, & The Clash. At first I thought wow nice cinematic tribute to the 1980s music scene, but after an hour of grueling chase and fight scenes, a weak story line that just droned on and on & an obviously gratuitous lesbian sex scene I just wanted this stinker to end but there was still another hour left! It's going to be at least a couple of months before I can go sit in a movie theater again, shame on this film for using a very good actress & some killer vintage music to make this horrendous stink bomb.",Atomic Blonde
605,dintjommi,Smoke and mirrors,4,4 November 2017,"There is no story, no characters and not much action. I like the fight scenes, but they are only 2-3 minutes. I guess this is what the audience wants, people posing with a gun in 1 hand and a cigarette between their bruised lips. Also a bit of lesbian action and some casual ice baths for the hardened super agent. If you want to see a good film on DDR, i suggest ""Das Leben der Anderen"" , which is *****infinitely****** better than this stylish garbage heap of junk-food-film. And if you like spies and agents, i guess ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""from 2011, or any old classic will be better, like: ""The Day of the Jackal"", ""The Forth protocol"" or even any BOnd or Bourne film, for that matter.

""Atomic Blonde"" attempts to create a new ultra-hip English spy heroine and falls completely flat at every turn. The plot wasn't overtly complicated, but my lack of interest in the characters and their dilemmas made it seem incredibly long and tedious. Only one aspect of the film stands out, and that is the handful of beautiful nude scenes of the aging (but still stunning) Charlize Theron. It seems that the director put his best work into the lighting, framing and cinematography of these scenes, and that is probably why the rest of the film falls apart. I honestly was so bored, I only made it about halfway through the movie, and turned it off - and even the possibility of more nudity from the beautiful Ms. Theron wasn't enough to keep me watching.",Atomic Blonde
607,dgillog,"Some great action scenes, meh everything else",4,10 January 2018,"The beginning of the movie was painful. The post-production blue hue was an eye sore, and from then I realized this was film desperately wanted to be like a Nicholas Winding Refn film. But it simply wasn't. I noticed too many times, a harsh light coming out of nowhere and taking over the shot. Few shots were well framed (although a few were). And it didn't choose either stark minimalism or intricate detail (which can both be found in Refn's films). I'd say it very much failed in this artistic attempt. Most of the action scenes were ok, but the one during the protest actually really surprised me. The ""long"" takes didn't seemed forced and flowed very well. This is the biggest saving element of this film. Granted, some of the usual cliches exist, but they didn't get in the way too bad. The biggest issue I had with the action scenes, is I never felt they main character was ever in any real danger. There are several huge issues I have other than the Refn-esque portion. The interrogation room scenes were all quite bad. Toby Jones and John Goodman (the interrogators) both had wasted roles. Why bring in people that can play such dynamic characters for the blandest roles? But some of the plot twists were exceedingly forced and painful to watch. The soundtrack was rarely all that fitting, but it seems that's the way a lot of action movies are going now. There were a few really poorly executed flashback sequences.",Atomic Blonde

I mean what was the point of the film - I may as well just google ""hot pictures"" of Charlize and call it a day because the directors didn't know how to follow along a cohesive storyline.

Even so, this movie is awful on many other levels, starting with the non-existence of a decent plot. I haven't read the book (or the cartoon?) but this movie definitely did not made sense. I have waited for a twist for the entire length of the movie. SPOILER: it came, but did not make much sense. Who is this woman? Who does she work for? Why was Percival the way he was? Maybe he got so accustomed to Berlin's duality, he developed a duality on his own. Who knows? And, also, who cares? This movie was a total waste of time. I watched because Charlize and James McAvoy are terrific actors; well, usually. In this movie, Theron overacted her part, and she seemed extremely fake. But, let me be fair, I did manage to stick to the end. So that must count as something. And also, if you want to see Charlize Theron in a lot of different designer clothes I could recommend the movie, though I'm still perplexed as to how she managed to bring all those clothes, which included multiple shoes, boots, and coats, in two tiny bags into Germany. Ps. what was the deal with the Queen song 'Under Cover' in the last scene? Not that I am not a fan of the song but it totally did not fit the mood of the scene.

630,calebhgeorge,Atomic Blonde is a stunningly stylized action spy thriller that sets the tone for female driven narratives.,8,26 July 2017,"I had the pleasure of seeing Atomic Blonde at an advanced screening and it did not disappoint. Atomic Blonde (based off the graphic novel The Coldest City) excels in near precision visual style and complicated yet understandable plot dynamics. Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) is an MI agent sent to Berlin at the turn of the Berlin Wall being brought down. Her mission is to find a list being sold to Russia with every secret agent name and... to possibly find the double agent looking to sell it. Her mission leads her to David Percival (James McAvoy), another MI agent who has settled into the deep underworld of the 80's Berlin scene. Broughton quickly get wrapped up in the Russia/Berlin conflict while battling another possible double agent looking to sell her out.Theron is amazing. Her gum shoe noir style is compellingly cool and brilliantly balanced with sudden sparks of non-stop action. The long take fight scenes are painstakingly real to the point where as a viewer you are exhausted for the characters. The third act is near constant action with camera angles and tracking shots that take a page out of Children of Men. To compare the fight scenes to John Wick would be apt but Atomic Blonde is not a carbon copy of John Wick but an expansion.McAvoy is exceptionally charming, smart and charged. He's created a character, in a world where all characters can't be trusted, that bends the line of whether the viewer can love or hate him. He's devilishly good.The soundtrack is another character within the film and provides both a contextual background (1980's Berlin) and complements the already overpowering (in all the bests ways) visual style. Atomic Blonde managed to take all the best songs of the 80's and seamlessly upgrade them to both a new generation while also invigorating the old.While the plot can be hard to follow and complicated a la Tinker Tailor Solider Spy, but it all cleans up nicely and by the third act, you can sit back and enjoy riveting non stop action. If you ever ask yourself while watching, ""Am I going to understand this?"" You will. Sit tight and know the plot works itself out.The wonderfully stylized visuals, sleek nostalgic soundtrack and brilliant acting make Atomic Blonde one of the best films of the summer 2017 season and continues the trend for mid-budget, dark action flicks.",Atomic Blonde
631,darkhorizons13,Comic book violence with a formulaic plot straight out of the graphic novel/comic,6,24 December 2017,"This film has a specific target demo and it caters to this audience rather well. Sure some would call it derivative of Sin City but lacking plot others would argue that this is a brilliant homage to the source material that suffers from the same thing all action heavy films do, small continuity goofs but certainly makes up for it with its pacing. Admittedly each character is a stereotype but considering most have very little dialogue short introduction, it is a great use of those stereotypes; you know exactly who every one is ;)Our heroine is a stoned faced spy being debriefed and the room has that air of suspicion directed right at her. We follow her recount of events with splices back and forth of the debrief. This to me was well intersected and allowed for some scenes to resonate and also allowed for some witty dialogue in between a rather seriously toned narrative. The stereotypical characters played by some brilliant choices in casting definitely sells what you are watching (type casting acts as a reference to the stereotype they are portraying and have played before elsewhere)
But the part that makes this film for me is the conclusion, some would disagree but if you like comics, animations or just action films with beautiful cinematography you will lean toward my opinion here.I will be adding this to my indulgence playlist of bad-ass action film",Atomic Blonde

But a spy story gets twisted and twirled and drags itself for almost two hours that feel like five. Theron lovelily models 6 models of autumn/winter wear sets - trenches, boots and in between (collection vintage 2017) which miraculously fit in a tiny hand luggage - cabin size trolley (please let me know the model - I'll take it for any price). That fashion show is elegantly combined with nicely lit nude scenes. So no complaints about that. Her acting is impeccable too.

Every single frame has someone lighting, flicking, sucking, and spewing plumes of smoke all over the damn place. My eyes burned just watching. It is literally a 2 hour chain smoke.

648,trmoore-61899,More of a rental movie than a theater movie,4,2 August 2017,"I never thought I would see this movie until about two weeks before it came out in theaters. I saw a trailer when I attended the Planet of the Apes movie, and was very intrigued. The previous trailers hadn't peaked my interest, but this one did, so there I was watching the movie.The plot itself is very interesting, full of twists and turn that keep you confused and interested, trying to figure out what is going on. It had a bunch of different speeds to it, going very slow and then jumping into a high stakes action sequence that was very well done. Where it went wrong is that they overused so many things, such as the action and sex. The action, while good, seemed like the same fight sequences over and over again. They would fight, get beat up, and move on in the plot until the next brawl where the same thing would happen.As for performances, I thought James McAvoy, John Goodman, Toby Jones, and Sofia Boutella did a great job with their roles, McAvoy clearly stealing the show. He was the best part about this movie in my opinion, playing his part to perfection and then some. The biggest disappointment to me in this movie was Charilze Theron. I heard so much on various media platforms on how she was so amazing in this movie and it was one of her best performances ever, and I just didn't see it. She did well in the action scenes she took part in, but her overall acting job was just meh.Overall, this is a solid movie. Good action and interesting plot plus good performances from secondary characters made this definitely a movie I would have rented for a dollar or two, or wait for it to come out on Netflix or HBO. But the repetitiveness of the action, overemphasizing the sex to keep people interested, and sub par acting performance by Charlize Theron made this a movie that I regret seeing in theaters.",Atomic Blonde

The issue comes down to a needlessly confusing plot with very little at stake, and not enough exposition to keep the audience interested. The Bad: A GOOD spy thriller leads a bit ahead of the audience, but keeps them engaged with little 'catch up' moments so they stay into it. This one basically lets you sit confused for 2 hours and then wraps it up and tosses in some more questionable story in at the last moment. The Good: Everything else. Charlize was great, the soundtrack was best supporting actor, it's gritty, cool, stylish and fun. It has possibly the best melee action sequence i've ever seen on film in terms of gritty realism and long take to make it seem SO brutal and painful. That scene alone is worth a rental.Honestly, if this movie had a good, let alone great script it would be a 9. But alas, this was a bit half cooked.

I did get confused here and there, but everything makes sense in the very end. It keeps you guessing till the very end, and it will blow your mind.",Atomic Blonde
659,enzoratti,BLONDES HAVE FUN KICKING ASS,10,18 December 2017,"I probably wouldn't like this movie if Charlize wasn't in it. She's like a walking fashion layout, from every angle of her face, her smoldering eyes, to the stylish outfits she wore. Nobody does it hotter! The movie has probably the best fight scenes i've ever seen a woman do, that didn't involve high wires, or fancy special effects or CG. Some other great hand to hand combat chick scenes are Kill Bill, Haywire, Salt. But Atomic Blonde has to be the best. That stairway fight scene was nicely directed, no music, just raw fighting..pretty awesome.
Some people may not be into it because of the endless music, the plot, or whatever. Maybe it's too stylized European for the average Joe. Music in every scene might be some sort of the trend as someone mentioned in Guradians of the Galaxy (i haven't seen it). I did see Baby Driver, & it seems to work. Granted the music was good in that movie, as well as Atomic Blonde. Some people were confused by the plot. Charlize is looking for a list of double agents- that's it! If you didn't get the ending, then this movie is definitely not for you. 
But i'm hoping for a sequel!",Atomic Blonde

I like the gay storyline as its different, she obviously looks gorgeous as ever and seems to be convincing in any character she's given. 
James macavoy is a personal favourite anyway, but he is also a great ""bad guy"" and love his scenes. 
The film had me guessing right the way through and LOVE the ending.

666,demercel,Chuck Norris - femme fatale mix,5,20 August 2017,"When I read about the movie, I expected something like Kingsmen or Men from U.N.C.L.E. - contemporary image of an previous era spy movie. Instead Atomic Blonde is some feminist lesbian fetish with main goal to get even for every male-lead-role spy movie in the world. Charlize Theron character is a kick-ass chick, who is so over the top better than any adversary, that it is ridiculous, it almost make you root for the bad guys. Usually action movies have some main bad character, boss enemy, who is difficult to beat and makes the audience uncertain and wishing the happy ending. But for that to work there should be some challenge, some difficulties for the main character. Not for the atomic blonde however. She is a mix of perfect qualities - irresistibly attractive, better in hand-to-hand combat than any of selected male twice as heavy KGB agents and of course smarter than any friend or foe. To make the feminist/lesbian image of a spy movie perfect there are is more however: * She has sex with the only other noticeable female character, that makes them close and kind of two-girls-against-the-whole-world * She is so hot and sensual when she is interrogated by her colleagues, that they look weak and pathetic * The previous was obviously not telling enough for her superiority, so they have to made her boss a midget-like type, who is made uncomfortable by her attractiveness and dominance. If after all this someone still has any doubts who is on top there is the scene where her boss says ""I am your superior"" and she answers that he is not with such contempt and disgust that the viewer has to be convinced how the whole idea of an male to be superior to woman is absurd. As a result instead female James Bond (if you look at the poster the James in James McAvoy is written in a font very similar to James Bond typography and under it is the word Blonde :) ) you get some kind of Chuck Norris kind of impossibly tough femme fatale. On the bright side the film have some good points - the soundtrack and camera work are really good, but this can not compensate for the lack of suspense, mediocre story and superwoman type of main character.",Atomic Blonde

I'm not a fan of the 'third party storytelling' technique. Not the way to go for AB2, but the fight scenes are the best EVER! Bar none - and I've seen a lot of action movies. I honestly have not seen a movie with more realistic, graphic, to-the-death fight scenes - man or woman. Great action movie and if Charleze was younger, she would have made a good 009 character.

674,silverwood-24288,"Not a comedy, but a laffer!",4,28 September 2020,"I like almost all of Charlize's movies but this is the exception.
The storyline seems lifted from a satire about spy movies and would be much better suited to a Johnny English movie. Most of the movie is devoted to scenes of Charlize beating a large chunk of the KGB and the East German police force into submission. Lucky for her that no matter the numbers that attack her, they politely wait their turn to engage in combat. The results are reminiscent of the early Batman show. The protagonist engages in a knock down fight with one villain and in spite of barely surviving, is suddenly rejuvenated in order to fight the next guy.
There are plot twists at the end which would be unbelievable to anyone not brain dead. Frankly a very disappointing movie!!!",Atomic Blonde

677,AdMaj_83,An hyper-convoluted slog,1,12 October 2019,"Bad direction, constantly disturbing camera movements, monotone acting, irrelevant sex, sudden voice over telling the audience what already happened.I honestly hated the soundtrack, the songs. Music reminiscent of the 70th, with Yamaha and Roland standard sounds, The beat is drum programmed to repeat the pattern endlessly. Monotone songs mix often with the dialogue. There is plenty of it throughout the film. With the over the top camera movements, killing tension and distracting the audience.Computer post-prod software does the rest. With no plots and plenty of confusing twists, I didn't know if I was watching a parody-remake of early Sergio Leone Spaghetti westerns, choreographed by Jacky Chan fighting directors.The Atomic Blonde attacks, smashes one, gets smashed and everyone bleeds. Meanwhile the others wait in turns to smash, be smashed, occasionally back to life to attack again. No matter how badly hurt, with plenty of made up blood all over she is instantly ready to repeat the same battle in another landscape and different enemies.This Atomic Bombe kills seven and more though guys no problems, she is unbreakable, as 1 minute later in the next scene she kills another dozen, to later fly down in a river. This after a multiple fight where she kills several with everything at hand, attempting to escape to West Berlin stealing a police car.Many ante-litteram subs lookalike smash her FIAT 125 (the standard police car in the iron curtain at the time) and, of course, she survives. Till a last sub pushes her to the bottom of a river, she attempts to save her crucial passenger, in spite of her bleeding injuries from head to toes. All this takes minutes of screen time under water, telling us shew isn't just invulnerable, but also amphibian, She fails to save him and finally gets away.Well if you really want to watch a truly bad film this ""jewel"" will be on top of your film list.Go and enjoy.

This was one of the most laughable, cringe worthy, and boring films I have seen this year. Im not exaggerating. I literally tried to fall asleep in the cinema because I was so bored. The film barely gripped me. At the beginning I was intrigued, however after twenty to thirty minutes there was no hope.The film relies heavily on aesthetic than plot. Maybe if they focused more on plot, it wouldn't have felt so messy in the middle. The music was great, but after a while it became tedious, as every scene had an 80's hit playing over the top. The style of the film, in terms of the lighting and the shots, was interesting at the start. But, it soon felt very 'done before' and unoriginal. There was just nothing exciting about it. Lastly, the acting was alright, there were great actors in the film. I just can't get over the cringe that James Macavoy brought to the film. 'I f*cking love Berlin!'...Really? I winced when he said that, probably a part of the writers problem to be fair.Overall, I can understand why this could be enjoyable for comic/action movie goers.

712,alisonchristine,The Feminist's Answer to the Classic Spy Thriller!,6,6 July 2017,"Set just days before the fall of the Berlin Wall Charlize Theron plays Lorraine Broughton a MI6 Agent who is sent to West Berlin to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents that was stolen from the agent at the time of his murder. Theron's Lorraine Broughton is the feminist's answer to James Bond. Sheis as witty, clever, and rebellious as Bond with the added athleticism and sex appeal that Theron brings to any of her turns on the silver screen. Atomic Blonde is fast paced, gritty and violent. The cinematography brings a realistic and at times playful atmosphere to an extremely violent and thrilling game of spies and covert dealings. The screen writing of Atomic Blonde is masterful. It pulls you in and leaves you guessing. Throughout the nearly two hour run of the movie finding the identity of the murderer is a question that keeps the watcher at the edge of their seat. The soundtrack of Atomic Blonde adds a quirky and playful atmosphere to an otherwise dark film. With the combination of sound, cinematography and acting one must really give around of applause to director David Leitch for bringing yet another action filled ride of a film that is at times touching, silly, and full of adventure. Now that I've praised this spy thriller lets discuss the down falls. While the performances by Theron and McAvoy cannot be classified as anything but impressive and the action scenes are some of the best I have seen since the Bourne films the plot can be a bit confusing for the average viewer at points. There are so many twists and turns throughout the film that to one who just wants to view a fun action packed film it could become a bit frustrating. However, despite the down sides of the quite complex plot the film its self is a daring step forward for the spy thriller genre. This film shows the length one will take to complete a mission by any means necessary. If you enjoyed the Daniel Craig James Bond movies or the Bourne Identity films then I would recommend this film to you as this film is like James Bond or Jason Bourne Plus! It has much more graphic and very well- choreographed fight scenes, more blood, loads of guns and tons of spy games!Content Warning: (This section will feature some SPOILERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!)Sex & Nudity  In the opening scene Theron's character is bare chested and her breasts are visible in the mirror reflection. Theron's character is shown getting out of an ice bath and sitting on the edge,when she turns to the side her breast and nipple and bare buttocks are shown. Theron's character is shown in a scene with another woman,breasts are visible during this scene and the women grope each other quite suggestively. This is a girl on girl sex scene so if you are sensitive to sexually explicit scenes avoid this film. Violence & Gore The film has two scenes that feature individuals being hit by cars. As this is an action film there are numerous gun fights that feature gratuitous amounts of blood. There are also scenes that feature hand to hand combat and graphic fight scenes with found objects. There are also some brutal on scene beatings. All deaths are shown on screen there are no cut a ways from the carnage. Profanity  Profanity is used throughout the entire movie. Though none of the language used felt out of character or unneeded; though if you are sensitive to language you could find the language to be overwhelming. Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking  Theron's character drinks vodka quite often and she smokes throughout the film, and several scenes take place in bars where there is drinking and smoking take place. Frightening/Intense Scenes  As previously mentioned there are quite a few graphic scenes in this film. If you are sensitive to blood or graphic images including gun shots, car accidents, stabbings, being enclosed in small spaces, beatings and fighting in general this film really is not for you.Atomic Blonde (2017) Director: David Leitch Starring: Charlize Theron & James McAvoy Run Time: 1h 55min.

Whilst this film is not an all time classic (hence the 9 rather than 10) or about to win an Oscar for the most heart felt 'put me to sleep' sort of movie; it excels in every other way. The action was non stop and simply brutal at times; on a few occasions throughout this movie I said the word 'ouch'... Charlize truly kicked butt in this film (And her performance truly surprised me). I also loved the cinematography - it has a different feel to everything else out there but in a really refreshing way.So, if you're kind of person who could easily watch John Wick and would find the idea of watching la la land etc = death; watch this film!!!",Atomic Blonde

But eventually, it even turned out to be more disappointing than I would have ever expected. The story line is rather boring. Also the play of the cast is way below its real potential. Also, I was surprised about the poor German skills of the German characters (e.g. the Stasi spy's German skills were poorer than those of C. Theron). Although I know that for a great part these roles are not played by native German actors. But why didn't Til Schweiger play the role of Merkel or the Stasi spy? In my perspective, C. Theron's acting as well as the music are perhaps the only good things worth pointing out about this movie. It would be unfair to compare this one with the two John Wick movies, especially not John Wick 1.",Atomic Blonde

I also didn't mind all the swearing. This is an R rated film after all. Are you really surprised?The music and lighting in the movie was wonderful.

722,bristoldega,"Great, believable, period correct movie!",10,30 July 2017,"A lot of people are giving this movie bad reviews because they went in expecting John Wick, Jason Bourne, or Mission Impossible when it's not trying to be any of those. What it is, is an accurate and believable Cold War espionage story taking place in Berlin mere days before the wall coming down. I was a young freshly minted soldier (and later stationed in Germany not long after the wall came down) at the time the movie takes place and remember the time and music very well, and this movie is spot on with several actual events. If you read any history about the espionage on both sides of the wall during this time, you'll see where the actual techniques and methods used by real spies on both sides are portrayed in this movie with incredible attention to detail. Also, the good guy (or girl in the case with Charlize Theron) doesn't kick the bad guys asses and walk away without a scratch, she and James Macavoy both get banged and bruised up even though they win the fight, as in real life.This movie is far from boring, as it keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire two hours, while making you think and keeping you guessing all the way. If you go into it expecting unrealistic, fantasy fueled escapes and fight scenes, you'll be disappointed. But if you go into it with an open mind and expecting realism with time period correct music, equipment, style and techniques, you won't be disappointed.",Atomic Blonde

AWESOME.I'm a big fan of James Bond movies, and, for all intents and purposes, this was the female equivalent. The story occurs in 1989 Berlin, with the back-drop of the Berlin Wall coming down, and the Iron Curtain beginning to crumble.The fight scenes are gritty, intense, and realistic, the action swift and surprising, and the accompanying soundtrack, some of the best tunes from the late '80's, adds a dimension of energy that soundtracks rarely achieve. The lead character, Broughton, expertly played by Charlize Theron, is a cross between Pat Benatar and Blondie's Debbie Harry.In keeping with the James Bond tradition, there's plenty of glamour, drinking, unusual characters, and romance, albeit Broughton is bisexual, which adds a twist.Not seen in the Bond films is a dizzying array of cross and double-cross intelligence agents who, at times, are simultaneously trying to help Broughton and kill her. Brave, indomitable, and a hell of a fighter (again, the fight scenes are intense), whether you like her or not as a person, you have to respect Broughton's determination. The cross and double-cross motif endures to the end of the film, with a surprise hard-turn at the very end, which veers this story solidly into its own franchise, forever distinct from the James Bond inheritance.Sexy, brooding, dark, and sharply executed, if you like the world of espionage, and the people dedicated enough to play the game, you'll deeply appreciate this very fine film.",Atomic Blonde
725,nbstruble,"A great movie, as long as you remember what it is.",7,1 August 2017,"This review is more a counter argument against the overly low ratings and negative criticism I have seen in the past few days about Atomic Blonde.For those who have not read the description Atomic Blonde stars Charlize Theron as an Mi6 agent sent to Berlin during the cold war to recover a file containing all the names of every double agent currently in the field. The first thing I think you should know about this movie is it's genre because it is horribly mislabeled on the IMDb page.Atomic Blonde is not really a mystery, it's an action/ultra-violence/rampage movie, and it fulfills each of these descriptions wonderfully. The action is undoubtedly ultra-violent, refreshingly believable and comprises around seventy percent of the run time. I read through many user and critic reviews of this film, and one of the recurring complaints is that Atomic Blonde is light on plot, and the characters are underdeveloped. These criticisms are perfectly justified in this movie, but the counter argument is the classic ""well what did you expect?"" The plot is one you have seen before countless times in many other spy films, but the plot is so very much not the point. If this is a major factor then Atomic Blonde is definitely not the movie for you, and that is perfectly alright, but don't be too swayed by people who left remarkably poor reviews because they didn't like what it focused on. The majority of the posters for the movie are of a single shot where Charlize Theron is kicking a man down the stairs while another bleeds out painfully behind her. This basically summarizes the whole movie, and most certainly isn't suggesting a plot rich experience or thorough character development. These are perfectly reasonable things to dislike in a movie, but I can't help comparing it to the complaint of ""man this Thai food sucks. It doesn't taste at all like mesquite barbecue."" The food is not necessarily bad just because it isn't the type of food you like. That said the next thing I'd like to talk about is what Atomic Blonde does right.As I said above this movie is absolutely deserving of it's description. The fight scenes are fantastically choreographed as they are clear to follow, meaningful to the characters (blows have a clear effect, and changes how they approach the fight going forward) and above all it is very believable. All too frequently movies are falling into the hyper comic book/cartoon violence that is becoming more and more prominent with the marvel movies popularity (never a bad time to fit in a jab at the avengers) This isn't saying that Atomic Blonde is some revolutionary counter culture commentary on the action genre, see Mad Max Furry Road for that business, but it is nice to see something different every now and then. Charlize Theron is a fitting cast for a bad ass destroyer of men, and seems like she actually put some work in at the gym for the role.All and all the good things about Atomic Blonde are really confined to the action category, and most of the praise goes to the director for the cinematography, but that's all a movie of this genre really needs. As an action/ultra-violence/rampage movie it ranks very high up in my book. If you compare it to other movies coming out then no it might not be my favorite, but at that rate all we are really doing is confusing a movie's quality with our own personal preference of genre. Just because you don't like Thai doesn't mean it is bad Thai",Atomic Blonde
726,shineug,Not even DVD worthy,1,1 August 2017,"I fell asleep during the movie.Maybe it was the cushy reclining movie chairs that did it but there was really no way to avoid how unbelievably boring this movie was.Plot holes, cinematic discrepancies, bad story connections, poorly devised characters in which we don't even know who they are as if the writers and producers make the assumption that we the audience know. This is a graphic novel adaptation of ""The Coldest City"". Perhaps they took a few liberties with the source material as Hollywood always does but with this, at least give us some insight into who this Atomic Blond is and what she stands for and what she's about.It was supposed to be a spy drama that's got this girl-power attitude. It was gritty and that's the look they wanted to go for, then yea, it has grit. But it's all due to the backdrop of the end of the Cold War. Shades of gray, blue and red light district red with hints of purple and such all displayed within the fall of the Communism in Germany back in 1989. Probably the only redeeming character of the movie is the city of Berlin itself but that's the only character worth noting if at all.All in all, this is a dud of a movie. Charlize Theron isn't convincing me of her being a BAMF. James MacAvoy comes across as the same old type-casted character, the super dramatic, overly emotive, Brit with fun one liners. Watch anything of him from Last King of Scottland to Wanted to this and he's the same cookie cutter type character. Exaggerated emotions and super dramatic and it's the same old droll.I did fall asleep for about 10 minutes so I probably missed some plot points but here's the thing and you need to pick up on this... I FELL ASLEEP!!!! If this was supposed to be an epic movie, it failed.Avoid. Save your ticket and popcorn money for something more productive like pay your bills or something... do something else like mow your lawn or finish your laundry load... do anything but see this movie because, if I feel asleep, then you will as well...Some people even left 40 minutes before the movie even ended that's how bad this was!!!!",Atomic Blonde

Surely many people would enjoy the sex scenes but was it necessary to turn an action film into a provocative sex movie? Have you ever James Bond walking around naked? Did Jonh Wick had any sex scene at all? They didn't need that. Besides having a girl-on-girl romance may seems to be progressive but the real question is: have you ever seen an action spy movie with gay males characters? They tried gender bending but they made it half way. The ""prize"" was still a girl to be conquered. If they wanted to be different they could have Lorraine to be a ""manizer"". Imagine if the french spy was an attractive strong male. And Lorraine approached him and grab him by the hand and lead him out. Now that would be something. The creation of ""manizer"".

But the horrendous plot and dumb characters instead have the opposite effect, making anyone who saw it extremely opposed to a female Bond character. Although Charlize Theron, James McAvoy, and John Goodman tried their best with what they had, their characters lacked the depth they were able to portray in their earlier films, which was not helped by the fact that other characters were so boring I forgot about them as soon as their specific scene ended. The plot is one of those stupidly-simple-but-told-in-a-complex-way-to-appear-cool. The lesbian scene came from nowhere, the relationship was undefined and undeveloped and its really disturbing that its the scene most critics focus on... ??

731,psto-29075,Comic book violence with no plot and a look derivative of Sin City: rubbish.,1,22 August 2017,"It's rare my wife and I walk out of a movie, but after one hour and fifteen minutes of unrelenting violence, interrupted only by a couple of minutes of lesbian sex, my wife finally declared herself unable to stomach more. I was only too happy to follow her lead. If I'd known before I bought the tickets that Atomic Blonde was based on a graphic novel (i.e. a comic book) I would never have gone - but it's billed as an Action Movie, a genre we enjoy. It's not. It's a childish procession of violence upon violence in which the heroine marches unidirectionally through a series of wastelands, assailed by an eternal parade of disposable goons, whom she dispatches routinely with bureaucratic disinterest in a variety of not especially creative ways. It's like watching a geeky friend play a long, self-absorbed game of space invaders; it loses its appeal after just a few seconds, and you start to wonder what's happening outside and whether you should find some more fun people to hang out with. Even the sex scene is clearly there only to satisfy the starved lust of the teenaged boys this movie addresses. 'Let's take a break from the faux kung fu and double handed pistol work, lads, here's a couple of hot naked chicks! Oh no, it's bed time...'Atomic Blonde lacks the charm, humour and suspense of the classic action movies, The Bourne Identity, the Best Bonds (Casino Royale, Goldfinger...), Die Hard, take your pick... If only it were held together by some kind of story, some essence of danger, or an original idea, or even one character for whom one could care, it might make a difference. Of course, there are none of the above. What's this 'List' they're all worked up about? Is it the same 'List' as in the first Mission Impossible? So why can't they make it fun like that one? Charlize Theron is a terrific actress and jaw-droppingly beautiful, but she stalks through this movie stone-faced and bored and without a single good line to make her interesting (in fact the dialogue overall is just awful). Every character is a stereotype, none of them original, and I cannot remember one single line - if there were any. Technically it's well shot, lit and equipped, but the Sin City atmosphere has been done before. The stunts are generally well done - but we've seen them all before.

It tries to be stylish with long lingering shots of Charlize and Berlin, but this does not count as character development.If you are expecting an action film, you aren't going to get it, well, not until the last third. You are also not going to get an art-house spy movie, though that is what it looks like it is trying to be. For the first two thirds of the movie, you get a lot of confusing convoluted ""plot"" that is presented in such a haphazard way, that you really stop caring about why the characters do what they do.Mixed in with the overly convoluted, flashback, John Goodman spy talky bits, are overly long shots of Charlize Theron pensively drinking vodka, Charlize kicking somebody for 5 secs, then back to more flashbacks, more pensive vodka drinking, kicking someone, James McAvoy being pensive and then back to John Goodman again. This sums up pretty much the entire film, at this point.After we rinse and repeat the above (not forgetting the lesbian love scene), we get to the last third of the movie which is better paced and has a more defined sense of forward momentum and you start caring that there is ""the list"" and ""getting the package out alive"". It actually becomes a full blown action movie at this point. Who knew? It was only in these latter stages of the movie that I stopped wanting to time travel to the end. If the whole movie had been like this I would have given a solid 8/10.I can see what they tried to do with this film, but in the hands of a different director and editor, this could have been the cool, art-house, stylish, 80s music laden, action spy thriller they so desperately wanted to showcase.There are far better movies of this genre out there and nobody is more disappointed about this fact than me, as I was looking forward to seeing the movie the marketing department was promising, but never actually delivered.I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the sequel, if there is one.",Atomic Blonde
735,humanitypolitics,"good style, meh feminism / diversity, ridiculous plot",6,9 September 2017,"Here's your spoiler alert.For all the cheap thrills, Atomic Blonde was enjoyable. It was fun listening to 80's pop music and watching a hot spy (Lorraine Broughton, played by Charlize Theron) beat up men and get it on with another hot spy (Delphine Lasalle, played by Sofia Boutella), sometimes nude, and sometimes wearing fabulous vintage clothing, usually flatteringly lit by neon lights.However, the movie was a little lacking otherwise.There were twists, because spies were in it, so it had to have twists, but the twists were mostly delivered in confusingly pointless ways. Why did Broughton meet with the Soviets at the end, and wear a brunette wig, after she had not only obtained the List, but also most definitely blown her cover with the Soviets when David Percival (James McAvoy) inevitably told them she was Sachel? Just so we could see her play Russian dressup and shoot more people? She didn't trust Percival from the beginning, but didn't think to check her belongings for bugs? Wait – so what DID Lasalle tell Broughton in the beginning when Voices Carry was blasting in the background? Where did this List thing come from anyway, and isn't ""List"" more of an accurate label than a ""code name,"" and who on earth could have even known who Broughton was in order for her name to appear on it in the first place?In addition to the twists / lame excuses for stylish action sequences, the phrase, ""(pronoun) set (pronoun) up"" was overused to the point that it seemed like either the writers didn't understand the concept of being set up but really thought it was a cool thing to say, or the ""setups"" happened in scenes that got cut in editing, although the idea of editing that bad in a movie of this level is unrealistically sad.Moving on to the inclusion of diversity in Atomic Blonde, there are good and bad points to be made. One bad point is that for all the ""strength"" they gave one female character, they more than made up for it by making the other one the worst spy possible. Lasalle can't follow Broughton the way Percival can – without Broughton knowing – and even worse, she threatens Percival (one of the strange uses of the phrase ""you set me up"") before running around her hotel room in her underwear, with her headphones on and music blasting, standing in doorways with her back turned and her defenses lowered, waiting for him to come strangle her. It's a pretty common device, to make characters that are so weak, anyone else would look strong in comparison, and I guess it still works – Broughton and Percival look like masterminds compared to Lasalle.see full review at humanitypoliticsDOTwordpressDOTcom",Atomic Blonde

Atomic Blonde, based on a graphic novel The Coldest City, is directed by David Leitch and it stars Charlize Theron as the main protagonist, who is a MI-6 field agent. Set in the late 80', the action takes place in Berlin, before the collapse of the Berlin Wall. MI-6 agent Lorraine Broughton is sent there to get back the List, which contains the names of agents from both sides (Soviets and NATO) active in Berlin. She teams up with David Percival, who is a British station chief there and the spy games may begin. From close combat and pursuing to trying to save other agents, the film is quite moving and gripping. With epic combat skills of Lorraine Broughton, the film has a lot of action in it.
