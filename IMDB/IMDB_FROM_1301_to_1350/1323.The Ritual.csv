0,Leofwine_draca,Folklore horror let down by familiarity and a poor script,6,4 April 2018,"THE RITUAL is a well-regarded British horror film that feels like a kind of spiritual successor to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, although it has bits and pieces of THE WICKER MAN, RITUALS, THE WITCH and KILL LIST added to the mix too. The derivative nature of the film is one of the things I liked least about it; it peaks early on with an excellent and shocking scene in a supermarket but goes slightly downhill shortly afterwards. I do love folklore and folklore horror films - there aren't enough of them - but while this film is mildly entertaining, it fails to impress in the same way a true classic of the genre like BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW impresses. It doesn't help that the script is sub-par, reducing all of the main characters to profanity-spewing idiots who are far from sympathetic. Rafe Spall is the best of the bunch, but only because he gets proper characterisation and has most screen time. The horror elements are fun and the climax certainly offbeat, but this isn't a classic for me.",The Ritual

However, Robert is murdered in a convenience store robbery and his friend decide to hike in Sweden to honor him. But when Dom twists his knee, they decide to take a shortcut through the woods. Along their journey, they learn that they are hunted down by something. What would be the menace?""The Ritual"" is a horror film with an intriguing premise but also a poor conclusion. The screenplay keeps the tension while the viewer does not know what is happening. But the conclusion disappoints. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Ritual

One in the group was killed, and they decide to do a little memorial along the way as they hike a mountain trail in Sweden (filmed in Romania). Things go well until they feel they need to take a short cut through the dense forest where they discover the proverbial cabin in the woods. The cabin was clearly used for some pagan ritual. They get scared and want out. The film was slow in developing but wasn't boring. Rafe Spall is set up as the final guy from the beginning. There is a creature that we see at the end. Nice trees.

3,kosmasp,Into the Forest,7,4 May 2018,"So going off wandering might not always be the best idea. Especially if you have some baggage to carry (pun intended). And while we do get some flashbacks and some backstory to the characters and their motivation to go on that trip, some may feel like the rest of the story is detached from that. Don't get me wrong, it has quite a few moments, it is shocking and it is tension filled, which might make you sit at the edge of your seat.There is also the moral question and the what would you have done (that's for the inciting incident, the one that is the reason for their predicament in the first place)? It is a tough question to answer for some, though even those who may say different might have acted exactly the same way. The ending is maybe a little bit of a let down, but technically this is sound to say the least ...",The Ritual
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Terrifying, character driven scare fest.",9,2 December 2018,"The Ritual rates as one of the best horrors I will seen for ages, it's atmospheric, scary, boasts great characters and is superbly acted. I'm certain many will make comparisons to The Blair Witch, and I definitely see similarities, but this felt like it had much more depth.The beginning was very unusual, very unexpected, the middle was superb, the ending possibly the weakest element.I loved the sense of horror, the sense of claustrophobia, that feeling of impending doom, all incredibly well captured. The acting is superb, Spall, Troughton, Ali, it was nice to see so many actors from famous perform together.The beast itself was superb, absolutely terrifying, not as scary as that witch though.Powerful imagery, scared galore, feet performances combine to make a superb movie. 9/10",The Ritual
5,jboothmillard,The Ritual,5,13 July 2020,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, it's not often I see a British scary movie advertised, and one that looks good, I hoped it would be worth it. Basically, university friends Phil (Arsher Ali), Dom (Sam Troughton, Patrick's grandson), Hutch (Downton Abbey and Coronation Street's Robert James-Collier), Luke (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son), and Robert (Paul Reid) meet in a pub and discuss plans for a group lad's trip. Rob's idea of hiking in Sweden is rejected. Afterward, Luke and Rob enter a shop to buy some alcohol but interrupt a robbery in progress. Luke hides while Rob freezes in fear as the thieves antagonise him for his valuables. Luke almost intervenes but continues to hide, and the thieves kill Rob for disobeying their demands and refusing to give them his wedding ring. Six months later, the remaining four friends embark on a hiking trip in northern Sweden in Rob's memory. Almost immediately, Dom injures his knee. Hutch suggests they cut through the forest to spare Dom from suffering, rather than sticking to the longer marked trail. Upon entering the forest, the group encounter strange things, including a gutted elk hanging from several branches and strange symbols carved in the trees. Night falls and it pours with rain, forcing them to find shelter. They eventually find an abandoned cabin, which they break into to stay the night. Inside, they find necklaces bearing similar symbols and a wooden effigy of a decapitated human torso with antlers for hands. The group all experience terrifying nightmares, and they wake the next morning to find chest bleeding from strange puncture wounds and Phil kneeling naked, praying to the effigy. Disturbed and puzzled by their own unconscious actions, the group tries to find a way out. An argument occurs between Luke and Dom about their location and seeing a large figure amongst the trees. It gets personal when Dom brings up the past, calling Luke a coward for letting Rob die to save himself, escaping without any injuries himself. Later that night, Luke is suddenly woken by Phil screaming. Then Hutch goes missing, but the three get lost going deeper into the woods to find him, unable to get back to their campsite. Continuing their search and running low on supplies, they find Hutch gutted and impaled on tree branches. After giving Hutch a burial, Phil is suddenly dragged away by an unseen creature. This creature has been stalking them the entire time. Luke and Dom make a run for it, with the creature chasing them. They find a path lined with torches leading to a small settlement and rush into a cottage to hide. While barricading themselves inside, they are knocked unconscious by someone. When they wake, they find themselves restrained in a cellar. Dom is taken away and returns later beaten, he tells Luke that he is to be sacrificed to the creature. He urges Luke to find a way out and destroy the village, burn it all to the ground, before he is also sacrificed. Amidst the ritual, Dom has a vision of his wife emerging from the forest, not realising it is the creature until it impales him on a nearby tree. Desperate to escape, Luke breaks his own thumb to partially free himself from his restraints. He is interrupted by the young woman, who explains that the creature is a Jötunn, an illegitimate son of Loki and an ancient god-like entity from Scandinavian mythology. The cult provides sacrifices to it in return for freedom from pain and immortality. Luke has been chosen and is to either submit and worship to it too or be sacrificed. After she leaves, Luke fully frees himself and heads upstairs. Armed with a torch, he finds a twisted congregation of mummified worshipers. He sets them alight, burning the cabin and attracting the creature. Finding a hunting rifle, Luke heads downstairs and runs into a worshipper, he kills him and takes his axe. The enraged creature kills the young woman while Luke shoots at it and escapes. It pursues him, crippling his mind with hallucinations of Rob's killing before catching him and forcing him to his knees, offering him a chance to submit. Luke refuses to kneel to it, and strikes it with the axe, briefly incapacitating it. Luke runs towards the sunlight and emerges in an open field. The creature is unable to leave the forest, it roars in anger while Luke roars back in triumph before heading towards a paved road. Also starring Maria Erwolter as The Host, Hilary Reeves as The Curate, Peter Liddell as The Logger, Francesca Mula as The Witch, and Kerri McLean as Gayle. It is one of those old-school scary movies with familiar ingredients, friends finding a cabin in the woods, terrorised by an unseen monster, and then Blair Witch and Wicker Man elements involving a nasty cult who worship this monster. The four main leads are all good, and it does have enough eerie, psychological, and tense moments to keep you watching, a reasonable supernatural horror. Worth watching!",The Ritual
6,BandSAboutMovies,Don't go into the woods,6,22 January 2019,"Five old college old friends meet to get drunk and discuss their annual vacation together. Rob wants to hike in Sweden, but the others all make fun of him. On their way home, Luke decides to get a bottle of vodka in a convenience store. Inside, Rob is killed by criminals when he won't give up his wedding ring. Luke is too slow to help and can only watch his friend be killed. From these very urban origins, the rural horror of The Ritual begins.To celebrate their friend, the survivors take the trip he wanted to Kungsleden, or King's Trail, in Sweden's Sarek National Park. One of them hurts his knee, so they decide to take a faster path home, but start to discover strange things like animals gutted and hung from trees and strange runes carved in the trees.Seeking shelter in an abandoned house, the men discover more runes and strange statues, yet they stay there for the night. When Luke wakes from an evening of nightmares, he has puncture wounds all over his chest. As they go deeper into the forest, their feelings toward one another - some blame Luke for Rob's death - come to light. And they start getting killed off by whatever is tracking them and left hung like the animals they say before.Soon, only Luke and Dom are left and the latter has been selected as a sacrifice to the Jötunn, who takes human lives and gives immortality in return. Luke must take part in the ritual and submit to the god or die. He refuses and the creature makes him relive his nightmares again and again until he's able to fight back and make his way to the edge of the woods, a place where it loses its power. Screaming in its face, Luke has survived.Directed by David Bruckner (V / H / S, Southbound), whose work I hadn't enjoyed much until this film, this is a great throwback to 1970's occult horror. It has a dark and sinister feel from the moment everyone journeys into the forest. It doesn't hold any surprises, but that doesn't mean it's not a great ride.",The Ritual

A ""Shortcut"" through the forest turns into getting the group lost and after finding an abandon cabin to get out of the weather, a supernatural encounter causes paranoia and tense distrust among the hikers.

8,neil-476,"Goodish, but...",7,20 December 2019,"5 friends can't agree where to go on holiday. When Rob is murdered during a robbery (witnessed by one of the others who survives due to terrified inaction), the friends honour him by hiking in remote Sweden, Rob's preference, shared by no-one. It's only when they try to short cut through a forest that bad things start to happen.This film is nicely atmospheric, well cast and acted, and has a decent horror monster situation and payoff.And yet...There are few surprises but, despite that, there are unanswered questions which leave you unsatisfied. In particular, did it all happen, or was it the hallucinatory resullt of Luke's guilt? That incident was a very effective start, but never used to its full potential.",The Ritual
9,Wizard-8,"Okay, but it could have been better",5,18 February 2018,"Based on a novel, it's pretty clear that someone along the way of the making of ""The Ritual"" got their inspiration from the 1977 Canadian movie ""Rituals"". Not only are the titles of the two movies similar, but both share the theme of several middle aged men hiking in the wilderness and experiencing terror. But the movie also got some inspiration from the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"", with the supernatural touches to the narrative. Actually, the last twenty minutes or so of the movie do take a more original turn, but I'll leave you to find out what happens if you do decide to see this movie. Derivative as the movie is at times, I will admit that it is never boring, and does get you interested in watching enough to stick to the end in order to see what happens. However, there are a number of unanswered questions along the way, ranging from why the central character keeps having visions of his friend's murder to how the killings in the forest had somehow eluded the local authorities for years. Had questions like these been eventually answered, we would have possible had a compelling, if still somewhat derivative, horror movie. As it is, it's only okay, watchable, but will make you wonder several times why someone during the production did not spot the glaring unanswered questions and have them fixed before filming started.",The Ritual
10,bombersflyup,"Phil: Oh, this is awful in almost every conceivable way.",3,11 April 2018,"The Ritual is a bad film, lacking in all the areas required to be of any quality.I usually love this type of film, a group of friends on a trek or on holiday that have some sort of horrific experience. However this film had a weak story, poor characters and was completely devoid of any feeling. Starting out with the main character experiencing the death of his friend, giving the film every opportunity to expand on this and bring emotion and character depth, but it didn't as Rafe Spall's character was just deadpan throughout the film. The creature and its worshippers were uninteresting and there's no explanation to what's going on at any point, not even at the end. Luke escapes quite easily, which is just stupid and the film just ends without anything....",The Ritual
11,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Thoroughly enjoyable and chilling creature feature,9,14 October 2018,"Deciding to go on a hiking trip, a group of guys honoring the wishes of a fallen friend head deep into the Swedish forest for a few days, only to become increasingly convinced that something's out in the woods hunting them one-by-one and must find a way to escape the strange rituals awaiting them.There was a lot to really like with this one. One of it's strongest aspects is the central setup at work here, where it works several enjoyable plotlines together into a rather engaging setup. The opening in the store that spurs the motivation for their trip is a rather brutal offering that serves this one well as are the continuous flashbacks he has to relive the encounter as the reasoning used for their journey out into the woods. Once there, the film picks up incredibly well with the exploits of the group out in the middle of nowhere being confronted by an endless series of strange and otherworldly scenarios, including finding the gutted animal strung up in the tent full of pagan symbols and the utterly freaky cabin they're forced to spend the first night in where the mysterious animal statue made of bone and tree branches that looks inhuman. That this is all accompanied by the sounds of tree branches breaking off in the distance and the complete lack of animal sounds around them creates a truly terrifying scenario the deeper into the forest they travel. Once that turns into the group being aware of the creature stalking them and what they're up against, this offers up some truly chilling sequences as the night-time attack ambush on their makeshift camp where it drags away the one victim only to be found in much the same manner as the animal previously, the far-off shots of the creature following them on the trail into the woods or the spectacularly intense chase through the darkened woods using the flashlight to illuminate the way against the unseen creature crashing through the trees around them. Lastly, the film's strong mythological overtones throughout here, from the concept of the creature to the type of pagan symbols found throughout the forest that signal the ritual being held by the cultists in their compound provides this one with a stellar setup that offers up plenty of strong elements into the film. As the finale includes the fine destruction of their camp and the action of their chase through the woods, this one keeps itself moving along nicely enough that it's engaging enough to hold itself up over it's few minor flaws. The film's biggest misstep occurs in the final half when it introduces the concept of the followers out in the middle of the woods who have a connection to the creature tormenting them. This is entirely unneeded in the film which had been working along nicely with the group lost in the woods with a strange creature tailing them, and to then offer this utterly bizarre turn that undermines a lot of the atmosphere and tension seen previously in favor of an underwritten setup about the group undergoing these strange and bizarre rituals which make no sense. As well, the ending is a bit of a cheat with a rather weak resolution to it all that's way too easy and simple which really renders the climactic confrontation rather disappointing and comes about due to very little involvement with the main creature's backstory and history which is a complete unknown. These here are what hold this one back for the most part.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",The Ritual
12,Aaron1375,"Interesting horror film, but does have a few flaws",7,8 April 2018,"I caught this film on Netflix as it may have been a Netflix original. I had heard others talking about it so me and my fiance decided to watch it. What we saw kept me and her on our toes; however, there were a couple of flaws that stopped this one from being really good and turned it into just a pretty good horror film. The atmosphere is great in this one so that is not one of them. I also enjoyed the setting. No, the main flaw I had with it was near to the end as it kind of took away from some of the film and it made little to no sense in other areas. Still, there was some great build up at the beginning of the film and it had me wondering what was going on, at the end though there was just some things that made me wonder what the heck the deal was. The story has a group of friends wanting to take a trip and they think they have it decided when two liquor store where one of the friends is killed in a robbery. Flash a few months later and the remaining friends do the trip they were planning on doing as a tribute to their departed friend. Well, things are going well, that is, until one of them suffers a sprain. Instead of keeping to the path, or sending one of the three remaining who are healthy for help, they decide to do the most horror thing you can do, cut through the woods because it would cut the distance in half. Makes sense, cause woods are so easy to maneuver and staying on the path would be too hard for the friend with the sprain to traverse, better to take him through woods that have sticks, holes and all manner of things to trip on. Well, they enter the woods and soon it is becoming dark, meaning the whole shortcut is already not all that short of a cut. In the house they find a strange room and they also have bad dreams and it isn't too long after that, that something seems to begin stalking the men. They begin to know they are being stalked and soon they must try to get out of the woods and to safety before all of them get picked off!One of the main flaws I found with the story is the whole introduction of the village as there just was not enough time spent to really develop this portion of the story and it just seemed to take away from the rest of the film. I thought the film kind of went downhill during this portion, though it was still alright. I am still also not sure what the point of the one room that was set on fire was as it had like weird straw people that never were really explained. So, the film did have a great build up, develop and explain a few more things at the end and it would have been a better film in my book. The acting in it is pretty good and I liked the setting in the woods and the abandoned cabin they ran across as these places really created a nice creepy atmosphere. The creature itself was very strange looking and different. So better than a lot of films that have made it to the big screen, but it is another horror film that could have been much better with just a bit more work.",The Ritual
13,Wuchakk,"The woods are lovely, dark and... horrifying!",7,14 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 2017 and directed by David Bruckner, ""The Ritual"" is a psychological adventure/horror about four British dudes in their 30s who embark on a hike in remote northern Sweden wherein it slowly becomes evident that some THING is stalking them in the dark woods. Will any of them make it out alive? This is basically a meshing of ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) and ""Ogre"" (2008), but without the tongue-in-cheekiness of the latter. There's also a little bit of ""The Wicker Man"" (1973/2006). Like ""Blair Witch"" the foul-mouthed protagonists become increasingly horrified in the foreboding forest and eventually turn on one another. But the sylvan cinematography is leagues superior due to the spectacular Romanian locations as opposed to the pedestrian film-work of ""Blair Witch"" in Maryland (which is understandable since the latter is a ""found-footage"" flick).I'm not going to give-away the creature, which isn't fully revealed until the last fifteen minutes, but it's basically a hybrid of the monsters in ""The Relic"" (1997) and ""Wendigo"" (2001), albeit bigger, and superior to both. The second half deviates from the book and people complain about it, but it's superior to the lame black metal cult of the book IMHO and you can't beat one potent sequence that smacks of hell-on-earth. There's also an intriguing element about achieving nigh-immortality at the price of submissive veneration. Despite these positives, the movie's a little uneventful and humdrum, plus it's lacking in the female department. The movie runs 1 hour 34 minutes and was shot entirely in Romania. WRITERS: Joe Barton wrote the script based on Adam Nevill's 2012 novel. CAST: The four protagonists are played by Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier and Sam Troughton.

14,trashgang,supernatural,7,21 March 2018,"And another hyped flick and also on Netflix. And just as the other two (Annihilation, Veronica) it does what it has to do. Delivering the horror.All those flicks do stand on their own, here it's all about the supernatural. Some old Gods are still living in the woods. And they do need some offering. It does deliver some really scary and creepy moments in the woods but there's more going on. The opening of this flick is really well done and it the red stuff does flow. But it's there for the characterisation. Once you understand what's going on we move towards the forest. It will remind you of Blair Witch not knowing what is going on due all the noises.

15,deloudelouvain,"Makes you want to go camping in Sweden, or NOT.",7,27 April 2018,"It's not the first movie that we all saw before with people wandering in the woods where something is definitely wrong. So the story might be a bit cliché but the execution was good. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, that I thought was completely overrated, you also have people in the woods and the supposition of something evil watching them. In The Blair Witch Project you will never get an answer nor see the thing that freightened everybody and that was a major letdown, plus it was not filmed good at all. Supposition of evil in horror movies is good, in the right ambiance, but at one point you have to see the evil force in real to be satisfied. In The Ritual you get that and that's a bonus. The acting was good, all characters added something to the story. A story that is creepy enough for a horror/thriller. To me it could have used a bit more blood to make it scarier, but that's just me. The best way to watch this movie would be at night in the middle of the woods somewhere in Sweden.",The Ritual
16,sddavis63,A Bunch Of Guys Went Hiking,7,7 July 2018,"You expect a movie like this to be set in the backwoods on the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia among inbred hillbilly cannibals. And there is actually a reference to the Appalachians early on in this movie. But it isn't set in West Virginia. It's a British Netflix movie, and it's mostly set in the deep forests of northern Sweden. The movie starts with five old college buddies in London planning what seems to be an annual vacation together. After rejecting a number of ordinary, expected hum-drum options, they decide on a hiking trip in Sweden. Tragically, before leaving, one of them is horribly murdered in a liquor store holdup while another watches but escapes unharmed. So you have ""survivor's guilt"" set up from the very start. The remaining four go ahead with the hiking vacation, and it turns into something quite unexpected.This is an effectively creepy movie pretty much from the moment that the group arrives in Sweden. Originally walking a known trail, after one of them hurts a knee they decide on a shortcut back to their lodge through the forest. Of course, you should never, ever take a shortcut through the forest! Not in West Virginia. Not in Sweden. And especially not in a movie. Strange things begin to happen. There are noises - footsteps and growls - and from time to time they catch a fleeting glimpse of - something big. Then they come across freshly gutted bodies hung high in trees. Breaking into a cabin they discover they find a sort of altar. What is going on? In truth, for a while I was wondering if any of it was real. Luke had experienced a huge trauma when he witnessed the murder of his friend. Was this a dream or a nightmare or a hallucination of his? But it wasn't. It was very real, and very horrible, and there really was a hideous creature roaming the woods that a local group (don't know if they were inbred or not) worshipped as some sort of offspring of the Norse gods.This movie certainly held my attention the whole way through. It was a good decision not to give us a good look at the creature until close to the end of the movie. That heightened the suspense and creepiness. I'd quibble a bit with the need for the murder of one of the guys in the opening scenes of the movie (and, yes, I realize it's based on a book so it's following the basic outline) but I think the story would have worked just as well if it had been five guys on a hiking trip through Sweden and not just four. But overall this is an enjoyable movie if you like the genre. The four main actors did well in portraying both the fear they felt and the tension that existed between them. And - if I was ever tempted to, this has convinced me to never go hiking through the forests of northern Sweden! (7/10)",The Ritual
17,Hellmant,Definitely doesn't live up to Bruckner's other work.,6,16 February 2018,"'THE RITUAL': Three Stars (Out of Five)A British horror movie about a group of college friends who reunite for a trip into the forest, and are stalked by a supernatural presence there. It was directed by David Bruckner (who also helmed such other indie horror flicks as 'SOUTHBOUND', 'THE SIGNAL', and a segment of 'V/H/S'), and it was scripted by Joe Barton (who also wrote the 2017 Netflix release 'IBOY'). The film is based on the book of the same name by Adam Nevill, and it stars Rafe Spall, Asher Ali, Robert James-Collier and Sam Troughton. It was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I enjoyed parts of it, but it definitely doesn't live up to Bruckner's other work. Luke (Spall), Phil (Ali), Hutch (James-Collier) and Dom (Troughton) are four old friends that decide to go camping together in the woods. A fifth friend of theirs was murdered recently, in a robbery which Luke was a witness to. Luke still holds a lot of guilt for hiding during the crime, and not trying to save his friend. This haunts him during the trip, and so does a seemingly supernatural force. The unknown entity begins killing all of the friends as well, and driving them all mad in the process. I like that the central character/hero of the movie has a really dark and flawed past. It's something that most people can relate to I think, and everyone likes to think that they'd be heroic if put to that test. So that part of the film is really disturbing and intriguing. The part where the friends are being hunted by an unknown presence in the woods though, is much less interesting and exciting. It's even somewhat dull at times. The film does pick up in the end though, and horror fans should probably get what they came for out of it (I think). It's just not nearly as good of a slasher/sci-flick as the director's other movies are.",The Ritual
18,thesar-2,Blair Witch's European Vacation,8,24 March 2018,"Hey, Blair, go to the corner - THIS is how to make a scary, supernatural woods film.Actually, the Blair Witch analogy is just one of many horror subgenres presented here and each one evolved extremely nicely into a superior one. I just love a movie that starts off good and gets progressively better. Such a rarity in the majority of films.Five blokes become four after a terrible incident leaving one remaining friend feeling guilty and the others trying to support him. Previous to the tragedy, they all had planned on a holiday in nature and kept their plans to honor the fallen fifth.All of that synopsis is about the first five minutes of the film and feels incidental to the (dead?) meat of the plot. At least, I thought so going in. These types of films usually have an elaborate setup to get our ""heroes"" to the place of torture and, again, it seems that way up front. But, wait...Continuing with the summary, but without actual spoilers: after the Dwight Schrute of the group gets injured in failing to remember his walking lessons, they decide to cut across a wooded area to their overnight resort destination. And let the games begin...I'm totally leaving out 90% of what happens, as it's best to go blindly into the woods of (obvious) horror alongside, and just like, the men. Like I said, the movie kept getting better and better and what appeared at first as a low-budget, indie film - despite really good acting, turned out to be highly effective in what you can't see and what you definitely can.This felt like true horror again and it was enormously refreshing to get back to an original and successful scary movie. Enough with those haunted house movies, torture porn gore fests and a zillion remakes/reboots/spinoffs/prequels. THANK YOU for making me believe in filmmakers again.***Final thoughts: Yeah, I'll stand by my ""original"" comment. Sure, there are many old ideas here, mostly meshed together, but they did take the time to find very good actors to care about and spin the old formulas into its own separate universe. I did feel this was clichéd during the first half, though never once did I consider turning it off. It totally intrigued me on where it was going and the characters were always making me concerned about their individual journeys. And when I got to the latter half, it absolutely paid off and worth the eye-opener. You'll soon forget any criticism you might have stored up for a review or word-of-mouth critique.",The Ritual
19,lost-in-limbo,Engaging horror that plays to its strengths.,6,22 April 2019,"I was going to let this pass me by, but the more I read about it - kind of had me wanting to check it out. Quite assertive, and well-done for what it wants to be; A leisured atmospheric rural creature-feature horror with a mysteriously eerie occult framework using simple, if cookie-cutter mechanics to invoke growing unease and instinctive terror.The acting is solid, and the script holds tight. It does enough with the character dramas to keep the lost-in-the-woods story dynamics moving forward, even throwing psychological shade over fractured mindsets when the good-hearted bickering turns harmfully personal. I didn't think it always worked, but it gave the story an extra dimension to squeeze out the emotional tension, provide motivations and the ability to show this creature can mentally manipulate the minds of those it stalks.Another element working to its favour was the dark, sprawling mountainous forest becoming a character in itself. The way the camera captures the surroundings and how the audio picks up on the creature moving through the lush vegetation (branches snapping to the off-screen growling) gives off a spooky ambiance that at anytime can swallow you up, or inflict a gruesome surprise. As for the monster (an ancient evil), I actually liked the Norse old-world folklore and unique camouflage design whenever we got the chance to see it. This does come to fruition in the outlandish descent of its third act, where I think it loses a bit something when it breaks out. The creature is mainly brought across in CGI, and done so perfectly, although there were practical prosthetics when it got up, close and personal, and the latter when used I found downright effective.",The Ritual
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A technically competent and self-assured slow-burning horror that falls a little flat in its third act.,6,24 October 2017,"'The Ritual (2017)' is a technically competent and conceptually confident horror picture that manages to crank up the tension without relying on false or obnoxious jump-scares, instead using its ominous musical score and brilliantly foreboding sound design to create a slow-building sense that there's something sinister lurking amongst the trees. It's in the script where the piece really shines; it's an example of a group dynamic done right, and you honestly do get a sense that these four men are mates who have known each other for a long time. You also get a sense that they're all different people who react differently to their bizarre and frightening situation. When the film moves into its third act, it starts to lose its way a little. The closer it comes to its eponymous ritual, the less tense and unique it gets. Still, the finale does introduce a visually interesting and well-developed creature whose only real fault is the fact that it's shown slightly too much during its climactic debut. This is a shame, since prior to then it's handled with a deft restraint that allows the flick's infrequent yet visceral splashes of gore to truly have an impact. The thing also has bit of a rushed and wet ending. 6/10.",The Ritual

22,bowmanblue,Netflix filler-horror,5,8 March 2018,"Do you like horror films? Have you seen loads of them? If the answer to BOTH of those questions is 'Yes' then you're probably going to find 'The Ritual' a little hard going. Don't get me wrong... there's nothing particularly bad about the film, but there's not enough that's new to make it really stand out among the countless other horror films that have come, gone and subsequently been forgotten.Four friends get lost in the woods. You're probably already thinking of a dozen other similar horror films. Okay, so this time it's some woods in Sweden, but a tree's a tree, right? Anyway, I won't dwell on why they find themselves there as it's all just exposition to get them to a remote, out-of-the-way location to end up at the wrong end of something nasty. The first couple of thirds of the movie (and it's actually a little bit longer than your average ninety minute horror flick) have a real 'Blair Witch' feel about them. Okay, so there's no handheld shaky-cam 'found footage' aspect to the story, but it still hits all the same beats as our hapless heroes slowly find themselves being first messed with by whatever is out there, before finally being picked off one by one.The final third tries to offer something different, but only really succeeds in feeling like a different film to what's gone before it. There are a few horror clichés here and you finally get a reasonable view of what's been hunting them all this time (something the 'Blair Witch Project' deliberately left out). And then it's over. And then, unless you're really new to the genre, you instantly begin to forget everything you've spent the last couple of hours watching.I know I'm sounding overly-negative about 'The Ritual' and I probably shouldn't. Despite my bored tone, it's not that bad; it's just nothing I haven't seen before.

When one gets injured they decide to cut it short and use the forest as a shortcut back to camp. What they find in the woods however isn't exactly friendly.Now the film is a slow burn, don't really expect anything to happen until the final act but when it does, it's actually quite good. It has a real Resident Evil 4 (2005) feel to it and I'd actually be curious to see what they could do with a sequel.Sadly due to the way it's constructed it's not as impressive as it could have been, the characters are forgettable, little is ultimately explained and the side story was totally pointless.Points for trying but I think it should have been a tad better.The Good:Interesting creature designSome impressive visualsFairly unpredictableThe Bad:How many times do you need ""Mate"" in the script?Very slow buildThings I Learnt From This Movie:Falling over large mounds of boobs is a common problem in Las Vegas",The Ritual

Just because it is set in the woods and weird things start happening, does not necessarily deem it a Blair Witch wannabe. This is not found footage, thank goodness! I'd much rather compare the film to 'Dark was the night', set in a forest.Quite often characters take a shortcut for the fun of it or some other obscure silly reason. At least in this film they had a very good, acceptable reason for doing just that. The film became foreboding the second they set foot in the forest. It then grips you and never lets go. The film is believable thanks to simple settings and a good, believable cast. Rafe Spall in particular was exceptional, and deservedly won an award as Best Actor. Despite being creepy as hell and very compelling, the film also had depth and emotion and I really sympathized with Luke (Rafe Spall). This is a wonderful scenario where a personal dilemma affects judgement, and causes a lot more peril in the process. This was very believably done, and his dreams added to this testimony.The visual effects were amazing. I feared the film would become a gore fest as it progressed, but thankfully it never did and was substituted by suspense instead.

28,eddie_baggins,An above average horror ride,6,18 March 2018,"One of the more competent Netflix horror releases that has found its way into our living rooms, David Bruckner's The Ritual is an atmospheric and layered production with more to say than your average jump scare experience and while it goes off the deep end towards its later stages a few too many times, horror aficionados should be well pleased with his haunted woods experience that's deeper than you'd first expect it to be.Focusing its attention on Rafe Spall's tormented Luke, a depressed and conflicted figure who is reeling from the violent recent death of his close friend Robert that he feels responsible for, The Ritual see's Luke and his group of ""mates"" head off into the wilds of Sweden to go hiking and pay homage to Robert's memory, only to find themselves deep in the woodlands and in a spot of bother when they realise they may not be alone in their isolated surrounds.It's not what appears to be a particularly original concept and Bruckner can at times find himself playing a little too close to genre conventions but with Spall impressing in the lead role and The Ritual sometimes genuinely surprising with its musings on fear and overcoming one's self-doubt, Bruckner's experience is one that overcomes its shortcomings to become an engaging watch.Filled with some undeniable dread filled anticipation and a collection of scenes that will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing to attention, Bruckner shows skill as a filmmaker that can create a mood and a setting to work as another character in his film and while at times Luke's comrades like Sam Troughton's Dom in particular begin to grate, the atmosphere in which Bruckner has managed to conjure up is top notch, while horror creature fans might have just found their 2018 MVP with The Ritual's big bad.Final Say - While it doesn't rewrite the rulebook and some potential scares go by the wayside, The Ritual is an enjoyable and often gripping low-budget horror that features another impressive Spall turn and marks down another above average effort from director David Bruckner.3 huts in the woods out of 5",The Ritual

The film captured the eerie nature of the forest so well, it becomes the most important character in the film. The creepiness n sense of dread in the broad daylight n the surrealistic nightmare sequences in the nighttime added solid tensions. The dream sequences in the cabin was truly nightmarish.

32,jtindahouse,One of the most tense and exhilarating films I've watched in a long while,8,11 February 2018,"The key to any good horror film has always been having characters that are realistic and that the audience can relate to and care for. Yet so many horror films completely overlook this element in their film. 'The Ritual' does not make this mistake. These characters are highly flawed, but they're also relatable and we as an audience can understand (if not fully agree with) choices and decisions they've made. I suspect a lot of this stems from the fact that 'The Ritual' was based on a novel as the source material. Movies based on novels almost always contain more depth to their characters for obvious reasons.So you've got yourself a set of great characters, but that still isn't enough to guarantee a successful film. You now have the obligation to utilise those characters you've created. 'The Ritual' ticks that box as well. Firstly, it's a great looking film. They did a fantastic job picking the setting for the film. Creepy and atmospheric, whilst beautiful and endearing at the same time. Secondly, this film ticks possibly the rarest box a horror movie is ever able to achieve these days, which is to be scary. I almost never get any rise in my heart-rate during a horror film any more, but that was certainly not the case here. I was invested in the story and the suspense had me on edge.The first 3/4 of the film are some of the best mystery, suspense, horror film watching I've done in years. This film was almost destined for greatness, but unfortunately the final 1/4 does let things a slip a bit. Once any mystery is gone from the story things lose steam a little and everything becomes a little stock-standard. The ending is quite abrupt too, and I had hoped for a little more. Altogether though I certainly recommend giving this film a watch. It's about as good as modern horror films come.",The Ritual
33,jadavix,"Superior handling, poor conclusion",7,18 February 2018,"""The Ritual"" is a creature feature with the same problems that generally plague films of that genre. It is handled well, with some effective moments in the beginning, and superior acting. But when we actually see the creature, and get an explanation of what it is and why it is, we lose interest, and it's not really scary anymore.It doesn't help that the creature makes no visual sense. I imagine that some people might find that makes it scarier. I didn't. It looks like a cross between a goat and a reindeer with human limbs added here and there for no reason I can tell. ""Weird"" does not always equal scary.The film is about a group of friends who take a hike through the woods of northern Sweden to fulfil the dying wishes of a mate of theirs, who was killed in an armed robbery that one of the friends was also present for, but survived due to hiding.They follow a hiking trail but decide to take a shortcut through a wooded area, where they discover signs of witchcraft, and soon, an inhuman creature shows up.There are many superior moments in these scenes, which take up more than half of the movie.

36,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,18 October 2017,"Based on the excellent book by Adam Nevill and adapted by Joe Barton (and co-produced by Andy Serkis), this story focuses on four associates who go on a hiking expedition in Sweden. Apart from anything else, they come to honour the memory of deceased pal Robert (Paul Reid). Luke (Rafe Spall) holds himself responsible for his friend's death (there's a constant melancholy behind his eyes) and there is an underlying animosity from the others because of the incident.This fuels some friction between the group, who otherwise swap some genuinely funny banter and are a believably close-knit gang of long-term friends. We have sensible Hutch (Robert James Collier), whinging Dom (Sam Troughton) and pessimist Phil (Arsher Ali) – finely drawn out characters played to perfection.The first two thirds of the film concentrate on a slow-burning realisation that they are far from alone in this vast, oppressive, beautiful wilderness. They suffer, do these lads, with some pretty gruesome and hallucinogenic set-pieces. This is Blair Witch 'turned up to 11' in many ways, and is genuinely creepy.The final third concentrates on Luke and the weird community of locals he meets. This is a comparatively rushed second act – we never really know the locals (only Sara, played by Maria Erwolter, has any decipherable lines). The creature responsible for the varied graphic happenings isn't revealed until late on, but is highly impressive.I think that apart from the location, the sound design is the star here. There are some truly gut-wrenching noises and jump scares that don't rely on the over-used screeching violin/Psycho-scare noises that soundtracks often saturate scary moments with. The whole production sounds incredible. And it looks overwhelming too - David Bruckner directs beautifully throughout.For anyone who has read the book, there may be disappointment at the moments that have been excised. I won't expand on that – both book and film are more than worth your time, with neither simply a re-tread of the other – but it is interesting to compare and contrast.Ultimately, I really enjoyed this. The build-up, in both character and horror, is exceptional. Only the film's ending comes as a let-down, and by that time, it is far too late to turn back.",The Ritual
37,GiraffeDoor,Very respectable effort.,7,13 February 2019,"I don't want to sound like a snob but there are a lot of trashy horror movies out there. The type that feel like they were made on a conveyor belt and are following an idiom, having half forgotten that the whole point is to be scary rather than just darkish. Where they seem to manufacture half their scares and the other half are ruined by telegraphing the scares with the generic music.But this movie comes from a good place. I love the setting: the forest in this movie is formidable and totally made me feel like I was disappearing into a forgotten world. The sense of dread grows and grows without blowing its load but we still get a pretty agreeable payoff with some more than adequate special effects, even if by the end it's more of an adventure movie than a horror.My biggest issue with the movie is the characters. I don't think the first couple of scenes in Britain really add anything and the picture would have worked better just having the friends go without emotional baggage. The film's biggest issue is the over ambitious approach to its characters and relationships, at times getting quite soapy, quickly resolving the less-than-spontaneous confrontations with a quick reconciliation-in-the-face of danger moment. I was not rooting for most of these guys.Although it's not a masterpiece it's still worth your time.",The Ritual

However, this proves to be a bad move when they learn that something is stalking and that whatever it is wants them dead...I tend to try and judge low budget films slightly differently to large budget films as I can appreciate her constraints sometimes need to be applied in order to satisfy the budget. What you won't get here is brilliant special effects or an all-star cast.However, what this film does benefit from is some good camaraderie from the 4 main actors and this does go a long way in making this a satisfying product. I was sold on the main characters being life-long friends and despite the fact that at times they came across as being a bit 'frat-boy' their banter and squabbling was entertaining to watch.Another good move by the writers was to not reveal the identity of what is doing the killing until very close to the end. This is what makes the film suspenseful as you're never entirely sure who or what is responsible which also means you're not sure how the men will overcome their adversary. In the main it plays out like a cross between Predator and The Blair Witch Project and I have to admit it worked both aspects well and it is mostly a tense affair.The acting is mostly good from the main cast with Spall and Collier being the standouts and as I've said given the budget involved it is a solid little film.The ending is the slight weak link as it does feel too easily resolved when you look at everything that proceeded it.

On the second floor they find some headless man-size figure with antlers for hands. It freaked them out. The guy who witnessed the killing in the liquor store keep having nightmares about that night. And its no different this night. But he leaves in the middle of the night and is attacked by something. When he returns to the house he finds the other guys screaming and soiling themselves. Another guy is on his kneed and praying to the figure.Next day they keep walking all freaked out and of course start to fight each other. When nightmare guy goes exploring an alternate route he sees some large creature. At night the pitch their tents and again nightmares and reality combine when something grabs on the guys.

Of course, the final guy will have to confront the creature and the creepy townsfolk.The Ritual is a nice minimalist horror movie of the 'a bunch of goofs go into the woods and get in trouble' type. But fortunately, this isn't all screaming and fighting among each other. There is a bit of that, but it makes sense in the context of the story. And for once, there is a reasonable character who is more interested with survival than with arguments. The setting in the Romanian woods is very creepy. I also liked the Norse mythology references, which rarely comes up in movies. Also here the origin of the creature is explained. The creature is weird and creepy but I would have made it more humanoid and less animalistic. Overall this is one of the better movies of its kind that sets a great tone and looks good.",The Ritual

And all we can do is remember him.
Robert, we miss you, mate.""""The Ritual"" is a British horror that takes place in a Swedish forest where four friends go on a hike in honor of a deceased friend. After seeing so many films where a dark forest provides terrifying and life-threatening situations, I made a decision. I'll never spend a weekend somewhere in a forest far from the civilized world in my life. Much too dangerous. In addition, it's also certain that I'll watch more of those Netflix Originals. Because these films, which are sometimes turned down by big film companies, really aren't so bad.""The Ritual"", however, wasn't a complete success. The first part is without a doubt the most impressive. A continuous feeling of threat and desperation, because this piece of pure nature doesn't seem to be completely deserted. Before they know it, those four city boys, Luke (Rafe Spall), Dom (Sam Troughton), Hutch (Rob James-Collier) and Phil (Arsher Ali), make some bizarre and disturbing discoveries. And this because of an incident with Dom hurting his knee. They decide to take a short cut through the woods. Due to a storm they get lost in this Scandinavian forest rather quickly. They spend the night in a deserted wooden cabin (well, cabins in the woods usually house something bad as we know) where they discover a kind of occult statue and experience a night full of frightening nightmares. And that's the moment this adventurous hike slowly turns into a survival trip.It's not only a mysterious entity these gentlemen have to worry about. Inner, personal demons are also involved. Especially Luke, who's still troubled by guilt about the incident where Robert (Paul Reid), the fifth member of this friend's club, lost his live. This creates surrealist delusions and you'll see the interior of the night shop being projected into the threatening forest. And gradually, reproaches about this are also expressed by the others. The things that were never pronounced, emerge under these traumatic circumstances. And this creates an even more intense atmosphere.Unfortunately, the denouement isn't of the same level as the first part. The fact that it's not about demonic forces (such as in ""Evil Dead"" or ""The Blair witch Project"") but something ancient and primitive, is pretty disappointing. The final run is still exciting enough though. I thought this movie was a mix of ""Razorback"" and ""The VVitch"". The title of the film partially explains what it is about. And to be honest, I thought the create was original and the CGI section looked professional. But despite the devilish atmosphere and the excellent camera work (without using excessive amounts of special effects), it still felt like a missed opportunity. There are a lot of situations that you've seen before in sortlike movies. And many stupid decisions were made even though they were (in my opinion) highly educated fellows. And finally, at some pont I thought they were kind of annoying who don't want to work together in a constructive way. But despite everything, I certainly won't neglect other Netflix Originals. That would be a stupid decision.",The Ritual
44,aidanratesmovies,Criminally Underrated and Incredibly Creepy Little Horror Flick,9,10 May 2021,"It's a rather simple story for an exemplary tale, The Ritual takes horror back to its roots in an incredible original, grounded, and very well thought out manner. I didn't expect much from this film, in its first few minutes I actually assumed it was some sort of horror comedy- perhaps similar to The World's End with its pub drinking and english characters who are longtime friends. However, the film transitions perfectly into an incredibly suspenseful nightmare world of terror, and I was all here for it. The acting in the film is great, much above the average quality many films have in the horror genre. I especially liked Rafe Spall as our protagonist Luke, who is a deeply hurt and quiet character- and Spall plays the part to no fault- perfectly capturing the character he is and was once. The film can be a bit slow, but while you wait out the film has plenty of fun creepy tension to spare, and some truly haunting imagery. The cinematography is excellent, and the special effects are brilliant. I hope i'm not giving away too much from saying this, but the mysterious creature in the forest is truly fantastically done- we may not see it in full for very long, but when it's there- it's truly a sight to behold. A lot of people gripe on the film for the ending, but I feel it leaves room for interpretation in a rather good way and perfectly fits the vibe the film is going for. In the end, The Ritual is an excellent, sinister, and criminally underrated horror flick that more audiences should certainly check out.My Rating: 8.7/10.",The Ritual
45,a_chinn,Possibly the best horror film of 2017,8,19 March 2018,"Terrific horror film is a scary supernatural tinged survival tale. The film combines the best elements of everything from ""The Wicker Man"" to ""Dreamcatcher"" to ""Southern Comfort"" to ""The Descent."" A group of friends reeling off of the death of a friend go hiking in the Scandinavian wildness only to find themselves being stalked by someone or something. The group becomes lost and stumbles across an abandoned cabin, finding themselves all haunted by terrifying nightmares the next day. From there, tension builds as more unexplained events begin to engulf the group as they try to find a way out of the woods. ""The Ritual"" would have been scary enough with it's lost-in-the-woods storyline, but when you add in the supernatural elements it's even better! Without spoiling too much (but SPOILER ALERT!) the slow build-up to gory murders, pagan cults, and a very creepy monster add up to what is probably the best horror film I've seen in the last year (okay, I haven't seen ""Get Out"" yet). Besides the reptile brain visceral reaction to the film's effective horror elements, what makes this film a cut above most horror films is that it has an interesting subtext around facing down past fears and forgiving oneself. I'll also give credit to director David Bruckner for effectively building suspense and earning scares with close ups, sound effects, dark shows, and surreal glimpses (particularly the early glimpses of the monster and images of their friend's liquor store murder recreated in the woods), rather than relying on standard horror film gore and jump-scares. However, I will fault the film for indulging in about a dozen too many horror film cliches (lost in the woods, and-then-there-were-none, Blair Witch paganism, etc.). At least they didn't bill the film as ""Based on True Events."" Still, even though the film dives deep into horror film cliches, it's does them very well. It's the lack of originality I have to ding the film for. Still, it's such a well done horror story that ""The Ritual"" is an absolute must-see for horror film fans.",The Ritual

47,robertemerald,Deep forest thriller horror,8,15 March 2019,"For a lot of The Ritual I felt I was watching an important evolution of The Blair Witch Project idea. It's much better than that. I loved the forest. There's no escaping the brilliance this movie brings in that regard. You get lost in a very deep forest full of colour and shadow. It's worth watching just for that. The Ritual uses good cameras and the camera work is excellent. The horror starts early, alas, so does the bitching. The scares are sudden and full of surprise, helped to a great extent by echoing flash-backs and nightmares linked to earlier trauma. This is very effective and a new technique, at least for me. I was a little disappointed we didn't see the (very original) entity stalking the group until late in the picture, and also thought the ritual element proper also came in way too late in this picture. I appreciate that may have been budget constraints or adherence to the book. I thought there was far more potential for more advanced skirmishes than was presented. But that is only my humble opinion, and one can't fault the authentic commitment of all the actors, or the flawless graphics of the final quarter. The Ritual is rich in colour and drama, is tense and never boring, and is thus a very exciting film experience.",The Ritual

So I was hoping it wouldn't be like that throughout, I mean, alright, the visions were alright, but I wanted to see more. It does get going after a short while, & the first part isn't all that bad. It will remind you of the god awful Blair Witch film back in 1999. Only this film is way way better!The effects were pretty good! The blood & gore were decent enough, though could've been better. But the creature, took the cake with this one! It was great to actually see the creature unlike the BWP which just held back everything & well was boring as!This film has a satisfying climax, a bit sad but satisfying!

Circumstances take a change for the worse when they take a shortcut through a dense woodland and encounter a sinister pagan nightmare.
This eerie B-movie shocker, based on Adam Nevill's acclaimed novel, has a theme about overcoming cowardice, and achieves a modicum of psychological depth and authentic notes of grief and guilt. It has good visual effects of malevolence and develops a sense of dread, dragging us through the woods towards a climax that is arresting if not especially meaningful. However, the crass, pouty dialogue reduces the working class alpha-male characters' motives to pointless yelling and brooding and overuse of expletives, and the plot has its characters making stupid decisions.

How many times before have we seen this exact scenario where a small group head into a creepy looking forest and end up lost and in danger? It's been done that many times before that any tension and suspense that should have been there just isn't, because we've all seen this identical scenario before, and in some cases done a lot better.As far as actual scares are concerned, there's a predictable jump scare here and there, but other than that, there's nothing to speak of.

54,gedikreverdi,An eerie film with unlikable characters,6,21 February 2021,Luke watched as his friend was being killed by the robbers in the liquor store and then four friends went hiking in Sweden. They took refuge in an abandoned cabin while its raining heavily outside. Luke saw the scenes from the liquor store that merged with the forest and one of them pissed himself while the other was praying to the straw man upstairs. The Norse god that resembled a moose-human would hunt his victims and hang them on the trees as if they're flies in spider web. He started to hunt them down one by one until dom the overweight guy and Luke were the only survivors. They found another cabin and the locals held them chained to the wall in a room. They sacrificed Dom and it was the first time we saw the creature completely. It wasn't super scary but it was creepy and the mythological background of him being one of the illegitimate sons of Loki was interesting. Luke set on fire the cabin after seeing the dead bodies listening to the preach of another straw man upstairs and the god showed up again. Luke injured him with the axe just before getting out of the forest. It was a pretty nice wacky but the characters was a bit too unlikable so I couldn't care about them at all except for Luke who got blamed for his friend's death.,The Ritual

56,petra_ste,"A familiar premise, well executed",7,15 April 2018,"""People lost in the woods"" horror movies are tricky. This kind of scenario is inherently creepy, tapping on ancestral fears everyone can relate tp; however, it often devolves into tedium: see the recent Blair Witch and its ninety minutes of people screaming in pitch black.The Ritual pulls it off. This tale of four friends lost in a Swedish forest as a mysterious creature stalks them features solid direction, strong acting, an original monster in both visual design and lore. The first half is excellent, with an effective urban prologue setting up a tragic event involving main character Luke (Rafe Spall), then an ominous atmosphere as the protagonists take a disastrous shortcut in the wilderness, notice the first unsettling traces of the monster and seek shelter in an abandoned cabin.In the second part things get a little repetitive; the film never lost my interest but it could have used more variety before the last act - say, an abandoned village with other signs of the creature's cult and predations. The Ritual also lacks defining set-pieces after the disturbing prologue and the sinister cabin scene; characters are dispatched in generic, unmemorable ways. This needed an iconic ""Dallas crawling into the air shaft"" moment.Finally, in spite of Spall's effective performance, Luke's character arc feels... unfinished. It's impossible to explain in detail withoutMAJOR SPOILERS, so beware.
Luke's flaw is cowardice, as he abandons a friend in need at the beginning. The ending really should have been about him sacrificing himself for his last surviving pal... who instead gets killed while Luke is unable to help. Then Luke refuses to surrender and manages to escape.

Admittedly it wasn't a unanimous decision to make the trip but it was partly done out of respect when the person who had the vision to suggest that the group make the trip ends up being killed in a London convenience store robbery.There is some added dimensions to the gruesome event when another member of the group, Luke (Rafe Spall) ends up witnessing the shocking murder of his friend whilst quite literally cowering behind the adjoining aisle.The 'cowardly' act forms some backbone of the screenplay with the element of regret of the characters being developed into the fabric of the story. Back to Sweden the group end up in a desolate wood landscape. Now you know there is going to be a 'horror' element when such events happen especially with the customary wooden cabin! Boring really and incredibly predictable. I've seen the same set pieces in several other films. One by one the group is reduced in size by a 'grizzly' thing that attacks and kills people.

The cinematography is fantastic and lush, multiple shots of creepy trees and subverting scenes, can you see something in the forest and shadows or not? One issue I took with the photography however was that a lot of the scenes I felt were too dark, whether this was to cover up the CGI of the monster (which was bloody brilliant by the by) or just my TV brightness was too low, either way some scenes were too dark and difficult to make out. Whilst there wasn't much music in the film to give it more of a realistic feel the sound effects were done to perfection, creaking woods in the wind, the rustling of leaves or the scratching of the monster stalking the group.The characters were well done, especially since there was only four so you get to explore each of their personalities well, the acting was very natural and didn't hold back in the bad language department, this made it all the more better as you didn't feel like they were reading poetry off a script but were just four normal blokes lost on a hike - another plus is their choices they make weren't as stupid as in a normal horror film, they knew the risks and did what they thought best.I won't spoil the ending but I have to say it was definitely a surprise, I see a few people bashing the ending but I really enjoyed it and it tied it up nicely (you may need to watch it twice or read a synopsis to fully understand it) without going on for too long.8/10: Forget the small budget, if this is on TV it's a must see, some of the best use of sound and tension I've seen in awhile!",The Ritual

This film is daring, bold, in your face and delivers the goods.After the death of one of their own, 4 friends come together and go on a hike in the mountains of Sweden to commemorate their fallen friend who was killed in a store robbery. This trip is especially taxing on one of them, Luke (played by Rafe Spall), who hid instead of standing up and defending his friend in need. However, when they take a detour through the neighboring woods, strange things begin to happen to them. And just when things couldn't get any worse, they are picked off one by one by some unknown creature or force until Luke finds himself face to face with not only the creature, but his own doubts and fears as well.This is what we go to movies for.

70,asda-man,Lads holiday gets ruined by gigantic moose man,6,17 May 2018,"You'd think people would've got the idea now. Don't go into the woods! Especially if you're out in the middle of nowhere, in a Scandinavian country, with only a compass to rely on. The Ritual might not be all that original but it's a solidly made little film which will certainly appease hungry horror fans who live for watching a group of friends get butchered one by one. It also ends up becoming surprisingly layered and moving, it's certainly more intelligent than its B-movie exterior it hides behind.It's a premise we've all seen before. In fact it's exactly the kind of formula The Cabin in the Woods was poking fun of, there even happens to be a cabin in the woods, would you believe it! A group of thirtysomething men decide to go on a walking holiday (which is a bit of an oxymoron, but there you go, some people enjoy it) after their friend gets brutally murdered by some crackheads robbing a corner shop. He was the only one who wanted to go on a Scandinavian hiking trip so they all go in tribute to him. Unfortunately, Rafe Spall is now wracked with guilt because he did nothing to help his friend and instead cowardly hid behind an aisle, which is something we'd all probably do if we were put into that godawful situation.Alone in the gorgeous Swedish outback, one moaning member of the group bruises his ankle so they decide to take a short-cut through some deep woodland which has 'Blair Witch' written all over it. They're not even that phased by a deer hanging on a tree with its guts pouring out, they just want to get some rest in an old creepy cabin which has an even creepier Wicker Man-esque moose/reindeer thing upstairs. The film does an excellent job of building up a sense of foreboding and threat. You know something isn't quite right but you can't work out what's going on. It's a film which keeps you guessing right up until the surreal third act.Some have said that the film is at its best when it's hinting at things in the shadows and that's sort of true, but you'd surely be disappointed if the evil was never revealed. There's a great sense of friendship with the cast of characters and for a horror film, it's actually very well-acted. You believe everything which is going on, which is important in a film which gradually gets more and more bonkers as it goes on. It's also nice to see a more mature British cast in a slasher flick instead of a bunch of whiny Americans. Who would've thought Thomas Barrow from Downton Abbey would be under attack in the woods?Lots of people have expressed dislike towards the ending, but for me that's when I realised that the film was actually more intelligent than what it's given credit for. It instead becomes a kind of parable for facing your demons and accepting your faults. Like the creature is symbolic for grief in The Babadook, the one here is also symbolic if you dig deep enough. If you don't take the ending too literally then you'll find it to be surprisingly touching and meaningful, it certainly stayed with me when the credits started to roll.The Ritual is a good example of a supernatural slasher flick albeit not exactly an original one. its high production values are let down by the formulaic screenplay which enables you to predict the direction in which it's heading. It also bordered on the ridiculous at times, although I do admire films which decide to take a more surreal route. All in all, if you're a horror fan you'll find a lot to appreciate in The Ritual. Even if it doesn't offer much new, there's certainly worse ways to kill ninety minutes.",The Ritual

When it at last becomes clear what the source of all the creepy goings-on is, it needed a little mind-adjustment, at least for me, it suddenly turns into a creature-feature, but the CGI is well done and it never went overboard.Greatly recommended, when you're a horror aficionado but in for something different.",The Ritual

Good character development, good acting and so far a good storyline. However as the film develops, it starts getting worse.Basically, the forest is ""haunted"" by an ancient god. And this god hunts these men down. This is where the issues for me arise. Things happen, that are important to the storyline, yet are never once explained. And that is the common theme. Whenever the lads slept, they would all have vivid nightmares and this was never explained as to why. Which is weird considering that this was a major point in this film. Without ruining the film completely and stating every single example of this. A lot of the second half of this film just simply isn't explained to us whatsoever.
The ending is the same and if you read a lot of user reviews it all says the same. ""The ending sucks"". And I agree. I am glad that they all didn't die, but my word TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON.

74,harryplinkett14,Abomination,1,2 January 2019,"Is this a film about facing your own demons, and a kind of supernatural horror that brings these demons to life? Is it a classic monster movie? Is it a 'homicidal hillbillies' film?Well, it's a little bit of everything. And it's a bit too much to swallow. Did we need the psychological terror? Did we need the hillbillies? Did we need four main characters, when two would have done just fine, and the other two are there for no purpose whatsoever, other than to take part in the 'let's bicker endlessly' bits?Oh, yes, this film makes it clear from very early on that it's gonna throw at you everything you hate about horror films. Stupid decisions that not even a moron would make abound, and they often take place after a scene where characters needlessly bicker and try to outdo each other in acting like they are mentally challenged. There is also a backstory to the situation characters find themselves in, which kind of echoes the one from 'The Descent', but has zero payoff.One gets the impression that the writers wanted to do a by-the numbers horror film about taking the wrong path in the woods, but then decided they would do something original by piling up plot elements until the plot collapses under their weight. By the time we reach the climax of the film, you just don't care any more. It's 'Blair Witch' meets 'Hills Have Eyes' meets generic monster, and as we reach the final sequence, we realise the writers had no idea where this train was going. The ending is confusing tonally, logically, emotionally... I couldn't even follow the action, to be frank.And of course, there is the question: How did Swedish hillbillies who never leave a forest learn fluent English? Also, does the Swedish police treat that forest as one of the diverse 'no-go zones' in the big cities, and never investigate all the cases of people wandering in and never coming out? I am very forgiving when it comes to plot holes in horror films, but you gotta show me you made an effort to minimize them.This film is a waste of time, and should serve as a lesson to screenwriters: If something can be taken out of the script, then do it.

The Ritual is neither. It's an attempt to fit a well-known architype of Horror, which neither succeeds nor fails, but it close enough to be more entertaining than disappointing. Said architype is probably far from new to most viewers: a bunch of friends go hiking a rural unfamiliar environment, and find themselves hunted by something (in this case, that is. In others it's someone).A shared tragedy brings four English friends to rural Sweden. When one of them is injured, they choose to take a shortcut through the woods. During this obvious act of sheer futility, they begin to experience horrible nightmares while being chased by some sort of animal that is always faster than their gaze. Cinematography is actually quite impressive, as the camera follows the protagonists' gazes and not the actual predator, leaving the viewers as confused and frightened as the characters, all share the terrifying predicament of knowing something is out there - but able to see it or know what it exactly is.Unfortunately, the film takes a distinct turn for the worse as we actually see the thing that haunts the woods and are given an unsatisfying, anticlimactic and plain foolish explanation as to its existence. Unnecessary to the point of being abusive. I couldn't help but pitying the writers who obviously felt obligated to offer something new instead of sticking to the script. Bad idea, big mistake. The result is simply damaging to the film and disappointing to the audience, in my opinion. The film wouldn't have been great in any case, but it really could have been good. Instead - it's simply average, mediocre, and just enough entertaining to be worth watching.All in all, everything I've said is my personal opinion. You might think the last part is actually good, even very good. Alternatively, you might think I've been overly generous. All I can recommend is that you watch the trailer and choose for yourselves.

82,Mike_Devine,Real potential but falls apart in the third act,4,24 August 2019,"Four 40-something friends go hiking in the woods in northern Sweden. Nothing can go wrong with that, right? The Netflix original 'The Ritual' follows the story of this crew as they hike in honor of their fallen buddy as a final remembrance of sorts, and predictably, things don't go quite according to plan.'Ritual' is pretty heavy, as the relationship between the four friends is tested in many ways. There's plenty of psychological spooks littered throughout the film, most of which are pretty well executed. This doesn't make up for the many scenes that feel like they're direct rip-offs of the much superior 'The Blair Witch Project,' though. Still, the stress and strain on these friends feels real; important because at the end of the day, it's the four actors (Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali, Robert James-Collier, Sam Troughton) on whose shoulders everything rests.Where 'The Ritual' really goes downhill, though, is the third act. Cheesy, generic and not very scary, the finale really destroys any excitement that was built up previously in the film. Too bad, as there was some real potential here.",The Ritual
83,thomasjay-2201,Bit of a hidden gem,7,26 April 2019,"After finally returning to Netflix and at last having the time to watch it I sat down and spent just shy of 2 hours watching this. A new type of horror (to me personally at least) this was fair to say an interesting viewing, the characters being more of the focus and the villains in a way and that was refreshing to say the least. It's fairly well paced and everything feels well done despite 3/4 of the film being four friends talking whilst on a commemorative hike through Sweden to honour the fifth man. That character (Rob) is really the only issue if any, his screen time is rushed and feels to have minimal impact but the frequent return of that memory to Rafe Spall's character does indeed give it a significance at the very least so all's not wasted or lost. The finale of man v god is a bit of a leap given the world it's established for through the previous acts but it's not exactly enough to bring everything down to the ground, overall pretty good, I certainly recommend",The Ritual

85,jtncsmistad,"""The Ritual"": Monster Movie as Allegory",7,6 February 2018,"The recently released ""The Ritual"" is a monster movie, with the creature springing forth from ancient Norse legend. But it is more than that. The level of performance by a quartet of actors is a prime cut above standard scary flick fare. And there is actually a point to the proceedings beyond doom, gloom and ripping apart human flesh-a message of redemption in struggling to overcome one's most incapacitating foibles (guilt, arrogance, fear and loneliness are all explored) that resonates straight through to the end of ""The Ritual"". At times subtle, at times stark, it manages to consistently creep through the chaos with both clarity and resonance. This is hardly a common component across the bulk of the genre. And it is in no small part a tribute to the vision and sensibility of Director David Bruckner. When I spoke with Bruckner recently he confirmed that, while horror is his thing, he believes that that which scares us on screen is a representation of what haunts and frightens us in our actual lives. I also talked with the director about the work of Cinematographer Andrew Shulkind, who certainly deserves a considerable share of the credit for the overall impact of ""The Ritual"". Shulkind's keen eye consistently captures scenes and shots that practically serve as additional characters in the film. Bruckner shared that he and Shulkind teamed up to ""work around the edges"" of the action to deftly reveal dynamics and motivations between the characters not expressly brought to bear. Bruckner directed one of the segments of 2015's multi-plotted ""Southbound"", of which I am not a fan. That said, here, at least in one guy's opinion, is a talent who is both growing and maturing as an artist. ""The Ritual"" operates in an entirely new league of depth and sure-footedness. It is intriguing to see where Bruckner's career behind the lens takes him from here.Indications are that it is a future progressing with promise ""northbound"".",The Ritual

Well directed and great script...some of the banter was really well done and made us all giggle.The set pieces containing flashbacks and hallucinations were very very well done.

Very well done indeed. Well worth a trip with your partner as they will be clung to you from the off set. Will keep an eye on the director for more.

89,CountJonnie,"Very decent horror, with capable cast",7,31 March 2018,"Horror movies are partially defined by scares, but can still suffer from either bad acting, or lack of a decent setting. The Ritual however succeeds on various levels. Before becoming a horror/slasher, it begins by introducing the characters and defines what binds them together. After that, they are placed in the situation where the horror begins. A big, yet claustrophobic setting (woods), that builds on suggestion and seems impossible to escape from, when the actors slowly learn what it means to be a prey without giving away too much too soon.It's especially that suggestion that can lure the watcher into thinking there are various options. The horror may be real, it may be in their head, it may be supernatural, it may be realistic, etc. while never steering away from the characters and motivations of the actors. It's not until the final 30 minutes, that the actual horror introduces itself and makes you understand in which way this partially predictable movie is heading. Very enjoyable and even more effective, a fresh breath in a difficult genre.",The Ritual

91,noahgibbobaker,"Bad movie, good execution.",5,8 November 2020,"The ritual is david Bruckner's first feature film, and he did a good job. Prior to this Bruckner had only directed segments in horror anthology films like V/H/S, southbound and the signal. I think he's already a pretty good director and can't wait for the day when he makes a great horror film.As a whole the film isn't very good, the screenplay is pretty awful, the writing probably the biggest issue with this film. The characters make many decisions that don't make any sense at all and the dialogue is poor as well. Also I should mention that Bruckner didn't write this movie, it's written by Joe Barton.The characters don't only make constant stupid choices, but they're also really unlikeable. I didn't care if these people died or not I just wanted them to stop talking and progress the story. Stop wasting my time and tell a good story instead. I couldn't take anything that was happening seriously cause the main characters don't seem like they take anything seriously. Or they're just really dumb, either way it's very poorly written.There is a huge shortage of good horror films at the moment, I don't even think that there is one good horror movie every year. Because of the lack of good horror movies being released people give movies like the visit, unfriended, a quiet place and creep a pass, even though all of these films are incompotent. The ritual isn't a great movie, but it is better than most modern horror films.Technically the ritual is good as well. Great cinematography for the most part, helped by the stunning location. The CGI is alright, it won't look very good in a few years though. The editing is mostly good, shot composition is decent.I'd probably recommend the ritual to you if you like horror movies or David Bruckner already.

92,doorsscorpywag,Effective Chiller,7,7 February 2018,"I read the book and was not impressed but the movie was far superior.
It made the reason they were there more interesting and did away with the Norwegian HM angle which was drivel.Once they got into the forest the pace picked up and the conclusion was better than the book. The claustrophobic remoteness of the forest was presented well by good use of the trees and there were some really interesting camera angles.
The monster was introduced gradually until the reveal in the finale and the finished product was pretty good. It wasn't particularly scary but did have some good unsettling moments that were effective.The characters were decent enough although it would have been better if the film was 20 or 30 minutes longer as we never really get to know a great deal about them. The book was better in that respect.
The same for the folks in the cabin. We never really got to understand why they were there and what was going on.
Again the book was better here.The ending did seemed rather rushed and with 20 minutes to go a lot had still to happen. 
Not really a horror more a good thriller with some weirdness thrown in. Worth a look certainly but nothing special. I gave it 6 but added an extra point for actually revealing the monster and doing it reasonably well.",The Ritual

Our characters are well-developed, relatable, and make almost all of the right decisions based on their circumstance. The film suffers when it reaches the inevitable and pivotal question in any horror movie: Do we maintain the shadowy guise of an evil presence or show our hand in grand fashion? A horror movie can be good by doing the former, but it can only achieve greatness in the latter. The Ritual went all in with its hand, leading to a flop.

97,Rabh17,A Nice Genre Horror that's good on tension,8,18 February 2018,"The other reviews are kind of on both sides of the map...but I gave it a middling high score because the Horror is really an aside to the mounting tension between the erstwhile friends after a tragic death during a robbery. This is really a story about a group of friends going thru a horror gauntlet that sorely tests the bonds of their friendship. 1-- Young guys will talk about 'What they would do if they suddenly found themselves in a dangerous situation...' But as an adult, you realize that such talk is just immature testosterone...because in truth, you really NEVER want such a situation to ever arise. Because what you may see in your friend's choice of action will never be erased from your mind's eye. 2-- The setting is simple. The Forest is the first and primal abode of 'Dangerous Things' from the elder days when Men huddled around a fire. This movie very nicely plays on that shifting sense of being stalked. And thru it all, the guys were portrayed as believable buddy blokes...so yeah, the dialogue can seem a bit short. 3-- I've read other reviews that panned the creature...but seriously, in today's age, we've pretty much seen every imaginable monster that can be put on the screen. In good Horror, the Monster doesn't have to 'Make Sense'... They are really just 'Forces of Nature'. The story is in how the characters react to its power. A Blockbuster? Not Really.

101,scb_coldsteel,A pleasant surprise all around,7,1 October 2018,"I recently finished the new Netflix original The Ritual. The film follows a tried-and-true horror film scenario of four friends getting lost in the wilderness and all hell breaking loose. Overall it was actually one of the better horror films I've seen in awhile.The movie by no means reinvented the wheel in its concept and borrowed heavily from film classics such as The Blair Witch Project, Deliverance, Wicker Man, and The Descent. That being said it was a very well made horror movie. The movie did a great job using sound to create genuine moments of suspense and intrigue. The film also made excellent use of the wilderness setting to craft a thick and eerie atmosphere.To compliment the setting the film also intentionally doled out plot details in small increments. This really helped to keep you on the edge of your seat about what was going to happen next in the movie. I never felt bored during the movie, even though the plot points felt familiar.A big plus for me was also the lack of jump-scares. All of the horror elements and scares felt natural instead of the forced in your face jump-scare. It's refreshing to see a horror movie rely on more than cheap tricks to scare its audience.The film did have its issues though. In some ways the film felt like it was two separate productions. Without giving anything away the first half of the film and the second went in connected but different directions. Also, again this was not the most original movie. Neither of these points really took away from the enjoyment of the movie, but it does keep this film away from being a classic.The Ritual was all around a solid horror experience. It was well made, acted, and most importantly provided ample scares. Despite its unoriginality it certainly entertained, a 7.5 out of 10.",The Ritual

105,manuelasaez,How did the mess this up so badly? It's like a completely different story,5,9 February 2018,"I have been waiting for this movie for months, reading previews about and watching interviews from the people involved. Being a fan of the novel by Adam Neville, I knew that the movie was going to take some liberties from the source material, but so many things were straight up omitted, that it just became it's own thing. Why even call it the same name if it only shares a backbone of a story?The movie starts off well enough, as you are introduced to the characters and watch their relationships to each other unfold. The story is interesting, and really sets the mood for the rest of the film. But then, someone decided to hit the fast forward button, and everything about the story was sped up. Comparing it to the novel is not something I do often, but the thing that made teh book memorable was how it took its time setting the stage. It seems like they used every other chapter of the book to write the script, and as a result the whole movie suffered. Gone is the animosity they felt towards each other that had nothing to do with what happened at the onset of the film. Gone is the feeling of dread that comes with being lost in an unknown location. It just seemed like they wanted to pack all of the ""safe"" elements of the book into the movie, but in doing so, omitted everything that made it special.
 
So the movie continues plodding along, things happen too fast, and the audience can't really become invested in anyone since they don't have a chance at showing you their personalities before their ultimate demise. And then we reach the second half of the movie.Man, how can a movie nosedive so quickly? It boggles the mind how a movie can start off so decently and end up so atrociously. Granted, the second half of the novel is the most out of left field part of the entire book, which some bat $#!@ crazy moments that probably wouldn't have translated well to the big screen, but couldn't they have at least tried? The last part of teh story was what made the novel great, and it is all but nonexistent in the movie. It's sad that what could have possibly elevated teh movie and perhaps given it a cult following was ruined due to some archaic taboo rules of film making that are still in place in modern times.This movie was the horror equivalent of I Am Legend to me. Both are movies based on excellent novels were the creative team just threw out everything that made the stories great to begin with. When you worry more about profits than you do about creative integrity, you get movies like The Ritual. Not a horrible film, but definitely a horrible disappointment.",The Ritual
106,FKDZ,A decent little ''Blair Witch Project 2.0'' attempt.,5,31 August 2021,"Any horror fan will immediately notice some very familiar scenes and moments when having seen BWP, but what that movie did, this movie does more of. Which is expanding and showing more of the ''witchery''.First and foremost, the dynamic and acting is good, though there are some points in the story where characters behave out of character odd or too irrational for me to completely get into it. The dialog is fine as well, though I wished for a bit more backstory so that'd we as a viewer would care more about certain characters.It's not really a scary movie just like BWP isn't really. Though this one contains more gore, it still refrains from showing too much.Now for this being its standalone story it felt a bit light on lore. There's not much to it here really. It's not vague in that regard its just very clear cut but at the same time al the mystery disappears.The monster, I wasn't a fan. Especially the chase scenes made me think that I was watching a Jurassic Park movie. But there's not really anything creepy or scary there. I wish they doubled down a bit more on scary behavior of the friends, but they didn't sadly.The music is alright, nothing memorable though. The sound design is good though.The CGI was was fine, it helps that it's sit in a dim/dark forest but it wasn't that distracting and I'm glad they kept most of it practical.The finale.. yeah, its run of the mill movie stuff, nothing surprising sadly.

107,S_Soma,An example of a well-made horror/monster picture.,9,7 February 2018,"THE RITUAL begins with a group of five buddies enjoying a few drinks in (what I assume is) a British pub and having a discussion about where they should go for a little vacation together. One wants to go here, another wants to go there, and there is no consensus. One of the members pushes the idea of going for a hike in Switzerland close to its border with Norway, and the idea isn't any more popular than any of the others.They leave the pub and while walking away one of them decides he hasn't had enough to drink and wants to go into a nearby liquor store. For some reason which isn't clear, he really wants one of the others to go with him. I'm guessing for some kind of moral support like ladies wanting to go to the bathroom en masse. Unfortunately, what the two men don't know is that the liquor store is currently being robbed and the man who volunteered to accompany the one who wanted to buy a bottle is brutally killed in the course of the robbery.So the four remaining buddies decide to go for a hike in Switzerland to honor their fallen comrade and the next scene we see is of the men camping and hiking in a somewhat desolate looking and overcast (apparently Swiss) countryside. They hold a brief ceremony around small rock cairn with a photograph, a few odd appropriate objects and a little booze in memory of their friend, and then proceed on their way.Not long after, the smallest of the men, and apparently one with a reputation of being generally disagreeable, falls and sprains his leg. With this added impediment to their forward progress, the men decide to take a shortcut through ""The Forest"" (cue ominous music) in the hopes that the crippled member will be able to cover the shorter distance successfully.Very shortly after entering the dense forest, things begin to go wrong. The forest is unusually and eerily quiet. And then... They come upon the carcass of a very large deer that is not only dead and freshly disemboweled, as evidenced by the still-dripping blood, but oddly splayed out and mysteriously placed high up in the trees. What killed it? Why was it disemboweled like this? And how did it get so far up in the trees?Whatever is out there the men want no part of it and waste no time in leaving the carcass behind. If only it was that easy. But there is something in the forest that's after them. Whatever it is, it's big... it's supernatural... and it's pissed.I live on a fairly steady diet of horror/supernatural movies. I do try to augment my intake with the occasional science-fiction movie as opportunity permits, but it's mostly the purposefully scary pictures for me. Tragically, while there is no dearth of spooky movies, the vast majority are utter rubbish. Apparently, however, it's quite possible to make a decent monster picture without breaking the budget as THE RITUAL clearly illustrates. It isn't perfect and it has the occasional problem but it's definitely a quality example of its genre.While not Academy Award material, because horror pictures almost never win Academy Awards on general principle, the production design is excellent, the music appropriate, the acting sufficient to purpose, and so on.One of the unavoidable obligations of a monster picture, supernatural or otherwise, is the payoff of the monster at the end. How good is the monster and is there a satisfactory explanation about its origins? This is most frequently the element where most monster pictures drop the ball. While there are those that seem to take issue with it, in my opinion THE RITUAL comes across with a perfectly good and scary monster that's entirely appropriate for a creepy old forest and I commend the makers of the movie for giving us something pretty darn original into the bargain.The only really negative note I have is that the creature evidently has the ability to cause horrifying visions in the minds of its targeted victims as well as other mind influencing games. The vision we see repeatedly is that of the liquor store robbery in which their friend was killed as viewed by the character who feels personal guilt over that death. We also see a vision of one of the member's wife supplanting the approaching monster in the sacrifice scene. What role these visions play was never clear to me and seems to me to have been added to the movie simply for unexplained effect.But, all in all, if you are into horror pictures, especially of the scary monster variety, THE RITUAL is a definite must-see.",The Ritual

110,OneAnjel,"poor acting, not believable",4,16 June 2019,"I really wanted to like this film. It did entertain me but it was more frustrating than frightening. I could have turned it off anytime and not given it another thought. There were good props, but the acting didn't really convince me that I should be scared, it felt more like a bunch of guys vaguely trying to scare their sisters but not committing. I felt the forest was very poorly utilized, I've seen scarier scenes in the Santa Cruz mountains overlooking the ocean. I also wasn't convinced by the sound of the monster, it felt like Sleepy Hollow's soundtrack re-purposed. There was no set up, which I think most good horror films have - the tale of the forest dwellers that makes it more ominous and edge of seat. Here we are left to read into things as they unfold with no clues.One reviewer said the characters were believable 'unlike most other horror films that rely on stupidity.' Well, I will disagree with that because the characters here were dumb as dirt. And then after everything, finally the one person who deserves least to be the lone survivor strikes the beast and it does nothing? Suddenly this thing is slow and without intention?I did feel the ending was lacking. I wanted to see him get into a car or some finality to leaving the forest. Instead, we see him in the opening where apparently the monster can not follow, but the surrounding area looks to be more forest. And his response to the monster is more ridiculous adolescent male behavior - I mean, you just learn that this thing can not follow you into the clearing and you decide to growl tauntingly at it? I think serious acting would be to yell f-you a few times and swing at the air in victory, not bend over like a buffalo and bellow.I disliked this film, I disliked the characters, I disliked the lack of build up, set up, or finale.

The tired cliche setup out the way, cut to six months later (this memory was of course a dream from which he wakes up, already at his destination), where he and his three bland forgettable friends get lost in the woods, come across a spoopy cabin on a rainy night, then get stalked by a big scary monster, until, you guessed it, only the main character stumbles out. Cut to black. Credits. Stop me if you've heard this before. Pretty standard Netflix content, which is usually only a couple notches above the sorta crap you'd see dumped on the Sy-Fy channel. I was pretty engaged for the first third of the movie (as familiar and cliche as it was), with its slow simmering buildup and the mystery of what's watching them in the woods. Then I got bored, having seen it all a million times before (Side Note: I just found out that despite being based on a novel, this movie heavily rips off a 1977 movie called ""Rituals"").

118,rabbitmoon,Tired cliched trash,3,12 March 2018,"Starts well with some good naturalistic writing and Rafe Spalls engaging character acting. It follows the structure of Dead Calm and The Descent - initial tragedy leads to people going on an escapist trip where 'bad things happen'. The Ritual in no way deserves a trilogy with those three though - as after its set up, its like they turned to a college student's film studies homework script. The characters become pointless, no further development, no dynamics, no point to the story, no point to the initial set-up scenes. Its just a really bad Blair Witch style rip-off with a monster that's wondered in from Pans Labyrinth or Harry Potter or something. Absolutely nothing interesting happens to or with the story - and once the lame threat-in-the-woods section starts, its over again in about thirty minutes where it ends suddenly and pointlessly. I feel like it should have had another half hour to make sense of what had just happened, and tying it more to the first act, but someone clearly just gave up and though ""that'll do, people will be whatsapping by this point anyway"".

I thought the trailer looked promising enough but never expected this story to absolutely enthrall me like it did. From the beginning your attention is captured with a very brutally somber intro that plays a deep role into the overall tale. You're then immersed into a magnificently scenic, yet eerie mountain forest setting where the atmosphere is incredibly effective. I cannot say enough about the beautiful imagery and camerawork throughout. As everything unravels it becomes an outstandingly creepy and suspenseful turn of events unlike anything you've seen before. They executed the big reveals towards the final frightening half hour brilliantly and thats where this horror film rises above so many with its extremely unnervingly bizarre conclusion that you will never see coming. Rafe Spell's performance was utterly intense, and you really feel for his character after certain events. Overall I'd rate this an 8.7/10 and would HIGHLY recommend it to any watcher.

120,nahumthebest,You should watch it if you cannot find any other horror film to watch,6,14 June 2020,"I dived into this film completely blind, as I always do, without watching a trailer or reading a plot.From the title, I could instantly predict it was a horror film and that bad things will happen to the characters. Eventually, I learned why the film has such a title.I liked the introduction. It led to the rest of the film. It was a strong premise for going where the characters went.Most of the film is filled with mystery, fear, suspense, and thrill, which are all good things. A forrest as the setting is a setting you can never go wrong with and it helped infinitely in this film.I must say, I was disappointed with the film's supernatural premise and I was not particularly impressed with the film's ""antagonist."" A scary backstory on such antagonist would have been nice.I wish the writers had spent more time on the characters behind the ritual or at least built up better to the eventual revelation of the main ""antagonist"" and had written a suspenseful backstory of the antagonist. I feel the writers and director and producers missed out on opportunities to build more suspense, fear, and thrill.It was clearly a low-budget film and I think it would have been a more potent film if it had instead been a ""found footage"" film, which it could have easily been. Such type of films can be very effective on ultra-low budges if the writing, directing, and acting are good.The actors - I did not appreciate the fact that they all acted like genuine cowards. Or was it acting?Conclusion: it is not a horror film I would immediately recommend to anyone. It is also not a horror film I would re-watch. It is also not a horror film I would praise.

Enjoy the experience of this movie, with excellent scary moments and a nordic atmosphere designed to give us the feeling of being lost. The performances are very good to be a scary movie, offering realistic reactions along with a good chemistry between each of the characters, finally, the main antagonist of the film seems to me very original and interesting, something finally innovative after so many years repeating the same designs and ideas.A simple but well made horror movie that is absolutely worth watching to finally enjoy a good horror movie in the last few years, as we have been invaded with mediocre films of the same genre.

Genuinely scary and well made film, nothing seems mediocre or terrible as far as quality is concerned. Acting is believable, although some actions of the characters are a bit frustrating and questionable, the characters behaved realistically in general. The tone of the film was dark throughout, and the pacing was quite nice. I rather enjoyed some of the cinematography as well, a lot of the shots created a foreboding atmosphere, as well as the set design. Some may find the CGI of the creature rather cheesy, but it was necessary for the film, and it really wasn't that bad. The other special effects were quite convincing.It's a great horror film in the woods, any horror fan should appreciate it. Yes its plot feels quite similar to many we've seen in the past, even recently (The Witch comes to mind), and yes some things happen that make you question the director's and screenwriter's motives, and yes some things are never explained (like, why did he keep having those ""visions?"").

Although it is no classic nor will it ever reach the heights of a cult horror flick, it's entertaining enough to have held me engrossed for the duration.The connection between Luke's (Rafe Spall) incident at the beginning of the movie and his implied redemption at the end is a little tenuous. It would have been better highlighted if he'd managed to save at least one of his friends... otherwise it was a bit (although not entirely) pointless to have bothered with the traumatic opening sequence at all.The usual unthinking, badly researched nonsense had to creep in somewhere... and it did. After the loss of the first of the group, they panicked and set off without bothering to take their tents and camping gear etc with them. Supposedly 'seasoned' (or at least with some/a little hiking experience), they'd know that survival is grossly limited when exposed to the elements, and that shelter should be the first consideration... but, they went off with nothing anyway.The monster/demon was somewhat disappointing and came across more as a mutated moose rather than a supernatural entity. Having said that, I understand it was supposedly based on a traditional/ancient Norse god or demon (which of the two, was presented ambiguously).Overall a not overly long, reasonably entertaining horror film marred (I have to say) with the usual stupid, politically correct sense of needing to force interracial relationships/marriage upon us when, in reality, it's a statistically low percentage.Yes, my friends, it just HAD TO creep in somewhere!",The Ritual

The dialogue was witty, relevant and I felt like I knew and cared about each of these guys. Camera work and setting? Check. As the story progresses, the use of the forest to enclose and control the narrative was really well done.And then there was the last twenty minutes! I wanted to cry. Basically, the wonderful complexity of the first hour was achieved through suggestion -- the terror is never actually put in the flesh.

Mysterious things start to happen - sounds, symbols on trees, signs of violence (mutilated animals, etc.), warnings. They can't agree on a course of action, choose the wrong path, and end up being picked off one by one, torn apart, and put on display for the others to see. Occasional jump scares and constant arguing about which way to go and what course of action to take. Here's the new twist - the last 2 are captured by Swedish creature-worshiping hillbillies, and one is sacrificed to the creature, while the last guy defies the thing, wounds it, and escapes.

There are some tense moments as the friends scamper in fear through the forest. The mood amongst the friends becomes hostile as they try to find a way out.

Characters you can relate to, and really excellent sound engineering. The middle of the film is claustrophobic, mysterious and genuinely scary, with a palpable sense of dread.

To the 1/3 of the movie I thought it's nothing but another typical copycat of The Blair Witch Project, where good friends turn against each other, stupid ideas come out of nowhere, and strange and evil spirits/things run after them. Well i got that part right. 
Some critics thought that the fight among friends were not deep enough but I hold different opinion: it is Luke that didn't show his regret about not standing out but watching his friend killed. As the name of the title, and the dark creature suggest, I can totally predict what's coming next: a cult. That means the scary parts in the movie are not really scary at all, leading me to expect something more hidden inside or the symbolic meaning of the creature to Luke, which I think, need to be addressed more and clearly. In sum, The Ritual is not that bad. It can be better if the symbolic meaning of the darkness is depicted deeper.",The Ritual

177,Kolobos51,"I read the book, saw the movie, these are my thoughts.",6,10 February 2018,"Netflix has been cranking out original content in an effort to stay relevant as more and more online competitors rear their heads threatening to take a bite out of the rental and streaming juggernaut's business. This latest effort is directed by David Bruckner, who did ""Amateur Night, ""easily the best segment in any of the V/H/S films, and a forgettable Bella Thorne Amityville sequel that debted on GooglePlay. It's based on a pretty solid novel and, for the first half, stays true to the source material. The second, simply put, does not. Is this movie good? Sure, not great, but solid enough and not as bad as some of Netflix's other original features. Is it as good as the book though? No. The story is the same. A group of old pals from Britain nearing middle age hike off the beaten patch in the Netherlands and end up lost, having to brave bad weather and carry an ornery and injured mate along the way. And there's this THING stalking them. They find mounting evidence of pagan rituals, mutilated animals in trees, and evidence that the locals, if there are any at all, may not be eager to help. The acting is solid enough, although I didn't recognize a single name in the movie. The film is exceedingly well shot, capturing the claustrophobic dread of being hopelessly lost in wild. The effects are good as well. The downside is that the characters are weak and because this is such a character piece, it just causes the whole movie to fall a little flat. Then there's s the third act. It's good enough, I guess, and if I hadn't already read the book it might have bothered me less but dropping a sublplot involving a deranged death metal band and replacing it with a more standard cult just disappointed me and made the story feel more familiar than it had to. I was little let down by this movie but, again, I think that was mostly because I dislike the alterations from the book. It's a perfectly fine horror film that, like the book, feels a little lopsided on the wilderness vs. creature elements.

182,Pigeon_down,The Hardest Genre Executed Pretty Well,8,25 February 2018,"Horror is the hardest genre to write for IMO. Yes there is a lot of horror out there but most of it is junk, cliche, poorly written, not really frightening, and increasingly made up of gore style murder (think most things by Eli Roth - total make up driven junk).The cast in this do a good job. The story line is ok. The script is ok. The make up and camera work is good, as is set. It is very hard to do horror well. We live in an era where we don't really believe in spooky things, Gods, Monsters, Demon, everything now we seek to explain and normalise without our understanding of a tangible scientific world - thus any monster, once it becomes explained we imagine can be 'killed'. Where it can't and inexplicably keeps coming back to life well that strains credulity more and more to the point of it descending into a slasher style flick. In The Ritual the backstory is quite good. I don't think the lead (Spall) fully redeems himself but he is a survivor, so the backstory moment leaves something missing a little. That said it offers far more substance and character than most horror flicks. The problem with the monster is it seems to be intelligent but irrational. It likes collecting people and spiking them on to trees. There seems to be no explanation or reason why since they do not appear to be eaten. If there is a reason i didn't pick it up in the movie. The movie does hint at the supernatural with one of the cast talking about living longer and worshiping the beast. Overall, Horror is really hard to write in a world where we want to understand why something exists, but in understanding it removes much of the fear thus creating a bind. The Ritual does not solve this dilemma but it takes a basic fear concept - the monster in the woods and it does a good job of telling that story. It does suffer from the requirement to make dumb choices - the characters make several dumb choices - it echoes American Werewolf - 'Stay on the path' with the idea that when lost any path will do, even though it is predictable that that will likely make things worse. However, it manages to balance this after the first cabin scene which has elements of the Blair Witch in which unseen terror and dreams cause the characters to panic and panic is never good when lost. Overall i liked it. Good retelling of the basic monster in the woods idea.",The Ritual

The Romanian forests (which they chose over the Swedish ones probably because it was cheaper to film there) are a great fit for such movie and nature surroundings add a lot to the overall atmosphere. The chemistry between characters feels natural and the things they discover in the forest are unsettling and genuinely creepy. The incident shown in the beginning is a great motivational point in the story which explains why they ended up in Sweden, but instead of leaving it as it is in the beginning and inevetably returning to bringing it up in the dialogues, they re-use the very scene to death throughout the movie, pointing all the lights at it again and again.The forced stupid happy ending harms this movie a lot, a very stupid and unlikely resolution.7.5/10",The Ritual

It's just a bunch of ignorant whiny British lads going to northern Sweden as therapy or whatever. There's not one real human to care about. The impressive nature is commented on and then treated like a postcard backdrop by the director David Bruckner. The dialogue is on the surface of things and not convincing at all. The story is stupid to say the least, especially the last twenty minutes. Not even the dreadful event underpinning and impregnating the story is told in a believable way.

194,songbirdmc,FINALLY!!!,9,19 March 2018,"I've been so bored for so long! Unfortunately, movies seem to have gone downhill over the years, in my humble opinion, that is. The genre that seems to have suffered the most is the horror genre. So many horror films rely on cheap tactics such as jump scares, found footage, and gallons and gallons of fake blood. I love a good scary movie and I don't mind blood and gore, but when it's extreme and for shock value then I have a problem with it. I don't want that to be all I get. This film had me from the beginning. It's so tense and the feeling of dread is so strong from start to finish. I love a film that gives me a creepy, eerie feeling without even showing anything. The feeling is just there. I attribute that to everyone involved in this film. I feel like each person involved committed to it 100%. The actors were all very convincing in their roles, the director did a fantastic job, the costumes, and the special effects were very well done. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is sick of what the horror genre has become and wants something different. Even if you're looking for a good suspense film. This one keeps you guessing and still manages to keep you hooked even when you finally do get what's going on.

198,mt-95256,"A Good Start, but a Weak End with Too Few Scares",5,15 October 2017,"October is that predictable month where cinema, TV, videogames – everything – will cash in on Halloween. There's no escaping it – but fortunately if you love some horror then it's not a time that fills you with dread; you actually find yourself looking forward to it! Not that many of these horrors are actually good; many that come out these days are predictable, cheesy and more funny than scary. Yet every now and then a horror comes out that's different; one that shakes up the genre and defies the audience's expectations, breathing fresh life into the genre. Sadly, although it may have seemed that way in the trailer, The Ritual is not one of these films. Rather, it's one of those lacklustre horrors that will inevitably find themselves in the corner of forgettable horrors on Netflix.Much of it is very much reminiscent of horror classics The Blair Witch Project and The Wicker Man (the latter becoming much more obvious in the final act of the film). In fact this film really does feel like it's two distinct parts – the initial phase, taking up the first two thirds of the film with a strong Blair Witch feel to it, and the final phase, feeling very much like a Wicker Man tribute. If the final section was intended to refresh the film and turn it on its head in an ingenious way, this fails as the two sections seem so different and disjointed it doesn't flow well and seems like a strange jump; particularly since the end is barely explained, leaving us with much more questions than we should really have.Still, while the ending may be weak, the beginning by contrast is fairly strong, giving us an enjoyable, solid set up. The bleak murder of their friend is dark and impactful, with Rafe Spall's portrayal very good as you can see in his face how this event has affected and changed his character. Still it's not just Spall who carries this film; a large part of the strength of the beginning is due to the chemistry and banter between the four friends, the way they joke and interact with each other remaining enjoyable and, most importantly, believable throughout. This gives the film its own personality and, when they finally get into the forest and come across creepy goings-on (such as a dead deer and an unsettling wooden hut) this stands out as being particularly creepy, the contrast giving the horror more of an effect. It's in this hut where things start to change; not just for the characters but for the film itself.The first night is justifiably strong and creepy, seemingly setting up a fairly scary movie with strong elements of horror – sadly though it just doesn't seem to go this way. After this point The Ritual begins its slow descent, as the thread unravels and the plot crumbles, leading us to a pretty slow and dull middle, before the unsatisfying ending. Once the horror starts the banter stops and the group start turning on each other – something you'd think would be a strong point. But the arguments are quickly resolved and the characters don't continue to develop throughout this point, remaining half-developed. Then whenever any deaths happen, as an audience we aren't as fussed as we should be.If only the final third brought it all together, but instead it's a nonsensical finale, attempting some semblance of a reasonable plot, with just an easy line or two in an effort to explain things. Not that everything in a film needs spelling out, sometimes less is more; but when there's next to nothing, this makes what would be a strength into a weakness. At the end, we still don't know exactly who the creepy occult are, what the monster is or does, or even necessarily what it looks like – the latter being particularly disappointing since from it's silhouette it looks like it could have been an interesting monster design, but all we see is a shadow of an oversized moose.Whilst the sinister and creepy atmosphere is nicely kept up throughout, it's a shame there wasn't much horror or actual scares for us to enjoy. It's seldom scary and just occasionally unsettling at best. At least there are no cheap jump scares; instead there's just the occasional cut to a different scene with a loud-ish noise that might make some of the more nervous audience members jump slightly. Still I was a fan of how a lot of the horror is an allegory for Luke's guilt in not intervening in his friend's murder. Unfortunately this is referenced so often that the constant flashing back to the scene of the crime loses its potency and starts to become tedious.The Ritual isn't a bad film per se at all; rather it feels as though all the ingredients are there, but it's just a missed opportunity. The bunch of friends are all likable, well-cast and well-acted, their banter carrying the film in the first act nicely. The constant sinister atmosphere is good, but sadly the horror and scares are missing, with the end feeling like such an unsatisfying mess that it eclipses most of what was good in the beginning. So The Ritual won't be taking the spot for best horror this year – that spot may be reserved for It or Get Out, but let's wait to see what Jigsaw is like before we declare the winner",The Ritual

206,MrLucasWarHero,A Mildly Entertaining Mediocre Horror Film,6,8 August 2019,"The film failed to hook me in and a lack of exposition left me feeling unengaged with the plot. There were a few decent scares but without any real crescendo the narrative seemed to suffer.
If you are looking for a horror film with similar themes I highly suggest you watch The Descent instead.",The Ritual
207,Westcoastal,Excellent horror with unexpected depth and a strong ending,8,9 September 2018,"The biggest beef I tend to have with horror is that partway through the film, inevitably I get to a point where I start rolling my eyes and finding everything foolish, or else I start feeling alienated from what's happening. There is such a fine line between scary and gratuitous, and such a fine line between creepy and absurd. This film does an excellent job of staying on the right side of those equations. The events of the film are unusual enough to be disorienting and scary without feeling absurd or unbelievable. The horror and dread are intense enough to keep people on the edge of their seats without crossing over into the realm of gratuitous suffering or torture. Perfect balance.The performances are really strong and believable, especially Rafe Spall's performance of Luke. I felt connected to his experience and invested in his struggles. But what I liked best about this film was the depiction and exploration of trauma and grief. Spall carries this theme exceptionally well throughout the film. There were a couple of moments that blew me away.The ending was incredibly powerful. The deeper theme of trauma/grief and dealing with one's inner conflicts really shines through.

Original and fresh story that is acted really well and the overall production is top notch.It has a few plot holes, cliches (what film doesn't?) and yes the ending was slightly poor in comparison to 3/4ths of the movie. The difficulty in wrapping up a film like this is immense and most film producers wouldn't even attempt it so 1 star just for effort alone. Add to that the fact it wasn't even a bad ending - it concludes the character arc and explains the driving force of the 'thing' quite satisfactorily.I recommend this authentic horror film.",The Ritual

It's very creepy, especially towards the end, and it could have gone overboard with gore or cheap cliched stock horror moments, but it resisted, and that's why this worked for me. It deals with grief, loss, shame and guilt and it has a fantastic redemption arc. There are some really disquieting moments, which forgo the usual jump shocks. It's interesting to watch how this group of friends deals with their resentments and issues around toxic masculinity, when the protagonist fails to save one of their friends from a robbery gone bad. We watch how they deal with it publicly and privately, and their chracters develop over time. Rafe spall is tremendous as the guilt ridden ""coward"" whose efforts to redeem and rebuild himself unfold over the course of the film. The cinematography is perfect and helps by adding to the murkyness and horror of the forest theyre perpetuallly trapped in. The monster is one of the things that does it for me though, on paper it shouldnt work, but its something to behold and is horrifying.",The Ritual

I turned the wall lights on in the end, I was getting too nervous in the dark.

216,diffguy,For Fans of The Descent,8,9 September 2021,"I strongly consider The Descent to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Hardly anything touches its cast dynamics, the character development, its narrative's basis in reality, the anxiety-creating decline of the characters' health, or it's absolutely insane monster reveal.The Ritual hits all of those notes and that's why I find the two comparable. A traumatic, based-in-reality opening that reaches far into the ending? Got it. The characters' sanity and health slowly declining causing anxiety? Got it. Cast chemistry? Got it, they played a group of friends perfectly. Monster reveal? Ho-ly F.The supernatural elements they introduce as the story progresses spook the hell out of you. It's also just an interesting premise of this dark ritual that infects your mind. Even the good films who use this trope reuse common elements like having a singular cursed object (The Ring, Drag Me To Hell), or a witch casting spells (Conjuring 3, The Witch), or the character seeks to complete a ritual (The Ninth Gate). The Ritual breaks out because it is none of these. It goes 10 steps further. It introduces a god character and utilizes ancient myth to give the magic of the forest narrative authority.The simplicity of shooting on location in the forest gave the film a unique and genuine feel, often creating beautiful scenes that could not be recreated in a studio or computer. It immerses the viewer in this terrifying forest, especially when the extreme darkness comes at night.The monster reveal was incredible. Out of nowhere, unexpected 10/10 reveal. Watched this movie three times now and it is still excellent.",The Ritual
217,knersisman,The Ritual,9,17 December 2018,"This is one of the best horror movies I have seen. It brings something fresh to the table by taking us into the mysterious Scandinavian forests. I am so used to movies taking place somewhere in the USA, but this one delves into mythology about a creature that is similar to the Nephilim and/or Annunaki tales that can be traced back to the ancient Sumerians and others. The actors are brilliant and the sense of loss, despair and self-loss is very well portrayed. If you like horror movies, do yourself a favor and watch this.",The Ritual

But this movie reeked Blair Witch done better.*****Spoiler Alert******When it was apparent that there was a real monster, a deity of some sort hunting and killing people I was intrigued. At first I thought it was maybe some sort of Yeti, or Big foot, but then it turned out to be an ancient for lack of a better word or understanding Minotaur. I was hoping for more development on the story behind it's origin and the development of the ritual.The way it ended was a disappointment unless there is going to be a sequel. I saw a vehicle drive by in the distance so I assumed the guy made it. Would he tell a story people find to be unbelievable, would there be a search party for the remains of the others, would he have been suspect of foul play? I mean, for time sake I guess they would have to end it there.I did wonder as to why out of all the others in the group he chosen, marked and spared. I guess that's up for us to imagine.",The Ritual

He could have killed more of the followers in front of the monster thereby showing it his powers. Then when he got to the edge of the forest he would then square up to the monster (as he does in the end of the film) except this time the monster would have sensed that it was subservient to the guy and bowed down to him.

Only issue is they didn't show more of him but I respect that. I think the story is fairly solid with pretty interesting characters. What I find most interesting about the characters is that it feels like they took your traditional ideal of a protagonist and split them into four men. But on top of that we see everything through the eyes of one of the more stable members of the group, which is also surprising. Normally we get everything filtered through to us from the eyes of an unreliable protagonist (like Phil). However, out of all of them Luke feels the most down to earth since he sees the world for what it is due to his experience. This is a good monster movie if your in it for that. But if your just getting into horror movies this one is pretty tame with the gore and monster so I'd suggest it for new comers to horror. A good film that kept me interested, even without showing the monster 90% of the movie. This is what It Comes At Night could have been if they had good writers.",The Ritual
224,jbenante-388-963917,A Solid Thriller,7,17 June 2018,"I call this a Thriller because it has more elements of that genre than it has of horror. Yes, there is strangeness, ominous music, and later on, an actual creature that is pretty well done in terms of creepiness.The thing with this movie is... I can't accept that the first few minutes were just a throwaway. What happened to the main character was significant, and HAS to be significant the rest of the way.Which brings me to the idea of the plot as a kind of allegory. I'm a former English teacher, so... cut me some slack about that.The WOODS (caps intentional) are a foreboding place. Viewers know that the group should not take a shortcut through the woods - but they also know that, indeed, they must, or there wouldn't be a movie. Once inside those Woods, the viewer is constantly reminded of that... EVENT... from the beginning of the movie. Clearly, there is significance.However, as mentioned by a number of other reviewers, things come apart somewhat in the final act. If the Woods symbolize a psychological state of grief and guilt, then... why all the death?Despite that flaw, it's an interesting movie with good acting and cinematography.",The Ritual

Just some kind of mystery or something.It has solid, though frequently obnoxious characters, a great sense of place and a lot of atmosphere.I thought some of the mental trip aspects were heavy handed and ultimately an annoying part of the movie.They were also a bit too willing to show what it should have been hiding.

But in The Ritual, David Bruckner shows that human plans do not always run smoothly. Watching this film, I felt a terrible atmosphere like in Hereditary, but it was packed in a tourist trip like in Midsommar.Music scoring here gives the impression of a cult, leading the audience to drift along with the feelings of the actors. The right POV shot camera technique provides a thrilling effect. Dark tone shows how scary the location of the trip. It's just that there are still some plots that seem absurd, but all of them can be answered with ""sect"".The Ritual provides a tense experience in watching horror movies without jump scare scattered.",The Ritual
229,annaily,Worth a watch.,7,12 February 2018,"I really liked this movie. Yes, the ending could've been better, a lot better, but it was really psychologically thrilling and spooky, especially for a Netflix movie. I'm really impressed with Netflix's content lately.I see trends in the low star reviews that I want to address. 1) ""the ending was bad"" I agree, but the rest of it wasn't. A movie with a bad ending isn't going to be the best movie of all time, but if I enjoy watching 90% of the movie, then I would say I got my time's worth. It's just a shame that it didn't take the opportunity to use the ""monsters who scare your mind, not just rip up your body"" thing that it could have had going for it.2) ""not scary enough"" it was suspenseful and creepy. It's more psychologically thrilling than outright terrifying, and I genuinely wonder which movies these people deem scary enough for them to enjoy because most horror movies really suck, especially in the past 20 years. Where are they finding all these ""genuinely scary"" movies? Or are they just consistently always disappointed with all of the horror movies they watch but keep watching them anyways? I have a lot of questions. 3) ""didn't capture the essence of the book"" why does everyone who reads a book that gets made into a movie feel the need to say this? I'm not sure if they just like being pretentious or if they genuinely believe a 90 minute movie must entirely capture the essence of a full length novel. There's no reason to judge them as if they need to be identical. They're standalone works. When I choose to watch the movie, I would hope that they don't drag it out as long as turning a book into a literal script would require. 4) ""Blair witch rip off"" very few movies, songs, books, etc. are truly original. You can make a movie with the same basic story tone as another one. Add your own twist, or don't, whatever, I'm not the purity police - just make an entertaining work without breaking copyright laws. If I'm entertained, I don't care if it resembles something else that also entertained me.

Next is revealing the danger, through almost all of the movie you never get any sort of real hard look at what the danger looks like all you really no is that it's big, when it did eventually appear in full view near the end of the film I did get quite a good chuckle because of how it looked but throughout the movie before that scene I was genuinly terrified of what could be following them, the movie also avoids jumpscares which I do really like because the main thing I hate about horror movies is jumpscares because they're just cheap and more of an annoyence than a scare. So yeah this movie doesn't really do anything new it just does stuff right that's why I praise it, it makes sure it avoids everything I despise in horrors so I definently recommend watching it, you will enjoy it in some way.",The Ritual
232,ramonbattershallrecover,The best 'best British horror' in years.,8,31 August 2018,"It's now become customary to have a quote on every British horror film saying it's 'the best...', generally from some tiny pay-to-quote internet site. However, while not perfect, it's certainly better - both overall and in terms of production values and acting - than the thousand or so British horror films released in the past few years. However, it will take some perseverance to appreciate. The first half hour is a wholly generic scenario of group of people who are starting to dislike each other - in this case a group of 30-something men on the cusp of middle age - who find themselves in a frightening situation while away from civilisation - namely a hiking holiday through a Swedish forest. The first half hour is, to be fair, a little turgid, with too much juvenile swearing and some slightly contrived and cliched reasons for venturing off the beaten path. However, soon the increasing sense of dread, the spookily evocative atmosphere of the forest, and some striking visual imagery eventually come together to create an atmospheric and original movie. However, the reason I gave this an eight is that, for the final half hour, it ventures out of the standard low(ish) budget comfort zone and enters into deeply surreal and unsettling territory that's like (without giving too much away) a cross between the Wicker Man and a Lovecraftian nightmare. The sheer weirdness of it all is aided immensely by the talented Rafe Spall's quite impressive acting range, which alternates between horror, resignation, contempt, and, ultimately, determination to survive.It's not perfect, and I can see why some people have given it three stars, but the sheer audacity of the final act, along with the most bizarre antagonist since The Ruins, elevate it far above the usual generic fare that simply tries to emulate American slasher movies with little imagination or verve.",The Ritual
233,Chipsneak,Deserves a lot better,8,11 August 2021,"I really don't understand the negatives reviews. It genuinely saddens me, because when a movie like this is interesting and fun yet gets shot down, all it does is encourage filmmakers to either appeal to the general public (which I get but also results in rubbish like the Furious franchise) or focus too much on style over substance.This movie is honestly great. You get completely lost in the environment with them. We're there for all the struggles and progress of the protagonist. People are actually complaining about the monster?? Just such an awesome and original design, so suited to the movie and the setting. The mythology just absolutely fits and adds to the story.The best part is the balance between metaphor and literalism. Most movies either imply supernatural themes as a reflection of the characters' story, or exist as purely literal representations (and sound have very blatantly parallels that allows for zero interpretation). While there is real horror in this, the contours of the story are affected by the main character's development.Obviously like most horror movies there are elements we've seen before, but this feels original and really demonstrates some spookiness that makes it so much fun to watch.",The Ritual

It has some good acting. Which should not be taken for granted in a horror film. The lead actors are all pretty good and believable.2. The atmosphere was pretty scary. Some scenes really gave me the creeps. Overall, there is a gripping and unnerving tension throughout the first hour.3. The cinematography: In particular, how they use the forrest to create a hovering threat.4. The motif of the guilt-stricken hero. Unfortunately, this could have been better developed.5. Sound design was awesome.6. So were the special effects. Even the monster CGI was pretty cool.7. Nice nods to some classics like Blair Witch, Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes (althought the bald-headed redneck was a little too much). You might even see some Tarkovsky references in the woods-cinematography (or at least von Trier, which would be kind of the same, if you know what I mean...).On the negative side:
***spoilers ahead***1. The last half hour takes away a lot from the previously built tension and terror. Once the minor-gifted hillbillies come into play and the monster is shown, the story is kind of de-mystified. From that point on, it was not really scary any more.2. The characters are kind of cardboard and there is no real development. We have the bro-y tough guy leader, who makes fun of nature and loves steaks the obnoxious fat one with the glasses, the sensitive and reasonable hero. Unfortunately, they do not really go anywhere as regards development...3. The stupid choices (take the shortcut through the creepy-ass woods, stay in the hut with the ritualist witchcraft stuff, ignore all the warnings and weird dreams and not talk about them etc., just to name a few). These come probably with the genre, though.4. The ending was somewhat abrupt and fell short of the rest of the movie.5. What exactly did they do to the heavy, spectacled friend, when they ""prepared him for the ritual"" upstairs and it sounded like they were gutting him alive? When he came back he was bleeding a little, but what exactly was the point of this?6. The plot device of the underexposed hillbilly woman who suddenly speaks English.7. They could have made so much more out of the main guy overcoming his fears and inner demons than him just screaming at the monster like the baby bear in Annaud's The Bear.All in all, I did enjoy the movie more than most of today's horror and more than expected from a Netflix film.

If you're a horror buff, there isn't anything particularly new or exciting about The Ritual. It's well acted, the cinematography is great, and there are a few genuine scares scattered throughout. Unfortunately the writing is a little lackluster, and the characters are all pretty unlikeable. The biggest problem I had with the film, ultimately, is that it simply adds nothing new to the horror genre. If you consider yourself a horror aficionado, you'll recognize all the story beats before they happen. There are too many stronger ""campers find themselves entwined in occult happenings"" films out there for me to strongly recommend this film.

After one of them gets killed at the beginning of the movie in a liquor store, it supposedly adds weight to their trip, giving it more meaning. In the end, the only thing this movie winds up being about is a group of people in the forest (not the four hikers) who offer humans as sacrifices to a creature that keeps them alive forever, so long as they worship it. The presence of this creature causes psychological effects / visions / dreams on the part of the four hikers throughout the movie.Through frequent flashbacks blurred with forest reality, the movie attempts to tie the violence in the liquor store with a monster that stalks them through the woods (and kills 3 out of 4 by the end.)

Luke blames Rob's death on himself, as he did not help him and instead hid while Rob was being beat to death. The remaining college friends go hiking in Sweden, where they encounter an ancient demon and cult living in the woods. The film combined body horror with psychological thrills and while its no masterpiece, it accomplishes what many horror films today are lacking. It reminded me a bit of The Blair Witch Project (1999), as the two have similar concepts about people being lost in a mystical wood that is being controlled by a supernatural force. What this film accomplishes better that the previous, however, is that it talks more about the character's backstories and how it relates to the main story, and I honestly it is really hard to make a good found footage film.

The director really knows how to do a build up without the overuse of sound effects and visuals.

The conflict within Luke is that he committed an act of cowardice. You see, there were 5 friends once, but Robert was brutally killed during a Liquor store robbery while Luke watched and hid, he did nothing, and nobody else knows.Spoilers ahead, don't read if you haven't seen the movie.The other blokes are Hutch, he is the leader, level headed, and makes most of the decisions. Phil is quiet and meek, but turns out be religiously grounded (which comes out later). Dom is physically weak, a wimp, gets injured and slows the group down. Ironically he takes command of the group for a short stint later.The group soon learns they are lost and take shelter. They wake next morning extremely disoriented. They all experienced night mares. This goes on for another day, and another, all the while they are breaking down. Still lost in the forest. They realize there is an entity toying with them. That's not all, they see evidence of people in the area, there are marked paths and shacks.There is a reason the entity is toying with the men. Its an ancient Norse creature. It requires disciples to feed it sacrifices, and serve as slaves. These human disciples of the entity are a dozen or so creepy Swedish hill-billies. Turns out they don't age, or age very slowly. But their numbers have been dwindling over the centuries. The entity needs a new recruit to do its bidding. It feeds off of an energy obtained from those who unwittingly enter the woods, are captured and presented ritualistically as a sacrifice. The creature tested, and toyed with the minds of the hikers in the forest like lab rats. Then the entity proceeds to get rid of the candidates that are not suitable, Hutch is to well grounded, Phil too meek, and religious. Dom actually has a back bone. So they are mind flayed and killed one by one at various times in the story. That leaves Luke, he's perfect, the entity has already determined through the mind melding tests and group observation that Luke would likely serve for a millennium or so just to save his skin. Remember he is a selfish, weak minded coward.This is the conflict within Luke. He knows why he was chosen. He has a chance to redeem himself. he knows there is no future as a slave to this creature. If he is clever enough, if he paid attention to the clues, he might be able to escape. He's smart enough to know that is the only option...This time he actually fights evil instead of hiding.",The Ritual

250,recklesscow,"A creepy cross between ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""The Wicker Man.""",7,18 April 2018,"I'm always sold on horror films that take place in the woods, as humans tend to have a natural fear of unknown environs and we seem to have carried a primordial fear of dark woods for generations, evident in many fairy tales.But just choosing a woodsy location isn't always enough, as there have been plenty of bad horror films set in the forest. What makes a good one is the same thing that makes any horror film good: a good plot, good acting, tension, etc.While relatively simple on plot, ""The Ritual"" does have a stellar opening five minutes that help set the tone for the rest of the film and elevate the human characters beyond the mere teenage fodder we normally get in films such as this. No, this time there's a real human element involved, as their motivation for visiting said woods they eventually find themselves in goes beyond a juvenile desire to drink it up, smoke pot, and have sex behind some trees. The human drama is just as palpable as the eerie forest itself, though a particularly sinister-looking abandoned house does take the cake for some time during the opening half.""The Ritual"" relies on the always-classy and seldom-seen rule that ""less is more"", leaving enough ambiguity to make the goings-on incredibly creepy as things predictably go from bad to worse for our characters. It helps that the film utilizes its location to the max. I'll go as far as to say that the woods in this film are even creepier than the ones seen in ""The Blair Witch Project"", and there's certainly no absence of dread once night falls. You come to be on the edge of your seat every time the sun goes down, as, along with the aforementioned film, that's typically when the you-know-what hits the fan.Films of this nature usually involve some character or another almost deserving their fate for engaging in poor decision-making or being so irksome that we root for the threat to take them out. So it's a relief to be able to say that the men in this film really have little control over what's happening to them, and their lack of ""bro-isms"" and juvenile delinquency makes us care for them beyond the teenage cliches we normally get in films with this setting.Where the film does stumble a bit is in its last half hour, when the tables are turned, so to speak, and a different type of threat emerges in addition to what we've already seen. Without giving too much away, I felt the film's scare factor decreased significantly during these scenes, but the film nevertheless manages to recover enough for a suitably thrilling finale that leaves us with just enough closure to have made the journey worthwhile.Words of advice: don't watch this while camping. You've been warned.",The Ritual

The movie ramps up really fast so it feels kinda stale in the middle part but makes it up with a good climax in the end. The theme of regret is really well handled and adds a needed extra layer to the movie just like the movie Babadook did with grief. The cinematography is good with some creepy shoot and visuals and it didn't rely on jumpscares.

Sadly, there are not a lot of great monster movies around so The Ritual was a welcome surprise for fans of the genre. Very original in my opinion. With horror I don't mean body horror like Saw but an amazing creature.
10/10 might seem a bit much, but in its genre, I think it is one of the best. I recommend not watching a trailer because of spoilers and just hop in. I re-watched it several times (alone and with my mates) to make sure it is as good as I believe it to be and I am certain most people looking for suspenseful creature-thrillers will enjoy it. There are some seriously unnerving shots and sequences that will stick with you for a while.

Although, where BW and this film diverge is in the ending; this film eventually reveals the monster, which proves to be one of its weak points. It is much more effective when you aren't sure what the thing is or what intentions it has.Speaking of the monster, I guess the creators were trying to be original with a demon elk thing, but I thought it was just weird.I give the creators points for the gory moments.

Most of the film is just a cycle of flashbacks of the same scene (they happen like 5 times or even more) and characters arguing with one another (this also becomes very tedious because the characters aren't interesting to begin with). The plot itself is straightforward, predictable and very little is left up to speculation.

Unlike most I DID find the ending quite nice. I liked the whole ""submission/cowardice"" thing that drove the protagonist to act the way he did and eventually survive. That's some character development if you ask me. On the other hand I do have to agree with what is often said, though: the big monster reveal took away most of the tension/suspense and would probably have been scarier if it remained unseen (as there is nothing we fear more than the unknown).

268,niko-oinonen,Idiocy to the point of frustration,4,23 March 2019,"The Ritual falls into some of the most obvious horror film pitfalls. It makes its characters act in such stupid manners that it feels like their actions have no other meaning than to forcefully keep them in the dark forest where they can be scared. Any other course of action would jeopardize the film itself.The Ritual is about a group of friends who go on a hiking trip to Swedish wilderness in order to honor the memory of one their friend who was killed in a liquor store robbery. There is unspoken air of judgement amongst them since one of them was present when he was killed, only hiding behind a shelve.The little remembering ritual is performed right at the beginning, and then it's time to hike their way to the nearest lodge. And then things start to go wrong. One of them spruces his ankle and complains that he won't be able to make the marked way through the high hills, so they must go through a thick and dark forest. That's only the first, and maybe the least dumb decision they are about to make. It all follows a typical horror movie style. They have strange dreams, encounters and they do insane things when they sleep, which they can't explain or don't remember doing. Even after the first night spent in the woods the sanest thing to do would be to turn back, bad leg or not. Yet, the movie insists to proceed on the road it has chosen. But in order to that, it must force its characters to act in more and more delusional and frankly idiotic manner that frustrated me. Otherwise there wouldn't really be a movie here.With Swedish wilderness as the backdrop, you might expect a horror film relying on some Scandinavian folk tale. Well, there is one, but sadly it's kept mostly nothing more than a backdrop. Whatever message it's trying to relay with the ancient god-like deer creature that grants its followers eternal life, it feels very disconnected with what the group of friends are doing and what they're going to through. If the connecting piece here is that the creature only chooses as his followers those who have gone through something traumatic or have a deep dug guilt, then it's a very loose connection.The ritual has some effective atmospheric moments in it, and it doesn't rely on cheap jump scares. The scariest moment being the first night they spent in a cabin in the middle of the woods. But the even the effect of the atmosphere diminishes towards the end as the film lays all its card on the table. Nothing is left to the imagination when the creature stalking the woods is shown in full and even its story is told straight to the viewer. But the most disappointing thing about the Ritual is that it fails to create a more thematically fitting connection between the group of friends and the horrors they face in the woods, or at least I can't find one.",The Ritual
269,bottomsgaming,"We've seen it a million times, but this one's pretty good.",6,20 February 2018,"As far as unoriginal Netflix horror movies go, I found this to be decent, actually. It's your typical, ""campers in the wilderness are tormented by crazy people/monsters/supernatural forces,"" but well-shot, short, and focused enough to where the main character's story felt complete and didn't drag on with excessive jump-scares or gory fight sequences. These campers aren't necessarily tormented by all of the threats listed above, but to avoid spoilers I just listed all the usual suspects. Let's be honest, regardless of which it is, we've seen every one too many times.The cinematography was excellent. The film is consistently gorgeous, and has a few specific shots that are background-worthy. Some shots are cleverly used to set up scares. Speaking of, there are a few jump scares in the movie, most of which aren't too abrasive. In all, there are far fewer than your average theater horror film, which is of course 100% for the better.The film also does a fine job of mentally progressing the main character through the physical obstacles he has to overcome. One thing that bad horror movies consistently flub is actually developing a good main character. Most just throw caricatures into haunted houses and press play. The Ritual at least puts some effort in. Ultimately, it's bare-bones - and the other characters are essentially plot fodder - but it works fine for what the film needs.To me, this feels like a poor man's The Descent. It's a tired concept and the simplest of stories that's just creepy enough and shot very well. Nothing memorable, here, but you can do much, much worse in Netflix's horror category.",The Ritual
270,nickrissmeyer,Downhill fast,4,11 July 2019,Interesting but relatively cliche horror premise but regardless the first hour does a good enough job of keeping your interest. They do a good job teasing what's happening without showing anything and the characters waking up from the initial nightmares in the cabin was getting pretty cool. The movie falls apart really fast after that by showing you way too much way too fast and by the last 30 minutes or so it's a whole different film. They should have stuck with the creepy woods weird stuff is happening and we don't know why thing. The creature is shown multiple times at drastically different sizes which feels not intentional at all and really clumsy. Initially it feels like a sort of Blair witch worship mixed with aspects of the descent but then by the end it feels like an action film or a comedy and ends on a black screen.

As they try taking a shortcut through the forest due to an injury, they encounter sinister signs of life and are afflicted by nightmares. It soon becomes apparent that some elusive and monstrous presence is after them...The Ritual, adapted from a rather lengthy novel, is a pretty good and compact horror film. Viewers who are acquainted with the ""weird tale"", especially of the H. P. Lovecraft variety, might especially like its mixture of cults, dangerous primeval locations and very ancient supernatural entities. Added to these are psychological troubles affecting all the characters but especially the protagonist, leading to some interesting imagery in which nightmares fuse with reality. Despite their problems, the characters don't act too irrationally, eliminating an often-felt frustration while watching horror films.Like most good films in the genre, The Ritual never explains all the details of its central mystery, and withholds the viewer from seeing the (quite creepy) monster in detail. It also has a relatively slow pace and relies more on tension and atmosphere rather than cheap scares, which I like. The cast does a great job at portraying their characters, however the characterization of most of them isn't handled that well. In the end, we don't really know anything about half the group, which effectively reduces those characters to ""fodder"".

Fantastic use of sound and cinematography to build tension and give the whole film a dark ominous atmosphere. The only part that I felt let the film down was the ending, it felt rushed and incomplete given the story time spent building to that point, I can only assume this was either to leave it to the viewer to fill in the rest or due to running time restrictions, either way it left me feeling unsatisfied as a viewer.",The Ritual

287,thefreneticist,"Smart, well-constructed man-versus-nature - and supernature - chiller",8,16 January 2019,"Well-made, excellently acted, emotionally-effecting (I *felt* the characters' shock, horror, grief, terror and sense of violation, all equally as the plot developed, from the major point near the very beginning which sets up the rest, all the way through to the final death) plus, it must be said, one of the most genuinely chillingly *awful* screams I have ever heard from any actor - male or female - in my long and storied horror-buff career. My stomach actually turned over, a little, hearing it.
I'm not sure I'd call it a horror movie so much as a tense character drama exploring the complexity of friendship, masculinity, guilt, trauma and blame that then spirals into a maddening, primal fearfest and race to elude an unseen enemy. Though I suppose the term ""survival horror"" is largely under-utilised, and was developed for films more or less just like this one. Very well, then; it may not be a conventional horror - or at least, it may diverge from the usual plotline in that an intense amount of story is developed long before the main descent into peril begins - but it's a fine example of the survival horror subgenre.
I would actually venture to draw the most parallels between it and Devil In The Dark, another impressively sinister ""hiking is always a terrible idea, smart people just get a hotel"" male-cast -led, relationship-drama -centred film, which is similarly claustrophobic - once the action starts - in its sense of inescapability from a seemingly-omniscient foe. Both films laugh at the slasher genre, as they hold up the concept that there are far older, far worse things than man that man should rightly fear.
The monster is smartly-delivered; the team who made The Ritual understand that there is most terror in what we do not see, and so they keep the cast's dire antagonist hidden out of sight - except for one too-quick-to-register flash - until well into the last act, and their inventiveness is conceiving it (as well as the human horrors that it leaves in its wake) is to be lauded. For all that I tried to guess its nature as the film went on, I came nowhere near to the final reveal.
This is a pretty niche sort of film, in terms of the horror community; the people it's for will love it, but I expect many others will be unimpressed. Nevertheless, if you *are* the sort of person who likes these, ""lost in the wilderness and being helplessly hunted by something primeval and horrific"" movies, then I expect you'll absolutely *love* this one - as someone who *is*, I do, and I give it a solid 8 on the ol' IMDB star-o-meter.

291,jaceodemedici,Refreshing horror done well,8,17 February 2018,"This isn't an absolute masterpiece but it is a damn good movie. I was kind of surprised that it was a Netflix original because their movie content hasn't been as strong as their series content so far, but this is a much needed step in the right direction. This isn't the movie for you if you need a cat to jump at the screen as a loud noise plays every 10-15 minutes in order to feel engaged. That being said, this movie has a lot of depth for it essentially being a creature feature. The movie is a bit of a slow burn, with the first two acts masquerading as a psychological thriller. Throughout the movie we see the main character flashing back to a traumatic event from the beginning of the film, and you're not really sure if there is going to be a creature or if people are just loosing their minds.Of course then we see the creature in the third act and it looks really good. I really enjoyed the back story for the creature and it worshippers as well. The creature is described as the bastard offspring of Loki, which might mean that it is supposed to be Fenrir, although he is commonly described as a wolf. It could easily be a different bastard offspring of Loki, but who's to say what a bastard wolf god monster would really look like? In my opinion, this is the best bastard wolf god monster we could have hoped for.",The Ritual

It's definitely not going to go down as one of the greatest horror movies of all time.I liked that the film was unpretentious. It never sought to make you think it was anything but what it was, a spooky little flick. It didn't spend a lot of time on character development initially, but somehow there was just enough to keep you interested.It moves at a good pace, every time you're just about to think ""get on with it"", they do.  It was creepy, spooky, and downright scary at times. They artfully employed just enough gore, jump-scares and (just a smidge) of CGI, with a very minimalist hand, that actually added to the film instead of detracting from it the way they so often do these days. Even those scenes where you have to force yourself to suspend disbelief something interesting pops up so quickly, that somehow you stay engaged and it moves right along. In addition they added some interesting if sometimes subtle, existential questions, that might have you giving some thought to your own strength of character. With it's elements of the supernatural, survivalist, and monster movie, I was more than satisfied watching it... by myself late at night!Perfectly casted, and wonderful preformences by all.",The Ritual

Imagine the Blair Witch Project but with way less tension and suspense. Too many cliches in place, and the monsters design is downright laughable, like something out of a bad SciFi Network Original horror movie. That being said, the first 5-10 minutes were quite good. It gave the rest of the film a much needed somber tone. For the next forty minutes the character development was somewhat there, except with Phil and Dom. Phil barely said anything worth mentioning: heck, he barely said anything at all. Dom was annoying and basically just a plot point, as his simultaneous wimpy-ness and stubbornness is basically why the characters end up the way that they do. Is it a bad film? I'd say so. As a horror movie it doesn't really deliver, it really just screamed SCIFI NETWORK ORIGINAL HORROR at me. That is, lazy and derivative. Also what's with how long it took them to pour out that flask? It was weird. I'd say the first half was scary, after that, not so much. I wish I didn't waste the time watching this. Afterwards, I was still hungry for horror so I turned on the Babadook and THAT is definitely a horror film worth watching. Another good horror film on Netflix right now is It Follows.

Four British lads on a hiking trek through Sweden to pay tribute to a departed mate who has been murdered at the start of the film in an off licence robbery. The story has a slight Blair Witch feel to the discovery of the carved runes in the trees as the group soon get lost in a forest. With most of my reviews I do not want to spoil the movie so I try to keep my comments brief and spoiler free. This film plays heavily on how damned creepy forests can be..even in daylight..and combines this with the concept of ancient nature elemental's/demons or gods...The acting is very natural which makes the group of friends feel familiar..like your own mates. I recommend this..but insist you view films the way that I do for full affect..view alone, in the dark..on a 42"" screen..sitting between stereo speakers or surround sound if you have it.

The story was strong, the brooding, and evenly paced mystery to the horrors to come in the second act was superbly executed. It was creeping, enthralling and very inventive. I love variety in horror and although a variation of this supernatural theme has been seen in other movies, I definitely feel like I was watching something that hasn't been done before and when it comes to horror that's almost everything for me.

But in my opinion there is a lack of originality and explanation in this movie.For example, there is a dude getting stabbed in the chest while daydreaming/hallucinating, dude ignores it totally and keeps heading on like nothing ever happend.In my opinion the difference between a 1-5 rating and a 6-10 rating is explaining (with a very good reason) why he ignores getting stabbed. Explain why that monster is killing people? Why can't a bullet hurt him but an axe can. Why doesn't he kill the main character (Rafe Spall) at once like the other characters.

Solely that goes a long way.The film utilizes small means to tell a bigger story. It's quite straightforward, in a positive way - it doesn't try to be something that it's not. It delves into the limitations of old friendships, and the unresolved conflicts that can disrupt them, while also telling a spooky story of a group of friends lost in a forest. It follows it's red line throughout, and the ending is satisfactory as well - rare in a horror flick!Rafe Spall deserves a lot of praise as the lead. He's ready for bigger roles, let me tell you.

I thought the acting between the main characters was great. Rafe Spall who plays Luke continues to show his talent. The setting is cliche, the setup is cliche, but the film just works. That's probably because this film has one of the most interesting and unique monsters I've ever seen in a horror film. Although, unfortunately you don't see a lot of it, you can argue that this film isn't even about the monster as much as it is about running away from guilt. Originally, I had an issue with the ending.

It's very disappointing to see a movie that has a massive potential to blow our minds away but then it all falls apart unnecessarily on the third act.

332,carolbrewer,Can I rewrite the ending?,5,13 February 2018,"Wow, it's so hard to rate this. On the one hand, the cinematography is excellent. The scenery is beautiful. The claustrophobic feeling of the woods is delightfully frightening. As a Blair Witch Project fan, I loved how they took that genre and made it even more appealing. I even enjoyed the set-up for what I thought was going to be more of a psychological thriller. Then, disappointment.First off, I just finished watch the film this minute, and I cannot tell you one of the character's names. I just have no recollection of them, which gives you an idea of how little time was paid on character development. Secondly, the thread they inserted into the beginning of the film, really didn't travel through to the conclusion at all. There were also other issues that I had. One fellow has a dream, and it comes to pass in identical fashion. Another dreams he's worshiping that beast, and he doesn't end up doing anything of the sort. He just gets killed-off like everyone else. The main character keeps dreaming about the scene which opens the film, but that doesn't really translate to his fate either.If I could rewrite the film's ending: When the one fella was about to be sacrificed and was yelling ""what are you waiting for?"", (while the scenes kept switching back from him to the main character attempting to escape from the ropes), I would have had the ""what are you waiting for?"" turn out to be the worshipers waiting for the main character to escape and emerge from the house. He had the same markings as the rest of the worshipers, and this would have been the opportunity for him to cower in fear (as he had in the opening of the film) or overcome. That's the only real way to tie-in the markings he had on his chest, his nightmares, and the psychology that was introduced at the film's start. They could go either way with his choice, but that choice needed to be in the final scene to hold the entire film together imo.",The Ritual

336,samanthagiavia,"Nothing new, predictable, boring and pointless.",3,22 February 2018,"You can always tell horror movie fans from regular movie watches. We're the ones not giving this raving reviews. The entire time I watched this move I thought it was a work of Eduardo Sánchez one of the minds behind ""The Blair witch Project"". The monster in this movie looked almost like the monster at the end of ""Lovely Molly"" and that movie also had some strange theme with Deers and Trees. ""The Ritual"" has the lost in the woods story line. Where a group of friend go hiking/camping whatever and get lost in some mysterious woods but in this movie they find a cabin with strange ritual stuff in it and later find themselves being stalked by some sort of forest creature. That has the power of illusion.Well that little paragraph sounded more interesting than it was actually executed. It goes more like a group of friends spend time arguing in the woods when they become lost. (Typical) The group is mixed up of the complainer, the know it all mercenary woodsman, some random guy whose obviously there to get killed off first and the main character. They walk and they walk and they walk in the woods and they complain and they argue and they argue. (We've seen this in every lost in the wilderness movie it and it's been done to death although I will say I did like that movie where the couple gets lost and the guy gets eaten by a bear after they get in an argument I think it was called ""Backcountry"".) So if you get the jest of it the characters you barely get to know them aside from them arguing with each other and therefore you don't have a reason to care what happens to them.What does happen in the movie is pretty much the Blair witch with strange ritualistic symbols, the group members having strange behavior or whatever after sleeping in the cabin. A majority of the movie plays out like the Blair Witch except you actually get to see the monster but not too well since it's mostly hidden in darkness.The creature for the duration of the movie is only sound and all you hear are its shrieks and noises while it picks off the group 1 by 1 for whatever reason it's never explained. It doesn't eat them it guts them and puts them in trees.3/4's into the film and finally the story picks up and there's a village of strange people that worship this creature. The movie becomes WICKER MAN. at this point. Except the creature is real and actually takes the villagers offerings of people. There is one thing though it marks people it values as worthy of worshiping it and won't kill them as long as the chosen bow to it.The story gets annoying at this point. There's a clean space to tell a back story or any story like why are all these people living in the middle of no where? Why do they worship the creature and how did they all get there? Can they ever leave the woods? All we know is that they all have marks on their chest. There's also a random scene and how can I forget this scene. The main character is captured to be sacrificed or converted to their religion or whatever and he breaks free. When he breaks free he goes to the worshiping area of the place they're holding him at and there are corpses sitting in the room like it's a church. The head scratcher is that the corpses are alive and they talk in whispers and shrieks. WHAT? WHY? & HUH? it's never explained what that room is or why there are corpses in there or why the corpses are alive somewhat. You would think in typical horror twist action that the congregation of corpses would be the villagers and the villagers are actually ghost but they're not. The Villagers are seen running about after their church of corpses is burnt by the main character. The creature reappears and attacks one of the villagers that was kneeling to it. This made no sense when the same villager told the main character that if you kneel to it that it won't hurt you. Guess that went out the window quickly she gets killed.The man character escapes fires a shot at the creature it chases him and gropes him or something it didn't look too kosher, then the main character attacks the creature runs out the woods to the safety zone and screams and yells at the creature showing his fierceness and that he won. Then a car is seen driving in the background (an Uber to pick up up?) to symbolize that the main character made it to safety I guess and then end story.Crap crap crap! I thought maybe I missed something in this movie. Maybe this movie was like ""Mr. Babadook"" and the creature in this was to symbolize something deep and meaningful like ""Regret"" or ""Remorse"" and the main character over came it in the end. That would sound great except nothing the monster does would fit with that theme. I also forgot the other running theme. The main character's friend was killed while he hid behind a shelf and was too afraid to rush in and help his friend. So the rest of the group blames him for the guy dying. Yeah whatever. This was dumbest plot idea to balance this movie around. First of all the guys friend was outnumbered 3 to 1 with one guy holding a knife, one a bat and the other guy in the distance. There was nothing the main character could have done except get himself killed also but they seem to run it into the ground that he didn't bother to help his friend and hid instead. 3/10 for this movie. Unoriginal, Characters you don't care about, annoying plot that doesn't explain anything, a monster that's makes as little sense as the rest of the movie and the overall result of me feeling like I wasted my time watching this move.",The Ritual

340,michaeljameshill-98919,A Movie with A Plot And Character Development?! - The Best Horror Movie I've Seen in Years,8,17 November 2019,"My wife and I watch a lot of horror films and we were both surprised by how good this movie was. Not to give too much away but it has all the good elements of a classic horror film. isolation, a powerful but unseen monster, the struggle of man against both the monster and his own internal demons, a feeling of despair, paranoia and isolation, and actually takes time to get you to care about the characters.
There is clearly multi-layered storytelling at play in this film which pits the main character against both his own demons and the monster of the film. By the end of the film it isn't clear if what we saw literally happened but the conclusion is satisfying nonetheless.
The movie is scary, has very cool/interesting art/creature design and is deeper than what we literally see on screen. This is something ""Us"" attempted but failed to do miserably. I also very much like the fact it doesn't go for the cheap ""jump scare/gross out scare"" tactics that most modern horror films do. The film does a good job of building the tension, paranoia and desperation slowly over time until things come to a head in the last quarter of the film. In the tradition of movies like ""Jaws"", this film knows that the monster the audience members create in their own minds is more scary than what can be shown on film and doesn't show the actual monster until the climax of the film. In my opinion it is a very unique/cool monster worth the wait. Some may argue it shouldn't have been shown at all but I agree with the choice to show it.
If you are a fan of horror/suspense movies I definitely recommend watching this movie. It is a throw back to when stories actually had an interesting/unique plot which was more than surface deep, the main characters were relatable people who made decisions which made sense/weren't comically stupid and writers took the time to flesh out characters/give them their own personalities and backstory so the audience would actually care about what happened to them. Personally, I would say this is the best horror film I've seen in years.",The Ritual

361,websignupforjohnny,Disappointing End,5,21 June 2020,"Great psychological and supernatural type thriller, which had its moments. But come on, the ending was just pathetic. I could have done a way better job.So here I go, there are spoilers following this sentence.The guy that saw his friend die in the liquor store and did nothing, well, he was the protagonist, and stood up for his friends in the forest with the evil creature killing all of his friends except him. After hacking the creature with an axe, he proceeds to scream at the creature like the recommended method of fending off a bear, as supposedly the screaming will scare away the beast. And that was the ending, just plain pathetic with no imagination.I suggest that he could have killed the beast with the ax, and then ran away. Later, falling down from exhaustion and drifting off to sleep, he wakes up, but not in the forest, but say, in the bar, maybe before the altercation in the liquor store. He either convinces his friend to call it a night, or goes with him to the liquor store, and defends him in a major fight, killing the bad guys with an ax. After the two report the incident to the police, they call up their other friends and agree to take a well needed vacation in Vegas.I thought that would have been the ending, because there are so many allusions to the altercation in the liquor store, with the fluorescent lights and vignettes of the store where the criminals attack and kill his friend. And yet I came away disappointed when the ending used none of these ""snapshots.""Would have been much better in my opinion with the last survivor being the champion and all his friends remaining alive after the nightmare, kind of like the Wizard of Oz. But what do I know, I'm not a director or producer. Still, a decent thriller to watch.",The Ritual

It has scary moments, most of which are not in-your-face but rather felt through the direness of the characters. If I were one among the characters, I'd be hopeless and lost. I can say the same about The Blairwitch Project, Backcountry, or even Frozen.A couple of transitions, in the latter half of the film, were abrupt; they put me a bit off. Another issue, a minor one, was the uncooked backstory of the cult.

On their way back Rob and Luke decide to enter a store to buy some alcohol. While inside they see two muggers coming out of the back room. Luke manages to hide while Rob gets caught by them. Refusing to give up his wedding ring he gets beaten up and dies. Fast forward 6 months and we see the four remaining friends go on a hiking trip trough Scandinavia.I was very surprised with the creativity of this movie. Both in a positive and negative way. The first part of the movie was very suspenseful, unnerving and it constantly makes you feel like something is not right. What I loved about it most was the way the main plot was mixed along with the ""side plot"" so to say about the rising tension between the friends, them trying to connect and move on and how that all unfolds under such circumstances.However as much as I enjoyed it, there were still some issues with the film that almost ruined it for me. Most of the characters were not fully developed and most of the story was focused on Luke which is a shame since it was obvious that the actors had great chemistry and their stories could have been expanded. There was also a definitive shift in the movie which almost ruined the movie for me since it changes the style of the movie from making it a tense, psychological journey of friends who despite the obvious grudges they hold against each other try to ease the tension and get trough the sureal landscape of the forest to a predictable second half with a (mild spoiler alert) small group of villagers who capture them to sacrifice them to an ancient Nordic monster which to be fair had an amazing design.In the end I would say that the pros outweigh the cons and despite all its flaws it still is a movie that deserves to be watched. It follows a simple concept which is executed in a fantastic way which combined with the gorgeous cinematography and chilling atmosphere make it a must watch for any horror fan. It got me interested in the book as well so I will probably be reading it in the future.",The Ritual

However, although this film and its protagonists tread a rather derivative path, what adds another dimension to the familiar 'lost in the woods' tale is the tragic event that precedes their trip and the impact that has on the group dynamic and the mindset of each individual as they try to get to grips with the ever more disturbing events that befall them as they attempt to get back to civilisation and reality. It does take a rather unnecessary (I feel) turn into monster territory in the finale, I personally prefer more left to the imagination than revealed, but the ending was gripping and tense nevertheless.This is a film that manages to create a sense of foreboding and unease throughout and benefits from a great cast of believable characters that you care about.",The Ritual

The main problem is that it isn't scary, gets pretty boring and repetitive, and gets worse with the reveal of the monster and the monster's worshipers- not better. They would have done well to take advice from that old adage ""less is more"" or to simply go the ""inexplicable strange happenings that are never fully explained"" route.

It suffered horrifically from overexposure of the threat at the end so that it ceased to be scary in any way, there wasn't really any reason why any of it happened, it just kind of felt like nothing was achieved by the end. But holy sh*t the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. It's worth watching for that alone. I did really enjoy aspects of the monsters design and again, those few genuinely unsettling scenes. I also liked some aspects of the characters, like their relationships and the main character's PTSD, their reaction to finding their first friend that was lost.

The viewer is being eased in to the friendship of five guys, which seem to love to take trips in their spare time. The character building seems a bit stiff in the beginning and I thought it was a bit too fast paced, but boy did I change my mind after the first act. It's crazy scary, with the right amount of build up once the movie gets going. I wished the producers would've shown more grit in the denouement, but I guess this is a very subjective opinion, since I like movies to be mysterious and don't mind open endings, as long as they make me think.

397,whatafox,Tortured and boring,3,31 March 2019,I was more afraid of the dark woods and the flashlights than ultimately the plot of the film. The premise was good with a fractured friend group and a lead who was carrying tremendous guilt and sadness. Unfortunately as soon as things go off track so does any element of spookiness or real fear. I think they should have skipped showing the xxx instead of featuring it so plainly and stuck to hints like the genuinely freaky hand wrapped around a trunk; and skipped the old fallback of ugly creeps in the woods sacrificing to some sadistic entitled monster. Perhaps hunting them one by one in varied manners while they actually kept their wits about them would have been scarier. They just totally fell apart and the first guy to die was the one with the most common sense. Dont kill that character first.,The Ritual

400,maxbinnewies,A lower rating would be unfair because it had it's good parts,5,9 May 2020,"A pretty decent horror film for the first hour. A good backstory, suspense is build, some scary elements introduced. Up to this point, the whole thing is pretty good and actually pretty scary. It does everything a good horror film should do. Up to this point it's even realistic. Witchcraft? It only hints at that. Scary monster? Never actually confirmed or in full frame. The rest is just nightmares and one guy murdered and hung in a tree. All totally possible in the real world.Then the movie takes a sudden turn. The monster is real and the movie is suddenly based in the paranormal. Ok, fair enough. I normally don't like paranormal movies, but this has been so good this far, I am willing to make an exception and accept that there is a scary monster running around the forest. What follows is again a couple of pretty good horror scenes of the remaining 3 and then 2 guys trying to survive their ordeal.But when they arrive in the village, the whole thing just turns ridiculous. The monster turns out to be a giant moose that is not even that big or scary? Random people in the forest that alternate between being zombies, witches and simple medievel folks? What the hell is even going on here? Why do they life like it's the year 900? Why don't they just flee the forest? Are they immortal? What's their relationship to the hyperactive elk? We never really get answers, because the movie suddenly turns around and concludes that the whole story had just one meaning: All you need to do is stand-up to the monsters in your head. So ... I mean we get it ... Guy is haunted by robbery, yelling at weird moose monster helps him overcome his trauma. That has been foreshadowed since the beginning, so no surprise there.And that just leaves us with a whole bunch of weirdness. It's not art. It's not horror. It's not even great CGI. If it would have just been the crazy monster and only one guy managed to escape, sure why not, decent horror flick, no reasonable explanation required. Instead it tries to go for some deep meaning of how you have to fight the deamons in your head. So your remaining three friends died, but it's all groovy aslong as you learned something? The alternative here is, that EVERYTHING was in his head, and neither his friends nor scary moose were with him in the forest. Ok, fair enough, but then the witch/zombie/medieval village doesn't fit in. You just don't dream stuff like that up, even if you're traumatised with PTSD. What remains is nonsense. And the learning from this movie is, stick to one storyline. If you make a movie about facing your mental enemies you can't also make one about zombies, witches and angry forest animals at the same time.",The Ritual

The movie started off very interesting, but as you progress more into the story the plot completely falls apart. I blame the story line breaking apart due to poor writing and lack of dialogue.

It would not have gotten dark. I guess it's just a lazy and exploitative film with no real message.The film makes no sense because it doesn't actually show what it would have been like on the King's Trail. I'm also confused by the suggestion to head south west when the trail heads west from Abisko, meaning they would likely have to head east to return.The ending is, at best, cheap and badly done and, at worst, really offensive to the Sami who populate the arctic circle region.",The Ritual
403,mashkej,Best horror ive seen in a long while....,9,19 February 2018,"First up...and Im probably too late...i suggest watching this movie with as little spoilers as possible. Its a tense, suspenseful, entertaining horror movie that had me on board from the opening scene through the final shot. Stop here..go watch it!ok...for those still reading...i'll dig deeper but avoid too much spoilers. Alot of people are connecting this with Blair Witch, which i suppose is ok from a setting standpoint, but dont fully agree with. This movie centers around a group of men who have been friends for a long time and do a fun ""guys"" vacation each year. The film opens with them experiencing a horrible event and then moves quickly to their vacation choice...a 3 day mountain hike in Switzerland.From there it goes bad.I suggest watching this film in a darkened room and just go along with the group as they experience some scary stuff. The horror is two fold as in addition to what they come up against, there is also the ""man vs nature"" element of them (at one point) being very lost within a wooded expanse. Another great aspect of the flick is it blends several horror genre's. i wont list them here as it would spoil 3rd act reveals but there's some doosys! Check it out!!!",The Ritual
404,amandawoods71,"It's not really horror, it's symbolism",9,28 February 2021,"I really like this film, and while it's not supposed to be gore, It's more psychological, and although I've never read the book, I think this story is worth analyzing anyway. If you're interested in the opinion of a literature
professor, then read on. If you don't, then don't. This review was much better the first time I wrote it, before it got erased.
When the story first opens, we see Luke witnessing his friend's murder at the hands of store robbers. Luke does not act, he sits silently, warning his friend not to act defiantly, and frozen in inaction himself. Later, in the forest, each friend begins to have visions or nightmares, over time, the nightmares no longer occur while they are sleeping. Luke's visions are always of the terror-filled events of the convenience store; we get a sense he will never really leave it. We know that he has become a sort of half-man; he seems distant from the group, a point driven home when his friends confirm to his face that they believe him to be a coward and to various extents, no longer a friend, part of the manly comeraderie. Each time we see his store-vision, we notice that the topography of the forest has encroached more and more on the scene, as this incident overtakes the murder of his friend as the worst thing that ever happened to him. As Luke becomes more and more ""present"" in this current situation (instead of living in the past), his friends become more and more dependent on him to guide them, to be a scout for them, to be the sole survivor of the group, and in the end, to avenge them. Luke, out of all four men, was chosen as worthy by the god to join the ranks of his worshippers. He is the singular one, the character most developed. (If you want to go down this rabbit hole, Greek drama tells us that it's the character who has experienced the most pain who is the most developed, surpassing even the gods themselves in compassion and therefore, perfection.) When the god itself faces him (excellent imagination of a Nordic god-monster, BTW), it forces Luke down into a prone worship stance I believe 3 times, a significant number in storytelling; it shows that the protagonist has surpassed his issues and has chosen this act very deliberately. Luke stands defiantly in the face of the fear-god itself, successfully, even wounding it to demonstrate his superiority to it. He leaves the forest, also leaving the convenience store behind with it (notice the lack of store imagery in this ending scene), and turns and screams at The Fear as loudly as he can, again 3 times, in a perfect foil to his silence and inaction in the first scene which froze his life in terror and shame. He leaves the forest and drops his weapon, which he will no longer need.

406,HermitBat,Great First Full Length Film for David Bruckner,7,16 March 2018,"Overall this film has strong positive points despite the weaker elements. As far as directing a full length film for the first time, I feel strongly that David Bruckner did an awesome job. (prior works are segments for VHS, Southbound, and The Signal). What this film did right;
-Foreboding atmosphere of the forest that is very similar to how effective the forest setting was in the film The Witch.-Pacing overall worked. My only gripe is towards the very beginning where I didn't feel as much investment, but luckily that part didn't last super long.-Knowing when to show something and not to show something. As I stated, this film does a great job in utilizing the forest environment as something eerie and foreboding that creates unease in both the characters and the viewers. However, it doesn't end up being a disappointment because eventually the film does reveal the the aspect of what makes the forest so terrifying. -The visuals of the cinematography are pleasing to look at and work super well with the narrative and tone of the film.-The creature design at the end of the movie was fantastic. The effects on it were well done and the design was so unique and unsettling. Granted, I was more entranced than afraid of the creature's appearance, I still consider it more of a positive than a negative.What this film did not do so well;
-Some of the acting was questionable regarding the main characters. Not really the aspects of them showing fear, but my main gripe is with how they interact with one another. Their chemistry was not super believable. However it wasn't bad to the point of it ruining the film.-The flashback scenes during the main character's nightmares broke the film's pacing and they weren't really effective and coming off as scary. Visually they were pulled off well, but for story's sake they felt extremely out of place to me.-The premise of the characters hiking into the woods because they think it'll shorten their trip back to their destination is a little unbelievable.Overall this film isn't perfect, and most of problems with it come from the actors and the writing rather than the director or cinematography. I really hope that Bruckner gets to make more full length movies, for I did enjoy this film a lot and I know he has potential to make better film.",The Ritual

It gave me The Blair Witch Project vibes and I was really excited. I thought it was something different than most of this kind of movies, the horror that it made me feel was mostly psychological. No jumpscares or poor attempts to be scary. That goes for the 2/3 of the movie. The rest was really dissapointing. It made me feel like they were tired of trying to make a good horror movie, so they came up with a poor, typical ending. Even if they wanted to keep the same ending scenario, they could have put more effort into it. Maybe not showing the monster (which was not scary at all) or not having a typical ""wrestling"" scene between the monster and the main actor (where the actor -oh, what a surprise- wins the monster that has been killing since it was created). I would have liked it more if the actor had died like the rest of its victims or if he had been part of this ""cult"" and started loving it. I don't know, something different than the usual.

417,MetallicityBrandon,"Pretty Good Horror, That's All",7,11 February 2021,"The Ritual is a movie that blew me away the first time I saw it, but upon multiple viewings, has started to grate on me.This movie rides on the relationships of the main characters and spooky atmosphere. Outside of that, there's almost nothing to like, especially towards the end.There are technically four main characters, but one of them pretty much doesn't exist. He doesn't have a character arc and barely has any meaningful dialogue. The four mains are supposed to be best friends with strong tension between them, but one of them can barely be called a character. It definitely breaks down the supposed friendship. The focus ends up being on Luke, Dom, and Hutch, who at least have some effort put into them. Hutch mostly served as a mediator between Luke and Dom, but hes a likeable guy and you feel for his situation. Luke and Dom are both very watchable, and their actors are mostly competent, sometimes great.The first two-thirds of this movie are pretty intense. It's nearly all build-up and this is easily the best part of the movie. I do think that there could have been more going on to establish the antagonistic force of the movie, because a lot of the build-up time is centered around the characters. This is fine, but it makes the two plots feel very separate when they are clearly supposed to be intertwined.Luke feels guilty over their friend Rob's death, and the other characters all blame him to varying degrees. The antagonists of the movie hone in on his feelings of guilt, and there are strongly symbolic elements showing this at the end. This only shows that the two plots were supposed to work together, but again they really don't. This is especially bad in the third act when the spooky plot takes center stage.The Ritual is a fine movie with 75% good characters, good performances, and a good atmosphere. It's beginning scenes are especially tense, and it's worth watching just for that. It definitely falls apart towards the end, though. The Ritual does fill a niche for me that not much else has and that has definitely influenced my rating. If you like folk, cosmic, and/or atmospheric horror, this is probably worth your time. If not, give it a pass.",The Ritual
418,janulimeyer,"Good thriller, but not scary for me",6,26 February 2021,"A friend recommended this film to me and it looked interesting so I watched it. First of all I noticed that it was greatly inspired by the blair witch project movie from 1999 which isn't a bad thing since that movie was outstanding. Up until the last 40 minutes the movie was very thrilling and there were some great scary scenes but then it went into a direction that I personally didn't like so much. There were some things that just didn't make sence to me but I won't name them precisely because I don't want spoilers in this review. Because of those things I got pretty bored in the last act of the film. At this point I want to say that I hardly get really scared but I know that that isn't true for everyone so this movie can definitely be really scary for you.
If you're new to horror movies I would recommend watching The Ritual since it's not too scary but very thrilling. On the other hand, if you're a more experienced horror movie watcher and want to get scared I wouldn't recommend this one. I would recommend the 1999 blair witch project to you since it is a lot more scary in my opinion.So overall The Ritual is a good movie but I expected it to scare me and since it didn't do that I will only give it six stars.",The Ritual

The friends traverse off the beaten track in search of a quicker route and get stranded in a dense and eerie forest with not just harsh weather but a far more ominous presence for company.Although the movie is largely predictable, it is still quiet riveting because of some masterful cinematography and sound effects which constantly maintains the atmospheric tension. This is complemented with some earnest performances from the entire cast, especially the lead played by Rafe Spall.It is also an allegory on how fear holds you captive and to survive the outer demon, one must first conquer his inner demons.Despite the lack of novelty, The Ritual is an enjoyable watch and is one of the better horror films available on Netflix.",The Ritual

Those four are, The Blair Witch Project, Pumpkinhead, The Wicker Man and King Kong. Personally, I would rather watch any of those four for the umpteenth time rather than sit through The Ritual for a second viewing.
Those four films were innovative and had heart and soul as well as characters that you actually cared about, and they left the viewer satisfied.
Like my heading states, The Ritual borrowed some heavy ingredients, but only half baked the idea.
My biggest gripe is the zero chemistry between the 4 one-note characters that are supposed to be friends. They are not believable as friends for one second and the viewer suffers while watching four actors give ridiculous one-note performances. We have ""the angry one,"" ""the guilt ridden one,"" ""the bland one who's gonna get it first"" and ""the token one."" The back-burner story about the 5th friend is as shallow and pointless as the characters.
The one saving grace of this movie is the true star of the cast ... The Woods. OMG, those woods were beautiful and creepy as hell at the same time.

The story is simple yet complicated. It makes you wonder if you have to sympathize with the characters or despise them. So it worked to make you see the characters as 3 dimensional.If I have to compare it to other movies, It might be like Blair Witch Project x Midsommar.

And that's all this film has. It's as though a bunch of college students made this.Real horror comes from within the viewer, with the script tapping into the viewer's fears. This film simply relies on the viewer's experience with horror films and hits the viewer over the head with utterly annoying music. It's nothing but one contrived shot after another.

461,mbridgham110,Just the way I like 'em,9,13 October 2018,"Spoilers. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If you've spent any time in the woods it is easy to realize that there are myriad stretches of the wild even relatively small patches, where all manner of mysterious things could exist and we might never know of them (until it's too late). This movie does an excellent job of conveying that sense. The forest itself and being lost in it, losing one's way, panic and looming despair. These heightened by inner group tensions are the best achievements of this film. And then there are the other horrors. And they creep in and accelerate. Not overly gory or dwelled upon but sudden and unforgiving. Let it be said that I like my monster movies to have monsters, not psychological maybe's, not psychotic humans, real monsters. And for me, this film did not disappoint with an intriguing and different design, that is both explicit and not-quite, and a sense of the ancient and ethnic. It's not a perfect film by any means, one angle of the horror is never satisfactorily woven in and I got tired of the men shouting at each other. Many reviews have dissed the ending but I thought it worked just fine. And reinforced the notion that patches of wilderness hold their secrets.",The Ritual

And with that being said I think it's fair to say that this movie was very well directed but it could have been so much more if it didn't had such a poor script.
As for flaws with this movie, despite the bad script, I found some performances that where not so great, the third half of the movie is terrible, it's like they just explain to you everything that is happening, they show the monster and I think the movie lost all the scary factor in that part. There is some cheap jumpscares, you know, loud sounds and things happening that aren't really scary or fit in the concept, just things that where thrown in there to make you go ""AAH!"". And it doesn't really work.
As for the good parts of the movie, I had a scary experience watching the first two half of this movie, I think the dream scenes worked very well, the cinematography was great and most of the actors did pretty well.
In conclusion, I think the movie is still worth watching despite all the flaws and waste of a talented director, it is a decent movie, not bad but definitely not good. 5/10",The Ritual

A wrong turn leads them into the mysterious forests of Norse legend, where an ancient evil exists and stalks them at every turn. It is quite different from the source novel, I suspect for reasons to do with adapting the tale to a different medium. It is a well-executed, deftly performed horror story that supplies the requisite amount of scares and is rich in atmosphere. I have watched a number of horror movies over the years that fall flat, and this isn't one of them due to its good production values and strong cast.

This was a nice surprise. The story is suspenseful, the visuals are satisfactorily creepy and the creature design is a breath of fresh air. After all the repetitive spookydooks with the long-dark-hair, gaunt faces and scritchyscratchy nails, I was beginning to think horror and monster horrors had simply run out of ideas. I like that the mythology is strong with this one and although some may complain that the ending is abrupt I am just so relieved that it has an ending. Unlike most of the films that are following this trend of leaving the story open ended with no explanations. Which I believe 90% of the time is not stylistic, it's just laziness. The Ritual gets an 8/10 because it's a movie with beautiful cinematography, solid acting, suspense and special effects.

When one of them trips and hurts his knee they decide to commence on a journey through the forests of Northern Sweden - as a shortcut back to an area where they can seek shelter and supplies. Upon entering the forest, The Ritual takes an immediate turn for the better in horror. Pagan symbolism litters the ancient bark on trees. They encounter dedication to the occult. After exposing themselves to the shrine, darkness envelopes their minds, and paranoia/fear sweeps through the group like dust through cracks. What follows is a thrilling, and haunting, film that chases the group through the antediluvian woods as they are stalked by an archaic demon/creature far beyond their comprehension. Sometimes cheesy and sometimes terrifying, the Ritual proves that modern horror can be unique and meritorious still.Side Note: The creature may be one of the few harrowing entities on screen to elicit a genuine horror response from the viewer!

The most significant factor that the audience is seeking for is the excitement evoked by dread and fear as well as a meaningful lfe lesson right after. Experienced David Bruckner, who had previous success with Southbound and understood this kind of film well enough, made the most of the available scary mysteries of the Western Norse mythology and dragged people through a sin-cos functions of feeling with climax and minutes of deep thought.

What sounds like an ordinary jumpscare-movie is actual an atmospherically extremely well done horror film by David Bruckner released in 2017. Based on a novel by Adam Nevill and with Rafe Spall, Arsher Ali and Robert James-Collier in the main roles, i´ts an worth mentioning work of the genre.
Five friends get together after a long period of time to go hiking in Sweden. But in the same evening, one of them got murdered during a raid. Years later, the remaining four decide to go on the planned route, the Kings Trail in northern Sweden. But on of them, Dom, hurts his leg and they take a shortcut trough a deep forest. Unfortunaly, theres somthing ancient waiting to chase them down.
You will never want to go hiking alone again after you watched that what Bruckner created here. The suspense curve is great designed, the CGI and the music as well. The connection to the norse mythology creates a mythical atmosphere, which lifts the movie out of the crowd. But not everything about this film is to be praised in high tones. The characters are flat and without any development, and anyone who has seen this will agree that the ending is very unsatisfying. Despite the flaws, I advise anyone who finds norse mythology interesting to see this film.

I liked how the plot depicts the aftermath trauma of a horrific life event that has put too much pain in the main actor's life as a fictional horror battle in forest. I absolutely loved mixing reality with that imaginary horrific story and the thrilling the director has put into the movies through many witty dialogues between the friends. I rarely write reviews on movies but I did for this one as I think it deserves more than 6 stars.,The Ritual

510,theAdvizor,4 Dummies Go for a Hike,1,19 August 2018,"When I started typing this review, I felt like this movie was a 4/10. I didn't hate it while I was watching it. Well, that's not true. There wasn't much to like. I felt like the writers had as hard of a time figuring out what this movie was about as I did. By the time it was over, I felt a little offended. I just didn't get this movie. I understand nature. I've done loads of camping/hiking. I understand the dynamic of being a male with male companions. (Was that part of the movie?) I have common sense. Etc. 
 
When we meet 4 college buddies in the Swedish mountainside, we meet seemingly prepared and experienced hikers. Packs. Supplies. Tents. Ability to get to a destination expediently. Then it rains and all hope is lost (?). As we get to know the group, it becomes clear that only one of them can read a compass and collectively, they are incompetent. Evidently, they just ran up credit cards at REI buying clothes to make them look like they know what's up. With as little leadership as survival instinct, our group of lackluster naturists falls one at a time to what seems like unpreparedness? Or maybe unsuspectingness? Or no-primal-instict-ness? Or forced-horror-ness? Not really sure after two hours, but all of that has something to do with it. I think? This group of gutless wonders cant seem to get passed each other's egos, weak mindedness or general lack of woodsmanship. The first test of fortitude comes in an abandon house. All live on, but none can cope with their dreams? Not dreams. But maybe dreams? A nude man praying to a bunch of sticks, unbeknownst to the viewer that what we're seeing is a voo-doo(?) type representation of what we much later find out is something to do with the Norse God Loki? But not Loki directly. Something to do with Loki? Maybe the Swedish version of Loki? But they're British so maybe the British version? Nonetheless, Loki is an evil Deer? Doesn't seem right...the rest is mostly nonsensical. Found they're way to their destination with no trouble. Couldn't find their way back. Gets dark. Cheap thrill type stuff. This whole movie seems to be just like that. Something to do with hiking? Something to do with mythology? Something to do with supernatural? Something to do with friends? Something to do with loss? It's all bad. No character development other than the lone survivor is a huge p*%#$. The plot was fulfilled in 10 minutes. The rest is a huge waste of time.",The Ritual

515,malherbejo,A breath of fresh air...,8,11 February 2018,"I don't remember ever reviewing a movie here, but I decided to come at the rescue of this movie...
I really enjoyed this movie and I go against the reviews which once more put it in the ""average around 6.0 score"" where so many other scary movies are standing.
I consider myself a horror/scary amateur and I have seen many movies of this kind, and since the last 10 years, its getting harder to find some that makes you say ""ok, this was a bit different"".... (of course there are some, but in my opinion over the large quantity, only over 20% are passing the ""not too bad"" test"").
For once, we don't have to bear some stupid teenagers partying for spring break in the forest, some people behaving so stupidly that you think ""seriously ??"", a haunted house, a possession, or a redneck hillbilly family... 
Here the movie has a lot of a ""realistic"" touch to it, the characters are normal and they could be us, normal people behaving normally in the face of danger and fear and that reinforce the attachment for the characters. Many times I wondered, ""damn, i dont know what I would have done in this situation"".
The mood is nicely growing more and more stressing and not much of the ""monster"" is shown for a long time, letting the viewer finding out slowly about the real horror happening in those woods. The change of scenery (Swedish forest) and the isolation of the characters reinforce the idea that nature in itself can be scary and that even a friendly country like Sweden can appear in another light...
The last quarter of the movie is a bit more conventional to the genre but still not falling in all the clichés. I especially raise a thumb up for the creature design and the explanation on what it is. Probably not all will approve, but I liked the way this was going and when learning what the creature really was, I wondered ""would I try to fight against that or give up ?""So yeah, this movie is not THE movie of the year for me, but for sure, it is totally over many of the ""i watch and I forget"" movie that I've been seing in horror recently.

525,FpsJimbo94,Strong start but poor final act.,6,19 September 2017,"Just came out of an early screening of this film during Odeon's monthly 'ScreamUnseen'. The film surrounds 4 friends who embark on a hike across a remote part of Sweden for a recently deceased friend. Things start to turn bad after they decide to take a shortcut through the forest. I split this film into 2 parts: The first part surrounds the group getting lost in the woods trying to find their way back to their cabin and encountering strange things and sounds in the woods. The woods give you a very strange and eerie vibe which I think the film excels at.The cinematography was great and really captured the sense of unease and isolation in the woods.The films also explores the subject of grief, especially in one of the main characters in the film and this has consequences heading into the latter parts of the film. Unfortunately the second part of this film falls short for reasons I can't go into without spoiling the film. If you are a fan of horror films set in the woods you'll have seen this kind of ending many times before. 'The Ritual' has some great strengths but unfortunately falls short towards the end of the movie. Definitely a film for fans of films such as 'Blair Witch' & 'Backcounty'.",The Ritual

535,keruirenlei,The Ritual (2017),7,19 September 2017,"2017 has been a very mixed year for horror (so far, anyway) We've had some fairly terrible movies like Rings, The Bye Bye Man and Annabelle: Creation but we've also had some unique, memorable films such as Get Out, It Comes at Night and IT. I'm still holding out for films such as Happy Death Day, Jigsaw and Creep 2 to be great but one film I didn't expect to enjoy was The Ritual. I saw the trailer before my screening of IT and it looked to be just another throwaway horror movie trying to be the next The Blair Witch Project. Thankfully, the film's trailer was just a poor attempt at showing what the film actually is like and shouldn't be used to assess the quality of the movie. The film's premise isn't entirely original, a bunch of friends decide to go hiking and to save time decide to cut through an eerie forest. This premise has been done to death in movies and even though director David Bruckner (V/H/S/) tries to set his film apart from the rest, the final product ends up feeling very cliché. Where the film does shine is with its cast of characters, the four friends on their hiking adventure which takes a sour turn for the worst. Our protagonist Luke (Rafe Spall) is the most interesting, fleshed-out character of the bunch and I was surprised to find out that the first act of the movie is centred around character development which really gave us a chance to learn about and care for these characters.After witnessing the murder of his friend, Robert (Paul Reid), Luke suffers incredible guilt and feels as if he's responsible for Robert's death as he chose to hide instead of step in and try to protect his friend. Spall does a good job portraying Luke by going the quiet and reserved route for the first half of the movie and while I wouldn't say there were any stand-out performances, everybody involved did well with the material they had and the banter between the friends kept things interesting and was good fun to watch.One of the things I absolutely loved about this movie was how it looked visually. Director of photography Andrew Shulkind (Southbound) does an incredible job of making the audience feel like they're in the woods with these friends. The incredible overhead shots of the area truly makes the forest feel like its own character which I adored. However, some of the scenes shot at night are hard to make out due to how dark it is at times but during the daytime sequences, the film looks visually stunning.One of the weaker aspects of the movie is the horror. I'd actually hesitate to even call this movie a horror flick and feel like if it was marketed as a thriller, people would have enjoyed this movie a little more (judging from some of the mixed reception it's received after it's premiere at TIFF and ODEON's Scream Unseen program, which I saw the film at).Although there's a few unsettling images and scenes scoured throughout, I wouldn't say any of it was that scary. For the majority of the second act, the horror comes from the friends discovering horrific things such as a bear pinned up to a tree with its guts ripped out. Like I said before, not entirely original but still unsettling. When the friends realize they're going to have to find shelter on the first night of their venture into the woods, they stay the night in an abandoned cabin which has strange markings inside, similar to ones they've seen on some of the trees outside. After searching the house for items to start a fire, they discover a strange pagan headless creature in the basement which looks like something ripped directly out of The Wicker Man. After discovering this strange figure, the friends all try to get some sleep but are each haunted by nightmares. Although we get to hear about most of them, the only ones we get to experience are Luke's. All of them reside in the shop where Robert was murdered and each one of these gets progressively more and more disturbing throughout the course of the film.Without going into spoiler territory, the third act of the movie caught me off guard and really surprised me. As I said before, the trailer made it seem as if this film was just trying to be the next Blair Witch but once the true nature of the film is revealed, I was on the edge of my seat until the credits rolled.The film has a lot of charm and humour which also surprised me. There's a few moments in the movie during the third act which had myself and the audience in hysterics. Also, it might contain my favourite visual gag of the entire year involving Luke and an old lady. The film takes itself very seriously but knows when to have fun and lighten up the tone a little. This isn't a comedy though so if you're expecting something along the lines of Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead in terms of humour, you're going to be disappointed. The humour is definitely a welcome addition though.Overall, The Ritual was a very fun time. Although, I wouldn't say it's my favourite horror-thriller movie of the year, it does a great job making you feel lost in the woods with these characters and with a surprise shift in tone during the third act, the movie never feels boring or uninteresting. Good performances, stunning visuals and an entertaining, albeit cliché premise make for a solid directorial feature debut. I'm looking forward to see more from Bruckner in the future and if his previous work is any indication of how versatile he is as a horror filmmaker (he previously worked on the first short in the horror anthology V/H/S/) then we're in for a treat.",The Ritual

I have spent a good many nights there in tents and cabins, and I am pretty well educated about the folklore. This one turns into something that is reall none-Scandinavian in terms of that. None of the ""rituals"" or creatures have nothing to do with actual lore. Sure, they speak about norse figures like the children of Loki, but that is just silly.As a fright-flick, though, it is good.And for you to know: We do have scary creatures in the woods.

Four middle aged men hiking across the Swedish wilderness in hope of some kind of clarity in wake of their deceased friend. The whole ancient god theory has fascinated me for some time now, and in this feature this group of men slowly get stalked and hunted by this demonic entity. It preys on their insecurity's and creates a very nightmarish world for them to endure. When you look at the ideas and the cinematography, it really is quite a spectacle. I personally liked the concept of the film and the sense of insanity that goes with it. If you take it at face value its just as above average.

555,derpderpswe,"Decent low-budget film, but what were they thinking?",3,19 February 2018,"The film is rather good, where focus is on a good story and acting, rather than CGI effects.But...why didn't the makers do it properly while they were at it?
Why film it in Romania rather than actually record it in the real Sarek (or elsewhere in the north of Sweden?
Perhaps even some real swedes playing parts, instead of...whoever they were.Myself, being Swedish with some genuine experience of the Kungsleden trail, I instantly noticed that the terrain was off.And the guys, what were THEY thinking? Going to Kungsleden means that you need to be PREPARED. 
But they weren't. No IFAK or Medkit, no aspirin even. Not worn-in shoes. Only one compass and map. None of them seemed to have any outdoor experience what so ever.Perhaps that was supposed to be a part of the story? But it was *too* much rookie-stuff, so it went sideways instead.I won't see it again, but I still enjoyed it.Ps: Up there, either there is 6 months of darkness - or there is 6 months of daylight. Not both in the same day/night.",The Ritual
556,hernandezhomer,Quite disturbing....,6,9 March 2018,"Really liked the film something about it makes it disturbing creepy for me. The creepy monster makes it evem more weird, i have to compare it to the original ""Blair Witch"", which for me has to be one of the most terrifying movie in its time. Wont go much into deatil on the film but i highly recommend.",The Ritual
557,heytanaya,My favorite monster of October 2020,8,25 October 2020,"The Ritual has an imaginative monster I love; and it's a great movie to boot.
I watched the movie twice within a week and it was great both times.",The Ritual
558,nchlslang,Refreshing occult horror movie,9,23 May 2018,"Great suspense mixed with some witchcraft lore and a awesome looking monster that I did not feel was super cheesy like horror monsters i see slot of lately. This literally had me on the edge of my seat through the movie with an ending that was also not very cheesy like ""the quiet place"" for instance. Go see if you kiwi anything i described",The Ritual
559,caiosaldanhaduarte,Simply the best horror movie in years,10,3 June 2018,"I can't believe the poor reviews of this title, they are either jealous or just can't understand talent when they see it.This movie has a sound story with state of the art messages about traumas and folclores alongside a very well crafted concept art. I'm not a guy to get frightned easely, but this movie made me think about dark places like no other.",The Ritual
560,paul-05393,More Films from Adam Nevill stories please.,7,4 June 2018,"Adam Nevill is seen as the British Steven king. I enjoy both authors but always find adaptations of Stephen king books a bit commercial. If more of Nevill's work follows this bring it on.This is what you see when you read the book ""No one gets out alive"" or ""House of small shadows next please"". Leave ""Last days"" alone I like that on the page.. The Ritual is British horror as it should be scary, bleak, raw and un-senational.",The Ritual
561,sambrocio,Very stereotypical as expected.,5,30 May 2019,"This movie was very stereotypical but now a days almost all are. Same tropes of college friends take a trip to foreign place they dont know well. One of them feels guilty over someones death which they should. One of them gets injured as always makin them all mad, what happens? Oh lets take a shortcit to get to said place faster. Expected. Smartest guy gets killed first. Strongest guy survives. Witchcraft stuff in woods. Demon. Too overdone and just not interesting enough to get hype about. The suspense and visuals were okay which is why ill give it a 5.",The Ritual

566,poledo,"Within 5 minutes, I was done",3,27 July 2018,"I know, people are going to say I never gave it a chance. However, as someone else stated, relate-able characters are key, and I could relate to the one friend and I identified him as someone whom I would despise for his actions through the rest of the movie. I was just done at that point. I'm beyond picky at this time in my life and I am very unforgiving. This movie failed in the first 5 minutes and I moved on to find one that didn't.",The Ritual
567,momelonms,Worst movie ever,1,14 February 2019,"This is the worst movie i have ever seen. Nothing added up and it was a complete mess. It's also not scary at all. I recommend you to stay away and choose another movie.
DO NOT WATCH, i was bored senseless",The Ritual
568,johnyuhas-71202,Excellent film,10,10 August 2018,"This is one of the better horror films in quite some time! Not Disturbing, but one that makes you question your belief system. The back drop of sweedens countryside adds eerie feeling throughout its entirety.",The Ritual
569,paulocon,Great Movie,8,15 June 2019,"This movie was chilling and thrilling.
The atmosphere was consistently creepy through the film and I appreciated that the film had a genuine storyline, as I feel many horror movies loose their direction because they are to focused on scares.
The acting and special effects were top notch and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good horror.",The Ritual
570,llive-13100,Excellent movie,7,18 August 2018,Worth to watch. But only obsession was that animal face is not clearly visible. Looks like a doll .. lol :P But worth to watch :),The Ritual

572,p-63115-95583,"Tense, Well Acted & Visually Stunning",8,9 September 2019,"After making a string of bad choices from Netflix's selection of horror movies over the last few weeks, 'The Ritual' delivered a much needed character driven story along with it's tense, slow burning horror.It's also beautiful to look at - the mountains and forests that provide the backdrop for the story are visually stunning and there are some great uses of camera work used in the film to heighten the feeling of uneasy suspense that lingers and gradually builds throughout it's first half.Along with its aesthetics, what really impressed me are the main characters - their interactions feel very real and believable throughout and Rafe Spall in particular is fantastic as Luke; whose struggle with his sense of guilt over the events that lead him and three of his friends into the wild to begin with runs parallel to trying to escape the events befalling them throughout the movie.Devoid of the cheaper jump scares and cliched characters found in a lot of it's contemporaries, 'The Ritual' is a great way to spend a tense couple of hours with a some great acting, believable characters and stunning scenery.",The Ritual

We were watching Same scene over and over again, until only one person of course stayed alive. Even the monster was beyond imagination!
Not even a horror movie - boring as hell I could say!
Please, please. DO NOT SPEND YOUR TIME BY WATCHING THIS MOVIE!",The Ritual
575,ajmarsh-54088,Great,9,13 March 2020,A great horror movie with real characters with a real motivation that you can relate to. Minimal jump scares. Big fan,The Ritual
576,whois-07201,Terrible script. Makes no sense.,1,31 December 2018,"Script and plot make no sense. These are college friends? If I fight as much with any friend, we won't stay friends, much less go on a hiking trip together. On the trip and throughout the movie, these ""friends"" disagree and contradict everything anyone says. These are not friends, they're idiots. Lots of long, blank stares waiting (almost hoping) for horrible things to happen. I don't mind the horror and mystery but the script is so pathetic that the characters become brainless, suicidal idiots constantly yelling at each other and almost looking for horrible things to happen to themselves and to others.",The Ritual
577,thebluexp,Catastrophique,1,13 July 2021,"I think that's the worst movie I've ever watched,
Silly story, very bad acting and terrible filming
Not frightening at all and very old style horror.",The Ritual
