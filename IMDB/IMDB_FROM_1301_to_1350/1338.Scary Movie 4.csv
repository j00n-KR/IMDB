0,TheLittleSongbird,The worst of the series,1,15 July 2011,"I enjoyed the first movie, liked the second though it had problems, and thought the third was okay. This however was a mess and definitely for me the worst of the series. The gags and spoofs aren't as focused this time around, The Grudge and The Village were not my idea of movies to spoof on, and the spoofs on them were rather weak. The acting is rather dire this time round with nobody seemingly able to get past their weak material or stock characters. The script is very unfunny and tired, the film pace-wise is for me the dullest of the four, the story is too thin for the running time and is predictable as well, the production values are rather cheap and the soundtrack is generic and uninspired. All in all, a bad movie and the worst of the series. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Scary Movie 4
1,Leofwine_draca,As dumb as ever,3,5 January 2013,"I don't know why I bothered watching this, because I knew I wouldn't like it. I didn't like any of the previous movies, but because I've seen all the kinds of films being spoofed, I kind of ended up watching it anyway. Sadly, SCARY MOVIE 4 only raised a few chuckles during its running time, although it's still a slight improvement over the exceptionally stupid first and second films in this series.There aren't so many films being spoofed this time around; the format instead picks about four or five major ones and kind of links them all together with a would-be storyline. So we get an opening sequence based on SAW (the best bit, actually), then follow-ups involving spins on THE GRUDGE (which I found a bit racist), THE VILLAGE, and WAR OF THE WORLDS.Sadly, the terrible Anna Faris is STILL finding work (and as awful as ever, dragging every moment she appears in down), but some of the supporting actors fare better. It's particularly fine to see Leslie Nielsen, still on top form playing the US president and providing most of the (few) laughs along the way.",Scary Movie 4
2,SnoopyStyle,not funny enough,3,2 November 2014,Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is jobless and has sent her kid to military school. She takes a job taking care of Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman) living in a haunted house. Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) is the next door neighbor who is spending the weekend with his two kids. Then the War of the Worlds happen. Incompetent President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) tries to organize the defense. Cindy reunites with Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) who survives a plane crash.The early departure of Charlie Sheen really saps the energy from this one. Basically I watch this hoping against any hope that Charlie would come back. David Zucker is back to mash together a string of random movie spoofs. I don't understand the addition of Tom Ryan as the new main character if he doesn't spend the entire movie with Cindy. Anna Faris is still funny playing dumb. The rest is just too random and too scattered without being actually funny. The bloopers are way funnier with Anthony Anderson trying to kiss Kevin Hart.,Scary Movie 4
3,claudio_carvalho,Shut Down Your Brain (Again) and Start Laughing With this Funny Franchise,7,20 May 2007,"The unemployed Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is hired to work in a cursed house as caretaker of an old lady and meets the ghost of a boy. Meanwhile, the teenager son Robbie and the young daughter Rachel of his next door neighbor and crane operator Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) are spending the weekend with their loser father. Cindy and Tom meet and fall in love for each other, but when Giant Tripods invade Earth, Tom escapes with Robbie and Rachel; Cindy travels to a village, trying to find the answer to a riddle to save the world; and the president of USA organizes the defense of the planet in UN under his intelligence and leadership.As I have previously wrote, parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual, I love cinema as culture, but also as entertainment, so I like this genre. Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic references to other films and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar.I found this ""Scary Movie 4"" also very funny. The screenplay is a big joke with the remake of ""War of the Worlds"", entwined with ""The Grudge"" and ""The Village"". It also satirizes ""Saw"" and ""Saw 2"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". There are also references to the American pop culture that I unfortunately have not understood, like for example Dr. Phil, the Oprah talk show in the end (see Obs.) or Bruce the Bed King. Leslie Nielsen is hilarious in the role of the smart president.This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. What I do not understand and really irritates me are the reviews of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD called ""Scary Movie 4"" (""the last part of a trilogy""), directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen and Anna Farris in the cast? An art movie, with hidden messages, an epic, a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Todo Mundo em Pânico 4' ('Everybody in Panic 4')Obs: My son has just forwarded ""Tom Cruise Freakin Out On Oprah"" in Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M08PfuP_NXs",Scary Movie 4
4,kosmasp,Weakest Link,2,13 October 2013,"If you spoof movies, that weren't any good in the first place, you might have a problem. And that is one of the many issues this movie has here. While we won't get any ""Airplane!"" anytime soon, it's not wrong to assume that a movie connected to the Zucker name (and with Mr. Nielsen in it too) has some expectations attached to it.Almost none of them are met, and while it doesn't really commit the crime of trying to be funny, when it doesn't have to be (scenes that being played straight work better most of the time, if not always), the scenes it does deliver miss the mark. There might be a few silly and also nice scenes in between, but you really have to look hard for them. I wouldn't recommend watching this, as I wouldn't recommend you watching ""The Village"" either",Scary Movie 4
5,lee_eisenberg,"When political screw-ups make for Leslie Nielsen's humor, you know that it's good.",10,29 November 2006,"The truth is, ""Scary Movie 4"" has basically no relation to its predecessors (actually, none of them have any relation to each other). It's just an excuse to be as silly as possible, and they succeed in that respect. Mainly spoofing ""The Grudge"" and ""War of the Worlds"" - but also ""Saw"", ""The Village"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield's ear off, George W. Bush reading the children's book while the WTC got attacked, and Tom Cruise's outburst on Oprah's show - they go all out. But what else could they do, considering that the movie stars Leslie Nielsen? Admittedly, it's all low humor (much of it scatological). Not only is it the sort of stuff that will probably only make sense to Americans, but even we might not get the jokes within a few years. But even if we don't, the whole thing's still good for a few laughs. If Anna Faris is to be remembered mainly as Cindy Campbell in these movies, then so be it; after all, she looks pretty good.Also starring Craig Bierko, Regina King, Bill Pullman, Anthony Anderson, Cloris Leachman, Carmen Electra, Charlie Sheen, Molly Shannon, and even appearances by Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil.",Scary Movie 4
6,jboothmillard,Scary Movie 4,2,19 April 2006,"I did used to like the Scary Movie films in a rather immature way, now only the first film is the one I can say good things about, because as they go on the sequels get worse and worse, and the spin off films from the same makers, e.g. Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and Vampires Suck are abysmal, this was the fourth film in the near pointless continuing horror films, television and popularised celebrity news spoof series. This film predominantly parodies the science-fiction, psychological and torture-filled horror films, specifically The Grudge, War of the Worlds, The Village and the Saw series, as well as spoofing or referencing Brokeback Mountain, Dark Water, Hustle & Flow, Million Dollar Baby, The Tripods, Shaun of the Dead, President George W. Bush finding out about 9/11, Russell Crowe throwing his mobile phone at someone, the song ""My Humps"" by The Black Eyed Peas, R. Kelly peeing on someone, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, Thir13en Ghosts, Final Destination, Tom Cruise jumping on the sofa on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Amityville Horror. Basically the film opens with Shaquille 'Shaq' O'Neal and Dr. Phil McGraw waking up in a decayed bathroom with an evil puppet on the television screen telling them that they will die from a deadly nerve gas unless releasing the antidote, and getting some saws they realise they have to cut their feet off in order to get out, but this goes wrong. It then moves to Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) in New York, her nephew Cody is in military school and her husband George (Simon Rex) has died, and Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) commits suicide falling off a roof, after taking a whole bottle of Viagra. Cindy takes a job caring for old Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman) at her house, and the neighbour Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) is having trouble getting on with his children Robbie (Beau Mirchoff) and Rachel (Conchita Campbell), and his friends are Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) who unintentionally reveal a homosexual experience whilst on a cowboy trip in the mountains. After a night of supernatural events Cindy tells Tom her recent tragedy, she was a champion boxer battling against the horrible ear biting black female boxer; she throws a punch and George trips over and breaks his neck on a wooden stool, many other people die as well. After this flashback they kiss, and the sky clouds over and alien Tripods come from beneath the ground and start killing people, the Japanese ghost Toshio Saeki (Garrett Masuda) appears to tell Cindy that the answer to stopping the alien invasion lies with his father. President of the United States, President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is informed of the alien attacks across the world, he seems more interested in hearing the children's story in the school, but he reacts very badly telling the children the story details and disastrous situation, and later at a conference with other world leaders he tries to demonstrate a device to reverse the laser technology of the aliens, that leaves nothing but clothes, it goes wrong and he and the crowd end up naked. After reuniting with friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) the two of them travel to find an Amish community who fear creatures from the outside their village, villagers leader Henry Hale (Bill Pullman), who also has blind daughter Holly (Carmen Electra), rules they can stay, but they may never leave. Meanwhile Tom and his children are travelling to find safety, and they have to avoid the several panicking people and the military, oh, and Michael Jackson, and for a while they hide in the house guarded by mad Oliver (Michael Madsen). Back in the village Henry is attacked and dying, but in his last moments he explains Toshio was his adopted son and he died at the boxing match seen in the flashback, Cindy and Brenda are taken prisoner by the alien ship, along with Tom and his family, and inside the Tripod they wake up in various death traps to test their ability to stay alive. Evil alien puppet Billy from the beginning, along with Zoltar, is the real father of Toshio, Brenda has a fight with the puppet on the television, and after planning to kill Tom and his family he decides to forgive and forget having seen what lengths the father will go to in order to save his children. Nine months later Brenda gives birth to the puppet baby of Zoltar, Mahalik and CJ resume their homosexual relationship, and Tom appears on The Oprah Winfrey Show going crazy for the attention of saving the world and exclaiming his love for Cindy, and ultimately he goes insane, jumping on the sofa, destroying the set, throwing Cindy around, and breaking Oprah's hand before running maniacally at the screen. Also starring Molly Shannon as Marilyn, Chris Elliott as Ezekiel, DeRay Davis as Marvin, Youngbloodz, Chingy , Lil' Jon, John Reardon as Jeremiah, Debra Wilson as Oprah and James Earl Jones as Narrator. The film is not very reminiscent of the classic spoof films at all, like Airplane! or The Naked Gun, even with director David Zucker involved, the character stupidity is highly irritating, the ridiculousness is not all amusing, the gross and disgusting material very high, especially the crude toilet humour, Cindy is clumsy and accident prone in a very annoying way, Brenda is okay but still has moments of annoyance, Nielsen is even more stupid that it is hardly funny, especially with the tasteless joke about Bush being told about 9/11, and the recognisable actors in small parts are hardly worth the effort. You may recognise the films being parodied, and perhaps seeing films you like is okay, but the jokes are all repetitive and predictable, the story is pointless, it is a waste of time, and the same sadly is to be said for one or two of the other sequels in the series as well, an awful horror comedy spoof film. Pretty poor!",Scary Movie 4
7,BA_Harrison,More barrel-scraping comedy.,2,7 July 2011,"When I reviewed Scary Movie 3, I gave it a slightly-higher-than-it-really-deserved rating of 2/10, thereby allowing myself room to give Scary Movie 4 an ever lower score should it somehow be worse; it was a close thing, but part 4 just about saved itself from that particular embarrassment in its closing minutes with a wicked scene at the expense of Tom Cruise that actually made me laugh (better late than never, I suppose).Directed by David Zucker, who also made the dreadful part 3, Scary Movie 4 is another grab-bag of dumb jokes that spoof the horror (and the occasional non-horror) blockbusters of the day, targets this time around including The Grudge, Saw, The Village and War of the Worlds. Once again, the humour is of the most obvious and basic kind; once again, the late and once-great Leslie Nielsen unwisely puts in an appearance, even going so far as to strip off and reveal his saggy, naked frame in the name of comedy (and for a paycheck, of course); and once again, the once lovely Anna Faris takes another step towards complete bimbo-dom, this time sporting a splendid trout pout to go with her now golden mane.",Scary Movie 4
8,Coventry,How do they continue to get worse?,2,23 September 2006,"The concept of the ""Scary Movie""-series is beginning to look more like a tragedy instead of a comedy. The first film was a very entertaining hit because it really felt like a silly idea that started as a joke between brothers but unexpectedly turned into a huge success. The second already sucked because it had to be written in a very short time and this showed. Then the third entry in the series promised some improvement, with the change of director to David Zucker, but it was every bit as disappointing. The fourth part simply continues the trend and presents a spitfire of inane gags, dumb characters and completely uninspired satire. The plots of pretty much every successful recent horror and Sci-Fi movie of the past few years are tacky blend together into one giant ridiculous storyline. Cindy Campbell, ""heroine"" of the previous three films, encounters in one day all the horrors of ""Saw"", ""The Village"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Grudge"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Amityville Horror"". In between, there's even some time left to radically spoof ""Brokeback Mountain"" and even Tom Cruise's idiotic behavior on the couch at Oprah's show. The humor is crude, vulgar and totally tasteless, yet this doesn't bother me at all. The fact that it's also not at all funny irritates me a lot more. The only couple of modest chuckles are provided by good old regular Leslie Nielsen as the nearly senile President of the United States. It doesn't look like the ""Scary Movie"" crew plans to stop making sequels any time soon, so we're all doomed to see many more of these inept turds. Now, I know what you're thinking! ""If you're so annoyed by these movies, then simply stop watching them!"". And you're right, too!",Scary Movie 4
9,michaelRokeefe,Enough of being scared silly?,5,30 November 2006,"Director David Zucker masterminds the fourth installment of the SCARY MOVIE series. Spoofs of THE GRUDGE, THE VILLAGE, SAW and WAR of the WORLDS. Cindy Campbell(Anna Faris)moves into a house that is haunted by a little boy. The who, why and when needs to be answered; and an alien invasion threatens to eradicate the entire human race; but Cindy and her gal-pal Brenda(Regina Hall)may have something to say about that. My two favorite scenes involve invading giant ""Tr-iPods"" and a comedic Dr. Phil McGraw.Almost non-stop crude and sexual humor; some comic violence and strong language earn a PG-13 rating. Others featured: Leslie Nielsen, Molly Shannon, Carmen Electra, Chris Elliott, Anthony Anderson and Shaquille O'Neal. Sick, but still worth a laugh.",Scary Movie 4

11,poolandrews,I thought it was really funny actually.,7,20 January 2009,"Scary Movie 4 starts as Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) gets a job as a live-in health-carer to an old woman named Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman) in a Japanese styled house. Once moved in Cindy begins seeing ghosts, meanwhile bachelor Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) moves in next door. While talking one day alien invaders attack the Earth & start killing millions of people with laser beams, one of the ghosts in Cindy's house knows how to defeat the aliens & Cindy sets out on a quest to find out the truth & discover a way to stop the alien invasion...Directed by David Zucker, the man behind Airplane! (1980), Police Squad & Naked Gun films, I have to say that I found Scary Movie 4 rather funny in a childish juvenile sort of way & there's absolutely nothing wrong with that at all. Zucker & his team took over the Scary Movie franchise from the Wayan brothers for Scary Movie 3 (2003) & turned in a decent effort although I think Scary Movie 4 is even better. As usual the laughs, jokes & gags in Scary Movie 4 are a mixture of parody & crude humour. From fart gags (a pretty young blind woman enters a building full of people & goes to the toilet over a box & makes all sorts of fart noises) to gay bashing (a really funny send-up of Brokeback Mountain (2005)) to sex (Charlie Sheen eats a load of Viagra by mistake instead of aspirin & gets a traffic cone sized erection) to poking fun at President Bush (Leslie Nielsen paying more attention to a duck in a child's story than the attacking aliens) to downright silliness (a funny yet daft scene in which a guy trying to persuade Cindy to take a job has to try & cover-up some haunted house issues!) which isn't a bad thing. The most obvious thing to say about Scary Movie 4 is that whether you like it will depend on how funny you find it so if your not a fan of childish playground humour, crudeness & spoof's then I would advise to give this a miss. If however you do have a sense of humour & don't mid the politically incorrect & sometimes coarse & rude gags (there's nothing wrong with that & don't let people use it as a stick to beat you with) then you could do a lot worse than Scary Movie 4, I must admit I laughed a lot during it & it's not often I say that. Of course what makes one person laugh is not necessarily the same as another but if you liked the previous Scary Movies & know what your letting yourself in for then give it a go as it's one of the best of the franchise.Beside making me laugh a lot Scary Movie 4 is really well made with surprisingly good special effects (sometimes better than in the actual films it's sending-up), the alien invasion looks good as do some of the creepy Japanese horror inspired ghosts. There are plenty of parodies here from Saw (2004) to The Village (2004), The Amityville Horror (2005), War of the Worlds (2005), Dark Water (2005) & The Grudge (2004) are some that come to mind as well as a spoof of the infamous Tom Cruise interview on Oprah. At not much over 80 odd minutes at least it's short & the gags come thick & fast. Despite featuring on the advertising & promotional material for the film King Kong does not appear.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $50,000,000 which I find very hard to believe, I mean that's mega budget territory & bigger than most of the films it spoof's & sends-up. The production values are great & some of the sets look even better than the films they are being copied & ripped-off from! The cast do alright, Anna Farris is still a hot looking lady while Bill Pullman, Leslie Nielsen, Michael Madsen, Carmen Electra, Shaquille O'Neal, Dr. Phil, Charlie Sheen & James Earl Jones in a neat Final Destination (2000) gag.Scary Movie 4 is exactly what you think it is, lots of crude sexual & bodily function humour pinned together by various parodies & send-ups of recent films. It's all good fun & I thought it was funny anyway, so shoot me. Not as good or funny as Scary Movie 2 (2001) but worth watching while Scary Movie 5 (2011) is currently in production.",Scary Movie 4
12,dbborroughs,Funnier than usual send up of recent horror films,4,19 April 2006,"One of the funnier entries in the Scary Movie series has dead on spoofs of War of the Worlds, Japanese Horror films, the Village and other recent horror and non horror films. Amazingly most of the jokes work, something that couldn't be said about the first three films.The problem here is that each joke seems to have too long a set up. Clearly the fact that the movie has a plot gets in the way as the movie has to build to each joke. Its not bad but I don't think that I should have to pay ten bucks for a movie thats half jokes and half set up. Still if you like these things what I say isn't going to change your mind.AT some point someone should just cut all of the jokes from all of the movie together and then we'd have something worth paying for.",Scary Movie 4
13,lastliberal,There goes that duck again.,5,28 July 2007,"I have to admit that parts of this were really funny.There is no one I can imagine that would be a better example of Bush than Leslie Nielsen.The Tom Cruise parody was so apt.The Brokeback Mountain skit was funny.Anna Faris and Regina Hall were definitely funny.Except for a couple of times when they just stretched the joke too far, it was a funny parody.They could have left out the Carmen Electra scatological bit, also.Michael Madsen and Charlie Sheen also made it a worthwhile venture.",Scary Movie 4
14,Boba_Fett1138,A weak spoof.,4,3 November 2009,"I have to admit that I enjoyed watching all of the other previous Scary Movies, even though they were all being mostly very lame movies to watch. This movie is however not as good to enjoy, mainly because the comedy of the movie just wasn't very funny.I didn't laughed much during this movie, though that of course is always a much needed fundamental aspect for a comedy. The movie isn't very funny as a spoof to watch, also because the movies that it's spoofing in this one weren't very good movies themselves in the first place. The comedy was just bad and it didn't got handled and build up very well at all. Strange that this movie comedy-wise is so much different from the other David Zucker directed entry ""Scary Movie 3"". It was like he was having a complete off day with this movie, for the entire production time they were shooting.The movie feels like it got made on the automatic pilot, without using much creativity. It picks the simple way of comedy spoofing by spoofing the obvious, without ever surprising the audience with a good clever, or even thought out well enough joke. Because of this the story and movie itself also often come across as a very messy one. It's just spoofing to spoof, not to ever be creative or fun enough of its own.It also seems that they are going the wrong way with the series by putting in so many cameos from well known people. The first movies didn't do this at all but ever since David Zucker's involvement more and more well known actors show up to make an appearance in this movie. In the beginning with Shaquille O'Neal and Phil McGraw it's all still fun but it just gets annoying after a while when another well known face shows up to make a not so impressive appearance. There are just in it for the cameo, not really for playing a fun or significant role in the movie.The series is definitely declining with this fourth entry.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scary Movie 4

17,anaconda-40658,Leslie Nielsen for President!,5,3 June 2015,"Scary Movie 4 (2006): Dir: David Zucker / Cast: Anna Faris, Craig Bierko, Leslie Nielsen, Regina Hall, Carmen Electra: Scary Movie remains the best of this parody franchise while Scary Movie 2 is at the opposite end of the quality scale. This newer film is somewhere in between but contains many funny moments nonetheless. Hilarious premise regards Anna Faris employed to care for an elderly woman only to be spooked by a ghost. Meanwhile Craig Bierko arrives home to see his two children only to be interrupted by an alien invasion. Structure is just a series of mismatch scenes spoofing films such as The Grudge, War of the Worlds, Saw 1 and 2 among others. Faris is still funny as Cindy Campbell who is haunted by images in a house after her brother-in-law is killed in an amusing opening. Bierko steals his scenes as a mockery of Tom Cruise. His children see him as a reject but he risks facing the Tripods to save them. It concludes with a welcome jab on the Oprah show where Bierko really takes the Cruise act into hilarious exaggeration. Regina Hall returns as Faris's best friend but considering her death in an earlier film, this makes absolutely no sense. Leslie Nielsen gives a hilarious nude scene as the United States President who attempts to counter the pods. Carmen Electra also makes an appearance in a King Kong sequence where she is puked upon. Pointless and vulgar spectacle. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Scary Movie 4
18,Aaron1375,About what I expected.,7,20 April 2006,"It was rather funny, as to be expected the jokes were hit and miss with there being more hits than misses for me. I thought once again it could have been funnier and there were some unnecessary jokes, but all in all it was a rather funny flick. This one actually plays like a sequel as characters from the previous flick are explained why they aren't here rather than just being ignored all together. For this one the required viewing or basic knowledge of a movie that you need for this one is mainly ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"", ""The Village"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and for me the best one ""War of the Worlds"" (a movie that needed some fun poked at it). There is also something in there making a bit of fun of a movie pretty much you don't need to have seen are know all that much about...you will get it as long as you watch a bit of television. The ""War of the Worlds"" to me seems to be the main film parodied, however the other films get their fair share of the jokes as well. The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a ""Saw"" recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast. Worth a look see, however, if you did not care for ""Scary Movie 3"" I would say you probably won't like this one.",Scary Movie 4
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scary Movie 4,4,22 June 2006,"I'm a fan of campy grossed out politically incorrect comedies, so films like Top Secret!, Airplane, Hot Shots and Naked Gun, are right up my alley. For some strange reason, I never did watch any of the past Scary Movies, save for the bits shown in various trailers. And I'm sad to say that Scary Movie 4, is unfortunately, not very funny.Sure, it contained the usual barrage of explicit toilet humour, sexual innuendos in the dialogue, and plenty of sight gags involving genitalia, but I guess too much of something will make you sick of it. And that's what happened with SM4.The main leads of Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) and Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) find love despite having to separate because of the Tri-pod alien invasion. Each took a different path - Tom in keeping his family alive during the carnage, while Cindy has to undertake a mission to discover the truth behind the invasion, after being tipped off by a faux-speaking Japanese ghostly kid who can't walk backwards down a staircase.Doesn't make much sense, does it? It doesn't matter actually, with comedies of this genre.But you got to admire the scriptwriters for almost seamlessly including the many references and scenes from so many thrillers and horror movies, and weave them all into one complete narrative, never mind if it doesn't make much sense at the end of the day. It's not easy collating the recognizable scenes, and piecing them together. The main bulk of references would have to come from Spielberg's War of the Worlds, Ju-On, Saw and The Village, just to name a few. Real life personalities were also not spared being buffooned, like Tom Cruise, Michael Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal and even George W Bush (played by Zucker regular Leslie Nielsen).Maybe the franchise is running out of steam, or the references the movie pulled from were not very interesting as spoofing material to begin with. I wouldn't recommend this weak comedy, even though a Scary Movie 5 has been announced. Yikes.",Scary Movie 4
20,siderite,Bad even on the Scary Movie scale,7,26 April 2006,"And I thought the Wayans were humourless... Just let a bunch of money dealing movie managers write a movie and watch it burn. I thought Scary Movie was a silly movie, but at least you had fun watching it. Part 4 is the last nail in the coffin, though, as well as the coffin, the dirt, the ash and the grave digger. It's a horrible movie, no humour, lots of known actors in idiotically small parts, in short, it is a movie that should never have been released. Yuck!I wonder who makes the genre classifications of the movies on IMDb. This is definitely not horror and I think this movie should prompt a diversification of the comedy genre into light comedy, hard comedy and no comedy.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,Zucker looses his originality,6,18 April 2006,"Now on Scary Movie 3, may I say I was very pleased to see that over all, most enjoyed the third installment, but when I talked to people about the movie most say they hated it and preferred the original Scary movie. So, I think that Zucker tried to channel some of the Wayne's brother's humor and it ended up backfiring. While there are some great and hilarious moments, from the Tom Cruise appearance on Opera to the Million Dollar Baby boxing scene, and just more than a few laughable lines, there were some things though, that just didn't work for me.Potty humor, come on, are we in the 5th grade? It was OK when I was in high school and beyond that, it was OK, but let's be honest, it's over done and let's just say it, done! Also, the very amusing joke of bumping into something or running into something is funny, but when it's done over and over again in the same scene and the third movie, it looses it's originality. While I'd recommend this movie for a few laughs, this was not my favorite Scary Movie.6/10",Scary Movie 4

Meanwhile, aliens invade the Earth and threatens to destroy mankind.Spoofing a host of movies like Saw, War of the Worlds, Million Dollar Bay and The Grudge, this movie has a lot of gags, but I just didn't find them funny. The acting was pretty lame, especially Craig Bierko's melodramatic, overzealous and annoying character. It seemed the movie tried to get by in being funny with overly used crude and sexual humor. The only bright side of the film was the appearances of Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil in the ""Saw"" spoof. Other than that, the rest of them movie was below average; the story didn't flow like Scary Movie 3, just meshed in pieces.Grade D-",Scary Movie 4

I have enjoyed all the Scary Movies; they are what they are, and if you just don't like silly, offensive, juvenile humor at least a little bit you aren't going to like any of them. But they are always a fun bag of pop culture humor and cruel pratfalls.As with all the films in the series, the humor is hit and miss. Some things I found very funny, like the running gag of terrible parenting, and some I could have done without, like the final Tom Cruise parody (which, unlike most of the humor, will make no sense to anyone not familiar with the original interview). Overall I felt that, while the lows weren't any lower than usual, the highs weren't quite as high. It is often laugh out funny, but it's rarely hysterically funny.

26,Robert_duder,Check your brain at the door....of course...and you'll be fine,6,4 May 2006,"As a self proclaimed hater of spoof films (sorry everyone) I did go to see Scary Movie 4. Maybe I am building a tolerance to the stupidity, and overblown jokes, and stupidity...did I say that?? Scary Movie 4 wasn't so bad...in fact I might even say it was the same as the first three...no better, no worse and I think that is an achievement for the fourth installment in a series that hasn't changed it's star or it's jokes at all. You can't...absolutely CAN'T go into it expecting true witty comedy...Scary Movie isn't pretentious, it never tries to do that, Scary Movie 4 is exactly what it has always been, forced references to big movies, stupid physical gags using poorly made dummies, and the dumbest jokes you could possibly think of...AND a good thing...wrought full of cameos.The star of the film is still Anna Faris as the slightly lacking intelligence Cindy Campbell. Faris feigns naivety like no other comedic actress could. She's beautiful and funny...a rare combination...and despite the stupidity she slips into it flawlessly which gives the film an edge. Craig Bierko takes the lead male role and does okay with it. He fits in with the stupidity which is what the film requires so from that aspect he does well. The role is something different for him so he does deserve mention in that aspect. Anthony Anderson, and Regina Hall both return for smaller roles but fans will appreciate their return. Cameos by Dr. Phil, Chingy, Carmen Electra, Chris Elliott, James Earl Jones, Shaquille O'Neal, Charlie Sheen, Bill Pullman and the king of spoof films, the irrepressible idiot Leslie Nielsen make the film more enjoyable especially the opening scene with Dr. Phil which was genuinely hilarious more so just to see Dr. Phil in that role.Scary Movie 4 is not good...don't get me wrong...but is it really meant to be good?? Kids, teens FLOCK to it because of it's rude, gross out humor, it's over the top ridiculous jokes and they love it so it's destined to make millions upon millions and for what it's worth it wasn't the worst waste of time. Plus the gross out humor was minimal (save for a DISGUSTING scene of Carmen Electra taking a crap??) compared to the other ones so that was good. They will keep making them and as long as they don't get even a fraction worse than this one...it's okay with me. 6/10",Scary Movie 4
27,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,The fourth and final part??? Oh no...,8,18 April 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Those crazy Scary Movie guys and gals are back! This time round the heroine from the first three movies, Cindy (Anna Faris) has moved into a creaky looking old house to care for an elderly lady- unfortunately the house is also possessed by the spirit of a dead boy. And as if that weren't enough the world has just been taken over-by alien tri-pods! And all they have to save the day is dim-witted dock worker Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko.) The promotional poster advertises this as ""the fourth and final part"" of the Scary Movie movies. If that's so then with the horror movie industry booming at an alarming rate, that's very bad news (even though a couple of jokes here aren't horror related) because these movies really are the absolute best.Even though a bit too many of the jokes revolve around crude racial stereo-typing, this still manages to be a cool fourth entry into the series. A lot of the jokes still raise a chuckle, some of the best being the Brokeback Mountain out-take and Bierko's hilarious impersonation of Tom Cruise's ridiculous over-acting in the recent War of the Worlds re-make, not to mention his iffy personal life. But unsurprisingly the best comes from that master of the trade Leslie Nielsen, really showing how it's done hilariously sending up George Bush's dim-witted responses to threats to the country.Cracks are starting to show a little now and I hope this series doesn't go the way that the Police Academy movies (apparantly) did, but for a damn good laugh to escape it all, the Scary Movies are great fun and it's just too bad if this is the last one. ****",Scary Movie 4

Sure, it isn't laugh out loud funny all the time, but it ought to give you a few chuckles and it is interesting enough to sit through. This time War of the Worlds, The Grudge, The Village, and Saw are the major movies that are spoofed throughout. Other movies get their due and are made fun of like Brokeback Mountain and I doubt I could list all of them. The main story centers around out star Cindy, who moves into a house haunted by a Japanese boy. She meets a hot neighbor who is also a bad father. Then the alien tri pods attack and most of the rest of the film is based on War of the Worlds.FINAL VERDICT: Worth a viewing if you want some simple comedy to entertain you for 90 minutes.",Scary Movie 4

My favorite scene was the opening scene with Shaq and Dr. Phil in the Saw spoof. That really brought the tone of the movie. Then it moved into War of the Worlds and I was really happy.The plot in a spoof movie is kind of difficult to explain. The basic premise is a bunch of people trying to stop an alien invasion.It was nice to see Anna Faris and Regina Hall return to their respective roles. Of course, Leslie Nielsen made my day again. He was absolutely hilarious.Overall, this was a very good movie. It wasn't as good as the third one but better than the first two. I rate this movie 9/10.",Scary Movie 4
30,CuriosityKilledShawn,"No better, no worse",5,11 April 2006,"Spoofs are old hat. They are outdated and there's no real point to them anymore. Modern audiences are FAR more cynical than they used to be and can easily pick up on a movie's foibles. We don't need stuff like this to remind us how naff some films can be.The Scary Movie franchise seems to be in the uncomfortable groove of releasing a new instalment every 2 years. Now we're onto the fourth (and final chapter of the trilogy) and the movies that Zucker and co are choosing to lampoon are already confined to the trash-bin of history. Thus rendering the film mostly purposeless.Aside from War of the Worlds, Scary Movie 4 rips to shreds The Village and The Grudge, two horror films that were so downright awful that they don't need a spoof to point out how stupid they were. And generic horror films come and go with such abundance these days that no one really gives a damn about either of these two anymore.Another thing I hate about spoofs (or at least this kind of spoof) is that they always ungracefully grab as many films as they can, mash them together and cook up some moronic plot as a way of stringing a bunch of simple-minded sketches together. When people are given the job/chore of directing a movie they should keep in mind that they are being given the chance to be really creative. And if they churn out something as mass-produced and common as the stuff they're meant to be making fun of then allow me to laugh out loud at the irony.Scary Movie 4 IS funny. But it's half enjoyable, half total, pointless crap. There are some great digs at Tom Cruise (who I am sick of the sight of) and Michael Jackson. But why the hell are they spoofing Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain when they're no even horror films? And why is King Kong on the poster when he's not even in the bloody movie? It's no better and no worse than the other Scary Movies. But it's a low-aiming series that only really appeals to the lowest common denominator. David Zucker has proved himself to be a good comedy director with Baseketball and Rat Race. This is truly beneath him, though that won't stop the masses from lapping it up.",Scary Movie 4

32,callanvass,It is what is. A lot of juvenile jokes that are unfunny with a few scattershot chuckles,4,26 August 2013,"This series had really begun to show its age at this juncture. This wasn't completely unfunny, but it had many rough moments to ultimately make this a failure in my opinion. After Charlie Sheen's amusing scene in the opening, it took a turn for the downward in a big way. Stuff like Brokeback Mountain (Poorly done by Anthony Anderson & Kevin Hart) War of The Worlds (Has its moments, but not nearly enough of them) Saw (I dug Shaq & Dr. Phil cameo's. I admittedly got a kick out of that) Million Dollar Baby (Meh. This was so, so. Simon Rex has a cameo as George. He was in the previous Scary Movie)and The Village also gets spoofed with a funny turn by Bill Pullman. Even Tom Cruise's now classic meltdown on Opera is spoofed (Which was way over the top and not even remotely funny) Anna Farris & Regina Hall show up, but the magic of the duo has worn off a bit. They try their hardest, but it doesn't help that they have to work with such poor material for the most part. Craig Bierko makes for a poor replacement for Simon Rex. This is a lot raunchier than the stuff in Scary Movie III, but it's not as amusing either. Scary Movie III was imperfect as well, but I laughed on quite a few occasions. Here; the laughs were scattershot and didn't happen all that frequently.Final Thoughts: I'm not gonna tell you to avoid it. It does have a few laughs, but most of this movie consists of tired, juvenile jokes, and proved to me that this series is starting to wear very thin on me.4/10",Scary Movie 4

36,Floated2,Lack of laughs,3,3 January 2019,"Within a film Scary Movie 4 is the fourth film in the franchise and the last with Anna Faris and Regina Hall. As a film, this feels more over the top and forced. There are some moments of entertainment, including a intro involving Dr. Phil and Shaquille O'Neal in a Saw spoof.Spoofing World of the Worlds, Saw, the Grudge, the Village along with some other blockbuster, one found this film to be not funny. Far too over the top and forced in comparison to the third film (which flowed more naturally). Also, the leading acting of the character of Tom (a spoof of Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds) just wasn't funny and was a clear downgrade from the leading man in Scary Movie 3 (Simon Rex).Too much slapstick comedy, such as metal objects falling on people or people getting hit in the face with objects (an unfunny running joke involved the daughter of Tom being ignored by Tom and her getting hit and attacked by objects and such). After a while, it just got completely unfunny. Also far more pop culture references and celebrity cameos than the previous films.The Saw scene towards the end involving Cindy, Brenda and a few others was quite well and engaging but nonetheless most of this film was just misses. Though the film wasn't as funny, it was mildly entertaining and the graphics and visuals did look great.",Scary Movie 4
37,filipemanuelneto,The best film in the franchise so far.,7,29 January 2021,"This is the fourth film in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise ... and this time, Cindy is going to get a new job as a health care provider and face an alien invasion. Of course, the film is full of satirical situations and parodies of notable films like ""Grudge"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Village"" and ""Saw"". That is, this film repeats the same formula that we already know. Despite this, it far exceeded my expectations. I felt that the jokes are much better and funnier than those of previous films, including the first one. The sexual load is still present, but it has been reduced and the dialogues are the best so far. Honestly, for me, this was the movie that I liked the most in the franchise, so far.There is no doubt at this point that the best thing that could have happened to the ""Scary Movie"" franchise was the change of director and screenwriter and the arrival of David Zucker. In the first two films, the Wayans clan dominated actors, director and screenwriters. In the third film, Zucker already takes the direction but accepts a script from the Wayans. Here, he had more control over what he wanted to do, assuming direction and script, which was undoubtedly an improvement.The film again features Anna Faris and Regina Hal in their usual characters. This time, I liked their work more. Hall's character, whom the previous films had made into a nymphomaniac, was much better developed here and the two actresses seem to have received better material to work with, obtaining better results from their efforts. I also enjoyed watching Leslie Nielsen, with a series of jokes and situations so anecdotical that it is impossible not to laugh. Honestly, I can understand why Nielsen has collaborated so actively with Zucker in other films: he knows how to get the best out of Nielsen, much to the public's delight. Alonso Boden is very good and Carmen Electra, Michael Madsen and Charlie Sheen do a satisfactory job. The cast, in general, did quite well. The opening sequence, with Phil McGraw and Shaquille O'Neal, is memorable.Technically, the film is quite interesting. There are good special effects and CGI and the sets and costumes also play their part very well. It is a longer film than the others, with about 90 minutes, within the average of a feature film. It has a good pace, it doesn't waste time, the jokes follow one another quickly and don't let the audience stop laughing.",Scary Movie 4

40,dfranzen70,"Sometimes it works, other times it blows..",5,11 January 2007,"Scary Movie 4 is a lot like Scary Movies 1, 2, and 3; there are plenty of parodies of then-current movies, hit-or-miss jokes, and strange cameos. But ultimately, the movie's just not all that funny. It's good for a chuckle here or there, but it falls well short of the first Scary Movie. And that's saying something, because the first two SMs were done by the Wayanses, whereas the second two were done by David Zucker of Airplane! fame. How could someone with Zucker's comedy pedigree turn in such a slapdash movie? The basic plot is that Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who's been in all of the SMs, has just been hired as a caregiver for an elderly Japanese lady, riffing on Sarah Michelle Gellar's The Grudge. Meanwhile, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) is a ne'er-do-well crane operator who lives next door and sometimes has custody of his two kids, riffing on Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. Then alien tripods invade from under the Earth (only they're called TriPods) and kill humans discriminately. But lo! There's a ghost of a boy in the house where Campbell's staying, and he tells her (by spouting Japanese brand names like Seiko and Benihana) that she must find his father, who knows how to defeat the alien menace. And it turns out the father, played by Bill Pullman, lives in a quaint village straight out of precolonial days, complete with a blind woman, two profound idiots, and mysterious They Who Shall Not Be Named creatures, riffing on The Village.Perhaps the best sequence is the first scene, in which Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil (the real guys, not actors) wake up in an old public restroom, a la Saw. It's a well-played scene; both personalities come across as sincere, not stiff, and more than a little deprecating (Phil's helpfulness, Shaq's free-throw-shooting ability). The setting is revisited later on in the movie, too, to good effect.There's even a minispoof of Million Dollar Baby, with Campbell flashing back to her days as a boxer and what happened during her final fight. The scene's actually pretty well done, a good aping of the one in the original, taken to the logical extreme. And another one, of Brokeback Mountain, except with African-American cowboys (Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart), recreating the famed tent scene from that movie.Some positives: Faris is reliably good, and Regina King, as her slutty BFF, is a perfect complement. Pullman turns in his standard good-guy performance, albeit with some profanity (at least in the unrated version). Bierko looks enough like Cruise in WotW to pass as his double; the actor does have a good sense of comic timing. One of the running gags has Tom unknowingly neglecting his young daughter Rachel.Adding his awesome pipes to the charade is James Earl Jones, as Morgan Freeman did in War of the Worlds. Unfortunately, he's not heard often enough. And we get too much of Leslie Nielsen, who plays President Harris. Nielsen's slapstick skills remain fine, but the script wasn't kind to him; rather than being funny, President Harris made you anxious for a different scene. Besides, making fun of My Pet Goat is so 2001.All in all, the movie's kind of disappointing. Unless, of course, your bar is already low. I mean, it's the fourth movie in the series - will it never end - and by now the jokes have to feel a little stale. Pungent, even. The one-liners often fall flat, despite a game cast; you'll be ducking to avoid the scattershot hilarity. Sometimes this approach to comedy works - throw as many jokes as you can against a reel of film and see what oozes the farthest - but here it just seems like a wasted effort. I think the genre-parody genre peaked a while ago.",Scary Movie 4

43,MaxBorg89,"Watchable, though not as good as the previous one",7,13 November 2006,"There was no reason to make Scary Movie a franchise, given the first two installments sucked. The third film, directed by spoof veteran David Zucker, was refreshingly funny, on the other hand. Now Zucker has returned for the fourth part, which isn't as great as number three, but has some enjoyable moments.As usual, the main targets are remakes of Japanese shockers (The Grudge) and M. Night Shyamalan (The Village), with the addition of Saw (a great cameo appearance by Dr. Phil), War of the Worlds and, in the non-horror department, Fahrenheit 9/11 (Leslie Nielsen, returning as the president, is a gas as always). There's also time for some Dawn of the Dead and, like in Scary Movie 3, Michael Jackson. All of that is pretty funny. Sadly, there are other elements that just don't work. The point of these films is to mock horror films, because there are situations that can provide great material for a parody. Then why waste time on some utterly tasteless rip-offs of films such as Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain? That stuff is cringe-worthy, not funny at all. Also, there's a section of the movie which makes fun of Tom Cruise's Katie Holmes-related antics on Oprah Winfrey's couch. That event was already extremely ridiculous by itself. What's there to add to make it more risible? And finally, why leave most of Scary Movie 3's cast out of the sequel? Why condemn Simon Rex and Charlie Sheen (and, in a way, Nielsen) to mere cameos? The new people aren't that charismatic, despite appearances by Michael Madsen and Bill Pullman.Final evaluation: incoherent, but can be seen.

In here, the ideas are a little bit less unique but the jokes are still over the top, especially as Leslie Nielsen plays once again the role of a very dumb and funny president of the United States of America and he alone is worth watching this flick as he adds once again something mature and unique to the series. Especially the jokes about Brokeback Mountain, Million Dollar Baby and Saw are still hilarious.Even though those series were finally rather childish with a very bad first part, an acceptable and entertaining second and fourth part and a really good third part, I would like to see a true fifth part in the future as there have been many movies in the past years that should be parodied by this sympathetic crew.",Scary Movie 4

Shaq wakes up lost in a room with Dr. phil and has to make a basket or he and Phil will die of toxic gas. This was by far the weakest opening of the films. The plot starts off like the Grudge where Tom Logan (Sheen) is contemplating suicide, except Cindy comes to visit him, he takes viagra and dies. Now to the actual plot, Cindy gets a job as a full time nanny for an old woman (Leachman) and is neighbors with lonely single father Tom Ryan (Bierko), but Cindy can't get over the death of her husband George who dies in a hilarious flashback. Plot moves on, the Grudge boy talks to Cindy in ""Japanese"". Tom and his kids are attacked by the Tripods ala War of the Worlds. Cindy finds Brenda who is now a reporter and they go to the Village to find the Grudge boy's father (Pullman). I won't go on with the long and complicated plot but it delivers well for the most part. Leslie Nielson is back as the president pretty much to reflect fairly recent events, and is absolutely hilarious when he tells racist jokes at the UN. Mahalik and CJ (Anderson and Hart) return to do a Brokeback Mountain parody. Madsen plays the Tim Robbin's character from War of the Worlds and is really funny for his brief appearance. So, I do recommend to fans of the genre, but it needs some fine tuning!3 out of 5 stars. 74 mins. PG-13 for Comedic gore, fart and sex jokes, butt nudity, and language.",Scary Movie 4
47,Sandcooler,Kinda funny I guess,5,18 January 2009,"First of all, what's up with all the rap references? It really made me lose the little concentration I needed to follow this movie, why is every third joke about rap? And you'd think a Hollywood production in need of a cameo could do better than that guy who used to have that song. Either way, this is a lot more unbalanced than the previous entries because there is no real plot, but some of the jokes still work. Others fall flat on their face, but that's something you just have to accept in a spoof nowadays. We open with something about ""Saw"" that features Dr.Phil, then Cindy goes to live in a house much like in ""The Grudge"", aliens take over the world, and then suddenly there's a sequence from ""The Village"", and then ""Saw"" again. I think that's one of the bigger mistakes. There's no plot to be distracted by, so all it has are jokes, which never take you by surprise. You just wait for the joke, then wait for the next one, really not caring how any of this will end. Also, this movie is pretty damn short. Felt like I had been watching nothing at all. Still some good material, and still one of the best semi-recent spoofs, though that says more about the other spoofs.",Scary Movie 4
48,Matt_Layden,"""Where Are The Laughs?""",3,17 August 2006,"This is the fourth installment in the Scary Movie franchise, this time we see Cindy in the middle of an extermination. With the world coming to an end, Cindy must find the father of a little boy who was killed in the house she works at in order to stop everything.Ever since David Zucker took over the franchise it seems to have gotten less gross out funny and, well, less funny in general. In this installment, the series has gone further then to parody horror films. This time we get to see a half baked Brokeback Mountain joke and Million Dollar Baby. Whoever thought that these jokes were funny doesn't have one funny bone in their entire body.We get the same old same old from Anna Faris and Regina Hall, who I still think serves no purpose. Anthony Anderson and Leslie Nielsen return from the third film in the same roles and newcomer Craig Bierko plays a parody of Tom Cruise.I can say that I did not laugh out loud once during the entire film, which goes by pretty fast. I did chuckle once at the beginning with Dr. Phil cutting off the wrong foot. Other then that there is nothing else that is worth a chuckle. I'm not going to go into the whole plot of the film, as it is indeed a parody, so it doesn't really matter. I'm also sitting here and asking myself why did they show a scene with Madsen hitting a guy and assuming his identity, then donig nothing with it. I was waiting for him to do something, but nothing came of it, why put that in? It confuses and makes no sense.Seeing Carmen Electra in the film take a dump is horrifying, not ""hot"" or ""funny"". At no point should people laugh at the film. It is an insult to your intelligence. Skip this film all together and hopefully they are finished with all the scary movie films.",Scary Movie 4

50,winner55,Time for new blood,6,23 December 2007,"I'd have to say - with much regret - that with this film the Zucker-Abrahams team, which brought us several of the funniest comedies of the end of the 20th century, have pretty much exhausted their talents in this film.Indication 1: The dialog repeats gags from previous more successful efforts by this team, especially ""Naked Gun"".Indication 2: Many of the actors, especially leading man Craig Bierko, are actually 'playing comic'. The Zuckers have long insisted that they directed actors to play the dialog straight and let the lines get the laughs - how could they have forgotten that here? Bierko mugs something awful! He's totally miscast.Indication 3: Their film-making is now almost pure parody - that means the comedy can no longer stand on its own; if you haven't seen the movies being parodied, you can't get a lot of the humor here. (And even if you have, much of the humor doesn't quite make it.) Indication 4: Greater emphasis on body function humor: in previous films, this team demonstrated an ability to do gags about flatulence etc. with a remarkable innocence - this kept such gags from becoming gross in the 'naughty adolescent' manner of many weaker comedies of the time, like the Porky's movies. But here, they're just, well - gross.One good thing about the movie - Anna Faris - she's delightful, and should really have just been given the movie whole, the way the ""Police Squad"" TV series was given over to Leslie Nielson.Also, there's good funny bits scattered here and there throughout the film - just not enough.hey, Z & A! - get the magic back, or just accept retirement, and let younger talents shine - perhaps the 21st just isn't your century.",Scary Movie 4

When Dr. Phil sawed the wrong foot off at the beginning! Along with a few laughs here & there it was a pretty good film! Not to mention the ending of Saw when the puppet's fighting each other & Brenda giving birth to Billy the Saw puppet!The final scene when Tom goes mental & starts laughing & jumping around screaming & shouting, bawling at the top of his voice! Eating the couch & going off his nut! Which was bloody funny!! Overall, a great addition which I thought was the best! Can't wait for Scary Movie 5 on Friday! 10/10",Scary Movie 4
52,moviewizguy,It Keeps Getting Better and Better,6,19 August 2006,"This film is about Cindy Campell, who moves to a new house, to take care of an old woman. Her next door neighbor is Tom Ryan. Suddenly, alien tripods are attacking the world, killing people. Cindy finds out the house she's in is haunted. She finds a ghost boy and he tells her that he knows the way to stop the alien invasion. So Cindy must go to uncover the secret to stop the alien invasion.This is the best Scary Movie film, ever. Maybe the reason is because it's spoofing War of the Worlds (2005). It also spoofs The Grudge, Saw and Saw II, and The Village. Some jokes fall flat but there are about one joke each second, meaning that you'll laugh through the whole movie.There is a LOT of physical jokes, in which I laugh at. Other jokes are smart and some are dumb. If you're one of those people who don't like physical comedies, you won't like this film. In fact, everything in Scary Movie 4 is very different than the other films, except most of the jokes.This is the funniest film, of them all. There are great cameos and the acting by Craig Bierko is great. Anna Faris' performance is decent, as well as Regina Hall. Well, that doesn't matter, in a movie like this, does it? The only thing that matters is if you'll laugh or not. No one cares about the story or the acting. This movie achieves with the hundreds of jokes, they give.What's next to say? Oh, the special effects. Well, spoofing War of the Worlds in a $45 million budget, you'd think the special effects for the tripod is horrible, right? Wrong. In fact, it looks as good as the tripods in War of the Worlds. Isn't it amazing? They took part of the budget in War of the Worlds, which was over $100 million, and used all they got, without going over budget. You would be surprised.If you're looking for a film with great acting and story, stay away from this film. If you're looking for a movie with good jokes, watch this film. This is the best film and it's unique. In my opinion, I really think this is so much different than Scary Movie 3. If you're fans of the film, watch it. You'll enjoy it.",Scary Movie 4
53,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scary Movie 4""- A weak comedy that is salvaged by a few good laughs...",5,30 August 2008,"David Zucker returns to direct, as do Anna Faris and Regina Hall return to star in ""Scary Movie 4"", the weakest entry in this parody series. Drawing its main bulk of material from hits such as ""War of the Worlds"", ""Saw"" and ""The Village"", it had the promise of being the best of the series. But because of an extremely rushed storyline (courtesy of scribes Craig Mazin, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft) and humor that is hit-and-miss to the extreme, it can't really reach any new levels for the recent surge of ""referential parody"" films. (At least that's what I call them.) Though it does manage to elevate itself over the sheer garbage that was the pseudo-spiritual-spin-offs ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie."" By now, the formula has been set- reintroduce the main characters (Cindy Campbell and her over-sexed friend Brenda), put them into a situation that parodies a popular movie, play around with it for 10-15 minutes and repeat until the bare-bones 83 minute running length has been met. (This includes the credits, mind you, so there is actually less than 80 minutes of full-fledged ""movie"" to watch.) Pepper in celebrity and musician cameos for cheap ""Hey, look at me!"" chuckles, and it's done.Basically, the plot boils down to this- alien ""Tripods"" (which are semi-parodies of both the Apple Ipod and the ""War of the Worlds"" tripods) have began to systematically attack the planet, and dim-witted Cindy must deal with a ghostly child (in a parody of ""The Grudge"") who may hold the key to stopping the attack, while her new potential squeeze (Craig Bierko in a hilarious performance) must contend with the alien invasion and his rocky relationship with his kids. Along the way, we get a so-so ""Saw"" parody featuring Dr. Phil and Shaq, a lengthy sequence that parodies ""The Village"" (the highlight of which is watching Carmen Electra strip down to sexy lingerie, before, well, a very unfunny flatulence joke), and a number of sequences that feature a returning (and scene-stealing) Leslie Nielsen as the president.What makes this film inferior to the other three is the fact that the film feels like it was written in a rush. A lot of the jokes seemed like last-ditch attempts at humor, and the few truly funny moments are few and far in between.In the end, it comes to is this- ""Scary Movie 4"" isn't good. But it is also not the worst movie ever made. It does have a few genuine laughs and oddly enough features a good moral lesson in the end, which is something you usually don't see in comedies of this style. And with it showing on TV now, you might as well check it out because you will definitely get at least a few chuckles out of it. A 5 out of 10.",Scary Movie 4
54,chrichtonsworld,David Zucker zucks,6,19 April 2006,"First of all, compared to previous Scary Movies this one is really bad. It had some funny moments and yes sometimes hilarious. But the great thing about the first three movies was that they were actually enjoyable. Sometimes I really got bored. I love mayhem, slapstick, English humour and black humour (when done right that is). But this was not even close. Also as a parody this one comes short because most of the time it is not so obvious which movie is being made fun off. OK, I recognized: Saw, The Grudge, The Village, War of the Worlds, Million Dollar Baby, Fahrenheit 9/11,The Ring and Brokeback Mountain. But that is all it was, referencing movies without adding something extra. Say what you want about The Wayans Brothers they did put a lot of their own unique take on comedy in the first two. They did put some heart in their projects. And back then managed to bring more flavour to certain scenes. They definitely made me laugh a lot more than David Zucker has done with this entry. David Zuckers earlier work like the Naked Gun series and Airplane) are genuine masterpieces of comedy. That is why it is really hard to understand that he could not make a better movie out of this one. In my opinion, you should forget about this and the third part and just watch the first two Scary Movies. Because at least they are a lot more fun and entertaining.",Scary Movie 4
55,xredgarnetx,Inf4equent laughs,5,8 March 2008,"What SCARY MOVIE 4 lacks in laughs, it makes up for in eye-pleasing re-creations of the movies it spoofs, in this case the SAW series, THE VILLAGE, WAR OF THE WORLDS and THE GRUDGE. It's all so tired and predictable but it can be fun to watch sets and incidents that you'd swear came from one of the films it spoofs, and yet you know better. Anna Faris is back as the native and accident-prone Cindy, trying to help the little ghost boy from THE GRUDGE figure out who his real father is. Craig Bierko of all people plays her new neighbor, a divorced dad of two who takes a shine to Cindy after hitting her in the face with a baseball, football and one or two other objects. He gets to go through the Tom Cruise paces in WAR OF THE WORLDS, right down to appearing on Oprah to discuss his newfound and crazed love for Cindy. The big guest star is Bill Pullman in the William Hurt role from THE VILLAGE. Molly Shannon is Bierko's ex-wife. Of course, Leslie Nielson is on hand as the befuddled president. Anthony Anderson and Chris Elliott are wasted in small roles. This is David Zucker humor all the way: He throws 20 gags at once against the wall, hoping at least one of them will stick.",Scary Movie 4

What irritates me about this version it that it really resorts to toilet humor instead of satire, one liner puns and physical comedy to make it work. I rented the ""uncensored"" version of the film. Boy, am I a sucker.Scary Movie 4 spoofs movies that are good to spoof. But this movie just drops the spoof ball several times and goes for the toilet. Fart jokes that run on forever, raunchy sex jokes that just doesn't work. Spoofing ""War of the Worlds"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Saw"", 9/11, ""The Ring"", ""The Village""...some take a joke too far to non-funny raunchiness, some not far enough. Charley Sheen's rock problem, Carmen Electra on the toilet forever isn't appealing as humor to me, as with the two boys in the tent readying themselves with jells, etc. Stupid, not funny. I really expected more, this could have been a lot of fun...but many of the jokes I saw in Scary Movie 2 & 3 and I can tell the well has run very, very dry.See this film only if you are a die hard fan of Cindy and her silly perils, love fart jokes and little comedy. At this point, they should just stop with the genre and move onto something else. It's stale.",Scary Movie 4
57,mstomaso,Ever Feel as if You are Living in a Scary Movie with a Bad Script?,4,18 September 2007,"Scary Movie adds a new element to the usual *** Movie formula - reality. A few scenes from the Dubya administration's history are reproduced, and an embarrassing moment from Mr Cruise's midlife crisis are re-lived in addition to the usual spoofs of various horror and sci fi films. The Dubya scenes, nicely done by Leslie Nielson, were the highlights of the film for me. I'm not a fan of brainless comedy, but this non-formula material made the film tolerable for me. SM4 spends a lot of time with The Village, Saw and War of the Worlds - plus a couple of films I only vaguely recognized... blending the plots cleverly but without adding much to the comedic value in the blending technique. Brokeback Mountain is also parodied (though I do not understand why this was considered a scary movie). The film is funny at times, but brow-beats its parody of Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds. Nevertheless, it's a fun little romp and much less grotesque than some of the previous entries in the series. Acting - good for what it is. Directing - good for what it is. Script - OK, but could have been more intellectually challenging (and funnier) Cinematography - good for what it is.

The acting is good enough. There are a few laugh out loud moments but unfortunately most are flat, repetitive and boring.The plot is poor with no depth or emotion and the excitement is limited with vast predictability. Leslie Nielsen (Naked Gun) and Anthony Anderson (Hustle and Flow) are the funniest in their familiar roles.The film is a parody of horror film Saw II.

60,fernandoschiavi,"Scary Movie 4 rescues a little of the old genius of ZAZ and assumes the outcome of one of the most memorable, for better or worse, films of the subgenre parody",5,25 April 2021,"The fourth and most recent chapter in the Everybody in a Panic series hit the big screen again under the baton of David Zucker, who had already headed the third. This new part of the series features Cindy Campbell, who now works as a nurse, needing to care for a lady who lives in a house where strange facts happen. This house she goes to is next to that of Tom Ryan, a divorced man who is taking care of his two children. Cindy and Tom end up taking an interest in each other, and when an alien invasion begins they must flee, in search of salvation. On the way Cindy still meets her old friend Brenda, who now works as a reporter.For a comedy film, the high budget was fully justified by the amount of special effects due to the base film used to unfold the plot. Once again several older cinema hits and released between the third and fourth films in the series are parodied. The basis for this story is the synopsis of Steven Spielberg's successful War of the Worlds, The Cry of Takashi Shimizu and James Wan's Sawin the already traditional opening scene that is a hallmark of the series' movie openings, in addition to the final climax.Written by Craig Mazin, Pat Proft and Jim Abrahams, this fourth film in the franchise focuses primarily on three recent productions: The Mortal Games, War of the Worlds and The Grudge, combining elements of these features in a simple and unfinished patchwork quilt (yet that the art direction is the best in the franchise, managing to reproduce scenarios of the parodied films almost perfectly). In a lazy attempt to maintain the continuity of the ""story"" started in the previous chapters, the script rescues one or the other character and, when it fails to do so, the directors simply bring the same actors living different figures. Anyway, if the characters played by Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Kevin Hart and Regina Hall are the same as previously seen, this is a fluke that makes no difference to filmmakers, writers, producers or the viewer).The prologue embarks on the success of the Saw (2004) and introduces two characters with their legs tied, having to cut them off to escape. As it is a Scary Movie, the character would certainly cut the wrong foot, and so it does. This is just one of the funniest entries in the franchise, and features Shaquille O'Neal acting to cover a scene, which is actually a parody with the player himself, who is constantly remembered for his shooting errors. Metalinguistic, Scary Movie seems to breathe well.Although some kind of humor is dated in the franchise, they still remain decades later, influencing typologies of the genre, and above all eliciting the laughter of those who watch, albeit a laughter from the corner of their mouth - and, as I said again, no look for impeccable cinematography, because, in addition to being unseemly, it is definitely not the proposal of the production. The truth is that Scary Movie catches us for the ridiculous of the ridiculous; for extreme parodization; by jokes; by nonsense; aspects that, pushed to the limit by the franchise, work with the general public, due to an almost instinctive link between the acts of the characters and the viewer.With regard to the narrative arc, we receive a Cindy who has just left the anchor of the newspaper and now works as a caregiver for an elderly woman in New York. We soon discover that the house is haunted, and the first parody appears. The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2004) is the substrate of the plot that unfolds inside the house, and the scenes in which Cindy talks in Japanese with the ghost boy are hilarious. Outside the house, the world is being attacked by aliens, as in War of the Worlds (Steven Spielberg, 2005), and, to escape from all that, Cindy and Brenda, who reappears out of nowhere, go to a place called The Village (M. Night Shyamalan, 2004), where they all get ready in a conservative and familiar village.In Scary Movie 4, Zucker manages to reconcile the types of jokes very well, presenting those old picturesque jokes and clichés - how beings are extremely clumsy and live by accidentally hitting someone - in addition to those jokes that are so rude, they are even offensive the most prudent. Oh, and entitled to everything that is disgusting, organic and despicable (see flatulence, urine and certain other things ...). In this fourth episode, there are those beings beyond stereotyped, who they rightly take the wave with the fact of being assumed stereotypes, and many of the jokes work as much as we seem to have seen it all before.David Zucker´s film and several other references to personalities more connected to American culture, moments that are really funny. Since the first episodes of the series had basically only horror films as the target of comedians, much of this fourth part was expected to have The Grudge, The Village and especially one of the most commented and profitable films in history, The Mortal Games. In addition to these great cinema hits, we see a sensational scene referring to the film Brokeback Mountain and Million Dollar Baby.Unlike other films that sought to place themselves in some genre more popularly on display at the time, this part seeks to encompass genres for all tastes: dramas, suspense, horror, comedies and real life, which does not necessarily mean a complex film, after all comes to the Scary Movie franchise. It is even difficult to quote specific scenes, after all, every moment parodying such films is worthwhile. Be the attack of the Tri-Pods; the beginning with the basketball player Shaquille O'Neal trapped in a bathroom identical to the one in ""Mortal Games""; the eastern agent trying to convince Cindy Campbell to take the job while ""diverting attention"" from the threat of the home; Cindy's boxing match parodying a decisive ""Million Dollar Baby scene; not to mention the appearances of the veteran of the branch Leslie Nielsen, as the stupid president of the USA (does that remind anyone?) ... All these moments are to make you relax or even laugh.Of course, here and there, Scary Movie 4 rescues a little of the old genius of ZAZ: when a character runs to position himself again in front of the camera, who had just ignored it, we realize the artificiality of these dramatic moments in films "" serious ""- and, later, when the hero tells his son that"" there is no time to explain what's going on ""(another common phrase in genres like police and suspense), an extra crosses the screen shouting"" Alien attack ! "", Which, once again, exposes the cliché in its lack of logic. In general, however, this continuation is nothing more than a collage of references that are thought to be intelligent only because they are able to recreate known scenes from other productions, limiting their attempts to make people laugh to the most basic forms of physical humor, with characters who stumble or are hit by various objects throughout history (and, as in the third chapter, there is a child who ends up becoming the preferred victim of the writers, which is still interesting). Oh yes, and I wouldn't even have to say that, since it's something that has become practically a requirement of American comedy, but Scary Movie4 bets heavily on bathroom humor, with gags involving secretions, excretions and gas. The plot sews scenes from all the features cited without any pretense except to hide moments that are already cemented in the mind of the ordinary consumer of Hollywood blockbusters.The cast complies well with what is proposed and does not compromise, with the experienced Bill Pullman, Charlie Sheen, and Michael Madsen on special tips. Shaquille O'Neal playing himself, James Earl Jones as the narrator, the always priceless Leslie Nielsen, and also with Anna Faris and Regina Hall, present in all the first four films in the series. Sheen and Anna Faris share with master Leslie Nielsen a fundamental characteristic for their performances to work: they never offer any indication that they know they are in a comedy, going through absurd incidents with an expression of absolute indifference and seriousness. In addition to them, there is also Craig Bierko, who hits the nail on the head by creating a fun cartoon of Tom Cruise (who, along with George W. Bush and Michael Jackson, is one of the celebrities ""attacked"" by the production). What ended up sounding a little repetitive was the story of the aliens already covered in the previous film in the series, but which in the end ended up giving some meaning to the doll used in the Mortal Games.Absurd from start to finish, perfect for taking someone seriously who just wants to laugh forcibly. If you demand a good plot, or even clever jokes that go well beyond the mark of ridicule, it is better to look for another film or save the money for the ticket. It is interesting that in this film, thought of as the official closing, there is no classic hit-and-run scene at the end, as it happens in the previous ones, which parodies Final Destination (2000). Anyway, all of this gives a definitive conclusion to all the open arches, to all the stories that had been unfolding until then, in the other long ones. Scary Movie closes with the ridicule of Tom Cruise's rough moment on the 2005 Oprah Winfrey program, in which he has an emotional lack of control, and puts an end to excellence in the franchise. Scary Movie 4, under the direction of David Zucker assumes the outcome of one of the most memorable, for better or worse, films of the subgenre parody.",Scary Movie 4
61,gregsrants,Miss and Hit,4,16 April 2006,"Could it be possible to forget how to make people laugh? I had to ask myself this question after seeing the new Scary Movie entry (cleverly titled Scary Movie 4) which was directed by David Zucker.David was part of the creative brains that brought us such belly busters as Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane, Top Secret and Ruthless People. Each of these movies - all made before 1990 - hold a sacred place on my DVD shelf and even 20 years later they can still pick me on days where emotional rescue is desperately required. By the time Zucker with his writing partner Jim Abrahams brought us the character Frank Drebin in the Naked Gun : Files from the Police Squad series, he was already a comic hero in our home whose name was just as revered in the genre as comedy as Mel Brooks and Ivan Reitman.But when the 1990's came a rollin' along, Zucker seemed to lose his connection with his audience. His second Naked Gun entry was inferior to the first and BASEketball and High School High (which he produced only), were embarrassing entries in what was shaping out to be a legacy.Then in 2003, Zucker was given the reins of the popular Scary Movie franchise that was moving into its third incarnation. In theory this would seem perfect behind the camera casting. The first two Scary Movie entries, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, were an attempted throwback to the earlier Zucker type flicks with pop culture references and slapstick humor being thrown at you with Rambo-esquire rapid fire.The results were both good and bad. The bad was the savagely reviewed film that scored a 39% approval rating from critics on rottentomatoes.com. The good however was very good for the Miramax label. The domestic gross was $110 million which was a big jump from the $72 million of the Scary Movie 2 take. Scary Movie 4 and the director of choice were then a foregone greenlight conclusion and one year later, here we are with movies such as Saw, War of the Worlds and The Grudge prime for the spoofing.Scary Movie 4 much like 3 and 2 and well, you get the idea, starts off promising. Dr. Phil and Shaq O'Neal find themselves chained by the ankle in an abandoned washroom a la Saw. In order to save themselves from the poisonous gas which is being piped into the room, Shaq must make a free throw that will release two saws suspended in the room. A few attempts and an emotional outpouring by Dr. Phil later, they have the saws in hand with 30 seconds remaining to cut their foot off and grab the antidote. Dr. Phil however inadvertently cuts off the wrong foot with his scream of acknowledgement, Scary Movie 4 is off to the races.Too bad the movie could not maintain the promise of its opening. Instead, we are subjected to scene after scene of horror movie spoofing with more misfires than bullseyes. Each new scene plays out like a Saturday Night Live skit where one funny bit is surrounded by a set up that takes far too long before getting to the punchline.That's not to say that there aren't moments of hilarity. Charlie Sheen does an admirable job in his short cameo and Conchita Campbell who mocks Dakota Fannings popular daughter-in-peril role of War of the Worlds elicits the odd popcorn choke as she continually gets neglected by her father (Craig Bierko). But maybe the funniest scene comes just before the credits when Bierko channels Tom Cruises couch jumping on the Oprah Winfrey show. Aping the new Mr. Holmes, Bierko has Cruise's mannerisms down to a tee which reminds us of just how funny it was to watch live last summer.There are other comfortable shoes in Scary Movie 4 that come in the form of old reliables such as Leslie Neilson as the President, Anna Faris and Regina Hall who return for the fourth time and Chris Elliot who does his best to try and gross us out in ways that might not even make an eleven year old laugh. But maybe this where the movie goes wrong as well. Some new blood might make things a little more interesting, or at the very least have us smile at people that haven't stretched their 15 screen minutes of fame farther than a Mr. Fantastic doll.But fat chance of that. A big opening is expected for Scary Movie 4 which means that number 5 will probably be in production before the end of the year once they have new summer blockbuster fare to make fun of. In the meantime, you can buy a ticket to watch riffs on Brokeback Mountain and The Village. Or, you can just tune into MADTV on Saturday night where you might see the same movies parodied. Possibly even funnier.www.robertsreviews.com",Scary Movie 4
62,russem31,Funnier than Scary Movie 2,6,15 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4, the direct sequel to Scary Movie 3 (both movies are by director David Zucker and this time around with his longtime film-making friend Jim Abrahams of Naked Gun fame who helped pen this script). This time they spoof such films as The Village, Saw, War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain and also Tom Cruise's Oprah incident. It's really amazing how the filmmakers are able to bring together all these different films into a somewhat coherent screenplay, which borders on funny to average (though there are a few hilarious moments - such as when Cindy is ""cleaning"" Mrs. Norris). Returning are Scary Movie alums Anna Faris as the ever funny Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as the hilarious Brenda Meeks. Also returning from Scary Movie 3 are Leslie Neilsen as President Harris (he's still great at 80 years of age!), Simon Rex as George, and Charlie Sheen as Tom Logan). Also returning from Scary Movie 1 though in a different role is Carmen Elektra! Though the Scary Movie formula is starting to run thin, it's still great to see this type of slapstick comedy out there.",Scary Movie 4
63,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not terrible, but definitely the weakest of the series",5,25 May 2012,"I liked all three of the Scary Movies. This one isn't as bad as some have said, but it's my opinion the weakest of the series. The story's thin and predictable and has some inane Dialogue. The characters are a mixed bag. Anna Faris did great as ever with her comic timing and Anthony Anderson did a decent job here, but the rest of the characters just fell flat. Some of the spoofs, including the Brokeback Snake Mountain, were forced and lack some wit, but the only spoofs that I liked the most were the Village, Saw, and War of the Worlds parodies and I've found them to be very clever despite it's rushed pacing. The music, although generic, is OK, but nothing special. At least it has some nice cinematography and some perfect visuals.Overall, not terrible, but still the weakest of the series. There's a fifth Scary Movie coming next year and I hope it will improve next time.",Scary Movie 4

It's really scary, I mean, when you think they just can't spoof a movie more than they are doing, in the next scene they just do it worse(or better if you want to laugh!). Scary Movie 4 is just that, one more excellent movie to terrify the horror moviesIt's really ""terrible""! Scary Movie 4 is in the same style of the previous titles of the series. Now the main victims are ""War of the Worlds"", ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"", and ""The Village"", but there's also some space to turn ridiculous some TV shows like ""Oprah"" or even the president of the United States! Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is extremely evil, as she is always, in all scary movies, but now she's terrifying an old catatonic lady, poor lady! The sinister mask which symbolizes ""Saw"" is after all a sympathetic old man, and he has a twin brother! But there's more: the Japanese kid, the ghost of ""The Grudge"", was his son! Yes, that's true! Fantastic, isn't it?! If you want to find out some more bombastic disclosures you must see this movie!

66,oneloveall,Still more of the same,4,16 August 2006,"Staying right with the third installation's method of haphazardly taping together some goofy, inconsequential plot out of a few recent horror flicks (this time Saw, Grudge, and Village get the honors) to produce yet another stagnant parody that produces yet another few hilarious moments. The funniest moments come from unexpected twists..when a certain movie is hilariously and unexpectedly ridiculed or when the current antics of one certain galaxy translating, love crazed megastar are exploited, but as usual these end up being the exception to the stale, repetitive humor. Unfortunately, those with a thirst for the underperformed slapstick genre have little else to do but sift through the few gems found here in the meantime that these types of comedies simply do not get made with the same respect that they used to be.",Scary Movie 4
67,DarthVoorhees,Makes Scary Movie 3 look like Citizen Kane,1,21 April 2006,"The funniest parts were in the trailer and even these scenes weren't that funny. 50% of the movie is sexual jokes and the other 50 is people getting hit by heavy metal objects.The movies that are made fun of are War of the Worlds,Saw, and The Grudge but the movie has no real plot. In my opinion the movie should have primarily been a Saw parody.The character of Tom Ryan had potential but he is shown as a dumb ass when he should have been a direct parody of Cruise.Yes there are moments of potential but they are too few and far between. David Zucker is not trying at all anymore,perhaps because his prime audience is now ten year olds who snicker at the word penis. The other films in the series took time to set up jokes and obscure jokes were passed out. Killing off Charlie Sheen was a bad move because he was the funniest character in 3.4 has the most celebrity cameos but they don't take advantage of the talent. The talented Anna Faris needs to realize she is more than Cindy Campbell and she can move on to bigger and better things. Leslie Nielson the master of the spoof genre is not used at all. Sadly I think the days of the spoof film are numbered. Sad really because the genre has brought laughs when other comedies failed. Airplane was a great film because it had a brain behind the silliness. Writers are using the spoof genre to churn out brainless garbage to earn a few million...",Scary Movie 4
68,bopdog,"Silly, goofy, and raunchy. It's good! If that doesn't suit you, see something else, and stop whining about it...",7,29 April 2006,"I am rather shocked to read so many respondents criticizing this movie. What did those people think they were going to see? Syriana? Get real, people! This is Scary Movie 4. It doesn't take a master's degree in literary criticism to figure out that this is likely to be similar to Scary Movies 1, 2, and 3. Duh.There were a few belly laughs in this outing. And lots of chuckles. And, typically, a few dull spots. But overall, the movie flowed along and entertained me throughout. If the audience reaction at my cinema in Cardiff, Wales, is any indication, they seemed to enjoy it as well--- folks were laughing all through it.Probably the biggest appeal of the Scary Movies is the star, Anna Farris. She isn't a sexy bombshell in the obviously sort of way. And that sort of PR-tuned fake-boobs phoniness can be a turn-off anyway. Rather, she is immensely appealing. She's very attractive, and very bright, charming, and somehow accessible and friendly. The cameos by a number of Hollywood heavyweights added to the solidity of the humor.Don't be afraid to attend this movie. The folks who pooh-pooh it have a right to their opinions, of course--- but I suspect those aren't really 'fun' type people to begin with. And, darkly, I suspect that a proportion of them may not even be 'real' audience members, but rather ringers and phonies hired by rival studios' PR firms to cast doubts about this production. I liked it! And if you like silly, raunchy, and goofy slapstick, you will too.",Scary Movie 4
69,DonFishies,"Has a few hilarious moments, but feels terribly stale in comparison to the other films in the franchise",4,29 May 2007,"Despite the heavy amount of controversy surrounding its content, I went and saw the first Scary Movie in theatres and enjoyed it thoroughly. I saw the second and third films, and while they never lived up to the original, they were still funny in their own way. But with the fourth film, I was never really hyped up or anywhere near as excited to see it as I was the originals. And after finally having the opportunity to watch it, it seems like this was for good reason.After an amusing Saw parody featuring Shaq and Dr. Phil McGraw (which was slapped all over the trailers for the film sadly), the film opens at an undetermined time after the third. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is now an elderly home care provider, and has been given a client who lives next to Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko). He is a lousy father and has been given care of the kids for the weekend. But when an alien attack begins, both are thrust into situations trying to stop the impending destruction.The Scary Movie franchise really should have began and ended with the first film. This film reeks of staleness from the moment it begins, and never stops feeling weak for the entirety of the film. It just does not have the pop or the zest that the first film had. It feels more like a rehash, hoping that it could cash in on the success of previous endeavours. Did this hilarious first film really need to go all the way down to part four, just so the producers could turn a quick few dollars? In the process of being stale, the film also shows its age in what movies it parodies. War of the Worlds was less than a year old when this movie came out. Was there really that much not left in the film world to centre around? Did they just run out of ideas that the most recent of bad horror films really just begged to be plunged and made fun of even worse than they already were (or am I the only one who found The Village hilariously bad?)? And are there no horror movies left after these small few that the filmmakers felt the need to sample critically acclaimed films like Brokeback Mountain and Million Dollar Baby to put next in line on the chopping block? It begs of why they even bothered titling the movie as part of the Scary Movie franchise in the first place. By making almost every joke centre around movies and references from less than three years previous, it completely ruins any hope for the movie to last longer than the next few years. I can only assume lasting appeal was the last thing on anyone's mind when they were writing and filming this.Another staleness, which quickly becomes bitter, is the humour in the film. It seems that for trading in the R-rating (and even with the DVD being Unrated), the best joke that they could come up with is someone getting their head smacked a few times. And then the next person, and then the next. These head smackings just keep coming, and only disappear when they finally decide to parody something (I assume this was the fair trade off for all of the penis and semen-related jokes from the first two films). And while some of the parodies are downright hilarious, some just are good for a few chuckles, and nothing more. Some fall totally flat, and just do nothing for the movie. They just make it even more unpleasant, and in some cases, make the film rather monotonous. Watching the likes of Charlie Sheen try to commit suicide for five minutes, or Carmen Elecktra, in all of her lingerie-wearing beauty, going to the bathroom, becomes tediously boring and useless after less than a few seconds.But that is not all. The jokes that do hit, few and far between, just vanish abruptly. More than a handful are set up, and never followed through (like why they needed to bring Michael Madsen into this movie for anything other than some cult credibility). If the movie proves anything, it is the fact that studios are willing to greenlight a half-baked script, that becomes even less baked as the movie goes on. The string of random movie parodies were connected in the previous films in the series. Here, they just feel loose, and really do not make all that much sense. Maybe they were hoping for an episodic feel to the movie, where they could screen pieces of it in-between commercials during television broadcasts of the other three movies. At least that would make a great deal of sense as to why the movie feels as shoddy as it does.I will give this movie some credit for at least doing a decent job with the parodying, unlike the recent Date Movie. Here, they attempt to make some jokes out of material mocking the original. Never is there a true moment when they actually just rip an entire scene out of the movie they are parodying, and play it off as one of their own with an added joke. So, for what it is worth, they at least make some solid effort at trying to stay within the parody genre.None of the actors are particularly good in the movie, and they only produce laughs at the faintest of times. Even the great Leslie Nielsen looks like he should have just not bothered with this one, friend of director David Zucker or not.I take back what I said earlier. This movie is about a quarter baked through. It has some pretty decent laughs off and on, and does a much better job than the competition, but it does not help that this fourth go-around only proves why this should have just stayed as one film.4/10.",Scary Movie 4
70,sashank_kini-1,Had its moments but couldn't just live up to my expectations,4,22 August 2007,"After watching Scary Movie 3, I was eager to watch its sequel. I even heard that it was doing good business in America. But after watching it, I was really disappointed. The humor was forced. There were some moments like the old lady's sponging scene and the Chinese man's tussle with the ghost scene, but apart from that , the humor looked extremely forced and repetitive. Banging the head against the wall has become like a logo for the writers and directors but it ain't funny anymore. The Oprah scene was really annoying. The other problem was that this movie parodied too many films. It got lost in doing that and thus it seemed stupid when suddenly, the characters in the movie entered another place with another evil character. Tom Ryan was funny in the beginning. But in the Oprah scene, he really tested my patience ( I mean the character who played him). Anna Faris too was humorous but still has no good acting. I felt that Regina Hall acted really badly in this unlike the previous movie. The old lady, who had no dialogs and the Chinese character were hilarious though. The movie was patchy and dull at numerous places. When they parodied Village, the actor who played a mad character was really annoying. The actor who played the president was very funny. Overall, very few laugh and so, only a 4 out of 10.",Scary Movie 4
71,LoneWolfAndCub,Extremely surprised!,7,14 April 2006,"I went to this movie with very low expectations. After watching the trailers, I thought this looked pretty lame and a real waste of money. Boy was I wrong!! This turned out to be an extremely funny movie, which does an extremely good job at parodying movies such as Saw, Saw II, The Village, The Grudge and War of the Worlds.This movie has a plot, but it is all over the place. It starts off with Dr. Phil and Shaq chained in a bathroom, for anyone thats seen Saw, they cram the bathroom scenes into a 2 minutes. We then go to our hero from the first three, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion. She meets Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) and they bond pretty quickly. A few days later the world is under attack by TrIpods. Cindy and an old friend, Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) go on a quest to try and defeat the aliens.As I said before, I was VERY surprised by this movie. I found myself cracking up at most of the jokes, some of which were very clever take offs. The acting is OK (Leslie Nielson particularly funny as the whack President of America) for this type of movie and we shall be expecting a fifth installment shortly. I would rank this second out of the series, just under the first one.3½/5.",Scary Movie 4
72,Antagonisten,Not as funny as it could have been,4,13 May 2006,"The ""Scary Movie""-franchise didn't really have much originality to begin with and to say that by now it's gotten tired is an understatement. But as quality goes it has at least stabilized. From the mildly funny first movie to the disastrous second, then back up to the not-great standard with the third movie. And this is pretty much just more of what we saw in the third.Basically this movie is spoofs of recent blockbusters, mainly stuff like ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Village"" and the bunch of Japanese horror movies released in recent years. The upside is that David Zucker still has feeling for physical and fast-paced comedy, even though he never reaches the level he achieved with movies like ""Airplane!"". The downside is that the spoofs are not very intelligent (too much is still based on toilet-humor and the likes) and they become rather tedious after a while.That being said there are some funny moments in this movie. What i perhaps liked best was the Tom Cruise-spoof near the end and also the references to ""The Village"". But still so much more could have been done with most of the spoofs. ""The Village"" is probably one of the silliest movies in recent years, there are so many ways to make it pay for that. And here very little of that is used. Perhaps that is the biggest disappointment with this movie, the constant feeling that there is so much more that could have been done. I can enjoy silly comedy for what it is, the problem is that the ""jokes-per-minute""-ratio is not high enough these days. What made movies like ""Airplane!"", ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"" so great was that even though much of what happened was silly, the pace was so high that you never really had time to notice.This movie is a giggle more than a laugh, and a 4/10 is what it deserves for trying.",Scary Movie 4
73,EmperorNortonII,More Dark Crude Laughs,7,4 May 2006,"""Scary Movie 4"" marks the fourth movie in the franchise, and the second in the franchise to be directed by David Zucker. You can tell the difference between Zucker's style and that of the Wayans Brothers, the creators of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. Under the Wayans, the humor was more outrageous, focusing on sexual organs. Zucker's style isn't so sexual, but there are more dumb jokes. The crude sex humor is still there (watch what happens when Charlie Sheen tries to overdose on Viagra). The cast, led by Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell, once again spoofs the recent horror movies and thrillers, such as ""Saw"" and ""War of the Worlds."" This movie is good for some laughs, but it's not the best movie in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise.",Scary Movie 4
74,Laakbaar,"Mildly entertaining slapstick, but mostly stupid and sometimes offensive",6,27 March 2013,"I mildly enjoyed this low-brow comedy, and its mishmash parody of various horror movies (""Saw"", ""The Grunge""), other movies (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Village"" and ""War of the Worlds""), and other aspects of Hollywood culture. In this movie in the series, it's not just about making fun of horror movies. Other kinds of movies were thrown in. Making fun of gays and Tom Cruise was a major theme in this movie. It crossed the line into the offensive zone.I saw this film on the idiot box right after its predecessor. Scary Movie III seemed funnier than IV, but I'm not sure if that was because I saw them back to back, or because of the movies themselves. III seemed more clever and more cutting edge, if you can call it that.This one also seemed more witless and boneheaded. I groaned at times. You'll enjoy this one if you enjoy fart jokes, viagra jokes, boner jokes, gay jokes, boob jokes, ass jokes, black jokes, punch-people-in-the-face jokes, child-abuse jokes, and so on. Perhaps that's what they were going for.It was all rather crude, cliché slapstick, but it was fast paced, irreverent and unpredictable. It merits a 5 because of its unalloyed stupidity, but I'm going to give it a 6 because I sat through it all and had a few chuckles.",Scary Movie 4

"" - Cindy Campbell",4,15 April 2006,"After much anticipation from myself and others, Scary Movie 4 is finally here, and to my utter dismay, it's a disappointment in a lot of ways. The first two Scary Movies were the best because it had the ingenious Wayan's brothers behind it and they truly understood the art of parody and how to make it most shocking, outrageous, hilarious and overall appealing to audiences. Then Zucker and friends, the men behind Airplane!, took over with Scary Movie 3, and to my complete surprise it was on par with Scary Movie 1 & 2. It seemed it would be hard for Scary Movie 4 to blow it, but in many ways it did.The laughs are just too friggin' slapstick this time around. Instead of interesting quips of sexual, political or racial innuendo, it seems to generate most of it's laughs from some bald Asian guy smacking the sh*t out of some little Asian boy ghost or the shamefully unfunny 'I Like Big Butts' dance cells of the human body dance to in parody of 'War of the Worlds'. The film is basically a parody of War of the Worlds, with a bit of 'The Grudge' and 'Saw' parody in there. The story follows Cindy Campell (Farris) who is now looking for work as a reporter and Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) who is supposed to be like Tom Cruise. The film, if you could call it that, also jabs fun at The Village and most notably Brokeback Mountain, the funniest of the film parodies, following Anthony Andersen and Kevin Hart falling in love with each other while ranching, reaching for some ""nuts"", spreading baby oil on each other, singing love songs to each other and sporting ""ass-less"" chaps. My God, I about crapped my pants laughing at that! Besides obvious movie parodies, the ending of the film proves to be the best, sticking it to real-life actor and full-time f*cking assh*le, Tom Cruise, jumping up and down declaring his love for Katie Holmes, I mean, Cindy Campbell, to Oprah played flawlessly by MadTV alumni Debra Wilson.All in all, the laughs are strained if that in 'Scary Movie 4'. It's funny, but not really funny, which is disappointing to say the absolute least seeing how hilarious and original the first three installments of the Scary Movie franchise were. This is the only Scary Movie I don't recommend seeing in theaters. Even though it's far better than that abomination known as 'Date Movie', I'd still wait for video. Grade: C (** 1/2 out of *****.

The main movies which are spoofed are 'War of the Worlds', 'The Village', 'Saw' and 'The Grudge'. Although i feel that the genres of movies are really gearing away from the concept. The advantage about the first and second film is that the spoofs were definitely horror films. 'Saw' is a horror film, but 'The Grudge' is a very low key horror film than 'Scream'. All the stars of the film bring top-notch performances, with some surprising appearances by Michael Madsen and James Earl Jones.

Making fun of at least 5 of the more recent scary movies, there was much to see and hear. War of the Worlds, Saw, the Village, Dawn of the Dead, and a couple of others. All these movies were rolled into many interlocking scenes that took you on a wild ride and kept your attention. There were a few scenes that just didn't need to be done and appealed more to the disgusting side of the viewer, but that's life.

80,supertom-3,Time to end this series!!!,4,15 April 2006,"In what could be the last in the series, Scary Movie 4 is another routine and average chuckle fest. When I say chuckles though, I mean few and far between with many jokes falling flat, and those that work are stretched out to the point of being unfunny and tiresome. For example Zucker stretches out an initially titter worthy toilet joke with Carmen Electra and milks her (suddenly a mental image I didn't intend has popped up!) for all she's worth until the joke becomes annoying. That's also combined with the endless slew of movie references, some more funny than the others, for example wherein the 3rd instalment mocked The Ring, this one mocks the Grudge, and in the end are very similar in mock, being that those films are so similar. Not to mention of course the fact that another alien invasion movie takes the brunt of the ribbing. Essentially this feels much like Scary Movie 3 reheated which itself felt like many other spoofs reheated.That's not to say that this movie won't provide laughs. David Zucker may have dried the well of his comedy genius somewhat, but he still squeezes out a few drops. There are enough laughs that this doesn't become boring, but I can't see this standing up to repeat viewings. The cast do their best mugging their way through the cheap humour. Anna Faris is as adorably cutesy and pretty as ever and has become quite adept in these films, to the point that any further instalment without her won't be worth watching. Anthony Anderson is for one of the few times just plain unfunny (I like Anderson usually but his material here is inane and just not funny), while Charlie Sheen's presence is sorely missed and Craig Bierko never matches Sheen's spoof expertise. Sheen appears in a short and again, mishandled cameo that stretches out a mildly amusing sight gag to levels of boredom. Regina Hall also makes an appearance again, making her and Faris I believe the only ever presents throughout this now mouldy series. Elsewhere spoof legend, Leslie Nielsen is sadly underused, even more saddening due to the fact he is by a long way the funniest part of the film. No one does straight faced, blissfully unaware of his ignorance like Nielsen (except maybe the real president Dubya!). I'd welcome a 4th Naked Gun movie to be honest and give Nielsen the lead role again.All in all this is merely passable entertainment and perhaps final instalment of the series that started out so promising with the Wayan's brothers first film. **",Scary Movie 4
81,christian123,A simple rehash with very few laughs,4,4 October 2006,"Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is trying to get over the loss of her husband George by taking a new job as a live-in caretaker. She soon learns that the house she's staying at is haunted by a vengeful ghost, and the bonus of having hunky Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) living next door is counterbalanced by the fact that all of humanity is about to get wiped out by aliens.If the term ""jumping the shark"" related to movies then Scary Movie 4 would mark the point where this franchise did so. This sequel is just a simple rehash and it offers very little in the way of originality and laughs. This franchise really needs a new writing team or else it will become another Police Academy series except these films actually make money. I enjoyed the first Scary Movie and I was one of the few people that enjoyed the second one. However, the third one was only mediocre and the drop-off in quality continues with this latest installment.I think the main reason why Scary Movie 4 is so lame is because of the script. I find it funny that three people worked on it yet they couldn't come up with anything special. Most of the jokes involved people hitting their head, obvious misunderstandings between characters, lame celebrity spoofs and recreation of popular movie scenes. The direction was also pretty weak and I think David Zucker has gotten kind of lazy. Granted, Airplane and The Naked Gun weren't amazing spoofs but they at least had an engaging charm to them. Scary Movie 4 was the complete opposite and hopefully he will try harder with his next comedy.A few performances did keep this film from being a complete waste of time though. Anna Faris was pretty funny as Cindy. Even with less than stellar material, she still managed to shine through. Regina Hall was also just as good. Anna and Regina keep these films funny and they keep them moving. If they were to leave, then there would be no point in making them. However, there really isn't much of a reason to make them now. Craig Bierko was okay, a little annoying though. Anthony Anderson was also okay though he wasn't in the film for very long. The rest of the performances were all forgettable and they aren't mentioning. In the end, Scary Movie 4 may register as a rental but it's a pretty forgettable comedy and it's not really worth seeing.

Scary Movie 3 was great because it brought a whole new style to the franchise and made it better. Scary Movie 4 just keeps the laughs coming with this spoof of War of the Worlds and The Grudge. There are also two sub plot spoofs with Saw and The Village. The way they connect the 4 movies together is genius, and it makes up a solid plot all its own. Also, this Scary Movie features the best sets and special effects of all the Scary Movies. The sets and props used in this movie are so dead on with the movies they're spoofing, I have to wonder if they used the same sets. The special effects for the tripods was almost as good as War of the Worlds.This movie features the funniest scenes and one liners of all the Scary Movies. I swear there wasn't a moment in the film that I wasn't laughing. If you need a laugh, this is the movie for you. This will most definitely be the best comedy of 2006.

The first Scary Movie, while no great piece of cinema, was a satire on the teen slasher films, mixing in old classic one. By the second one, the Wayans brothers knew to let it go, as the material was already stretched thin. As David Zuckerman picked up the franchise, it has just crumbled to pieces. Scary Movie 4 is a parody of itself. Any satire that was left in Scary Movie 2, has become slap stick humor of brainless comedy. It's like Funniest Home Video Show, with constant jokes of people getting hit in the head; over and over.Scary Movie 4 lacks in a story arc. The situations are one random scene interchanged, with no connection between one another. Not just referencing other films, the writers jump on the George Bush bandwagon and Tom Cruise's couch dance on the Oprah Winfery show.Returning to her signature role, Anna Faris has to be the queen of air-head characters.

Craig Bierko flounders around the screen, with a host of cameos from Dr. Phil, Chingy, Michael Madsen and others.For a franchise that started as a passable satire, Scary Movie 4 has turned it into nothing but a film for early adolescences to say, 'he got hit on the head'.",Scary Movie 4
84,PoisonKeyblade,Hilarious Spoof Film,9,19 August 2007,"It was hilarious! While it isn't as good as the third installment, Scary Movie 4 still managed to pick up steam from the best movie in the series. It was consistently funny most of the time, and highly original in the way it goes about mocking its source material. Saw was so obviously a cantidate that I was surprised it wasn't chosen sooner. The Grudge was also a perfect spoof opportunity, and it's milked for all it's worth, in a good way. It was certainly one of the better spoof films of the last few years, but wasn't as good as Epic Movie or as instantly popular as Date Movie (""worst movie ever!"") or as classy as Hot Fuzz. Still, Scary Movie 4 was a very solid movie for being the fourth installment, and that's saying something. Hitting #4 is usually where all the problems start to come to fruition.",Scary Movie 4

86,Emerenciano,"Please, give up!",2,26 July 2006,"I don't know what is happening to the comedies nowadays, but we have seen lots of ""funny"" films which are actually something like a creepy show, where terrible jokes and tricks are made to people who have have no way to get away from that or have some kind of limitations. I know it was common in the old Greek Theatre, but human beings have surely (have we really?) developed and some kinds of jokes and tricks should have been thrown away from our society.The references to other films, so well done in the first Scary Movie, have become ridiculous, specially in this fourth (and worst) one. I don't know how it began, but the fact is that, except for the first films, all the others movies of this series are terrible (maybe the third can considered reasonably good). Have the producers forgot how to do their jobs? Are the audiences enjoying such horrible comedies? Is cinema really losing its quality? YES, YES, YES!!!!After such bad sequence, maybe it's the time to raise a questions: Isn't that the moment to give up this series? Please, I beg you...stop!",Scary Movie 4
87,Jay_Exiomo,The fourth one's mediocre at best,5,21 June 2006,"Something's wrong when the jokes seem to be wearing out. Something's wrong when the filmmakers think seeing a butt-naked Leslie Nielsen is funny. And something's REALLY wrong when you're a Dallas Mavericks fan and just a few hours after the NBA Finals you see Shaq on the big screen. Oh well.""Scary Movie 4"" brings back director David Zucker (who went behind the camera for the third ""Scary Movie"" after the Wayans brothers left the franchise) and Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell, the perennial clueless protagonist. In what passes as the film's ""plot"" (or otherwise known as the very thin thread that binds a series of spoofs of other movies), Cindy moves in to an apparently haunted house to take care of an old woman. She soon meets Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), a divorced father of two, and soon they find themselves in the middle of an alien invasion and a barrage of hit-or-miss gags parodying various scenes of films ranging from ""Saw,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""The Village""... and yes, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" ""Scary Movie 4"" ain't a lot of fun. Yeah, of course, I'm completely aware of what it is. It's a gross-out comedy that thinks farts are still hilarious if only Carmen Electra does them. And it's not the kind of film you want to submit to your scriptwriting professor unless you're high on heroine.Of course, the most important thing to ask yourself before entering the theater is, ""Is it worth killing a couple of brain cells for the sake of a few hours of crassness and idiocy?"" Yes, of course, it is... as long as those few hours have with them a decent amount of laughs. This movie is littered with jokes, and whether they work is largely hit-or-miss. Those that work sure begets amusement, but a chuckle at the most. It's also to the film's detriment that two of the better scenes - the opening sequence, where Shaq and Dr. Phil find themselves chained in a bathroom and the epilogue that spoofs Tom Cruise's couch-jumping incident - are mainly fillers for a film that may be starting to overstay its welcome.As for the cast, Faris has never seemed more uninspired than here, just going through the motions of the script, still giving that clueless look while perhaps thinking about the paycheck she'd be collecting. As Brenda, Regina Hall has less of her on the screen this time around than in the past installments, but I'm not really sure whether that's a good sign. She delivers but the exposition of her character has become an exhausting routine (Kenny of ""South Park,"" perhaps?). Then there's Bierko, who has the potential to be really funny if only given with better jokes to deliver.""Scary Movie 4"" isn't a complete schlock of a film. It just feels that it could've been funnier. But then, that might not be entirely true because a joke (and the way it's told) may be only repeated so much before it starts to lose its appeal. And that's the case here. But then again, if you dig this kind of comedy and have been a fan of the first three ""Scary Movies,"" you might enjoy this one, if only marginally.",Scary Movie 4
88,lorcan-61881,"Guys,now come on..",6,30 January 2017,"Scary Movie 4 spoofs millions of films like 'The Grudge,War Of The Worlds,Saw,The Village as well as pop singer Michael Jackson'. The film once again follows Cindy who must go threw impossible tasks to save earth with her stupid friend Brenda. Unlike 3,this film was pretty bad. The jokes were actually brutal in this like it was literally just farts and stupid stuff that wasn't even funny. The best parody in this film was probably The Village(2004)which was a very good film and I will give this to Zucker,he did parody that film pretty well now. Anna Faris once again returned as stupid Cindy along with Regina Hall and Carmen Electra also appeared in this but not as Drew she was Holly,you know the girl from The Village who was blind,ya her.

This movie was not funny at all like the other three scary movies! This movie was whack! The Dr. Phil and Shaq scene at the beginning could have put anyone to sleep. Why did they have to poke fun of Michael Jackson in this movie? There were actually two funny scenes in the entire movie. The scene when the lady was talking to the blue boy in Japanese was funny. And the scene with Regina Hall and the other girl kidnapping those two girls and getting beat up by them. I hope Scary Movie 5 is more funny than this one. They need to bring the Wayans brothers back!,Scary Movie 4
90,ScottDMenzel,"""Scary Movie 4"" is a decent sequel but at times tries a little too hard",6,14 April 2006,"In ""Scary Movie 4"", Cindy (Anna Faris) has to discover what happened to a little ghost boy who invades her house in order stop an alien invasion from taking over earth. Spoofs of ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Grudge"", ""Saw"", and ""The Village"" are just some of the big movies spoofed in the 4th sequel to the extremely popular series.The ""Scary Movie"" franchise has been a spoof franchise that I feel is overrated. I hated the original film, the second one had a great opening but after that it sucked, but then the 3rd one arrived and I must admit I did find it to be quite amusing. With the Wayans Brothers no longer working on the franchise, I was impressed with the 3rd one and was looking forward to ""Scary Movie 4"" but sadly ""Scary Movie 3"" is still the best one in the franchise.Now I didn't hate ""Scary Movie 4"" in fact I did get quite a few hard laughs from it however the film was just too over the top at times. The jokes fly at the audience nonstop in some scenes yet in others they are really spread out. The movie doesn't flow together as nicely as say the 3rd one did. The jokes are either too combined, to spread out, or too over the top.So what worked, you may ask? I think out of all the movies spoofed in ""Scary Movie 4"" the best spoofs were ""The Grudge"" scenes as well as some of the ""War of the Worlds"" scenes. The whole conversation that Cindy was having with the ghost boy was a riot. I also liked some of the random little scenes like the Michael Jackson scene which although I know it's overdone I still found the scene very amusing.All the scenes with Leslie Nielsen as President Harris were hilarious to me. I think Nielsen even at the ripe old age of 80 years old still knows what is funny. His scenes were very funny and worked well at least to me. Also the Tom Ryan and Oprah scene at the end was hilarious. I love seeing people mock Tom Cruise because the guy needs to loosen up and take a joke and this scene mocked the hell out of him and I loved every minute of it.So what didn't work you may ask? The whole ""Village"" scenes were way too much. In fact they actually did a fart joke involving Carmen Electra. I am sorry but that joke was just ridiculous. I didn't even find it remotely funny. I know I complain but really does anyone find fart jokes funny still? Also the whole ""Brokeback Mountain"" gay jokes weren't funny at all either. I didn't think any of them worked at all. The ""Saw"" gags were mediocre. I found them kind of funny but since ""Saw"" is probably the best movie out of all the movies spoofed I think they could have made the ""Saw"" jokes funnier Luckily, even though I didn't think everything worked in ""Scary Movie 4"", I still think the film was better than the first two which is good news to me. However, I must say neither part 3 or 4 have topped the opening sequence in the 2nd film which was ""The Exorcist"" spoof.Director David Zucker does an OK job directing but like I said sometimes I feel he thinks one joke is never enough. He tries to cram ""Scary Movie 4"" with joke after joke and sometimes they fall flat. I also think that some jokes are geared towards certain audiences while others are geared towards others. This makes the movie seem unbalanced. You have some creative old school spoof gags in here but then at the same time you have fart jokes and gay jokes that don't work just because the younger audiences will laugh at them. David Zucker has a gift for making spoof movies; I just wish that he would stick to the old school methods instead of making his films overwhelming with jokes for all ages. The man created ""The Naked Gun series"" and ""Airplane"" so he knows what a good spoof is.In the end, ""Scary Movie 4"" is a decent sequel that just tries to hard at times to be funny. Some jokes work and some don't. I think maybe the ""Scary Movie"" franchise needs to come to an end and Zucker and Anna Faris should move on and work together on new projects. I see Zucker is working on a new Superhero spoof movie coming out next year which I feel will be very big if he takes his time on it. The superhero genre in general has been so overwhelming in the last few years that I feel a good spoof movie on superheroes is a great idea. So while ""Scary Movie 4"" wasn't a masterpiece, it still delivered a decent amount of laughs and I think majority of fans of the series will enjoy it. I just don't know how much more they can milk out of this franchise; it seems to be coming to an end. So if you like the franchise, see the 4th because even though it's not as good as the 3rd, it's still a decent attempt at the spoof genre and is a whole hell of a lot funnier than ""Date Movie.""MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Scary Movie 4"" is 6 out of 10. Tries to hard at times to be funny but in the end still delivers some solid laughs.",Scary Movie 4

You get my point don't you, duds like the village, war of the worlds are not horror movie legends like the movies spoofed in the rest.Half the jokes were not really funny because I hadn't seen the village or remembered the scenes from war of the worlds, honestly I realised the movie was in trouble the moment I saw that these were going to be the movies which are going to be spoofed the most.The creative streak and humour that we was seen in the earlier movies was evident here to, some great scenes were..The opening scene on the spoof on saw was brilliant.The greedy estate agent and the first visit to the house.(from grudge) The blind women entering the courtroom. (the village).But these scenes are few and far between and maybe a lot of more creative spoofs were lost to the fact that scenes that were spoofed were far from legendary.The acting of the movie is again good, both the girls returning from the original movies. But acting hardly matters in such movies and even good performances from the actors cant do much for this film.The special effects are very good and sometimes the scenes ended up being scary or attractive only due the great quality of the special effects.Any hope this movie had to recover were shattered towards the end that was highly boring and unimaginative.In all a highly creative BUT FAILED attempt at making a successful 4th movie in the series.Control yourself and stay away from this movie.....or borrow it from someone.+s great acting, special effects, some genuinely humorous scenes +/-s 4th in the series so expected less -s didn't even meet lowered expectations, effort to remember the scenes spoofed, no legendary scene spoofed.total 5/10 (absolute if you count the fact that it didn't meet expectations then its a 4.5)",Scary Movie 4

Not like some nowadays parodies this one at least is funny and original, though it was banal sometimes, but which comedy wasn't?

94,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Scary Movie 4 (2006),5,1 March 2008,"Much better then the spoof movies we are getting today. The original scary movie series is still the king of spoof movies. Blowing away Date movie, Epic movie and Meet the Spartans.This time around spoofing everything from War of the Worlds to Saw. The problem with spoof movies is that we never get the humor of them unless we have seen the movies they are spoofing. So i recommend you head to Wikipedia and see the list of movies that this spoofs and try and see as much of them as you possibly can.Apparantlly Scary movie 5 is coming soon. I don't mind the Scary movie series but it may be time to stop.Each spoof was superb. The detail of the sets and costumes worked greatly in each scene. The set for the Saw spoof was exact and same with the Village and The Grudge. This truly adds to the value.Our favorites are back Cindy and Brenda. This time fighting off tripods and the village and even the grudge.The acting was good. Even though it doesn't need to be in a movie like this.The humor gives me mixed emotions. Sometimes its hilarious and then sometimes it feels like empty jokes that don't even raise a laugh in the room. A bit like Date movie did.I recommend this if you have seen the first 3. It is a perfect movie to watch with some popcorn(or pizza)and a few friends.5/10",Scary Movie 4
95,Torgo_Approves,No brains were harmed during the making of this production.,6,17 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4. Is it an example of good film-making? No. Will future film students study this movie and its revolutionary techniques? No. Could I have written this script in half an hour while stoned? Yes. Can I remember the last time I laughed this hard? No.The key to enjoying a Scary Movie is to see it as a series of sketches based on popular movies, rather than a stand-alone film. The spoofs are extremely obvious and require as little thought to understand as it must have taken to write them. But as far as juvenile humour and crude visual jokes go, David Zucker does it right. You might question Zucker's actual skills as a director, but I dare you to call any of his movies unfunny. Another reviewer mentioned that he missed the Wayans' style of comedy and brought up the scene where a blind Carmen Electra mistakes a church seat for a toilet as one of the funny scenes. Funny how I thought that was the only scene in the entire movie where the comedy fell on its face. The Wayans' relied far too much on lame sexual humour and gross-out jokes and I enjoy slapstick far more than that.Not that Scary Movie 4 doesn't have its fair share of (hilarious) crude jokes. I won't spoil all the fun for you, so I'll just mention my favourite: Charlie Sheen, haunted by his past, tries to commit suicide, unfortunately the sleeping pills he swallowed turn out to be Viagra. That's the level of the humour in this movie, and if you are entertained by violent slapstick, people getting hit by cars, sexual jokes, and brilliant dialogue such as:""I saw this face..."" ""With a nose?"" ""Yes."" ""Hmm. Sounds like a face.""...then this movie is worth buying a ticket for. But if you can't stand lowbrow, dirty, and obvious comedy, you better stay away. Personally I thought 4 was the funniest in the entire series, after #3. If a movie can make me laugh for an hour and 22 minutes, I can't hate it. While Scary Movie 4 definitely isn't a ""good"" movie, it's hard to put down comedy this funny. Craig Bierko does a very good Tom Cruise impression, as well. If you liked the other movies, especially 3, this is a must see.Dirty, juvenile comedy is rarely this funny. Strongly recommended if you're in the mood.(r#16)",Scary Movie 4

It is nothing more or less. If this kind of send up isn't your bag, stay away. But if you have been a fan of the Zucker films or this franchise, then you will get exactly what you paid for and want.Overall, a good second outing for the Zucker trust. They manage to pull in enough name actors in cameos and mine the comedy cave of all the latest horror/thrillers to keep you from checking out your watch. They even manage to throw in a Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain send up (the latter is pretty hilarious given the two persons used).I paid the matinée price for this film and got my money's worth.

97,Punk19,This is funny,6,17 September 2006,"David Zucker directs this very funny movie perfectly. It starts off on a very good note, and it just gets better and better until the entire thing explodes at the end.Scary Movie 4 starts off with Shaquille O'Neal( playing himself) and Dr. Phil McGraw (also playing himself) being chained up in a room. A puppet tells them that they have 102 seconds to save themselves. Shaq sees two saws and takes three free throw shots (excluding the one shot when he throws a sink at Dr. Phil for hurting his feelings.) to get the two saws hanging just above their heads, when he succeeds, they start cutting throw their chains. Soon they discover that they can't, so Dr. Phil suggest cutting through their feet. Well to make a long story short, they don't make it, Dr. Phil saws the wrong foot off.We then shoot to a scene at the piers where Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) is working as a crane operator. He falls asleep and causes a bit of a mess before he goes home to see his ex-wife Marilyn (Molly Shannon) and their two kids Rachael (Conchita Campbell) and Robbie (Beau Mirchoff).Then incomes Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who is now working for an elderly woman named Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman). Cindy quickly finds out that the house is haunted by the ghost of a little boy (Garrett Masuda).After a few hilarious scenes of Cindy getting hit numerous times by baseballs, footballs and being sweet talked by Tom Ryan, TrIpods come into the picture. They begin destroying people, leaving only their clothes, and making a few very funny scenes when Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) think that fleeing people are zombies.President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is also very funny in this. He gets naked in one scene, makes racial jokes and acts like the very typical President Bush, which he is spoofing.To make a long story short; Cindy, Brenda (Regina Hall), Tom Ryan, Rachael and Robbie get sucked up into a TrIpod and are subjected to a game where Cindy has to pop out her eye in order to get a key. She sets them all free and we come to the ending where two puppets named Jigsaw (Laura Dash and Craig Mazin(voice)) and Zoltar (David Mylrea and David Zucker (voice)) come in and announce that the invasion is over.There is a scene at the end where Brenda Meeks has a baby puppet, being fathered by Zoltar and where Tom Ryan is acting very foolish on the Oprah Winfrey (Debra Wilson) show.The spoofs are obvious of War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Million Dollar Baby, Saw, The Village and many many others. I recommend this to all Scary Movie fans, and to everyone that loves a good laugh.",Scary Movie 4

99,samseescinema,I've stopped laughing,1,13 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4 rating: 1 out of 4If a comedian were to crack a thousand jokes and we laughed at four, this comedian would not be considered funny. He would be booed and thrown out of the venue and told sternly and with all seriousness that he ought to choose another profession. Now tell me this: Why hasn't somebody told this to the fellows making these Scary Movie films? The premise is the same as the others, but this time only more stupid: Mimic as many recent horror flicks as possible, then knee, bat, bludgeon, scare, defecate, punch, and maim the characters with as much slapstick absurdity as a four year old male can muster. The problem with this formula is that by the four hundredth time I've seen somebody grimace in unexpected pain, I've stopped laughing. Spoofs can be intelligent. If done right, they can dissect the absurdity of serious films and exploit their solemnity to hilarious effect. Scary Movie 4 doesn't even make a pass at such antics. They'd rather kick ghosts in the testicles. And the film doesn't limit itself to spoofing only horror films; it attacks Million Dollar Baby, Brokeback Mountain, and the Bush Administration (actually, I'll admit to laughing at this segment). It mostly plugs at The Grudge and War of the Worlds, with Anna Faris and Craig Bierko filling in the roles Sarah Michelle Gellar and Tom Cruise played. Their mimicry looks and feels smartwith surprising CGI effects filling in the Tripods and ghostiesbut the final execution is painful. But here's the thing: the theatre was packed and it was roaring. Our little packet of critics sitting near the aisles was the only silent section in the theatre. The man in front of me laughed so violently that his chair rocked painfully into my knees on multiple occasions. So call us jaded, but me and my fellow critics don't seem to be of the demographic Scary Movie 4 is aiming at. Those who are going to see it are, yes, probably going to enjoy themselves. But let me confidently announce that I hated this movie from beginning to end. Hell, even the credits annoyed me. I just hope that the Scary Movie series doesn't become an ongoing fixture at our multiplexes. Isn't four enough?",Scary Movie 4

101,Robert_Hearth,"""But If You Talk About Those Of Whom We Do Not Speak, Have You Not Spoken Of That About Which We Do Not Talk."" --- Female Elder",6,30 September 2006,"""Scary Movie 4"" (2006) Directed By: David Zucker Starring: Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Craig Bierko, Carmen Electra, & Bill Pullman MPAA Rating: ""Unrated"" (for crude and sexual humor throughout, some comic violence and language) When ""Scary Movie"" opened in 2000 and made fun of the some of the biggest horror movies of the time period, people were either blown away by its unforgiving and completely crude humor orutterly disgusted. I was right in between, feeling that the sexual humor often overshadowed the satirical humor. The obligatory sequel premiered a year later and was critically-loathed. Even fans of the original found it to be uninspired and just not that funny. The series was thought to be dead, but, alas, a third entry was madebut this time without the Wayan Brothers and without the ""R"" rating. Audiences, as well as critics, were split over whether or not the third installment would improve upon the series or bury it once and for all. Clearly, it did the second of the two, as yet another movie has been made. The fourth film continued with the style of ""Scary Movie 3"" and continued to eliminate much of the sexual content that was so heavily influential on the first two movies. Personally, I prefer the style of the third and fourth movies and I, therefore, believe that ""Scary Movie 4"" is easily the best in the series. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are back to deliver even more side-splitting laughs and the numerous celebrity cameos are enough to warrant a watch. However, in a genre that is so dependent on originality, ""Scary Movie 4"" lacks the original humor of the first movie, recycling too many old jokes.Cindy Campbell (Faris) and Brenda Meeks (Hall) are back and, this time, are in a war against a spooky ghost, a group of alien tri-pods, and a killer puppet. ""Scary Movie 4"" spoofs such films as ""The Grudge"" (2004), ""Saw"", and ""War of the Worlds"". The key to any spoof comedy is seamlessly connecting a series of unrelated movies. How can one take such different films as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Village"" and make one movie? It requires filmmakers to stretch out the plot, wearing it a little too thin in some places and leaving it a little too cluttered in places. There are many places in ""Scary Movie 4"" where you simply have to turn your brain off and just watch, knowing that the story is taking too many liberties to be taken seriously but not particularly caring. The major problem with spoof comedies is not with the movies, themselves, but with the viewers. People tend to over-analyze them, not realizing (or, more appropriately, not caring) that you are not meant to take these movies seriously. They are entertainmentcheap and hollow entertainment, but entertainment, nonetheless. If you go into them expecting an intellectual movie, then you deserve an hour and a half of groaning and boredom. Whether you like them or not, if viewed in the right state of mind, the ""Scary Movie"" films are some of the most effective comedies made recently.""Scary Movie 4"" relies heavily on its performances to enhance it humor. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are easily the best at eliciting laughs and, thankfully, have the most screen time. Anna Faris is a wonderful actress and could do so much better than this series. When will she do another serious role? Regina Hall could also do better than these movies, but she, like Faris, are just so good at them. Hall made her often flat jokes work beautifully. Craig Bierko is a great actor, but he just doesn't work as well as he should here. His facial expressions are funny, but he just does not fit with the rest of the cast. He also lacks any chemistry with Faris, unlike Simon Rex from ""Scary Movie 3"". Carmen Electra has a few funny moments, but she just doesn't have enough screen time and is wasted on a minuscule part. Chris Elliot returns to the franchise and gives his all in yet another small part. I found myself laughing hysterically whenever he was on screen. Bill Pullman also does a nice job, but he could have also had a larger part. Upon thinking back, it would appear that one of the biggest problems plaguing ""Scary Movie 4"" is the fact that so many talented members of the cast were completely wasted on nothing parts.""Scary Movie"" prided itself on original jokes that shocked almost everyone and offended everyone else. ""Scary Movie 4"" takes a safer route, recycling many jokes from the first three films. However, ""safer"" does not mean ""better"". In fact, when discussing the ""Scary Movie"" series, a lack of originality is especially negative. Comedies, especially spoof comedies, should always try to remain fresh and innovative, but ""Scary Movie 4"" does not do that. It settles very comfortably within territory that has already been explored. Do the jokes still work? Yes, but not nearly as well. However, when ""Scary Movie 4"" does actually step out to become inventive, it succeeds very well and kept me laughing. Still, ""Scary Movie 4"" finds a nice balance between crude humor and clean humor, still keeping it all funny, but not completely revolting. When all was said and done, I couldn't care less about ""Scary Movie 4"". It was entertaining throughout, but lacked any real substance. It was hollow and completely pointless, but never had any boring moments. If you were a fan of the first three movies, then you should give this fourth installment a try, as it follows the exact same formula. No new ground is covered, but it certainly isn't a complete waste of time. In fact, it is the complete opposite.Final Thought: While lacking fresh and original jokes, ""Scary Movie 4"" is still funny enough to warrant a watch.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",Scary Movie 4
102,MrVibrating,"Simple, even stupid, but funny.",7,21 May 2006,"I thought the first Scary movie was pretty funny. The obvious jabs at other movies, the way it exposed some clichés, and the awesome ""Wazaaaaaaap!"" scenes made me laugh, but I didn't bother to see the following two sequels. I just happened to see this one, and I was surprised. It was rather funny.This is the sort of humour that everyone can(scratch ""can"" ,replace with ""should be able to"") laugh at. It's lowbrow, it's silly, it's obvious, but it's funny. If you're more than a little bit snobby you can never watch this movie. You might start laughing in it and get your image destroyed.If you've seen the trailer you know what kind of jokes this movie contains. It's a spoof from frame one to the end. I hadn't seen most of the movies it spoofed, but they are so well-known most of the plot and the scenes they parodies were familiar to me.The best part is the finale though. That one actually had me in fits, which is rare these days. Overall, the spoofs were well-made and very accurate, but not THAT funny. Anyway, this is a silly and funny comedy, even if you haven't seen all the scary movies or the movies they spoof, you should be able to appreciate it.",Scary Movie 4
103,mcsheehey,"Funny, Yet Insanely Stupid: Sounds like a Scary Movie to Me",5,5 June 2007,"""Scary Movie 4"" is one of the most bizarre, stupid, insanely implausible, and all-over-the-place films I have ever seen, making it about like all of the other ""Scary Movies,"" if not more so. The plot mainly spoof-parallels four films, them being ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Saw,"" ""The Village,"" and ""The Grudge."" Unlike ""Date Movie,"" it actually succeeds in making fun of these films, being that they are not too difficult to make fun of. We get to see ""triPods"" that look like giant iPods, a very humorous looking Jigsaw, and Carmen Electra as the blind girl in ""The Village"" among many others. The plot, as one might expect, is meaningless and stupid. I felt as if I were losing brain cells as I watched the film. In addition, the performances are O.K. at best, except for that of Anna Farris who i thought was pretty good. Still, the film is very funny, especially the random spoofs of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". I'd recommend it to teens who are having some friends over and want to watch a stupidly funny film. 5/10",Scary Movie 4
104,JimD73,"More miss than hit, but it hits hard",5,31 August 2006,"Well, a new Scary Movie has come around. Since there hasn't been a good one since the first, expectations were very low, but like always, the movie had a chance. Just look at the first, which has me rolling on the floor every time I see it. Throw in Airplane! director David Zucker and a surefire hit should be expected. Not so much, as the third instalment showed. It may have had a couple laughs the first time around, but the second viewing showed it for what it really was: lame. It is fair to say that the expectations for the fourth were about the same, but this one actually does have some solid bits. Not nearly enough to make it worth recommending, though.The plot, if you wish to call it that (perhaps 'seemingly random string of events' would be a more appropriate name), is, like any other Scary Movie, a string of plots given loose ties to one another. This time, Cindy (Faris) is hired by a company that cares for the elderly and is sent to care for Mrs. Norris (Leachman), whose house is haunted by a little Asian boy. She meets Tom Ryan (Bierko), a single father, who lives behind her. Soon, the country is invaded by giant TriPods, and Tom must run with his family while Cindy uncovers the mystery behind a hidden village the boy told her about.The main spoofs in the movie are The War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Saw and The Village. Unlike most other Scary Movies, there aren't too many minor spoofs in the movie. Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain get their due, as does Oprah Winfrey, but nothing else is blatantly obvious. It is a bit of shame, as the movie likely could have benefited from being a little more broad in terms of spoofs.Of course, the movie will be a lot better if you have seen the movies and can relate them. The War of the Worlds and Saw are definitely popular enough to deserve the parodies, but to be honest, not everyone bothered with seeing The Village or particularly The Grudge, so a lot of people will miss some of the jokes. If you have seen the movies, the parodies of the main four are easy to laugh at, though the Brokeback and Million Dollar Baby stuff falls absolutely flat.Speaking of falling flat, that's exactly what most of the movie does. The movie is entirely hit-and-miss, with many more misses than hits. Just look at scenes like the final Saw-like torture, the Brokeback parody that went too far, any scene with Chris Elliot as the retarded villager or Charlie Sheen taking a bottle of Viagara. Part of you says it should be funny, but it just doesn't work out. For the most part, it's actually cringe inducing when it doesn't work, particularly one scene where Leslie Nielson appears naked in from of the UN.Not to say that the whole movie is a waste. While it misses more than it hits, when it does hit, it can hit pretty hard. Only a couple of the parts that are in gross out fashion are funny, notably a scene where Cindy washes Mrs. Norris with bedpan water. The real solid stuff in the movie is what feels less like Scary Movie and more like the classic Zucker stuff we remember from Airplane and The Naked Gun, where it is funny but isn't repeated or made incredibly obvious, almost being subtle. The best part of the whole movie has to be one point where Cindy speaks Japanese, but actually is just saying popular Japanese rand names like 'Honda' and 'Mitsubishi'. There is also a great Airplane reference that spoofs a scene from The War of the Worlds. In fact, when you think about it, there is a lot of truly funny material in the movie, from Michael Madsen's speech about maggots and dragons to the great opening scene with Dr. Phil and Shaq. It's just too bad they were buried in the rest of the crap.The cast is actually pretty good. Anna Faris once again proves herself as the queen of Scary Movie, with an excellent naiveté and great comic timing. She definitely carries this movie much more than she had to in previous versions. Regina Hall is also pretty good as Brenda, who seems much more sex-crazed than in previous versions. Craig Bierko basically sleepwalks through the movie, and to be honest, that's probably what was needed for the role.There is one hell of a supporting cast to back them up. Leslie Nielson is great as the bumbling president, even if the bits given to him mostly fall flat. Leachman is absolutely perfect as the mute Mrs. Norris. Pullman is appropriately drab as the village elder. Madsen is hilarious in a brief role spoofing Tim Robbins in War of the Worlds. No cast member really fails to do what the director intended in the film. Many of the characters, such as Chris Elliot or Anthony Anderson, are given such horrible bits that they don't really reach their potential, but this isn't their fault so much as it is the director's.Overall, Scary Movie 4 is actually a bit better than the last two entries in the series. While certainly not as funny as the first, it does have a solid amount of laughs, even if the gags are much more miss than hit. If you liked Scary Movie 3, odds are you'll enjoy this one even more. If you are a fan of old Zucker classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun, you might find some of the better bits to be very worth watching. If you are neither of the above, stay the hell away from this movie.65%",Scary Movie 4
105,ALauff,Fun,6,25 October 2006,"Surprisingly more on-target in its cultural lampooning than the previous three films, though that isn't exactly grand praise. The vignettes spoofing Cruise's performances in War of the Worlds and the Oprah Winfrey show work best, with Craig Bierko doing an hilarious coming-apart-at-the-seams impersonation. Zucker and Abrahams, the creative minds behind Airplane! and The Naked Gun, are less concerned with scatological humoralthough the film contains just enough fart jokesthan revealing the cracks and manipulations in Hollywood entertainment, which gives the production a delicious irony since this series is a major cash cow. I had a fun time.",Scary Movie 4
106,wastebot,"Not scary, not horror, but funny",6,19 July 2006,"It's not scary, but it's not actually horror. It is a movie.It's more of a gross-out comedy film satirizing mostly current movies, especially those that have been popular.It's better than some of the films it makes fun of, such as War of the Worlds, and worse than others, such as Saw and Million Dollar Baby.The only real weak spots are when they go too over the top and simply do it for the sake of the gag and trying to be funny. It also lacks American Pie type moments that truly cause you to lose your breath laughing.Otherwise, it's as enjoyable as a very non-serious gross-out scary parody can get and finishes strong.",Scary Movie 4
107,andell,The Weakest Entry in an Ever Weakening Series,2,14 April 2006,"Its hard to write a review of a parody that doesn't work and make it sound logical or thoughtful because, well, the parody in itself is a mocking look at film itself. With this in mind, readers should recognize that my opinions on the film is based on the understanding that it is supposed to be a silly take on films that had a more serious undercurrent.And to put it frankly, Scary Movie 4 is terrible! Set primarily around ""War of the Worlds,"" the film incorporates elements of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Saw,"" and ""The Village"" amongst other films. Aside from Anna Faris and Regina Hall, and aside from perhaps the first scene in which there are some tongue in cheek mocking references to Shaq's free throw shooting and Dr. Phil's credentials, there is very little to find funny here.Perhaps the more discerning readers will want to read a more specific review- if that is the case, I recommend you check out a movie critic who is paid to make them.

Its not hilarious by any means but it does pass an amusingly enjoyable 80 minutes of time. The gags are mostly clichéd and predictable, there's lots of tired old slapstick but when there's nothing else on TV (which is why I watched this) it certainly fits the bill. As for the appearance of 'Michael Jackson' in the film, I'm still laughing every time I think about it - heaven knows how they got away with it, but its certainly a funny moment!! Im' glad that I had seen all the films that this tries to spoof and the re-creation of the sets for War of the Worlds is fantastic. Its so close to the original.",Scary Movie 4

111,J_Trex,This movie was an absolute scream!,10,21 April 2006,"This movie was an absolute scream. I saw it while in vacation in San Juan, PR at the Plaza de las Americas movieplex. The theatre was packed, which I took as a good sign, since the movie is in its second week of release. My instincts turned out correct. This movie was one hilarious bit after the next, and I don't think I ever stopped laughing, in fact, I'm still laughing. The funniest bit was at the end when the hero (Craig Bierko as Tom Ryan)was on Oprah and did a hysterical impersonation of Tom Cruise. Ana Faris was also very good, as always. There was an endless array of cameo appearances, all excellent and very funny.The audience loved it every bit as much as I did. The whole place was rolling in the aisles. Great movie with great comic acting. My only question is how this movie only received a 5.6 on IMDb. How is that? In my opinion, it definitely earned a 10. What more can you ask from a movie than to laugh non-stop for nearly two hours?",Scary Movie 4
112,A_Roode,Plenty of gross out humour but not much else to recommend it.,5,13 April 2006,"Fans of the 'Scary Movie' series will know pretty much what to expect: plenty of gross out gags, parody and a decent performance or two. This series of films was started by the Wayans brothers. Their bread and butter has always been to rely on gross out humour. Although they aren't involved in this series anymore, that philosophy of joke has remained. It may have been fresh initially (the first film WAS clever and fun), but on a whole they have drifted further and further into stale and contrived territory. They lack the freshness that was once there. 'Scary Movie 4' has done nothing to reverse this and I wonder if it might finally be the end of the series. 'Scary Movie 4' isn't bad. It just doesn't really manage to be very good either. I had a free pass to a sneak preview and by the end of the movie was pretty comfortable in my relief of having not had to pay with anything more than time.Anyone who has seen the previous three films will find nothing new. Anyone new to the series will find puerile, profane and vulgar humour which, I admit, has an audience. If you have seen 'War of the Worlds,' 'The Village,' 'Million Dollar Baby,' 'Brokeback Mountain,' 'The Grudge,' and -- most importantly -- 'Saw' then there will be moments of passing amusement for you. These moments pass quickly into fart jokes. That pretty much sums it up: if fart jokes and a girl getting hit in the head on a couple of different occasions with a ball is funny to you, then look no further than 'Scary Movie 4.' If you're hoping to find something a bit more sophisticated, you'll do better searching elsewhere.",Scary Movie 4
113,pressboard,Four is definitely not a charm,3,17 April 2006,"I liked the first 3 Scary Movies, although each one showed a small deterioration from the one before. Number Four has hit rock bottom. Unlike the first 3 movies, number four focuses on spoofing three movies - Brokeback Mountain, The Village and The Grudge. I guess I am really criticizing the writing. Every comedy is going to have humor that either hits or misses and much of that interpretation depends upon the audience member who is ""getting"" the joke. SM4 has too many misses and not enough hits. It has very little ""throw away"" humor, which I always enjoy and a pacing problem as well. There is one excruciating scene where a blind Jennifer Lopez is relieving herself in a church pew, which on the surface sounds like a great scene. It was painful to see how badly this one missed. Instead of laughing uproariously, you are cringing like the church members in the scene. I do not think the series should be retired, but it definitely needs a little Viagra to wake it up.",Scary Movie 4

That said, this one (for me) falls a tad below part 3, which I thought (and still do) is the best in the bunch. I will say that part 4 does offer up some funny stuff. The funniest scene to me is when Cindy and Brenda arrive at 'The Village'. They are hiding in the bushes and see 2 village girls about ready to walk right by them. They decide that they need to pull these girls into the bushes and beat them for their clothes so Cindy and Brenda don't look out of place. They do this, the bushes move around for a bit and, finally, 2 girls emerge from the bushes. But it's not Cindy and Brenda. It's the 2 village girls. When Cindy and Brenda do emerge into view, they are disheveled and a little tired out. Funny stuff. Though some jokes misfire, this is still better than part 2.",Scary Movie 4

Incredible spoofing of Saw, War of the Worlds, The Village, The Grudge, Million Dollar Baby, Oprah, and Brokeback Mountain.Albeit it lacked a climatic feel and that some of the integrated story lines was not as seamless as it was on Scary Movie 3, it still flowed along reasonably smooth, with gut busting gags .... no that's gut busting, not chest bursting .... gut busting gags that makes this movie irresistible.In short, the trailers shows only a small amount of the laughter that this movie can give you, and that even includes the PG rated gags.

117,sullibrandon,Typical Mindless Scary Movie Comedy,7,23 May 2006,"Scary Movie 4 is a movie that had me laughing consistently the whole way through. It is a great comedy, one that will surely make you nearly split your sides in laughter. However, it is lacking in character development, a consistent plot, and an overall good storyline. In comparison with the 3rd (which I absolutely loved) it is about on par, maybe even surpassing it. If you liked the 3rd, you pretty much are guaranteed to like this one.We begin by being introduced to a Saw parody, and then dive right into a Grudge parody, immediately following which we are treated to a War of the Worlds parody. Not long after that, the movie lampoons everything from Brokeback Mountain to the Village. Scary Movie 4 is rich with hilarious parody and comedy - I loved it. However, the plot lines constantly overlap with one another - and there is a part at the beginning with Charlie Sheen that doesn't even make sense. I mean, it doesn't even have a real reason to be there. As I mentioned, there are many other flaws in the movie as well. The characters go through predictable lines and such, never breaking out of the characters that they are parodying. Anna Faris once again plays the token woman who gets caught up in all this tragedy - in this movie she basically takes the place of Sarah Michelle Gellar in the Grudge part of the movie. Craig Bierko becomes Tom Cruise, and Anthony Anderson becomes Heath Ledger (or Jake Gyllenhall.) The comedy in Scary Movie 4 is rich and rife with hilarious puns, one-liners, and so much slapstick you'll wonder how much more you can take, until the writers throw one more clever spin on the idea. However, as a good, quality, solid movie, I have to admit that Scary Movie 4 fails miserably. I knew going into it that this was the case. I was not expecting satire on the level of Airplane!, or character development on the level of Spider-Man 2. What I was expecting was a movie that consistently delivered solid belly laughs - In my book, Scary Movie 4 deserves the trophy of the funniest movie of the year. Much of the humor is based on crudity or sexual antics, though, and Scary Movie 4 degrades itself with predictable uses of these.As a solid laugh giver, I give Scary Movie 4 a 9/10. As a solid, good quality movie, I give it a 3/10. On the whole, 7/10. If you choose to go see Scary Movie 4, whether it is now or on DVD, do not attempt to analyze the death out of a movie whose sole purpose is to make you laugh. If you just sit back and enjoy it, this movie will give you exactly that.",Scary Movie 4
118,Falcon-51,Losing It's Touch,6,28 April 2006,"Trying to scare up some laughs for the 4th time is getting to be tricky. If you have seen the trailer for this film, then you have seen almost all the good stuff. There were a few laughs but the film cannot hold a candle to its predecessors. The cameos were nice (Shaq, Dr. Phil and Charlie Sheen) and its ability to draw from many other popular films as it has done before really helps in getting the laughs. SAW, WAR OF THE WORLDS, AND BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are only a few of the films spoofed for Scary Movie 4. Big fans of the franchise will not want to miss this one, but don't expect as much. Despite its fall from grace, I would encourage another installment, if only to show it can still bring in the laughs.",Scary Movie 4

Anna Farris (sp?) can be funny, but she doesn't need to try very hard in this - there's not much for her to work with. It was interesting to see Dr. Phil willingly take self-deprecating humor, and Debra Wilson is a comedy goddess (I miss her on MadTV), but other than that the laughs ran so thin that sometimes it was hard to tell if they were making fun of other movies or just getting some more use out of left-over sets. I want my $9.50 back! This isn't even a popcorn ""I can just sit back and laugh"" movie. It is a total waste with ""in jokes"" casually mentioning myspace and ""lovely lady lumps"" but without any substance or even the faintest hint of a plot.",Scary Movie 4

After that the plot follows mostly War of the worlds with The Grudge, The Village and other movies mixed with the plot. Like Scary Movie 3 the twisted plot makes the movie even better. One other highlight besides the beginning is the part with Michael Madsen. His short role is hilarious. Other guest actors and celebrities are also funny. Leslie Nielsen is again great as the president of USA and causes some serious laughter. Unfortunately Scary Movie 4 has too many immature poo and pee jokes. I also don't like the too graphic sexual jokes. These two things were mostly missing from the third movie which is maybe my favorite of the series, the first movie coming very close. The director David Zucker also includes too much slapstick into his Scary Movies. Sometimes it works but often not. The verbal jokes of the movie work so much better. The disgust factor reminded me too much of Date Movie which is still haunting my mind. Otherwise Scary Movie 4 is worth seeing especially to those that enjoyed Scary Movie 3. Scary Movie 4 is good enough to have me looking forward to a fifth movie if it happens. I just hope that the fifth movie will have less gross out material.",Scary Movie 4

Sure, those topics can be funny, but there needs to be setup or cleverness involved to make a legitimate gag. Meanwhile, the broader story is equally absent because it's a collection of references to other movies rather than an independent narrative. Many scenes are shoehorned in, making this feel like a sketch show instead of a film. Spoofing is already a low form of comedy, but Scary Movie 4 doesn't even play off of its source material. It only references them as if that alone is funny or entertaining.On top of all this, Scary Movie 4 is as cheap as can be. The special effects, makeup, and costumes are not even trying. Everything looks like a knockoff SNL skit. It's surprising that they got cameos for this production because it's an embarrassment. Clearly, this was made by scam artists who were more interested in grifting audiences than actual entertainment.

In part because I saw it in San Francisco where tickets were $10 each and the crowd was as unruly and loud as I had heard. The majority of it though was that the movie was just not as funny. It tried to be too broad and cover too many movies without a coherent tie-in between them as there was pretty much in Scary Movie 3. A deep reliance on The Grudge and The War of the Worlds as well as Saw made for a confusion movie. Some parts were really good though. Leslie Nielson was really good. Anthony Anderson is always funny. Chris Elliot was under-utilized in a throw-away role.

127,phillipstephenso,Scary?,4,30 June 2006,"Well, not quite scary. More like goofy. I think the slapstick of this movie is like whistling in a cemetery, false bravado. The world is a scary place, and it does no good to simply gloss over horror by ignoring and laughing at it with hysteria, in my opinion. This movie is too clever by half. The War of the Worlds is parodied as simply an excuse for non-stop Saturday Night Live gags. Saw and Saw II are the occasion for Shaquille O'Neal and Doctor Phil, of all people, to share a torture chamber. And, other references to movies such as Brokeback Mountain and others are simply the background for ridiculous and even disgusting behavior. Craig Bierko and Beau Mirchoff are charming as the War of the Worlds father and son. The other members of the ensemble are only mildly entertaining as they woodenly go through their paces and utter their silly lines. The utter silliness of the parody is annoying as well as shallow. Horror is real. Slapstick comedy is real. But, it is really boring to see horror assigned to updated Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges gag routines. This debases both genres.",Scary Movie 4
128,happytoms,Depends on how you look at it,6,11 October 2019,"It's the early 2000s parody formula. All you need is to base the story on few recent and successful high budget movies, make fun of everything and everyone in the most ridiculous ways, have action/horror which mostly leads to comedy, sexy girls and everything else you would expect from a parody.It's a time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days and remember all iconic situations and characters of the movie which aren't that many in this movie compared to the others.The story is as cliché as you would expect from a parody movie, and it's kinda enjoyable after all these years.
Cliché story, music, effects, and the amazing 2000s vibe works kinda well.Overall I think quite a lot of people will not enjoy it and a portion will. Personally, after watching the original movie this feels like not the greatest parody and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 6 out of 10. It's better than the second movie, worse than the first one and equally good as the third one.
Would kinda recommend to anyone familiar or not with parodies, but it wouldn't be my first choice at all.",Scary Movie 4

I saw this movie and I cracked up laughing at a lot of bits. It is a funny movie, but it doesn't deserve a 10. In my opinion (Which I'm sure will suck to a lot of you) Comedy movies don't deserve 10/10's. The acting was pretty good. There are a few jokes that they tried to get laughs out of us, but didn't work. But I wont say much more. Depending if you find sexuality or just normal jokes funny, it depends which ones you will laugh at. A lot of people wont find this movie funny, which is okay, every comedy has haters. As you all know it's about making fun of popular movies and turning them into a joke. That's the whole idea/plot. It is worth the money irrespective there are a few jokes in there that wont make you laugh. 7/10",Scary Movie 4

131,pax03,uhh its Scary Movie 3 all over again,4,20 May 2006,"this was an unoriginal, stupid, gross out movie. Truly a BIG sign that the scary movie franchise is dead or dying. This coming from a huge fan of the scary movie franchise, i thought the first 2 were comic gems and the third one was a nice surprise, but this one just took all the jokes from the last one and just churned them out again. Of course there was celebrity cameos, but about 75% of them didn't need to be in there (ie. Lil Jon, Michael Madsen, Mike Tyson) they were just there to get a small part in a big movie and a paycheck. The jokes were all done before in the first 3, the Michael Jackson thing has been done to death. The only good scenes were the 'Brokeback' scene, 'Tom Cruise' couch jumping scene, and Leslie Nielson. The other jokes you could see coming a mile away and weren't that funny, just stupid or gross. I feel bad for Ana Farris, she has been type cast like crazy and I don't see her career going anywhere but to these spoof comedies that are getting worse and worse. this review is coming from a guy that loves spoof comedies, but this was just not good at all, average is the best word for it.

There are one or two parts that made me life and the movie was extremely short, the only reasons it did not get a one from me. I can watch someone get knocked down or injured once or twice, but if you base your whole movie on that, then it just doesn't work. I didn't even feel like I was having fun nor was anyone in the movie. Please don't make another unless you come up with something fresh, cause this is just bad.",Scary Movie 4
133,the-jerk,Plot? Who needs a plot?,9,19 April 2006,"No this movie isn't art, but then again, neither are any of the others. Nor are most movies in this genre (the spoof), for that matter. But you could always count on the ""Scary Movie""s for laughs, and the same can be said about many of the people involved in this movie.Let's start with David Zucker, director, and Leslie Neilson, actor (he plays the president), both of whom were involved in a few of the greatest comedies of all time (Airplane!, The Naked Gun, Top Secret, Kentucky Fried Movie...). Let's face it, Zucker is a master of this genre, and he did better with both this and the previous movie than the Wayans Bros did. Neilson definitely can be funny, especially when directed by Zucker, and he has a few laughs here. Then there's Anna Faris and Regina Hall, the only two people to star in all four movies. They are both a hoot, and Hall (as Brenda) has some of the funniest lines, although it's a relatively small part (my favorite is a nod to ZAZ comedies of old: showing Cindy (Faris) video of the devastation caused by the alien invasion a la ""War of the Worlds"", she says ""This is Detroit""... followed by ""This is Detroit after the invasion"" with the only two differences between the shots being the presence of the tripods). A few others from the previous movies return for cameos or small parts, including Anthony Anderson, Chris Elliot, Carmen Electra, Charlie Sheen, and Simon Rex. And there are other comedy vets, including Bill Pullman (Spaceballs), Cloris Leachman (about half of Mel Brooks's movies), Dave Atell (Insomniac), and Molly Shannon (SNL). It's all good fun.Forget about a plot, because there is none; ""Scary Movie 4"" is even less plot-driven than most spoofs, including the previous three movies in the series. What it does, essentially, is zig-zag through the plots of ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"", ""War of the Worlds"", and ""The Village"", with other pop-culture points of reference thrown in. This might even be its greatest strength, because really, who cares about plot in a spoof? Some may disagree, but you shouldn't expect great drama with deep characterization in a movie like this, and if that's what you want, steer clear of this one just as you probably did all the others. Go see this if you want to laugh. As in most movies of this nature, many jokes fall flat, but the ones that hit the bulls-eye do so in such a painfully funny way that you'll split your sides. I think this was definitely the funniest in the series yet.Bottom line: ""Scary Movie 4"" is hilarious. Probably the best spoof to be made in a decade.",Scary Movie 4
134,NateF88,The gas tank is halfway full,5,16 April 2006,"Some movies are like a halfway filled gas tank. The part of tank that has the gas keeps the car rolling, but the empty part doesn't help the car move at all.Such is the instance with Scary Movie 4. The first half of the film is completely void of laughs and relies on the been-there-done-that slapstick/goofy violence you'd expect to see on a re-run of a Three Stooges episode on PBS. However, the second half of the movie has quite a few laughs and had enough energy to keep me interested in the movie, but the movie needed a refill for the last few minutes, as it runs out of gas before it reaches the finish line.This time around the plots of recent movies such as War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Million Dollar Baby, Saw, The Village, and quite a few others are intertwined to form a smudge of a comedic plot. Why explain it? Trying to compress the plot into a tiny paragraph is like trying to squash a block of cement in a vice. It just can't be done.I don't know why Scary Movie 4 has to keep on recycling the same slap stick jokes that have been in the previous movie. The only laughs in this film come from spoken one-liners. It's as if they had no other funny dialogue to come up with, and added fart and ball jokes instead that reminded me of the previous bomb this year, Date Movie. Another problem Scary Movie 4 seems to have is a lack of knowledge of when to stop. There are many laughs, but many of the same jokes are played on for such a long time and are repeated that you feel ashamed that you laughed at them when they started. It doesn't know when to quit.What keeps the movie alive the most is, like in Scary Movie 3, Leslie Nielsen playing the President of the United States. He again shows us how much he is needed for these kinds of movies, and there is a very funny scene in which he doesn't know what to say during a speech to the United Nations.If you liked Scary Movie 3, most likely you'll like Scary Movie 4. I don't think anyone who found many recycled jokes in Scary Movie 3 will find anything fresh here. After all, do the movies Scary Movie 4 spoofs have much originality, even when played seriously?",Scary Movie 4

When the franchise changed from Wayans to Zucker I first thought It might come out well, I mean they (he) gave us ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Gun"". But already Part 3 was weaker then the other two. But with ""Scary Movie 4"" the fun is definitely over. The Jokes are lame and just a few scenes are really funny. You sit there with a smile and the only thing you enjoy a little bit, is the parody. And only if you knew the original movies, you might find some entertainment in the installment. I'm seriously disappointed by this movie and I would love the Wayan Bros to take over again. Even their worst movie might be funnier than this boring and toothless ""comedy"". Or give Zucker some creativity enhancing pills ;-).

The film still keep the plot to heart as well unlike many spoof films that don't really seem to have one.Anna Faris once again returns to her now famous role which again includes her being a total pratt at times and at others incredibly funny. The role of Tom Ryan played by Craig Bierko is great but the same gag seems to be used with him right the way through the film.The best scene of the film had to be the scene where Charlie Sheens character returns, all i'll say is Viagra!!!!!! The only bad thing i can say of the film is that the films revolves around the idea of aliens (War of the worlds) which was done in part 3 so hopefully 5 might do something different i'm thinking the OMEN!!!!

138,boy_in_red,A handful of laughs over an hour and a half,5,27 August 2006,"I was excited about watching Scary Movie 4- I needed some silly no-brainer laughs and Scary Movie 3 had been a pleasant surprise after the pretty diabolically unfunny Scary Movie 2.Sadly, this entry, while not completely dreadful, left me feeling pretty so-so about the whole thing. For a film that lasts for about an hour and a half I'm sure I only laughed out loud or cracked a smile maybe a handful of times- not a great ratio really.Maybe it's the nature of the films being spoofed here- War of the Worlds, Saw, The Village, The Grudge- they don't exactly scream comedic potential right? And as the Scary Movie films are very much about parodies of recent releases, it is perhaps highly dependent on the sort of film that have come out lately. However, having said that the screenplay had THREE writers- surely one would expect creativity there to overcome such hurdles? There are some good points too. Anna Faris is always a joy to watch- there's something so instantly likable about her, and she somehow manages to be funny without saying a word. A real talent. Regina Hall is a lot of fun also as Brenda, but her character didn't get to shine as much in this film. I hope for future entries they give her better material to work with.Perhaps worth a rent on a rainy day, but not worth a blind purchase (something I did yesterday in my excitement) unless you're a completist, and know you're going to have to own it anyway.",Scary Movie 4

The original story parodies of film genres that Zucker and Abrams are famous for are instead sadly replaced by Seltzer and Friedberg's scene for scene mockery of various films in the horror genre with various sight gags thrown in (with War of the Worlds, The Village, The Grudge, and Saw taking the major brunt of the punches). However, thanks to Z and A, many of the hit in the groin jokes are replaced by funny dialogs or other, more intelligent sight gags.All in all, however, Zucker and Abrams would have done a lot better had they done this on their own, though.",Scary Movie 4

The timing is perfect and keeps it real. This movie makes fun of movies that are overrated and stupid which I'm glad it does. The acting is pretty good and 85% of the jokes are hilarious. Making Shaq and Dr. Phil playing as themselves was a brilliant idea. I don't know why Dr Phil made fun of himself. I guess he has a great sense of humor and would like to watch himself and laugh at himself. One of the things i disagreed on was the characters bumping into things all the time. The third I chuckled and the first 2 times I laughed out loud, but the eighth time it gets rather old and repetitive for me. Others might not get sick of it. Again, it's an opinion. The Oprah with them poking fun of Tom Cruise was excellent. One of the best ideas in history. Everybody loves it. Sure, who doesn't? i recommend this to anyone who loves people poking fun of movies that are stupid and overrated and actors who are stupid and overrated. 8/10",Scary Movie 4

In this movie, War of the Worlds, Saw, The Grudge, and The Village are spoofed, along with other spoofs weaved in. Do not go to this movie if you are looking for a strong script or powerful acting. You will find neither of those here. However, the crude jokes are for the most part, very funny although at sometimes, predictable. If you haven't seen the movies that they parody, then the chances are, you won't really fully appreciate the movie. Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy Campell and Craig Bierko plays Tom Cruises character from War of the Worlds. Regina Hall mysteriously comes back from her apparent death in Scary Movie 3. There are a bunch of cameos including Shaq and Dr. Phil. Other actors include Carmen Electra, Charlie Sheen, Anthony Anderson, Chris Elliot, and Leslie Nielsen. Although most of the humor is slapstick and a little immature and repetitive, it is also frequently hilarious. Bottom Line: Better than Scary Movie 2. Not quite as good as Scary Movie 1. About the same as Scary Movie 3.",Scary Movie 4
144,Crazyfarts,Just as good as its predecessors.,8,3 June 2006,"Cindy finds out the house she lives in is haunted by a little boy and goes on a quest to find out who killed him and why. Also, Alien ""Tr-iPods"" are invading the world and she has to uncover the secret in order to stop them.The good thing about ""Scary Movie"" movies is that they're all different from each other. A lot of the humor is the same but it's still fresh parody ideas. I thought the trailer was not funny at all and that had lowered my expectations to the point where I may have enjoyed this a lot more.Much like Scary Movie 3, part 4 takes a bunch of recent horror films and blends them in with parodies from other genres... not to be so technical but I thought they were meant to just spoof horror... not that it really matters as this may have been the funniest ""Scary Movie"" yet. I think once it hits DVD, I will probably appreciate its humor even more.What is it with teens? The whole cinema was packed full of teens and young 20-somethings who didn't know anything about the movies being spoofed. I was sat next to a bunch of teen girls who would cuss in every sentence when they weren't watching the movie and yelling out the names of the movies they were spoofing... ""Saw 2!""... ""No, it's the first one""... ""Whatever"". Pffft. They barely laughed and still thought it was a great movie. I remember them laughing at the stuff that really wasn't funny like the ""foot race"" where the guy runs into the wall... it wasn't really funny, it was just moronic and yet these hoes laughed at it. The worst part is when they laughed at stuff that wasn't meant to be funny... stuff they actually weren't spoofing. I'm talking about stuff like Jigsaw riding a trike... he does that in the real movies and yet they thought that was the joke. These people should be shot.Anywho, part 4 is filled with cameos of modern pop-icons, references (of course) and cast members from the last film. They do a funny spoof of Million Dollar Baby and really work the War of the Worlds plot well into the movie as its actually not different from the real movie. Say what? Michael Madsen had a short but funny scene where he imitates Tim Robbins' character from War of the Worlds and says ""We'll build our own tripods... ours will have 4 legs."" Man, this movie had some sweet lines.The effects were also quite terrific. Even stuff like the ground breaking in the streets was up to par with the real movie. Top notch stuff. The Jigsaw scenes were funny too, especially the ending.I'm not going to sugarcoat it... you'll love it if you loved part 3... if you didn't, there still may be hope because even though it uses the same style as the last one, using these new movies really makes it a new experience. I don't know how you'll go, but I laughed.Oh yeah, also look out for the arguments that Mahalik and CJ have like they did in part 3. The MySpace reference was sweet... I was waiting for someone to use that.I don't drink... but I sure did review this movie like I was drunk. I drink, therefore I am.",Scary Movie 4
145,sklose32,Great Movie - Extremely Funny,9,28 April 2006,"To be honest, when I went to the Movie Theater I wasn't expecting that this one is even more funny and outrageous than the last one. When the franchise was passed from Wayans to Zucker in the previous one I was a little disappointed, but already with Part 3 David Zucker proved me wrong, because his first take was already very, very funny. (It's just sad that they went for the PG-13 rating (Parts 3 & 4)) . But this one, oh man! It's so funny you sometimes don't catch a joke because you are still laughing from the previous one. When I went to see it, there where only like 8 people in the theater but like after a minute or so I seemed like the room was full. ( I am from Austria (where the language is German), but I of course went to a Theater where they showed it in English, because when they dub, it they always try to change the jokes, of which they think people don't get, so they change it to something similar from the country the movie is dubbed for (And you never know what the original gag was about. ). So you have to watch it in English. And you must be up-to-date with American pop-culture to get every joke. But there is one thing I was wondering about. They recreated most of the key sequences of 'War of the Worlds' (which here looked sometimes even better). And this movie only cost like 45 Million $. 'War of the Worlds' cost 132 Million $. Just wondering where all that money went. (Guess to Tom Cruise). Back to Scary Movie 4: The ""Saw"" stuff was also extremely funny. And what they managed in this movie what they didn't manage this good in the previous one was combining all the spoofs and have a constant story line that included all the spoofs and yet having a solid story line. And for those who are wondering: You don't have to have seen all the movies they make fun of to enjoy it. It's still funny if you don't know the source material. Like I haven seen 'the Grudge' but I still got the jokes. And one of the funniest short sequences, in my humble opinion, is the 'Brokeback Mountain' spoof. They must have put that in in the last minute. If I would tell you which movies they made fun of I still wouldn't spoil it because you don't know what they do with it. So after blabbering for a while I can only give you one advice: WATCH IT!!! And by the way: You don't need to see and of the previous ones. Except for some names, nothing remains from any of them. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did. Can't wait for some sort of Special Edition DVD. Enjoy!!! Greetings from Vienna.",Scary Movie 4
146,churchofsunshine,"Not great, but better than ""Date Movie"" !!",5,23 April 2006,"It's not often I'll re-edit one of my reviews and mark a film upwards, but the fourth instalment of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise has succeeded where others have failed by appearing to be much better on its second viewing, some two years after I saw it first on a bootleg DVD. Maybe that was the problem, or maybe now, in the wake of endless ""Movie"" spin-offs (mostly by Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer who co-wrote the first ""Scary Movie"" with the Wayans brothers) such as ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" that I realised just how good this film is in comparison.What the studio undoubtedly have done right is removing those two talentless hacks (Friedberg & Seltzer) from the writing duties and recruiting two of the people who invented the spoof movie genre, director David Zucker and co-writer Jim Abrahams (the people behind Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane and the Naked Gun series) who also brought over their old buddy Leslie Nielson, and no-one does deadpan spoof movies better than Nielson. He effortlessly lifts every scene he is in.In the end, this is miles better than Scary Movies 2 and 3, and far better than all of the other ""Movie"" franchises that are being pumped out of Hollywood at an alarming rate. It doesn't outstay it's welcome and although not side-splittingly funny in the way that ""The Naked Gun"" or ""Airplane"" are many years after their first viewings, it's not half as bad as I made out in my first review.

I fell asleep in many sequences, and the movie gets sometimes horribly boring. Zucker was never a fan for toilet humor but we have two disgusting crude scenes in this movie (bathing a paralyzed woman with urine and a blind woman defecating in the church with rich sound effects U could smell !).

152,killbill500,"Not as good as the first three, but still good enough to be included into my DVD collection.",6,12 March 2008,"It's a pretty hit-or-miss movie. Some jokes just work (Cindy's hand actions and facial expressions as she's describing something very nasty, Cindy making the Japanese boy scream, etc.), some that shouldn't work, but do (the blind lady going to what she believes to be her toilet, Michael Jackson's cameo appearance, ""I've been walking beside you the whole time."") but unfortunately, there are some jokes that are either too childish to be taken seriously and laughed at, or just too contrived and have been ""seen before"", which after four movies, would seem pretty inevitable, wouldn't you think? The acting starts out a little shaky, but develops. I give particular praise to Anna Faris' acting, which as always, remains hilarious, believable, and consistent for the whole movie.Should you bother to watch this film? Yes. While there aren't too many laugh out loud moments (this could be because I've seen it a lot of times), there are definitely enough jokes to satisfy you through the entire duration. Rent it first, and if you like it, buy it later.6/10.",Scary Movie 4
153,ThEAnOrExOrCiSt,*Yawn*,3,6 September 2006,"Started out funny enough, and I was exicted at the promise the movie showed. But it quickly deteriorated from there. I mean, the flick wasn't even funny after the opening sequence with Shaq and Dr. Phil in a saw-like peril. It actually gave me a headache, and I found myself wishing that it would just end. At least Scary Movie 3 (which ain't no Scary Movie) spoofed movies that totally deserved it, but they were good films. War of the Worlds was terrible, and so was the Grudge. Neither could go up against Signs or The Ring in terms of the quality of the films (Despite Signs' weak alien bad guys.) If you're going to spoof movies, at least pick some that are actually decent. Spoofing crap leads to a crappy spoof. Boo hiss.",Scary Movie 4
154,AJ_is_Awesomness,"Been there, Done that.",10,9 April 2006,"Okay, first let me say that i have no problem with the Scary Movie series. The first one was pure magic-and created a whole new genre in the Satire industry. The second was also pretty funny, mainly because the Wayans brothers were still on board. The third was merely passable, but because Shawn and Marlon Wayans were onto other things it seemed that the whole thing would come to an end. Now, we return to Scary Movie 4- another follow up of Parody sketches based on recent films. this time heading for the cut, are such classic horror films such as 'Saw,The Grudge, War of the Worlds, Will and Grace and Dawn of the Dead.' Okay, so it's hardly lacking there then. A particularly funny scene taken from War of the worlds involves a furious Tom Cruise lookalike who literally nearly decapitates Anna Faris (Cindy)with a baseball. 'Are you alright?' he says. 'Oh i'm OK. I've taken balls to the face before!' And i must add, that a few of the scenes are pretty funny. A huge alien creature/tripod/Ipod which rises from the ground suddenly begins to play some very strange music. 'The Tripods are circulating all over the world!' says Faris. Okay, so Ipods are a big thing right now, but do we really need a sketch on how popular ipods are selling? I think not! Despite a handful of silly mistakes, SM4 is not that bad. I wish i could say it was excellent, however as we enter 2006, it seems a good time to leave all that Satire stuff back in the year 2000. As Date Movie proved, the whole thing looks tired. Scary Movie 4 does look tired, limping from a good start to a frustrating ending, and still refusing to give up. In my eyes, David Lucker has ruined a good opportunity. I think that perhaps we should move on, and not continue to make the Scary Movie genre and it's fans look worn out and 'sooo last year' Instead, we have another tired, wont-give-up sequel that combines few laughs and fading charisma to pass a laughable PG-13 rating. The first 2 were so graphic, and sexually hilarious, that they were almost instantly given a 17+ R rating. The last 2 are so laughable dire, they are scooping up 14 year old girls, who think that they are incredible for getting in to see a 'real' Adult movie. That adults can be bothered with this is a debate in itself. Cult fans of Scary Movie won't be disappointed, however everyone else will soon get tired of the bum and tit jokes. Not even Faris can save her career now... 4/10",Scary Movie 4
155,Maarten1985,"One of the better, but not the best",6,4 September 2006,"One of the better comedies of recent years ...But not the best.Like previous Scary Movies, the story resolves around a main theme, a parody of a recent movie, blended with references to other recent movies that can be mocked with.Two good aspects of this movie are the use of parody and cameos. The parodies are done so well that you can keep track even if you haven't watched the 'original' movies yet. And the makers of this movie aren't too shy having half their cast existing out of cameos. In most movies this would fail, but for Scary Movie it does the trick. Scary Movie guarantees lots of familiar faces from both movies, sports and music industry.Some actors who haven't had the most success in recent years, like Leslie Nielsen for example, are really enjoyable in this movie. They show that with a good direction they are still very, very funny and capable of doing comedies.Having all the parodies and cameos blended together, Scary Movie 4 marks itself as a decent comedy filled with very funny scenes - as long as you keep your thinking and/or expectations to a minimum in some cases.

Out of all the ""movies"", this one is definitely the worst. David Zucker has probably squeezed all the juice out of his comedies and is just trying too hard. This is more of an attempted Austin Powers comedy movie than a scary movie. It doesn't really follow any specific movie like 1 which is mainly Scream, 2 which is mainly three main ones Amityville Horror, The Exorcist and Poltergeist and 3 doesn't follow any movie mainly but at least its funny. Date Movie was OK but Epic Movie was dreadful too but not as bad as Scary Movie 4. Scary Movie 5 will hopefully be better with most of the original cast of the 1.

This movie is so horrible that my mother would have gotten a heart attack watching it. It's so bad that I am surprised that it didn't get an X-rating.

But where was the blood when Dr. Phony, er, I mean Dr. Phil saws his leg off. That would have been hilarious having all that blood spattered on his face.Then there should also be blood on Dr. Phil's ass-monkey Oprah when that no-talent Tom Cruise parody played ""mercy"" with her wrists. Debra Wilson finally gets a budget to make look like that old overbloated windbag. But she should be BLEEDING! Craig Bierko totally missed Tom Cruise's goofy grin which begged to be made fun of in the WotW opening. I mean, the real Tom was so unconvincing it was hilarious.And what about his daughter Rachel. When that little brat got electrocuted by the tripods, was I the only one in the theater screaming, ""Yes! Fry the little bitch!"" Well, okay maybe I was. But once again, no blood, no makeup for bruises. Nothing. I mean, this is supposed to be cartoony, so at least show little birdies flying over her empty head.And the mass nude scene was brilliant.

161,jimhills,Worth a Rent,7,7 June 2006,"www.kajatm.com In the fourth installment of the Scary Movie series focuses on making fun of the horror genre that comes out during the year and overall is actually pretty good. Scary Movie 4, directed by David Zucker, takes shots at movies and pop culture which includes Saw, War of the Worlds, Million Dollar Baby, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, The Village, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, Shaq, President Bush and Dr. Phil.The opening scene of this movie is highly entertaining, but then again it stars Shaq so how couldn't it be? Hands down Shaq is the funniest athlete in all of sports since John Kruk has decided to be a talking head on ESPN. To open up the movie we find ourselves watching a recreation of the scene in Saw where the captives have to make a decision to either die or cut off their legs. This scene is just priceless. The two captives are portrayed by Shaq and Dr. Phil so honestly just putting those two together it has to be a good scene. I found myself laughing out loud, which doesn't happen that often, because Shaq does such a good job of making fun of himself. Of course we have a standard shot at Kobe and his in ability to make free-throws so it is kind of refreshing to see an athlete not take himself so seriously. But in this scene we also have Dr. Phil making fun of himself and the advice that he gives. So with these two factors we have a great opening scene.The second best scene of this comedy is the recreation of The Grudge. Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who is much hotter with black hair by the way, recreates the scene in The Grudge where Sarah Michelle Gellar is talking to the little boy in the possessed house. This scene is just priceless because instead of using actual Japanese words to communicate with the boy Cindy just uses America words such as Nintendo, Suzuki, sushi, sumo, Mitsubishi, Toyota, etc. while all the time we get a caption on the bottom of the screen translating what they are saying into actual English. David Zucker, my hats off to you for this, good work.I think that it is important to note that during this movie we have a recreation of Million Dollar Baby that contains Mike Tyson playing a female boxer. OK, let that sink in and for a second and just for good measure let me restate that, Mike Tyson playing a female boxer. I am willing to bet that you could have made about $1 million dollars if you made a bet 15 years ago that Mike Tyson would be in movie where he was playing a female boxer. Mike, what happened? You were once the most feared man on the planet, now you are just a punch line. But I guess that I can't really blame you? At least you are trying to pay off the debt that you are in and you haven't done what everyone has expected you to do which is either kill yourself or be in jail serving a life sentence. It is just sad to watch the athletes that you loved (yes I know it is wrong to claim that you loved Mike Tyson but I grew up in the Nintendo generation where Mike Tyson's Punch Out was the greatest video game ever made and it is hard for me to hate a guy that was the reason why I started to like boxing) to watch when you were a kid fall so far from grace.One thing to point out that I really didn't find funny was the recreation of President Bush sitting in the classroom during the 9/11 attacks. President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is sitting in the classroom when a secret agent comes up to him and tells him that the world is being destroyed by aliens. Instead of jumping into action President Harris tells the secret agent that he wants to stay and listen to the story to find out how it ends. Hollywood, we get it, you don't like President Bush. It is about time to let it go, don't you think? If you are going to make fun of the President why don't you come up with something that is a little more original instead of a 5 year old joke.The movie closes with Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) going on the O show (spoof on Oprah) to confess his love with Cindy Campbell. Again, this scene was very well done because it is just a little over the top but almost right on with the way that Tom Cruise acted on the Oprah show when he was confessing his love for Katie Holmes. And anything that takes shots at Tom Cruise and his insaneness is bound to be funny in my book.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It does tend to drag at times but it makes up for the slow parts with some really funny scenes. Normally I would just tell you to go out and rent this movie but because there isn't anything out right now I would recommend going to the theater to see it. Your choices are really limited right now so if you find yourself at the theater looking to see something don't rule out Scary Movie 4. But keep in mind that if you haven't seen the movies that are listed above this movie is not going to be as funny to someone that has. But then again, what do I know?",Scary Movie 4
162,themullenfamily,Oh well...,5,15 April 2006,"Not what I was hoping for, but pretty much what I expected. I loved the first one, enjoyed the other two, so I kinda figured this one would be a let down, and it was. Not nearly as creative as the others, not nearly as many films parodied. It did have its moments, but for the most part a let down. Of course, most of the best jokes were released in the previews either in part, or altogether.It was more fun than cleaning house, which was my other option for today. Worth watching, but don't expect the clever humor and multiple horror film references you've come to expect for the Scary Movie series. They stay pretty focused on War of the Worlds, The Forgotten, The Grudge and Saw 2. I only liked 2 out of those 4 movies, so maybe that explains the 5/10 rating!",Scary Movie 4

Sure it is not the pinnacle of humor but it is not nearly as bad as everyone is saying. IThe acting was pretty decent, although it was over the top sometimes.The jokes where funny and original. Although like the acting they could also be over the top or just flat out gross.The special effects where pretty standard. Nothing special.Overall this is a pretty good movie and it is definitely worth renting. But I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 10.

One question though: in the poster for this movie, the one where you see the actors, King Kong is in the back, I don't remember seeing him at anytime. Did anyone notice a sequence or a scene with King Kong?One negative point:I also think the starting scene, as well as the closing scene, should have been edited a little bit better.

The movie ripped on modern culture, too. It was one of those where you say: yeah, that's me right there. iPod, Myspace, etc. got their comeuppance. It was just the cute little moments that made the movie. My favorite moment was easily the sponge bath scene. Having seen Ju-On, the Korean (Korean, right? Not Japanese...) version of the Grudge, I remember a similar scene where the caretaker gave the catatonic old lady a bath or something. In this movie, the sponge missed the water bucket & went straight for the urine filled bedpan. :D",Scary Movie 4

In my opinion, they made fun of The War of the Worlds a little too much, but it was still really funny. I don't understand why so many people did not like this movie, I just do not understand the hate.

I wanted to like it, I liked 1 and 2, 3 was the best and most humorous, and then this stinker! I think I laughed twice through the whole movie, and the first was in the opening sequence which I had already seen in the previews (why do they do that anyhow?) To sum it up, if you like Wayans style humor (gross out, stereotypes which ring true, and goofy humor) watch 1 or 2 (1 is better).If you like thoughtful, slapstick humor (like Airplane, Naked Gun, etc.) and like your humor more thoughtful, rent 3 (think it's still one of the best comedy movies ever made.) But, if you like to laugh like twice, and like your humor to be stupid and such, see this one. I think most will be disappointed and to add to this movie's cringe factor, it might have killed off the spoof movies.I only gave it a 2 because that is the amount of times it made me laugh, suppose it's better than none!",Scary Movie 4

There is no plot (even by spoof standards) and the jokes are painfully unfunny and downright cringe-worthy. I can't believe the people who voted this a 10. They must've seen a completely different movie. And can someone PLEASE explain the 5.2 rating on IMDb to me? This movie is bottom 100 material for sure! All the jokes were in the trailer (and even they weren't that funny). I'm only hoping that 5 will be a step up from this - which should be easy because this was about as funny as watching a person snore for 90 minutes.My advice: watch 1, 2 and 3 back-to-back and forget this ever existed.",Scary Movie 4

It has more understandable jokes and new characters in it. It's just amazing how they take movies and then trip on it. My favorite was the whole president scene. I am sorry for those who like Bush out there, but I don't and I just thought the scene was hilarious. The movie is indeed worth seeing.

Now, if you've seen the first three, didn't like them, and still went to see this, then it's your own fault. If you haven't seen any, or just one of the other ones, and didn't like this one, then i still blame you because you really had no reason to go see this. Anyways, the audience that they were aiming to entertain were fans of the first three, so if you didn't like the first three, and gave this one, then it's your own fault for going to see it. Now... to the movie. Scary movie 4 had some surprisingly good parts. This is up there with the first one, and it was something a little bit fresher than the third. The acting, like normal, was a little bad, but that was expected after seeing the first three. And, also, the humor was a little bit on the stupid side, but that's the whole point of the movie. As a flat out scary movie fan, i enjoyed this movie, and i think that if you fall under the audience that they were aiming for, you'll like it to.

Also Craig Bierko is spot on, if you don't know who he is, remember Cinderella Man, she was Max Braddocks last opponent, he was as funny as hell.Take my advice, if you want to spend your hard earnt £/$ then see this, i was still laughing when i came out of the cinema.",Scary Movie 4

Similarly, I haven't seen any of the movies ""Scary Movie 4"" parodies, though I could tell what they were (Saw, Saw 2, The Village, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, Dawn of the Dead, The War of the Worlds, and possibly more). Whatever the case, I found this movie to be high entertaining.Though never seeing the individual movies, I could see the problems the writers may have had on the other stories (such as Tom's lack of regard for his daughter) through the exaggerations used. Clever references to the real world are seen such as the alien tripod plays 80s music before switching to attack mode (ala the ipod), a ghost's illegible directions being translated into a Yahoo map, and where ""gangstas"" are vaporized, leaving a bunch of gold chains behind. I also liked the references to world events, from Tom Cruise's outburst of love on Opera, To Bush's inactivity during 911, to Mike Tyson's ear incident.I really enjoyed how the stories flowed together, doing an effective job of making you laugh yet scaring you senseless at the same time (as well as bringing about the demise of Dr. Phil). The only reason it's not perfect is because the movie was fairly short. The conclusion was pretty rushed and everything was just resolved too easily. Nevertheless, this is a must see for horror movie fanatics, those who love the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, and lovers of comedy that isn't afraid to push the envelope.",Scary Movie 4

But after seeing Date Movie, which was the worst movie i've ever seen, I felt the need to point out some things about Scary Movie 4 that Date Movie is obviously lacking. O.k. where to start...Scary Movie 4 has generally good characters. Anna Faris and Reginna Hall were overall really funny. The jokes in this movie made sense, had many pop-culture references, weren't extremely dragged out, and flowed with the over-all story, wheres Date Movies jokes where just one, hollow, interchangeable joke after another...There were some ""not so funny parts"", such as the very end. And the constant reference to rappers throughout the movie(Chingy, Lil John,etc.), I guess to reach out to the younger culture. I'm 15 and I just found it annoying, not funny.But overall the funny parts overpower the not funny parts. This movie isn't as good as number 3, which wasn't as good as number 2, which wasn't as good as number 1, but over-all, its a pretty good movie. I would of origanlly given this movie a 5 or a 6, but after seeing Date Movie, i'm grateful for people like David Zucker, and i'm giving it a 7.

It's filled with dumb jokes, sexual references, and everything in pop culture that's happened in that last year.

My son and I both agreed it was the best of the lot - having picked up part 2 shortly afterwards.I was only familiar with Saw and War Of The Worlds at the time, although I was aware of The Village and it was on my 'must see' list. After seeing it, and then watching SM4 again, I found it even funnier. Of course the toilet scene was in bad taste, but isn't it what you'd expect from this genre anyway?I was a bit surprised when brash, loudmouthed, over-sexed, Brenda turned up - hadn't she been stabbed to death in a cinema scene in an earlier film - but what would a Scary Movie be without her?Not for the high brow-ed, but if you just want a bit of fun, see it for sure.",Scary Movie 4
179,dunkel_berg25,Is this movie racist? I hope I am wrong about this...,3,5 June 2006,"The fourth Scary Movie seemed to me very ....not funny compared with the other three. And I was very disappointed since I liked the third movie very much, and since this one has the same director and screenplay writer I was expecting a very funny movie. Let me get to the point. I really thought this movie was very much racist with afro-Americans overall. I am not saying this because I am an afro-American and I hope I am wrong but I will try to prove my reasons through several scenes I disliked in the movie: two afro-American rappers are killed by the alien attack. They vanish and the only thing left are their silver chains and necklaces and stuff. (OK, MAYBE this one is only a bad joke) the blond hair girl's friend(played afro-American actress Regina Hall) is portrayed as a total prostitute. I am not sure she behaved like this in the previous movies, but on this one it was really explicit. the two afro-American actors(very good in their comedic roles by the way) playing the gay couple in a Horseback Mountain reference. I know its just a silly movie, but it really looks quite humiliating for them. Mike Tyson goes mad on a ""tearing everybody's ear"" spree on a boxing arena (ok, maybe making fun of his image will work for him but I think probably not), Don King kills the little boy with his heavy weigh and even Shaq seems very mean in the initial scene of this movie. Tom Ryan break Oprah's wrists. OK, I don't no Oprah. What I know about her make me want to not want to know her(uh...something like that). But the point is that she is a very strong personality in American TV and very popular through the afro-American people. I am guessing that her show must have broke a lot of audience records and she will probably become a legend in the history of American television. So, yes, I think she deserved more respect. OK. This is it. They couldn't have done it. They shouldn't have done it. This scene is totally unnecessary. And apart of this being a very stupid movie I still think that they should have used someone else. Or at least, someone not afro-American for a change. But they chose to do it with him and I really don't know why he accepted it. He needs money that bad? He must have cashed some with Episode III. I really hope that this isn't the last movie to remember such a great actor, Mr. James Earl Jones.Overall very disappointed. I thought I could trust good work from the guys who made comedy classics such as ""Airplane"" and ""Top Secret"".",Scary Movie 4
180,holmescj80,Funnier than Sacry Movie 3,9,18 June 2006,"This latest installment in the Scary Movie Franchise was well done.The jokes are not as half baked or over done as Scary Movie 2 and 3.The plot is relatively simple - we see the return of Cindy Campbell (she gets finnier and dumber as the movie moves along) looking after an old lady in a house, which is next to Tom Ryan's house, during the alien invasion.From here, the cast get separated and go their own ways, with funny adventures meeting strange characters.There is always the usual fart gag here and there, and homophobia (a poke at Brokeback Mountain).The special effects are pretty funny too. Erections, children zapped by lightning and severed limbs are all about fun.This film may also leave the door open for Scary Movie 5.",Scary Movie 4
181,gomi2,90 Minutes of pop-culture references... none of them funny.,1,22 April 2006,"Had 2 children not relied on me for transportation home from the movie I would have walked out after the first 10 minutes. Strangely enough they hated it. What's more surprising is that I shared the opinions of two teen boys who are engrossed in Rap Music, Pro (sic) Wrestling, MTV, and movies featuring breasts, blood, and explosions. This movie should have been right up their alley.Scary movie 4 recycles the same jokes from the first 3 ""Scary"" movies, but disguises it in a shiny new wrapper by using a new set of overrated pop-culture references. Instead of poking fun at the aspects of pop-culture that truly deserve it (ie: tabloid magazines, irresponsible pregnant pop-divas, ridiculous celebrity monikers like 'P-Diddy,' contracting the names of Hollywood couples like 'Brangelina and Tomkat,' predictable bad-movie plots, brainless celebrity sluts, and drugged-up sports stars) they simply took anything that was popular and tried to make fun of it. In fact their desperation to latch onto anything that COULD be made fun of, no matter how much the humor failed, was so strong that it left the writers looking ignorant and out of touch with what satire truly is. The movie's plot is thin, accidental, and written as nothing more than an excuse to tie War of the Worlds, Saw (I & II), The Village, and The Grudge together in such a loose fashion, that one would have gotten more from it had they watched it backwards. In trying so hard, it generates a largely predictable and detestable plot that is little more than re-enacted footage from movies that you're probably already too familiar with, using sub-par actors, generic FX, cheap visual gags, and bad puns. However, I will give the studio kudos for recreating those scenes with splendid accuracy.If you enjoy watching movies you have already seen, except poorly modified in completely low-brow attempts to make you laugh, then run out right now and see this. Otherwise, if you have a brain, you'd find more entertainment value from having a bus run over your head. I may have never laughed during this movie, but I did halfway smile, TWICE! I think that's the highest compliment that this movie can get.I expected more from the man who brought us such comic classics as Kentucky Fried Movie and Police Squad.For shame, Mr. Zucker. Running low on cash, are we?",Scary Movie 4
182,K-Mac017,The writers of Scary Movie have clearly lost their edge,3,9 June 2007,"Seriously, whatever happened to the days where you could simply look past all the grotesque humor and nonsensical lines and still get one heap of an entertaining time and laugh watching a comedy? That's what the original writers for Scary Movie used to bring, but ever since Scary Movies 1-3, this series has gone way downhill, and it's gotten worse with each addition to the series. This is seriously the most retarded and unfunny comedy (or attempt thereof) I have seen besides Date Movie, besides that pathetic attempt at a comedy, I don't think I have ever been so bored and laugh less watching a comedy before in my life. There were only 3 or 4 even remotely funny scenes throughout this travesty of a film (or spoof, whatever you want to call it), and most of the laughs came courtesy of Leslie Nielsen, the only remotely funny act in the entire movie besides Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart, which even they weren't that funny like they were in Scary Movie 3. And notice how they only picked the more recent movies at the time of filming (The Village, War of the Worlds, Saw, The Grudge, etc)? If that were really the case, where they only picked the latest films to spoof, then they should have stopped at Scary Movie 3 because let's face it: you really need to get your head examined if you think you can make a spoof out of The Village, War of the Worlds or the Grudge that is in the least bit funny, those are the last films that come to mind that should be made into spoofs based off of them period, and this film showed every bit of it. I gave this movie a 3, and that was being generous. The only reason I even rated it as high as I did was because Leslie Nielsen was REALLY funny in this movie, I'm still chuckling as I write this... but other than that, save your money, it looked funny from the previews, but this movie has once again shown that trailers can be deceiving as they show only the greatest parts of a movie, and I can assure you that, aside from the parts in the trailers, you won't find anything even remotely worthwhile here. Granted, it's funnier than Date Movie (which that's not saying much at all), but unless you really dose up on the sleep pills, you'll have a hard time even making it to the few actually funny scenes in this movie. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",Scary Movie 4

The weak point of the movie is that the first part of the movie is not well related to second part and seems separate story altogether.

It turns out i put my expectations too high, and i didn't end up liking it that much. Sure, there are some jokes, but none are really THAT effective, and i felt as if the character Brenda was not back to her old self again. This is just a way to waste 86 minutes or so - but i heard a lot of other people liked it - so my review probably isn't the most important - but, as i said, it is an OK movie. Though it is not filled with all the laughs i would have wanted, from movies such as Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, or even Anchorman, it is still an o-k way to spend 86 minutes.5.5/10 _ty",Scary Movie 4

If you enjoyed the first two, you'll most likely hate this film.Watch the movie but don't expect much. The movie spoofs on the Village, Saw, Saw 2, War of the Worlds, The Grudge, etc. The film has a very unfunny opening involving Dr. Phil & Shaq. You've seen this on the previews & everyone has already seen it. In fact most of the jokes, you've already seen because of the previews. Most of the jokes in the film are recycled from past movies & television shows. The funniest part in the movie, is every scene with Leslie Nelson.

186,archer75,Pray that the Scary Movies don't end up like Police Academy,4,31 August 2006,"We all like the Scary Movie series. They are funny, witty and well acted, mainly because the actors are funny and do not take the role too seriously. Well not all of them, SM4 is ruined by Craig Bierko and Leslie Neilson (wash my mouth out with soap).Mr Neilson has made some very funny movies (Airplane, Naked Gun) and some shockers (Mr Magoo). However, he brings nothing to SM4 and his address to the United Nations is both insulting, hammy and, worst of all, simply not funny! Craig Bierko has the dubious honour of being the lead man, pushing the prettier, but, more importantly, funnier Anna Faris to the sidelines. He might be the lead man but his performance was more like lead (a little homophone for you to work on). The final scenes, where he guest appears on 'Oprah' is truly embarrassing and, at times, he looks as if he is equally embarrassed. He does not give a good enough performance as either the straight man or a funny guy.SM4 does provide another game of 'Spot the movie' and the acknowledgements towards The Grudge, War of the Worlds, Brokeback Mountain and Saw, amongst others, is good. It remains a mystery why they ignored the Zombie opportunity, especially with the reincarnation of Brenda.The writers and producers need to ensure that the next movie (if there is to be another) is not rushed, and endeavour to produce a film that is as funny as the original and its 2 sequels. If they fail, the Scary Movie franchise may end up a parody of that other great, but finally embarrassing series, Police Academy.",Scary Movie 4

Some that I remember. :Cindy burns the ghost's hand in the attic. - Brenda throws the solenoid at a passing driver. - The ghost rolling down the stairs.A must for the type people who can laugh at themselves.

Compared to the third movie though, this is fantastic and has a lot of great one liners (mostly from Leslie Nielsen (President Harris) this time around).It's great to see the return of Anderson (Mahalik) and Hart (CJ) and also great to see Chris Elliott back in the film, even if he isn't around much.

But, also scary movies as well, it made fun of the ridiculous-ness that was the Village, War of the Worlds, The Grudge, and Ring 2.Anna Farris, was, as always, hillarous, and so was the rest of the cast.It's a pleasant surprise--definitely see it!",Scary Movie 4
191,Justin-Kamal,"Good, but...",7,17 April 2006,"Scary movies have been a fan favorite for decades. They have thrilled us, entertained us, and shocked us to the core. There comes a time in every scary movie's life when it becomes subject to sarcasm and satire. Those movies selected to be featured in the ""Scary Movie"" movies are often portrayed well and very humorously. This time, however, I'm afraid that they have not been treated quite as kindly as their precedents.Practically copying the plot line of ""War of the Worlds"", ""Scary Movie 4"" reveals its writers as unimaginative though slightly funny. With brief cameos of ""Saw"", ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Village"" and ""The Grudge"", this movie delivers a fairly good yet cheap satire of some of the best horrors of the year. While the use of the actual special effects from those movies prevents ""Scary Movie 4"" from looking cheesy, it further proves that the production crews need to get off their butts and start thinking of some better ways to earn their profit.Why would I want to go to a movie and spend almost two hours watching slightly changed clips of movies I've already seen? I must admit that curiosity got the best of me and drove me to go watch it. My reaction to it was actually rather positive. Much unlike usual, I enjoyed the toiled humor in this film. I thought that they actually did a fairly good job changing the original plot lines. My opinion still remains that they compromise their ability to make new and original movies and much rather copy old ones to make a hefty profit from viewers who enjoyed the movies featured.My overall rating for this movie is a 7/10 since it did pull out a few laughs out of me. Regardless of its meaningless and pointless plot line, ""Scary Movie 4"" still managed to become one of the most anticipated movies of the year and I suppose that is worthy of respect however medial.I recommend you wait for this movie to be released on DVD or TV. It's not really worth it to go see it in theaters unless you don't care about story quality and prefer straight-up humor.",Scary Movie 4
192,annie88_99,Silly but some good laughs,7,23 August 2006,"Why would an intelligent, well-educated, middle-aged woman like this movie? It's inexplicable, but I did. I don't know if it's because I watched it an hour after slamming my finger in the car door and I had cried myself into heaves and needed something to laugh at. Or perhaps it was because I am a fan of the majority of the movies that Scary 4 spoofs and I took them a little too seriously at the time. Whatever the reason, I laughed a lot during this movie, and while I'm ashamed to tell any of my friends that I liked it, I'm telling you. The great thing about the Scary movies franchise is that they do an exceptional job of copying the original, with some very good special effects that I'm sure cost a fraction of the real ones. They also draw on some great comedic acting talents, which always strikes me as a bit bizarre, but then maybe someone on the producer's team is a great salesman. Whatever the tricks behind the scenes, it works on screen. Are the jokes dumb and predictable? Yes. Is there more potty humour than necessary? Absolutely. Still, it's fun low-brow humour.",Scary Movie 4
193,scyker,Scary Movie,8,23 April 2006,"I'll admit, that scary movie four seems kind of run down after the first ones, but you people are being moronic about it. First off, the movie is supposed to make fun of other horror movies as much as possible. That's the point. Second, it was a good movie. You don't have to be a die hard fan to like it. It had really funny scenes and they went about it the right way. If they see a good joke, they use it. That's the way it's suppose to be done. It's a good comedy movie. I hope there's more in the end. Because this series, unlike other movies with their billions of pointless sequels, can continue as long as there are more horror movies. Don't call the humor into question just because the title of the movie ends with a four. Comedy and horror are disappearing and aren't as good as they used to be. These movies are a great idea. Don't let good ideas disappear. I was laughing right up until the end. Don't let this movie pass you by. The whole point of the new characters is that the movie gets new life.

It's only about 84 minutes so I'd recommend not spending TONS of money on concessions.BUT and that's a big but, THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC. The film starts out a little too slow, the jokes fall flat, and it's cheesy. About ten minutes into the whole thing, though, it all changes. Cindy is up to her old tricks of saving the world and spoofing movies along the way. The writers did a wonderful job of distorting movie plots.However, I must offer a piece of advice...DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU'VE ONLY SEEN ONE OR TWO FILMS FROM LAST YEAR!!! I sat in that theater for the whole time laughing so loud and hard my stomach hurt, but I was all alone. No one else laughed because none of the other movie-goers had any clue what was going on. If you haven't seen Million Dollar Baby, Saw, The Village, The Grudge, War of the Worlds, or Brokeback Mountain or if you don't know about Tom Cruise's couch jumping episode you are going to be utterly confused and frustrated because THESE MOVIES ARE SPOOFED.

The plot of this film is very dry and too predictable sure it has some funny elements to it but i am surprised to see it got one win it was that bad. The acting is average and the story line tends to lingerer. There is a lot of unnecessary parts in this movie that drag it down they are trying to be funny but no one is laughing and all the jokes have been done before and are worn out in this movie. Only two members of the original Scary Movie cast are in this movie. They should seriously not make anymore as they get worse as the movies go on. Anna Faris you are much better than these movies. This is a let down from the movie Airoplane which David Zucker also directed. I gave this movie a 3 as it was two hours wasted from my life for a lot of rubbish.

It all started with Airplane nearly thirty years ago and moved into The Naked Gun etc. to Scary Movie 3. The actors and gags slowly churn some from brother to brother with the exception of Leslie Nielsen.It basically spoofs four movies with others thrown in.

You will get some good laughs out of it and the reason the jokes mostly work is because there are great comedic talent like Regina Hall, Lislie Nielsen, Anna Faris, Craig Bierko, Anthony Anderson, Chris Elliott, Kevin Hart, Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex. They spoof every horror hit of that year or last and make a story of it all and they parody everything from War of the Worlds to Saw its not as good as the other Scary Movies but still a pretty good spoof.

The first one was pretty decent, the second one was OK, the third picked up slightly but this one was terrible.They tried to put too much in the film and it had no real plot. At least the first one was a horror film with spoofs throughout. We never actually knew who the killer was and the spoofs served the story. Scary Movie 4 spoofs films in the same way that a sketch show would do. It never forms a plot and therefore fails as a decent parody.It may have looked good, being the first shot in high-definition, but it could have been better. The jokes also wore too thin; it relied on slapstick humour which is awful at the best of times. The ending has no purpose than to inform the viewer that Tom Ryan is Tom Cruise. WE KNOW. ITS SO OBVIOUS THROUGHOUT THE FILM WHO TOM RYAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE. WE Don't NEED AN OPRAH SHOW - WE GET IT.Rating: D-",Scary Movie 4

At times his stuff is embarrassing. I know the guys who did Airplane did work on this one, there are no parallels to Airplane and this one, not a single one. Opening scene was good, Dr. Phil lets his true emotions out. Shaq is great.Overall this movie was bad, but you can decide that for yourself.

The only movie I had seen that they spoofed was The Village, but I knew enough about the others that I got most of the jokes. I just thought most of the gags were lame and the script was lazily thrown together. *I* could have written better comedy! I like Leslie Nielsen as the dim-witted president, an extension of most characters he has played since ""Airplane!"". And Dr. Phil was a fun addition.To me, the funniest scene was when Cindy and the dead Japanese boy were speaking 'Japanese'. I was the only one in the theater that found this hilarious. (They just kept saying one-word Japanese brands and items, like ""Suzuki! Teryaki! Fujitsu!"" and pretended they were really saying something. Very silly.)

I love Scary Movie 3 and I think its still the best although the original is a great toilet humour comedy, but this one mannnn was dreadful. I found myself forcing myself to find it funny just because I loved Scary Movie 3.The saw opener wasn't even that funny, although I did laugh at the MJ bit and the brokeback mountain tent scene, in my opinion those were the funniest two gags of the film. It seemed like Zucker played it safe by just including loads of scene where people get hit on the head. I no it doesn't matter if there's not much of a plot but this was useless how they tried to tie in 3 different plots from horror films.OH AND A BIG NO NO, what happened to Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex they was a great comedy duo, and were given nothing in this film except a few minutes which wasn't even funny, i was cheesed off about that, although I think Kevin Hart and Antoney Anderson were the scene stealer's of the film. The character of Tom Ryan was irritating and wasn't even funny.I don't know whether the franchise is getting old now, but it seemed that this wasn't a scary movie film, because it was that dumb and it seemed rushed just to make some money. And it would have been better if the House Of Wax gag was included And I've got to say I was shocked that this received a 15 certificate in the UK when it wasn't that bad, the sexual dialogue was in the same league as date movie which was given a 12A.Fans will go and watch this despite bad reviews but expect the worst",Scary Movie 4

Half an hour into this film I snuck out of Scary Movie 4 and snuck into She's the Man (a surprisingly awesome comedy, it aims for the same age audience, but those with a higher IQ) The failing for this film is obvious - there is no sense of plot or character and so the jokes consist solely of spoofs of popular recent films without anything to hold it together - or hold your interest.

207,Vickerend,Too short but out of standing!,10,8 July 2006,Getting better in some ways and worst in others. David Zucker started with Scary movie 3 after the Wayans brothers stop making sequels. Scary movie 2 was crowned as one of 2001's worsts movies. Scary movie 3 (DAVID ZUCKER)was much better than the 2nd part so we expected much more from scary movie 4. Scary movie seems to be divided into to parts: scary movie 1 and 2 directed by Wayans brothers and scary movie 3 and 4 directed by David Zucker. Two completely different styles. Scary movie 3 was surprising! Laughs since the beginning until the end but was too short.Scary movie 4 is just worst. Less laughs but the copies of other terror films as the grudge changing it into comedy is better than ever. Ana Faris is the best thing in the movie. Each time she is more stupid and her acts are excellent. I think no other actress could do it better. The parts in which Carmen Electra acts as the blind in the village are great. Much better than Scary movie 2 but worst than Scary movie 1 and 3.David Zucker has announced a 5th movie. I expect it better and a change in the style. A good movie to have some laughs.,Scary Movie 4

The movie explores all the box office hits such as War of the Worlds, The Village, The Grudge, Million Dollar Baby and Saw. Scary Movie 4 is way better than 2, 3. But personal the first Scary Movie was a classic and all the best jokes and gags came from the first. Scary movie 4 only 80 minutes long which is disappointing due it's the last one in the chapter. Best comedy I will see this year. All the old jokes still made me laugh and the new. Defiantly worth the wait and should see it if you haven't? I went to show my support to David Zucker because he makes some classic. So if you haven't seen it, go now!",Scary Movie 4

I loved the whole Scary Movie Trilogy, but why this!? Shaq couldn't act, I didn't laugh at any part except the part of the president showing his ass to the nation. The theme wasn't funny at all, the Brokeback Mountain scenes weren't even clever or FUNNY, mostly any scene the writers wrote weren't funny. So why making this movie??? I don't understand why New Line Cinema would buy the script. However, don't even bother seeing this movie.

And didn't they already use the village in the other Scary movies? Maybe not, but I thought so. If so, they shouldn't repeat. The saw part(s) were good though. I won't say what I liked the most, because I don't want to give it away, but the end with the guy & the woman, is pretty funny :] Anyways, this movie wasn't worth seeing to me, but at the same time I guess it was.

I was very pleased to see Brenda back, however, not even she could bring this up to the standards of the others.It felt as if each scene was rushed and just randomly placed together- for some reason, it didn't all seem to fit with each other, it was like ""OK, we've done one spoof- quickly we have to do the next one"" and everything seems so rushed and unfinished.However, it wasn't a complete disappointment, Their were some really funny moments in the film which save it from complete boredom.

I might have laughed one or twice but that was it. I don't think they picked the right kind of horror movies to show. war of the worlds! and The Grudge! and Saw! and The Village!! the village ain't a horror movie. i think that scary movie's 3 and 4 are exactly the opposite than 1 and 2. first of all these movies like scary movie 1,2,3,4 are not movies that you would make a fuss about. the acting honestly sucked, and nothing fit with anything... if you are going to the cinema to watch a movie this weekend, pick something like ice age 2 or the three burials of Melquiades Esttrada. those are movies that are really good.so basically, you're in trouble when a comedy opens with a mirthless sketch (sending up Saw) featuring American celebrities mostly unrecognizable to British audiences (basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and TV pundit Dr Phil). The fourth Scary Movie then proceeds to weave together limp skits on The Grudge, The Village and War Of The Worlds, with tipped-in stabs at the not-exactly-scary Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain.Director David Zucker, still in career wilderness, has Leslie Nielsen's President to do a very tasteless 9/11 Bush routine and makes room for cameo rappers who aren't funny but can now brag to their crews that they're movie stars. Anna Faris, reaching the get-me-out-of-this-franchise crunch Steve Guttenberg was in after the fourth or fifth Police Academy, and Craig Bierko  who does an okay Tom Cruise-on-Oprah imitation  deserve better.

Unfortunately it is what we have come to expect from the Scary Movie franchise, and quite predictable at times. I was also disappointed because it takes the same general plot of the last movie: Alien Invasion.Despite the negativity you may be reading, the reason my vote is so high is because of the humor. The plot may have been weak and the acting a bit frail, but the comedy was the one element that kept me in that theater. It wasn't the regular raunchy sex jokes you may expect since it was in the first and second, but rather regular slapstick comedy. These movies deserved being spoofed, and boy did they receive what was coming too them.Some jokes were well planned out, others dragged on, and some were just so stupid you couldn't help but laugh.

As you can tell by my screen name, I have a soft spot for really bad movies. The problem with this film was that it wasn't really bad, it was just boring. Almost all of the jokes fell flat and the ones that were kind of funny either didn't go far enough over the edge,(due to the PG13 rating)or wore out their welcome by going on too long. I really like all of the actors in the movie, and I've always respected the writers and director, but they just seemed to be phoning it in. Anywho, I'm sure there's a crowd of people out there who will enjoy the movie, I just wish that I were one of them. I'm sure it will make 50 million easy and there will more than likely be another in two years.

Plus, every one of the Scary Movie series is funny, and this is probably by far the funniest. It had a good storyline to it, and is just a movie that's worth watching.I will probably try to own it on DVD when it comes out, and I think that this one is a lot better then Date Movie.

This one spoofs mainly the war of the worlds, being very good at it( the ipods are very good), but the reference too the grudge was the best. IF you are a spoof fan you'll probably like it(not certainly), but if you are not, maybe it's a 50-50 kind of thing. You may not liked it, but keep in mind: it could be worst.

There were about 3 funny parts in the whole movie and the rest can be summed up in one word..STUPID. In fact what I kept hearing from everyone in the movie theater was the same thing I was thinking ""this is so stupid"". Maybe my 8 year old son would like it, but I don't see an adult thinking it is funny, unless you are easily amused.

220,I_Like_Turtle_s,"""By keeping the parody and humour so tightly focused, they've generated more laughter than any other movies this year.. so far.",7,14 April 2006,"The Scary Movie parody wagon has been rolling since 2000, when the Wayans Brothers pooled their considerable comedic talents and came up with a kitchen sink flick that riffed on mainly horror movies  with just a little Matrix thrown in. The second Scary Movie, also from the brothers Wayan, riffed on The Exorcist, The Legend of Hell House, Poltergeist, Little Shop of Horrors, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining, and Hannibal. Non-horror targets included Dirty Harry, Charlie's Angels, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and again, The Matrix.A couple of years passed, and the directorial torch was passed to Airplane! genius-with-a-joke David Zucker for Scary Movie 3. Without Wayans, the genre widened a bit to add even more non-horror movie spoofs and much more current films. It was a box-office hit, so of course you knew what was comingScary Movie 4, with all the core regulars back in action, makes fun of War of the Worlds, The Grudge, The Village, Saw and Saw II, Million Dollar Baby, and Brokeback Mountain. With a better through-line connecting all the stories than its predecessor, Scary Movie 4 is a refreshing (albeit rank) addition to the series. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are back as the clueless Cindy Campbell, and the sex-crazed Brenda Meeks, respectively.When Cindy takes a job as the caretaker of an elderly woman (Cloris Leachman), she runs into some scary ghosts with a grudge. But things start looking up when she meets her handsome new neighbor, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko). Unfortunately, Tom is distracted by troubles of his own  namely a bitter ex-wife, two clingy kids, and, oh yeah: An alien invasion, sparked by the ground-breaking appearance of the ""iPods"". When Tom, his family, and Cindy are forced to flee and find a way to beat the huge, deadly alien-machines, they take a few side-trips.One such trip takes Cindy and her best friend Brenda into The Village, a place where time stands still and the resident blind girl (Carmen Electra) can't find the outhouse. Returnees from Scary Movie 3 include Charlie Sheen (spoofing Bill Pullman The Grudge; turnabout is fair play, so Bill Pullman is also in Scary Movie 4), Simon Rex, Leslie Neilsen as our Commander in Chief, and Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart who've changed their Eight Mile tune to the Brokeback Mountain hoe-down/get down.I was impressed not only by the logical knitting of the story lines (only Brokeback Mountain is forced to fit, but it's okay as a flashback), but by the attention to detail. The sets and set design, especially for The Grudge and Saw, are flawless and even the costumes are perfectly fitted to the characters for each skit.The only bet they really missed was a zombie movie spoof (when Brenda returns from the dead  The Ring curse killed her in Scary Movie 3  it's just glossed over).Despite too much scatological humor (just a personal bias of mine), Scary Movie 4 is a laugh-out-loud funny, well-directed and well-acted comedy that's a perfect kick-off to the summer popcorn season. To say much more would spoil the surprises, so all I'll say is: If you like the Scary Movie franchise, be sure and catch this one on the big screen.",Scary Movie 4

I thought they were gonna have a ton more laughs. But the only ones i got were a few more and the same ones from the commercial. Yes there were some really funny parts unheard of yet. This movie includes: The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, War Of The Worlds, Saw, and parts of Oprah's Show. There are some parts of other movies but you have to watch it. The funny parts are basically sexual humor, at least most of it is, it takes a minute to understand some of it. They really do get the stuff in order, but the movies as always flow with the other movies making it funny. The only weird part is that the Grudge house is right next door to the house from War Of The Worlds which isn't right.

Then came Scary Movie 2, the sequel that focused it's attack on ghosts and evil spirits. Then came Scary Movie 3, the film that proved that nothing (Yes. Nothing) was safe. While these proved to be considerably funny in a demented way, they still were ridiculed by the critics and by some fans who wished they would stop. I was one of these. And upon hearing about the 4th installment to this crazy trilogy, I wasn't inspired to leave my lounge. When I did, however, I saw one of the most comic sequels to have ever been spawned. While the acting was exceptional, the film's 'parodic' sense of humor was officially the main highlights. Yet when we see sequels we have expectations and the expectation of being better than the predecessors has been met. Spoofing many films including 'War Of The Worlds', 'The Grudge', 'Saw' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' this film really proved that nobody is safe from the parody industry, not even Oprah.

224,mistorpotatomoto,"Should've been called ""Pop-Culture References 4"".",2,23 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4 is the fourth installment in a series which started as extremely funny, interesting, and rich with plot, and is now nothing more then a pile of immature fart jokes and physical slapstick.I went into the theatre knowing to catch a crowd of 12 year olds and immature ghetto people. I was not disappointed. The last time I saw this many pre-teens at once was in Middle school. The last time I saw this many ghetto people at once, was when I was stuck in Camden trying to get home as fast as possible.The movie begins with parody of Saw, 2004's hit suspense/thriller. Of course, the parody does the original no justice. The entire prologue amounts to nothing more then a joke everyone has seen in the trailer, where Dr. Phil cuts off his foot to escape from his chains, only to realise that he has cut off the wrong foot. He falls over and the real movie begins. Somewhere in between the Scary Movie 4 logo and the foot scene, I think the writers expected people to laugh.I'm pretty sure there wasn't a plot. If there was, it was so poorly woven together it could easily fool anyone into thinking otherwise. Cindy Campbell(Anna Farris) finds a new job watching after an old lady who cannot care for herself. Little does she know, the house is haunted for some reason. They won't go into why the house is haunted, since that would mean the writers would need decent writing skills, so instead they just skip all of the logic and continue hitting each other with blunt objects.With the exception of Leslie Nielson, the acting is god awful. Even the veterans seem to feel the movie is being drawn out too far. The lines are delivered without enthusiasm or libido. Everyone comes off as an idiot, and rightfully so.Onto the actual humor of the movie...if you can call it that. While the first movie revolved around sexual humor, puns and clever jokes, this one is all about being hit with as many absurd objects as possible. If you find it hilarious when people are smashed in the face with a giant rock, then this might be the movie for you. But even for those few fans, it gets old. Sure, it was nice the first time (although still not funny), but after the 30th time (heck, even after the second time) it's old and played out. Now, when the actors aren't hitting other people with blunt objects or bumbling around like idiots, they're using as much lame sexual innuendo as possible.Yes, we get it, Tom Cruise might be gay. Please, just move on. OK, Brenda is a slut, we understood the first time she said something sexual. Also, what's with the poop humor? Is it really that funny when someone poops in public? It's just bad.In the end, if you're a 12 year old boy or a stupid ghetto person, you will love this movie. Otherwise just save your money.",Scary Movie 4

I have seen the second and third, the second being my personal favorite of the two, with the third not far behind. Scary Movie 4, IS far behind. With about two funny parts in the whole thing, I found it completely ridiculous. They tried to base all of their jokes on spoofs of scary movies, instead of using some that people who haven't seen some of these movies would understand. Plus, if they wanted to use some of the raunchy scenes that they did, they should have given it an R rating and added more to get rid of some of the completely stupid scenes. That 3 star rating is pretty generous in my book, and that is only for the couple times I did laugh. Maybe it was an okay movie, but i went in expecting so much more because of the hilarity of the other scary movies, and this one probably ruined the whole scary movie franchise.

Even though not as good as Scary Movie 3, the two put together certainly covered up a, in my opinion, very poor Scary Movie 2.Most of the ratings I think were badly judged. For English, Irish and even Sweedish ratings say a severe 15+. Only a few things, such as CJ and Manhilk (is that spelt right?!?) in the tent and the Tripod and vacuum cleaner part are to be judged by parents first.

The problem is that its all now just one tired joke. If you've seen Scary Movie, you've effectively seen this. And all the other Scary Movies. And the Airplane films. And the Naked Gun movies. In fact all in all Mr Zucker has made a mint from using the same format repeatedly over god knows how many years and it amazes me how some people aren't finally catching on. The one saving grace in the film probably is Leslie Neilson who does his best, when hes in it, to make a tired format bearable but all in all, though he tries his best it really doesn't make up for the rest.I cant for the life of me whether the cast members that have been in them all are either short of work, desperate for money or just trying to milk this for all its worth, but whichever it is, they really aren't doing themselves or their careers any favours in my opinion. So why a 3? Well, more out of sympathy for Neilson than anything else, who, when given a great and slightly original script, can be one of the funniest men in films.

I like the spoof of Saw at the beginning of the movie when Dr Phil and Shaquille O'Neal are trapped, and Dr Phil has to cut off his foot. But, there is one thing in that scene that I find weird. When Shaq is throwing the rocks in the basketball hoop, and the pipe hits Dr Phil it looks extremely unrealistic. There are some things I like in this movie, whereas there are some that I find very stupid. The ""TriPod"" scene made me jump out of my seat. And - Carmen Electra was a really terrible actress in this movie. Her role may have been quite small, but still she won a Razzie Award for worst actress.

It takes snippets from so called ""serious"" horror movies and strings them together into an incoherent mess, like most horror movies really are.From the opening sequence based on ""Saw"", to the ""War of the Worlds"" story line, or the ""Brokeback Mountain"" with two great black actors, SS4 does not disappoint. The Viagra sequence with Charlie Sheen had tears streaming down my eyes as I tried to control myself. Watch out for Leslie Neilsen as President Bush addressing the ""UN-assembly"" and the Tom Cruise episode at the end.",Scary Movie 4
237,pudgethuggn89,A Collection of Slap-Stick and Dirty Comedy Sequences That Fails To Live Up to its Predecessors,2,15 April 2006,"I went into ""Scary Movie 4"" expecting nothing, and that is exactly what I got. A dirty movie laden with jokes that made me feel like I was back in the year 2000 is what I got. A movie with no plot (which, admittedly, isn't the main objective of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise, but come on, this had nothing) that was like a 5 year old kid trying to do exactly what his ""cooler"" 18 year old brother would do is what I got.From Viagra to pure toilet humor in every sense of the phrase, ""Scary Movie 4"" was an exercise in futility as much as it was a comedy movie. Among the spoofs are the movies ""War of the Worlds,"" ""The Grudge,"" ""Saw,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" (don't ask) and ""The Village."" None of the spoofs are done particularly well, at least compared to the spoofs in ""Scary Movies 1-3"" (the Shaq/Dr. Phil scene that was on TV every five seconds in the weeks before the movie was released was basically the whole scene in itself, and it wasn't even that funny).The only redeeming quality to the movie was the performance of Leslie Nielsen as the President of the United States, and even then, the obvious mocking of the attacks, or response thereof, on 9/11 were in bad taste.""Scary Movie 4"" failed in all aspects. It felt like a failed TV miniseries that is on its last breath. Sometimes, franchises like ""Scary Movie"" need to end their run on a high note, but, unfortunately, with ""Scary Movie 4,"" that cannot be done.",Scary Movie 4
238,scottkellaway5,Surprisingly disappointing,3,23 April 2006,"This installment of the series was not up to the standards of the previous 3. It lacked any real hard hitting humour and was pretty much running on the same old jokes. How many times is it funny to see someone run into something and fall over? The funniest scenes for me was the spoofing of Million dollar baby & Brokeback mountain. There were a few other slightly funny scenes but not many. The trailers for the movie didn't make me want to see it, I thought it was down to adult humour content but it was basically because there weren't many funny scenes to put into them. All in all its worth a watch if your given a free ticket or have a pretty heavily childish sense of humour which enjoys repetition.",Scary Movie 4

That's the question one has to ask after watching this uninspired and predictable 4th installment of the scary movie franchise.While it has its moments in the first few minutes, things afterwards go downhill quickly. The jokes aren't funny most of the time, and many tend to cross the line to bleak vulgarity. While watching, I couldn't avoid the impression that the people responsible for this mess ran out of ideas. It certainly isn't the problem of the films they ridicule. War of the Worlds, The Grudge and The Village, among others, surely offer plenty of vantage points, but sadly, they chose to go for the cheap laughs. While I was enjoying part 1 and 3 of the series (part 2 wasn't that great, either), this one isn't worth sitting through. Leslie Nielsen delivers, as usual, but he's one of the rare redeeming factors here.",Scary Movie 4

How many times can someone being smacked in the face be funny? I really cannot believe that someone has 1) bothered to wake up in the morning to make such rubbish, and 2) actually think that it is going to be funny. Yes its a spoof, but No it isn't funny.

It was funny in some bits but in my opinion it wasn't as good as the other's. The beginning was funny with the doctor & the basketball player and with the president and the duck. The thing that confused me abit was that Brenda was back when you saw her dead in the last instalment of the 'trilogy'. They cover this up with a 'yeah well i thought you were dead to' line. I think that a couple of the best lines were the...'yeah I'm gon put that on Myspace' and 'Your mistaking me for someone who gives a sh*t.' Some of the jokes are more sick humour they make you laugh and cringe at the same time (Opera & Tom.) For anyone-that is going to see it it's worth seeing just to make your own opinions as there are so many mixed ones around. x,Scary Movie 4
242,shakiki,Funny movie with newly-related basis of material,8,14 April 2006,"My friend and I saw this movie tonight and thought it seemed to be pretty funny based on the commercials we'd seen. The movies and events, offhand, that I recall this being based on were The Village, War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Million Dollar Baby (or something like that with boxers), Saw, Tom Cruise events, and some more that I can't quite remember. Unfortunately I hadn't seen The Grudge so a little bit of the movie I couldn't relate to. The same goes for MDB which I hadn't seen but it was short enough where you didn't really need to have seen that one to relate. Village, WW, and Saw scenes were based a lot on those movies which were quite amusing (if you'd seen those movies). If you hadn't seen those and are unfamiliar with them you'd have been a little bit confused. Unfortunately I didn't figure out a way to add a quote from the movie to IMDb but one of my favorite parts was when Brenda and Cindy were in the vehicle and Brenda's sleeping and mumbling ""No, R.Kelly, don't pee on me... in the back and in the front... "". As everyone should know, R. Kelly was in the news for having a pee-on-people turn-on (I don't know the technical term) and 'in the back and in the front' is from My Humps, a song from Black Eyed Peas. Overall this movie was quite amusing in my opinion and I think I may buy it in the future once it's on DVD. -thanks- Suzie",Scary Movie 4

Many tell you not to go in expecting a blockbuster hit, but why shouldn't we? The Exorcist is one of the scariest movies ever made. Decades later many are still haunted my the original picture. Shouldn't we go in to this movie expecting the same? After viewing this movie I can report zero scary scenes and a plot that contains many controdictions (see the bloops section).

I loved the recent Date Movie too and thought it was an hilarious spin off. However, after watching Scary Movie 4, I came away from the film, completely let down. The expectations the previous films had put on me were ripped away. The gags were poor, Anna Farris although still brilliant could not act her way past the poor script writing and even worst the devastatingly bad plot! whereas before we have seen fairly strict rigidity to the spoofed film, the writers aimed to spoof too much and forgot about the plot. Trying to revive gags and characters from the last film did not work.

I have to admit that I laughed out loud a lot throughout the film. The plot involves Cindy Campell, star of all the previous Scary movie films, moving into a new house. But there are bigger problems than the job of house cleaning, as she soon find out her house is haunted by a little boy. To make matters worse, alien ""TrIpods"" are taking over the world. How is she ever going to escape this scenario? Scary movie 4 is filled with laughs, but cheap laughs as you would expect from a Scary Movie film, but it doesn't make it not fun to watch. So if you find yourself bored with nothing to do...why not see a funny flick. Definitely entertaining and will pass the time. My vote for this film is 6 out of 10.",Scary Movie 4

I almost didn't see it but when I saw that Leslie Nielson was returning, I ran to the theater. The funniest parts are at the beginning when Charlie Sheen accidentally takes the whole container of Viagra thinking that they're sleeping pills. Also, it's pretty funny when all the power goes out and the suicide bomber jumps out and nothing happens, then he gets jumped. Mike Tyson as a woman was hysterical and then Don King falling on the little kid from The Grudge. When Tom Ryan puts the gun in his pants and then it fires, i didn't stop laughing. When he shoots the gun in the air and the hang glider comes down that was great. And finally, Rumpleforeskin. The best of the Scary movie series.",Scary Movie 4

Ever since the Wayans Bros left the series, the quality of the movies have gone downhill (although their recent endeavors haven't been anything to cheer about either). The envelope-pushing comedy present in the first two movies has been replaced by family friendly slapstick. I appears to me that the filmmakers were trying to hide the low-quality jokes with a superstar cast. Sorry guys, even Leslie Neilsen couldn't save this one. As far as I'm concerned, the Scary Movie series ended with the second film. 3 out of 10",Scary Movie 4

Scary Movie 1, I'd put up there with the classics like Airplane, the Naked Gun, and Hot Shots part Deux.The sequels haven't been nearly as good, but they are good for a few laughs. Scary Movie 4 is no exception.If you're a fan like I am, you'll be thrilled to see the Scary Movie regulars Anna Faris and Regina Hall (Who have both appeared in all 4 movies)...as well as Scary Movie 3 holdovers Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart.The movie mainly spoofs War of the Worlds, Saw, and The Grudge, but there are a few other movie spoofs that are thrown in for a scene or two, like Brokeback mountain. If you didn't see one of these movies, you won't be too lost, we're talking Scary Movie, not Raging Bull.Some of the jokes lasted a bit too long. Okay I get it...ha ha hurt the kids.I saw this movie during the middle of the week in a theater filled with about six people. Three of the six walked out before it was over. I stayed. I guess they didn't find the jokes as funny as I did.",Scary Movie 4

I saw the trailer and I honestly thought it was going to be very disappointing.*****SPOILER ALERT***** I was wrong, there were lots of good jokes and gags here...some were a bit too repetitive such as head-banging into objects, people, etc.Carmen Elekra made a disappointing comeback in the Scary Movie series with very unfunny toilet humour, it worked ten times better in Dumb & Dumber, and lack of clothing as usual. We've seen it all before...I didn't think the main opening was good for the film at all. It was a very bad start with the cameo from Dr. Phil. I'm glad it picked up better in the film but lost it's steam due to more storyline and less gags.I don't know why but Anna Faris is getting more attractive with every Scary Movie, she looked really nice in this one! There should have been more Leslie Nielsen by far, his scenes were classic, he is the king of Spoofs! I loved his Rumpilstiltskin joke, one of the best! Unlike most fourth instalments, such as Jaws: The Revenge, Superman IV, etc, this movie had pretty decent special effects! The War Of The Worlds scenes especially.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT***** Overall, a very passable sequel but I hope they give the Scary Movie franchise a rest for a while. I think the series got better after the Wayans Brothers opted out after Part II.",Scary Movie 4

Lastly the film has a very good twist at the end which i was very surprised at.Bad Points: Needs more sex, drugs and swearing, It has the same old someone getting hit and thrown all over the place bit boring.Overall I would recommend this film as it is very funny!",Scary Movie 4

Scary Movie 4 sullies name of The Scary Movie/Date Movie franchise. David Zucker has completely lost it. The other Scary Movies are irrelevant to this one. The acting is sub-par and there was practically no plot.Dr. Phil, Shaq, and a butt load of other celebrities make appearances that have nothing to do with the film. Charlie Sheen is a prime example of this occurring.Oh and another thing. The DVD I rented was the ""not rated"" version. I think the reason why it was not rated was because the MPAA was getting too tired of watching this talentless crap. Seriously, this movie is perfect if you are Mormon. Scary Movie 4 is a bunch of caca dookie...oops, did I say a swear word? Even this was more risqué than the language of the movie.",Scary Movie 4

There is not as much of the David Zucker ""one liners"" you would expect, a hint of the Wayans brothers mixed in, and a lot of the jokes run flat. One of the key problems with the film was that they tried to mix too many parodies into it, which took away from the story, and at times seemed just like one big jumble of plot lines and stories.However, having said that I would like to say that there are some hilarious moments and lines in the film which make it worth seeing. Especially if you are a fan of film such as airplane and the naked gun movies, there are still plenty of moments in it. The comedy style of this film is much like Hotshots Part Deux, yet doesn't quite reach the level of genius which that film did",Scary Movie 4

Well, it was (half) possible. Although the overall structure isn't as tight as the other three, the jokes are often still 'fresh' and there's a lot of slapstick, which, although predictable, is still funny! Anna Faris (Cindi), as always, is still on top form, as is Regina Hall (Brenda) and together, they deliver some fantastic comedy. If you're looking for a new, original comedy, perhaps this isn't for you. However, if you're a fan of Scary Movie 1, 2 and 3, then how could you boycott this one?!

Way to easy even for brainless people. The so-called jokes are so simple and the spoofed movies go so quickly by that you don't have time to rethink if that was to lame or maybe a bit funny. Isn't it possible to make a movie like this with some real humor?

It may as well have been called ""lets see how many times people can get hit in the head"". The script was awful, and filled with popculture refereneces that wont even be funny in a month, and parodied movies that aren't even of the horror genre (Brokeback Mountain, Million Dollar Baby). The Saw references were horrible, and the cameos were at a minimum as far as the scary movie series goes. And I don't understand why King Kong is on the poster, he isn't even in the movie.

The whole movie is nothing but a regurgitation of jokes used in SM 3. It might be just me but it seems Hollywood execs are seriously undermining the audiences sense of humor thinking they could use the same slapstick joke 3 times in the movie (and sometimes also three times in a row) and get a laugh every time. However I cant completely bash the movie, there is a Charlie Sheen moment that is quite funny but aside from that, nothing much is. This movie, depending on your sense of humor, provides about 5-10 laughs in total, and the rest of the time you'll be looking around the theater for that one moron who's laughing so you can punch him in the mouth.

I had seen Scary Movie 1 & 2 and thought they were pretty amusing, so when I saw this new one was number 1 at the box office I thought maybe it was good too.I was wrong. There's nothing wrong with lowbrow humor but just about every joke in this movie is about butts or poop. These jokes make up about 10% of the ""Funny Parts"" in the movie. These ""Funny Parts"" are when people get hit in the face with things - from baseballs to car parts to footballs to fists to doors to any other -funny- thing that you can get hit in the face with. Also there's plenty of banging-your-head-on-stuff to go around. Some slapstick is OK in movies I guess, but when the same character gets hit in the head the same way 4 times in one scene, its just annoying. Of the few other jokes in the movie, most are predictable (naked scene) and not funny (oprah scene). There were a *few* laughs in the movie.Don't waste your money on this movie, hitting yourself in the head is a similar but more enjoyable experience.",Scary Movie 4

I laughed hard when I realized they were going do do a remake of the ""Tom Cruise jumps in Oprah Winfrey's lounge"" but my laugh got stuck in my throat quickly as they overdid it.They stretched almost all material too thin.

I am not going to lie it had its moments where i cracked up really hard but it wasn't consistent enough to keep me laughing throughout the whole thing. In scary movie 3 my friends and I would keep rolling off lines for weeks but with this movie we didn't even really talk about it when we got out of the theater.

However, that being said, the Scary Movie's are definitely the leader in that division. Where it lacks in substance and plot it more than makes up for in mindless slap stick and goofiness. I've been watching the franchise since it began, and I was indeed worried with where it was heading. These doubts began shortly after Scary Movie 3, and then multiplied after the disaster that was Date Movie. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting to be wowed whenever I entered the theater, but I have to say that I left pleasantly surprised. If you have seen any of the movies that are spoofed, you're sure to chuckle throughout the movie. If you haven't seen any of the movies, you'll probably laugh all the same. That alone makes it worth watching, because it is something that anyone can enjoy. Unfortunately, there are still some people in the world that absolutely DO NOT enjoy these types of movies. Those people either A. Take themselves WAAAAY too seriously, or B. Have lost the ability to laugh/the will to live. If you don't find yourself under either of those categories, then I believe that you'll find Scary Movie 4 an enjoyable endeavor from the average, mundane, weighted down with heavy issues movies that peoples A and B call ""entertaining"".",Scary Movie 4

The third was just 'okay', I mean I LOVED the opening scene with Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson but the rest was just annoying. And here they decide to make a fourth. My question is 'WHY?'...There's really nothing special or original anymore. Although the first 20-30 minutes of this film were very funny, I HATED the rest. And great, now they're planning a fifth? COME ON! I mean, what are they going to do now? ''House of Wax''? ''Snakes On a Plane''? Okay, now for the 'SCARY MOVIE' fans, don't ignore this one.

While 3, taking the series over from the Wayans, brought back a return to the old Airplane! style of sight gags and fast paced jokes and was at least better than part 2, this one just doesn't go anywhere or have any laugh out loud moments, and seemed a lot longer than it actually was. Most of the jokes involve the actors banging their heads into things, which the Three Stooges did a lot better 70 years ago, and aside from a couple snickers from when Charlie Sheen took the whole bottle of Viagra, I pretty much slept through this junk. And Leslie Nielsen looks like he stepped out of a coffin, he looks terrible. It should no longer be a requirement to put him in movies like this, let the poor guy die already.

And i guess i was right. I, ironically, laughed 4 times (once kind of hard) at Scary Movie 4. The rest was all horrible slapstick comedy, and nothing was clever about the way they made fun of the movies at all (and in some parts, they just re-enacted it).

There definitely was a few gasps when he lost his clothes but it was quite humorous.The story line... was garbled. But what does one expect from a Scary Movie? I think if you focus more on the jokes and less of the story line you'll enjoy this movie much more.The jokes themselves were generally funny. Some of them got a bit repetitive and boring. If you've seen the 3rd scary movie you know that the little boy gets repeatedly hit by things. Its repeated throughout the 4th which was a bit tiring.The parodies included Saw, Brokeback Mountain(this one was particularly funny), The Grudge, The Village, and War of The Worlds. Even if you haven't seen all these movies the jokes are still funny and it isn't hard to catch on to them.My favourite part was the ending. Oprah's wrists... well... my friend and I had a good long laugh over it.All in all it was okay. Some of the jokes were pretty lame but all in all I'm glad I went. For you ladies there's some lookers in this movie so definitely worth the checking out. Gentlemen... girls in bras pillow fighting... I'm sure that'll keep you happy!

Towards the end, the jokes start wearing thin, and you can tell the actors are trying real hard to make the dialog work. Sometimes, they succeed with delivering punchlines to the ""T"". This movie is very funny for anyone who can enjoy a funny take on recent films, than you should enjoy this without a problem. Just don't expect Shakespearian comedy and you should be fine.",Scary Movie 4

Overall, I did like the movie. Not as much as the others, but I did like it.I would like the film to be more raunchy. Ever since the third one they've been more tame, more boring. A lot of it is just people getting hit on/in the face, head or nads. I don't know how so many people say this one is funnier than the others, because I left the movie theater more disappointed than happy. Sure, Carmen Elektra getting the squirts in the church was hilarious, and Lil Jon's cameo was also funny, but I think this film had the potential to be much funnier and more dirty than it was.",Scary Movie 4

OK this film was worth the £4.20 I paid to see it, but not worth the extra calories I burned off to get to the cinema! The film does however contain some rather humorous puns, which all some how match together to form some kind of plot! The acting in parts is laughable which helps towards the films humorous edge (whether intended or not). The types of shots used in this film are also very limited so the film does not experiment at all! Overall this film is OK for a laugh or not but nothing of any value. Previous Scary Movies are better a recommend just going to your nearest rental place and renting a previous one!",Scary Movie 4

This simple statistic saddens me, because society is practically oblivious to the fact that these movies are atrocities, disasters, vulgar, wretched, pointless and quite simply...just plain awful. This time around, the series turns its attention to The Grudge, Saw I and II,War of the Worlds, The Village and er....Brokeback Mountain???? Cue lame one-liners, vile slapstick humor, pointless celebrity cameos and more clichés than you could ever dream of. What angers me the most is that this series is resurrected time after time, causing the innocent, Scary Movie debutants to waste their hard earned 7 euro on this tripe.

I only jumped once, when the little boy appeared in the window of Cindys car.

I felt like all of the moderately funny parts were in the preview. During the movie I found myself waiting for something to laugh at. I thought that it was neat that they included a lot of other well known faces and names. However, their acting was not the best. I could have definitely waited until it came out on video instead of paying $8.00 to see it. I would recommend to anyone who likes to save a few bucks to wait until it comes out on video.

What lets this film down is the saw parody. The opening scene and the following saw parody falls flat on its face and completely misses the mark. Also the film feels very short and ends very suddenly, but having James Earl Jones getting run over makes up for that (lol). Overall not a comedy masterclass, but still a clever parody. The downside is that the lack of current horror films may hint that this series has gone on long enough, lots of this film does parody other non-horror films such as Brokeback Mountain.

Although this film did produce some genuine laughs, there were too few to make anything out of, which as a real shame. The acting was bad and there failed to be any reasonable plot what-so-ever. I think we are due a new main character now rather than ""Cindy Campbell"" in every film.. with that same, old gormless personality .

Let's just say that the trailer contained just about every funny moment in the entire movie. Shaq and Dr. Phil may have been the best part of the film. Which is a lot like saying that flushing the toilet is the best part of throwing up. The spoofs are mostly obvious and lack any kind of wit. Most of the jokes revolve around either gay references (mostly brokeback mountain tributes), naked ugly people or loud and public low-altitude bombing runs (bowel movements for the uninitiated). Maybe this movie holds my attention for 30 seconds if I was drunk or stoned, but sober it was a total waste of time. I'd say that you shouldn't see this flick but it's a lot like ordering food that tastes so bad that you're compelled to share it. So, go see this ASAP.

Not only is the plot full of holes, but it doesn't gel well between the spoofs, i mean come on! The Grudge, War of the Worlds, The village and Saw...WTF...not only have they taken films from totally different areas of the horror genre but they have clearly mashed them together purely because they were big at the time (although i think most would agree with me when i say The Village and The Grudge were hardly good films) The acting is standard for this type of spoof films and i have no problem with the actors, what i do have a problem with is the script that i could have written in half an hour tripping on acid! This film does not live up to the expectations raised by the first one, which was excellent and actually funny. While watching the fourth i didn't laugh once.

Leslie Nielson- Well, i've seen him in 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun', so i knew he was a natural comedian and despite being old he's still got it. Negatives: Crude- Extremely. The bit where the blonde girl rubs urine on the old lady. Was that really necessary? Was that funny? If we find it funny then society's got a big problem. It wasn't funny. Smple as that. It didn't crack the audience up, it just made us squirm in our seats. The Brokeback Mountain scene. Funny at first, but then like many of the jokes just got over the top and turned disturbing. repetitive.- How many times did someone hit their head on something? It's only funny once in a while! Not really a film to see at the cinema- Well, it was worse for me because Chelsea had just lost to Liverpool so i found it hard to laugh.

This will not become a classic like Airplane! (same co director) or Blazing Saddles. The first 30 minutes try so hard to get a laugh that it even borrows from some of Zucker's past films. While the rest of it may not be as funny as the classics I listed above, its definitely the funniest modern movie I have seen in a long time (Mind you, I haven't seen any of the other Scary Movies, so I wouldn't know if the previous are funnier).All that said, there isn't really much of a plot here. It's pretty much a series of sketches spoofing The War of the Worlds, The Village, and Saw; all strung together to form a story line that isn't very coherent. Sometimes it basically copies a scene and throws in some fart jokes. That's all I'm going to give away, as probably the reason that I enjoyed it so much is that I had not seen any trailers for this.",Scary Movie 4

The effects in the movie are good and the lampooning is not awful but the comedy is something America threw out five years ago, lets hit someone in the head or make a joke about farting....lets not!Its a shame that Zucker and Neilson would throw something this bad out because both air plane and the naked gun are genius.

Haha, it not only contained scary movies, but Brokeback mountain, and the Tom cruise Oprah show incident. and what made me laugh the most was the Japanese spoken in The Grudge scene. The plot also made sense, it was a little all over the place, but not bad at all. Dr. Phil was good, well he only acted for like 3 minutes. One thing is that no one can beat Dakota Fanning's screams.

298,nobles-3,So bad it made me angry,1,18 April 2006,"I just got back from the theater short the ridiculous ticket prices charged these days, and felt like I lost more than money. 'Scary Movie 4' is god-awful. I am a big fan of dumb, spoof movies like 'Hot Shots: Part Deux' and 'Wrongfully Accused'. Even 'Scary Movie 3' earned my endorsement. So naturally, I had high hopes since the third movie gave this lackluster series some momentum. Boy, was I wrong. Not only does 4 not live up to the third, it puts the Scary Movie name at a worse status than it was after the first two.Instead of taking a note from the third, it goes back to the crude humor of the first two movies and doesn't even do that well. I don't know what it is about these guys that makes them mistake gagging noises from the audience for laughter. Honestly, I think they try to gross people out more than make them laugh. Then again, toilet humor has been done right plenty of times in other movies - but that fact just makes this movie's failure more catastrophic.Outside of writing that outdoes the Wayans Brothers in suckedness (In Living Color was the last documented moment these guys were funny), the overall production is poor. The CGI special effects are worse than movies from 1995, and the film quality even bothered me somehow. Leslie Nielson is one bright-spot (albeit dim) in the film, but thats unfair because its impossible for him to not be funny. Tom Ryan is forgettable and the actress who is a constant in the series is, once again, NOT FUNNY. Once this film is released on DVD, the goof-ups section of IMDb will absolutely light up, if people even bother.When *HUGE* target movies like 'The War of the Worlds', 'Brokeback Mountain', and 'The Grudge' are so severely missed with an almost too-easy opportunity, this movie deserves to be slammed for 10 more paragraphs, but hopefully a point has been made. Don't. see. this. movie. (!!!!) Go play with abandoned refrigerators instead or something.",Scary Movie 4
299,burnc,Funny for the most part.,10,14 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4 had a ton of potential. With movies such as Saw 1&2, The Village, The Grudge and War of the Worlds, there was a lot of material that could have been used for parodies. This movie delivered plenty of small gags, but I couldn't help thinking while I watched it that there could have been some really big ones.Anna Faris is back as the hopelessly clueless Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks. Both are great in their roles, Faris in particular, though I have my doubts whether they would return for a Scary Movie 5. Leslie Neilson is completely underused. Charlie Sheen and Carmen Electra have small roles, but both are hilarious.Scary Movie 4 has some good laughs, mostly relating to the Saw spoofs. Having Cindy Campell spoof Hilary Swank's character in Million Dollar Baby was fantastic, that whole scene (plus the great Oprah / Tom Cruise spoof at the end) was the highpoint of the film.While it might not be the best Scary Movie of the four, Scary Movie 4 certainly isn't the worst.",Scary Movie 4
300,j-douglasbagley,Reassuringly Funny,5,24 April 2006,"Having seen all three previous Scary Movies I was well informed as to what to expect from the film, yet I wasn't at all bored with the film. I found my self chuckling out loud for the entirety of the movie. Some of the gags in the film were really quite funny, especially the Brokeback Mountain sketch between ""Mahalik"" and ""CJ"" was particularly funny. some of the apparently off the cuff humour was really quite enjoyable to watch including the banter between the above characters. Anna Faris was on usual form fulfilling her role as the ""female title fight boxer"", her missing swing at female opponent ""Mike Tyson""(busy biting ears) causing nearly everyone involved in the fight and the crowd, to almost majestically, break their necks, leaving Cindy distraught and full of guilt. The overall length of the movie was quite short but I felt that it was just the right time, any longer and perhaps my interest would have been lost. The Tom Cruise character in the film was OK but his face was rather annoying sometimes, and they even managed to get in a contractual Michael Jackson kiddie fiddler crack. Overall I thought the performances were good and was a quality addition to the Scary Movie franchise.",Scary Movie 4
301,hamiltonz07,one of the worst I've seen...,2,26 April 2006,Went in with hopes of a decent watchable movie.I counted this movie having three great hits but a ridiculous amount of unnecessary and plain stupid misses. Dr.Phil and Shaq? What the hell is that?!?!? It is a thoughtless movie with thoughtless jokes and zero laughs for any body with a reasonable amount of maturity. Special FX put on the slapstick humor make the movie seem like a silly cartoon where characters bounce around uncontrollably rather than a comedy.I loved all the previous scary movies but this one is worse than mediocre. Without a doubt thats $5 and an hour and half wasted. Contains stupid celebrity cameos and reuses jokes that aren't even funny. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.,Scary Movie 4
302,dozenwanna2,guess who dropped the ball,6,16 April 2006,"perhaps a six is a bit harsh, but in light of the previous installments in this series i expected more than what 'scary movie 4' delivered. these are not unrealistic expectations, they managed to deliver on three previous movies. what bothered me the most about this movie was that i felt like none of the writers were really trying. instead of playing with cultural stereotypes to poke fun at those who subscribe to them, this movie seemed to buy into every cliché and tired caricature available. previous movies in this series managed to skewer racial stereotypes by both poking fun of racially attributed characteristics previously ignored. it's hard to explain why without proper context, but somehow when the main black female was stabbed to death by the entire movie theater for chatting on her cell. during a movie it is both a humorous homage to jada pinkett's death in 'scream 2' and a play on racial myths. 'scary movie 1-3' knew where the line was that separated 'all in the family' and 'strangers with candy' from those advocating racial stereotypes. now, two days after seeing the latest, and probably last, in the franchise i am still at a loss for why it was so funny that brenda was, well, hmmm, brenda played the ho. don't get me wrong, in the movie before this one there is that great scene where she details what makes for a proper pounding...in front of a classroom of six to eight year olds. but her sex drive was not the sum of her character. at least it wasn't before the most recent.",Scary Movie 4
303,lesleyshaheen,"i'll show you, i'll really like this movie",10,16 April 2006,"come on people, give me a break. you gave this movie a six out of ten? what, were you honestly surprised by the potty humor and slapstick-t&a jokes? i saw this movie Friday, after one of the cruddiest days in a while, and laughed my ass off the whole time. here's why, old people are funny, small children are annoying, watching chicks get smacked around releases some sublimated desire inside all of us, and white people are stupid and black people are unpredictable and just a little dangerous. is this movie base, derivative, insulting to our intelligence, and appealing to the lowest common denominator...hell yes. and is it funny, OH HELL YES. the only complaint i have for this movie is that it does not have the quick turnaround of its predecessors. previous installments in this series appeared to spoof what must have been dailies when the ""scary movie"" team got their hands on 'em. forget current, these movies were practically nostalgic for the present. 'scary movie 4,' not so topical. jokes about the first 'saw,' 'the village,' and 'the grudge,' very much yesterday's joke. oh yeah, and not enough brenda, that girl is funny.",Scary Movie 4
304,jonesielanglotz,Scary....funny....cool...hot,7,28 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4 I had heard the buzz about this film being a bit crappy, but had to go check it out anyways. I have to admit that I laughed out loud a lot throughout the film. The plot involves Cindy Campell, star of all the previous Scary movie films, moving into a new house. But there are bigger problems than the job of house cleaning, as she soon find out her house is haunted by a little boy. To make matters worse, alien ""TrIpods"" are taking over the world. How is she ever going to escape this scenario? Scary movie 4 is filled with laughs, but cheap laughs as you would expect from a Scary Movie film, but it doesn't make it not fun to watch. So if you find yourself bored with nothing to do...why not see a funny flick. Definitely entertaining and will pass the time.",Scary Movie 4
305,lillithmaximus,Quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen...,10,15 April 2006,"I didn't like Scary Movie 3 nearly as much as the first two, mostly because of the lack of Wayans influence, but part four was simply outright hilarious. The tour of the house (spoofing ""The Grudge"") had me in crying laughter hysterics. I loved all of the ""crazy Tom Cruise"" pokes as well. HIGHLY recommended, especially if you enjoyed part three, or Date Movie, for that matter.10 lines. Wow. I don't want to ruin the movie that much.The graphics for the War of the Worlds spoof were great. And I didn't even realize that Dane Cook was the voice of Jigsaw, so hey, one more reason to see this thing.",Scary Movie 4
306,sj-59,Hits all the wrong notes.,3,14 April 2006,"After the first ""Scary Movie"", I was hysterical. The brilliant spoof highlighted some of the movies that I personally hated. This made the humor hilarious. There was some slapstick, but not enough to turn you away. ""Scary Movie 2"" had some funny moments from the first real scary movie, the Exorcist. Little more slapstick, but good slapstick. ""Scary Movie 3"" got good performances from Anna Faris and Charlie Sheen. An average film that I enjoyed the first couple of times. ""Scary Movie 4"" is horrible. Taking from ""Grudge"" and ""War of the Worlds"" it takes all of the OK moments from those movies and makes them crummy slapstick. I shuttered every time some teenagers laughed at the inane jokes. (Inane look it up) Anna Faris shouldn't have settled for this horrid script. It delivers a few laughs from the ""Saw"" parodies. The rest of the movie (which is quite short) is blur of people running into walls and falling down stairs. The worst Scary Movie yet. It can't deliver. They try too hard. To make up for this, Scary Movie 5 needs to be a comedy that is dirty like the first two. Stay away from this one. I give it a 3 out of 10.",Scary Movie 4
307,miaadotcomx3,best movie,9,15 April 2006,"I'm a huge fan of the whole 'scary movie' series. this was an absolutely hilarious and successful add to that group. the jokes were fresh, original, and not to mention hilarious. I'm not one to laugh out loud (im a silent laugher) but this movie had me slapping my knee. the story line was great and the spoofs were awesome. the opening scene was already side splitting and i was grinning knowing that i had so much more of this to go. the re-appearances of certain characters such as Cindy, Brenda, and CJ was great and the new characters introduced gave the movie a little something extra.This is definitely worth going to the movies for. a must see!",Scary Movie 4
308,tjohnsond,It was alright,4,14 April 2006,"Both the comedy and plot of the movie was mediocre in Scary Movie 4.This movie is better than Scary Movie 3 without a doubt - that was awful (in my opinion). The first scenes are pretty funny especially the brief Charlie Sheen scene in the beginning. The movie was alright - I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the 1st and 2nd Scary Movie films.It's kind of weird but the comedy was not original, it was sort of expected in the movie. Like the ending, I was expecting some torture device that did something weird. I liked how the Wayans brothers did it - it was original, different and nothing you expected. With this film, you expect this type of humor from a friend and you can perdict it in this film. I really think they need a new writer for the next Scary Movie films.",Scary Movie 4
309,derrickdude85,If you want to see!!!,8,14 April 2006,"Okay, pretty good movie, a lot of funny spoofs. Although, if you have not seen certain movies, scary movie 4 won't make much sense and making it not as funny. Here are the movies you should see: War of the Worlds, Saw I or II, The Grudge, and The Village. These should make the movie a success for you. Oh if you like Dane Cook, the character JIGSAW is played by him, so keep that in mind! Okay, not the greatest plot, but it's just another ""Scary Movie"", so just try to enjoy and don't put to much into understanding what is going on. It has the traditional ""Scary Movie"" plot, and even Brenda comes back (Don't ask how, I don't know, nor do I think anyone does.) If you liked the other ""Scary Movies"" this movie is for you and it is about what you would expect.",Scary Movie 4
310,havoccs,Not as good as SM3 but okay.,6,14 April 2006,"Well this movie seemed kind of childish. Scary Movie 3 was defiantly a much better movie. Also everything happened to fast and the plot was weak. Really the only funny part was when Anthony Andersen's guy and ""CJ"" have another argument about zombies this time just like they did in SM3. It was worth seeing but not the best comedy ever. Spoofing SAW and SAW 2 was a very good idea but it should have been in the movie a lot more. They also used too much spoofing of ""The Village"". That wasn't a very good movie and it didn't turn out well in this movie. Most of the movies they did make fun of were pretty good. SM4 was an overall half good movie.",Scary Movie 4
311,pillow1,Disappointment,3,14 April 2006,"well compared to all the other scary movies, this one was the worst. They couldn't seem to keep the plot on one string, and the jokes were rather lacking from even the third movie which in my opinion was the worst before now. I guess Scary Movie's will never be the same due to the new company putting them out. The actors are good like always, but they try to be comical instead of trying to make the movies seem serious (which in my opinion is why the first 2 were so good). But if you are a scary movie fan you have to see this, just don't expect to laugh even 1/10th as much as the others. Even the horrible Date Movie which recently came out was in my opinion better. I fear this is the last movie of the series, and a bad way to go out.",Scary Movie 4

I saw this movie an hour ago, and got exactly what I went to see out of it. I went to watch ""War of the Worlds"" and ""The Grudge"" spoofed good and proper. I shelled out good money to see both of those bombs. I wanted badly to see Dr. Phil and Tom Cruise spoofed. I was not disappointed. The Cruise terd had the scientology South Park episode pulled at the last moment, and Dr. Phil ovulates, I swear it. I went to watch a spoof, and a spoof is what was delivered, along with the usual urine, fart, and potty humor one would expect. I do miss the Wayans brothers though,...absent since Scary Movie 2.

The movie included more humor and less storyline. Being personally a fan of horror films, as well as this series, i found it to be a bit lacking in the explanation the events. I do admit i loved this film, however, I found it quite humorous. If the main storyline had been a little more explained and better detailed i would have absolutely loved this movie. I am a big fan of the series and would love to see more, although i hope they include more of saw, i would love to see it spoofed a little extra. Well, thats all i have to say, if you'd like to know more...you should go see it! Chow!!",Scary Movie 4
315,anna_koss,okay,6,15 April 2006,"movie was okay, but casting on this site shows dane cook as the part of jigsaw, however he is not in the movie, or in closing credits after movie at all. also, movie had a confusing plot then ended quickly, as if writers of the script ran out of ideas and just decided to end it. not quite as good as the previous ones before this, but not a total waste of money to spend if you decide to go see it. this viewer went to see it at a drive in on April 15, 2006. saw this along with failure to launch and failure to launch was much better especially for those of you who like chick flicks rather than parody movies. also, how does Brenda always end up in each one of the scary movie films if she dies in everyone?",Scary Movie 4
316,MistressMeercat,A disappointment,3,16 April 2006,"After the first three movies, all of which had me crying with laughter, I was expecting a masterpiece, a final comedic hit to complete the ""trilogy."" I was to be sorely let down. This is one of the many films which chooses to display not just the best parts in the trailer, but the only good parts. I found this film unrealistic and mediocre, embarrassing at parts. A large problem was that there was a tendency to go over the top, the Viagra scene, would, in my opinion, have been quite funny if his erection had been a normal size, funny is often something people can relate to, I doubt many can relate to a 3 foot erection being attacked by a cat. Brenda's return from the dead was unnecessary and again, unrealistic, a scene flashed into my mind of her claiming to be like Jesus risen from the dead, the kind of humour in bad taste that I find amusing, instead, the miracle was explained with a pathetic, 'Yeah, I thought you were dead too.' Many of the few moments of real humour were created by the skill of the actors and not by the script, such as the facial expressions of the smaller man in the 'Brokeback Mountain' spoof. I would not recommend seeing this film, with cinema prices as they are, it's a waste of money.",Scary Movie 4
317,hackzor12,it was horrible because....,2,17 April 2006,"This was just a genuinely horrible movie, it was fit to entertain an 8 year old and the comic edge just wasn't there. I'm not one to rag on a movie for being stupid, I am a huge fan of the original Scary Movie, and American Pie type films. The jokes were ""cheap"" (seems to be a common term used to describe the humor in this movie) and just frankly not funny. The Brokeback parody was just awkward and you can only hit someone in the head so many times before its just obnoxious. I don't consider myself an incredible intellectual but this film was just mind numbing and you really want it to be good because you paid 8 bucks to see it. With so many great films out right now, don't see this one. I recommend Inside Man, Lucky Number Slevin, and Thank You For Smoking, all which I thought were great and highly entertaining.

It's one of those films where you have to just give in to that inner child and laugh at all the things that you always used to. Well worth seeing if you can be like that, if your a snotty idiot who will stick your nose up at the slightest immaturity then id say don't bother. Had me in stitches through most of it. you also get a free awful love story thrown in with all the fun.

Some no doubt are better than others, they contain a quick satiracle wit and mocked all the classics. Now Scary Movie has run out of movies to mock and choose about three in the entire film. The film was terrible, all of the characters were terrible, I'm sorry but trying create even the stupidest comedy, you need characters that people will not hate. The leading man and woman were terrible and completely awful. The majority of the film was lame! This is a cash grab, a production merely made to see how much they could get out of the cow-eyed movie going public. ""Hey, other scary movies funny, lets see this one."" Gar.. definitely save the cash. If you must see it, get a friend to foot the bill. blah.",Scary Movie 4

There were only a few kneeslappers in this movie, and being a comedy, it did not work for me. My favorite seen was the beginning parody of saw with dr. phil and shaq..If the movie was more like that maybe it would have been worth while to watch it. I thought these jokes were more stupid than funny..the best part for me was the fact that it was only an hour and 15 minutes. Basically, a three year old could make a better film. I would have actually rather went to watch ice age the meltdown, i mean at least the movie has an actual plot. My opinion is, if you are a scary movie fan, wait for it to come out on video, and don't waste 15 bucks at the movie theaters.",Scary Movie 4

I found the same stupid jokes in this one as you find in the previous one, but they were just not as funny. I sat through the entire moving hoping that I would get to see something that made me laugh really hard, but I could not find anything. I also went in to this movie expecting to laugh the entire time. IF you decide to see it, try to wait for the DVD release so you can rent it and spend the money you save on seeing something GOOD in the theater.

To me this film was a utter disappointment but you can only expect so much really, i know now that if more come out and somebody suggests going to see it to save my money.

The spoofs a good, they are actually a lot like the movies themselves. They stick with the original stories well, not completely destroying them. A lot, lot of physical humor. Some gross stuff, but hey, thats why it's funny. If you liked Scary Movie 3, you will like this. I think it is kidna funnier. It runs a little smoother.

This movie will definitely make you laugh, and doesn't ""kill it"" all that much. If you're parody fan, you'll absolutely appreciate this movie. Better than all the other ones- FOR SURE ** There are a series of combinations, and a nice bundle of flicks involved. The only disappointment however, was the opening. I believe all ""Scary Movies"" have a ( I would say, about a) 5:00 minute introduction before the title is displayed. Part 1 had the Drew Barrymore/ Scream parody, and the i think it was the second one that had the Excorcist; with the perverted priest, and spewing of the green sh*t everywhere. In my opinion, after the opening introduction with the Excorcist in that movie, it was all down hill from there. Unlike scary movie 4. The intro has Dr Phil, and Shaq (WTF?!_), and no, it wasn't funny at all. I thought to myself "" F**k you Wayans bros'!"", but to my surprise, the movie picked up really well, and had me laughing the whole way through.",Scary Movie 4

David Zucker has not captured what Keenen Ivory Wayans thought of when the first two movies were brought about. they had one main movie spoof with only minor jokes with other movies and shows. the past two scary moves hasn't caught the magic of the previous ones before them. this new scary movie was almost like date movie which was also a waste of my time.",Scary Movie 4

Even though incredibly disturbing, it was portrayed in such a hilarious way. The humor is unrelentless and I found myself laughing so hard I almost cried at one scene where the little Japanese kid has a conversation with the main character in Japanese. Starting with, ""Hello?

This movie follows the others in the series of scary movies with being able to completely make fun of different scary movies. The scary movies being made fun of this time include War of the Worlds, The Grudge, Brokeback Mountain, Saw, Million Dollar Baby, and The Village. There are also guest appearances by The President(not the real one), Dr. Phil, Micheal Jackson, Jigsaw, and Oprah. We meet many new characters in this movie and must say goodbye to two from scary movie three. This movie is not for everyone especially children under fourteen.

It was more like an 80-minute live action Family Guy, with random references to pop icons and events that had no relation to the storyline whatsoever. And while Family Guy strings these little clips together to make an actual story, Scary Movie 4 doesn't. By inserting a few references to Oprah, and...wait, the jokes were so irrelevant I can't even remember any others. Don't pay $7 to see this movie, please. It will only encourage them to create a new Scary Movie, one that will be the exact same as this one. If you were a fan of the first three Scary Movies, you will be horribly disappointed. If you didn't think the first three were funny, maybe you'll like this one, because it isn't funny.",Scary Movie 4

I did not care for War of the worlds, I thought they totally destroyed a very good story / Concept when they created that movie, but made it worse by trying to make fun of it in SM4. The village was poorly done start with and to incorporate that into another movie was disappointing.With all the possible content out there, they came up with this. No thank you! Did not think any part of it was funny, a great many of the jokes were already done, maybe I am looking for something fresh and not tired or the same old humor.",Scary Movie 4

When I saw it it was hilarious but kind of badly done. Scary movie 1 for being the first one was OK, the second one was good and the third one was the best because usually directors tend to make the last movie really good. I have not a doubt, it is hilarious, but as someone else said, it has cheap laughs, the running and hitting yourself thing is old but it's funny.

After a few times of hearing the joke though, it can get boring. Especially when you hear it again and again. Well thats what Scary Movie 4 is about: Repetitive old jokes. Being a big fan of Scary Movie films, I started watching the film with high hopes, unaware they were to be soon shattered.Once again, the film takes a more comical side like Scary Movie 3 did, rather than the ""Teen"" side used in 1 and 2. Though instead of being funny ( which 3 was ) its not. They blow EVERYTHING out of proportion thinking it would make the film funny, however fail horribly: it makes it annoying and you will begging for the film to end. A perfect example is the very last scene.Some may love it, some may hate it. I hate it. To me, Scary Movie films only got better till No. 4 was made.",Scary Movie 4

Whereas Scary Movie 3 had 9 different movies that it parodied and it was a lot more enjoyable. The whole series is kind of retarded but the fourth one was a waste of money.......They should have used Shaq and Dr. Phil a lot more since they had them there anyway....... They were only used for about 5 minutes in the beginning.

I knew it as soon as I sat down and there was a computer animated segment of tiny cells and bacteria dancing around with large breasts to upbeat music... the camera angle then zoomed out to review a man scratching his crotch.That basically sums up the quality of the film.The plot was jumbled and tried to span too many films... and it did none of them very well. 'The Village' spoof was the least funny of all... the talents of Chris Elliott were wasted in such a pathetic part as he got, and try as he did to make it funny, it fell short of any such praise. On the whole, the film was nothing but cheap gags and sitcom-grade sexual innuendos. For the life of me I can not understand why actors like Leslie Nielson and Charlies Sheen still sign on for this manner of rubbish! The series should have ended with the Wayans Brothers' leadership.The film garnishes a solid ""F"" ranking. I will NOT see any more films in the series, should they continues to produce them... and lets hope that they don't.

347,plantain,Jim and David are making spoof again ! Huzzah !,9,20 April 2006,"""Million dollar baby"" left me seriously depressed for at least 2 days. The ""Million dollar baby"" spoof scene in ""scary movie 4"" left me laughing so hard - that I had to look away because I wasn't able to breath. I can actually say that was the hardest I ever laughed.Nothing about that scene was clever, sophisticated or even in good taste. It simply regarded an element that troubled me in the original film. Jim Abrahams & Craig Mazin made it funny. David Zucker gave it life.In my opinion, this is the stuff that makes an excellent parody: It takes our own insights about movies and turn into something exaggerated and funny for everyone to see. This is the stuff that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is all about. This is the stuff that made Jim Abrahams & the Zuckers movies to be the funniest ever (In my opinion).A sense of humor is critically unique. Some people won't get it, and that's OK - it doesn't make them stupid (humor is something rather stupid by definition).But, if you're a fan of MST3K, and if you quote to this day lines from ""Airplane"", ""top secret"" and ""Kentucky fried movie"" - I recommend you do the following: First, Make sure you see ALL of the SM4 spoofed movies; no matter how silly they are (They're quite fine), it will be worthwhile. Second, lower you expectations (!) and finally go and see Scary movie 4.Scary movie 4 isn't really a nine stars movie. My personal experience made it worth nine stars, because it hit the spot for me. Most of the time, it is immature, childish and in short: not very witty. But that's something I'm able to tolerate, because if you share my taste in humor, you already know that really funny comedies are, sadly, extremely rare.",Scary Movie 4
348,YippeeKiYay327,Funniest of the Series,4,18 April 2006,"I saw this movie the 1st day it came out in America, which was Friday. This was the first surprise of the year. It was the first time, since Wedding Crashers, that I laughed so hard in the theaters. In the film we join many special appearances like Dr. Phil, Shaq, Bill Pullman, Carmen Electra, Chris Elliot, and even a brief cameo by Charlie Sheen. But we rejoin the character Cindy played by Anna Farris, we also rejoin Regina Hall as Brenda, who died in the last film, but somehow is always recommended. The movies they spoof are War of the Worlds, The Village, Saw, and The Grudge. They also have parodies on Million Dollar baby and Brokeback Mountain, but they are irrelevant to the plot. But I really shouldn't say that because the point of these movies are to be random, and totally be off topic. Craig Bierko, who plays Tom Ryan(Cindy's new love), is a very funny, and a good role. I don't want to give much more away. I want everyone to go this movie, and be unaware of the jokes they throw at you. I strongly recommend this movie for fans of the ""Scary Movie"" series, and to people with a special sense-of-humor, what I mean is people who laugh at immaturity and really funny bathroom humor.

Scary Movie 4 was an OK film, sure, it was funny, in places, I'm not going to deny that, but, it just seemed to be missing that special ingredient that made the first 2 so funny.I found myself almost bored about half an hour into the film, and I think that the only reasons that I didn't walk out of the cinema were that I had a friend with me, I had paid for the ticket (I can't help being cheapskate!!) and I had faith that it would get better...Faith counted for nothing, I guess, because it didn't really get any better.",Scary Movie 4

And don't even get me started on the acting. When Shaq does the best performance in the movie, you know you're in trouble.The amount of humor in this movie was slim to none.

The first two movies did this well, and the third for the most part except when it got stupid at the end and the kid got hit with an object for the 500000000000th time.

Buuut I didn't, and it ended up being the most painful experience ever. I don't even know what else to say except that if you want to completely waste ten bucks and an hour and a half of your life that you'll never be able to get back, then see Scary Movie 4. And then punch yourself in the face a bunch of times, because you'll see that happen maybe 47 times throughout the course of the movie. Awesome. Really though, I'm not sure who comes up with some of the jokes for these movies, but whoever they are should be proud of themselves. President Bush jokes were funny like 6 years ago. Leslie Neilsen was funny 26 years ago. Making fun of Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch is a bit redundant. I think I laughed once during the entire movie. But it wasn't at the movie, it was at the people around me falling over on the floors at the joke about the...well, I won't spoil the surprise. You'll see. You should anyway, great movie.

One of the best parts was the dialogue and scene between Anna Farris' character and the ""Grudge"" boy.Regina Hall returning as Cindy Campbell's sex-crazed sidekick Brenda is memorable. Farris' character, however, relies too much on very dry humor, which at times can get annoying. I really wish that the Wayans still had some to do with the Scary Movie franchise.

I just want to tell everyone I'm a huge fan of the Scary Movie series's and this movie is a great collection to the bunch. If you liked Scary Movie 3 then you will definitely enjoy this one because it is based around the same type of humor not saying it leaves out Scary Movie 1, and 2 humor but it is still not as ""Sexual"" as Scary Movie 1, and 2 but there is more in Scary Movie 4 then there was in 3.

The rest of the movie, however, was full of fart, poop and jokes that pertain to bodily functions.The movie can be plain gross at times because it relies on so much toilet humor. Washing an elderly woman with her own urine is not exactly funny, but is pretty nasty. The lowest point of the movie comes in the form of an extended poop sequence. The audience does not know whether to sit there and take it or get up and leave and risk being recognized by someone they know.",Scary Movie 4
359,perpetuallynakedchloe,Scary Movie 4 is generally a bore,3,30 April 2006,"Scary Movie 4 left much to be desired. Grand total of genuine laughs: 3. Fart jokes just were never that funny to begin with, neither was seeing people get hit with miscellaneous objects every 4 seconds (approximately) for an entire hour and 20 minutes. Scary Movie 4 takes that sort of cheap humor to another level. Or perhaps just the natural level for a sequel to ""scary movie."" I mean, in earnest, it isn't even the level of humor that is the problem, but rather the monotony of it all. Fart joke, someone gets hit with blunt object, fart joke, pee-washing scene, another blunt object hits someone, someone gets kicked in the balls, poop joke. It all just becomes the same joke over and over and over and over again. See, i feel sad in side because this sort of satire could really have some potential if the real hilarity wasn't so overshadowed by the disproportionate amount of really dumb jokes that would best appeal to 10-yr-olds (who, incidentally, are not allowed to see the movie). For example, a real laugh could occur at the point in the movie when the dim-witted President ignores a global alien attack in order to listen to a children's' story. This sort of mocking is actually funny. Now when the next couple of scenes contain about 25 instances of people being hit with things, and three fart/poop/gross-out jokes, any substance the film actually had is washed away - or shall i say clubbed to death by blunt objects. At about 3 or 4 points in the movie i was so disgusted that i just wanted it to end! It was, quite literally, a waste of my life. Please, for your own good, heed my warning and do not waste an hour and 20 minutes of your life on something that is not, even in its most glorified form, entertaining or funny. If you have already seen it, i feel your pain.",Scary Movie 4
360,dts29,Waynes Bros. Are Comedy Kings.,1,4 May 2006,"First of all this movie wasn't funny. This movie series is just going to keep on trying to make money by adding idiotic scenes that happen in our world and put together to make a stupid movie. Come to think of it, they should of just called part 3 and 4 of scary movie as stupid movie, cos they were not funny at all but just plain stupid. As for the waynes brothers they ACTUALLY used scenes from horror movies and innovated them into comical masterpieces. Also I think Smokey (Marlon Waynes) stoled the show for the scary movie first 2 movies, Cos that guy was just hilarious. When I found out Smokey wasn't gonna be in the 3rd part I knew the movie wasn't going to be as good as part 1 and 2. As for part 4, I just went for the hell of it to watch it, knowing again that smokey wasn't in it and that they were going to make a spoof of saw. At the end i thought it just got worse. The only part that was good was the first 5 - 8 mins with charlie sheen after the shaq and dr. phil seen. Then after that, the movie was just stupid and not stupid funny. So to conclude this i'm just disappointed that the waynes brothers are not involved anymore since they sold the rights to David zucker, which was a bad mistake. Although I'am looking forward to watching ""Little Man"", which is the next waynes brothers project. I just can't get enough of them.Peace! :D",Scary Movie 4

During the previews, I was saying uh-oh (except for Clerks II, it looks a little teen-oriented, but Clerks was excellent). As I walked out of the theater, I told my friend that I'm going to go home and cry myself to sleep. I was thinking of that the whole film. OK that was a little unprofessional but if you aren't convinced by this review to go see the movie and you end up seeing it, you'd understand.If you enjoy urine jokes, fart jokes, slapstick stunts over and over again, shattered opportunities for good humor, re-watching the trailer stretched out into 83 minutes of film, and giggling when you hear the word ""butt,"" then by all means see this movie. The few times that I did laugh(very few), the writers had a right idea but it FLOPPED. I thought I'd never say this, but this was worse than Date Movie.

(They need to go back to rated R),4,15 April 2006,"I just saw Scary Movie 4 tonight with some friends, and it just doesn't seem to have the same feel the other three movies had. I found that the movie was very rushed, and that most of the scenes were put together in a hurry. I think they tried too hard with this one, and that the story wasn't as well written to flow together like the other ones were.I did laugh pretty hard at some scenes, although near the end the story slowed down and the funnies were drying up. I think that a problem this one and scary movie 3 had troubles with was their lack or more adult-based humour, that pushed the rating into ""Restricted"". But, money is what makes Filmer's happy, and to get more money they have to open the movie to a wider audience and lower the rating - which in my opinion - lowers the overall Ha-Ha of the film.I don't think I would recommend seeing this film in theatre's, but renting it and watching it with a bunch of friends would make it a more enjoyable film. It's also a plus to have seen the movies they are spoofing - which I did, but some of my friends didn't... so I had to explain some scenes.",Scary Movie 4

Unfortunately it hardly stacks up to the ones made in the past. It does have a good plot though, spoofing many very popular movies which you will undoubtetly notice when you see them.The plot and the opening scene are about the only good things in it though. The rest of the movie is the same gag over and over. And here it is, someone accidentally hits someone then that person who got hit gets up and then gets hit again. I can't tell you how old that got. Another complaint was the fact that this type of movie has been made many times before and it's really starting to get lame.Eventually you will be able to guess what will happen next, whether it's some guy getting accidentally hit, a fart/ poop joke, or some gross out joke, you will definitely catch on. The humor isn't even that topical like it was in the last. But this review probably won't matter and the movie will continue to make millions from friends wanting to go to what all there other friends are going to, that's how i got sucked into it. So yeah I would definitely rather watch an old school spoof like Naked Gun, than this.",Scary Movie 4
364,Bombajio,Served many laughs,8,14 April 2006,"""Scary Movie 4"" is one of the few movies that I've actually seen when it first premieres. And I am happy. The movie was very good and certainly served many laughs. It was done in the true ""Scary Movie"" fashion: Cindy is still being haunted by freaky things(A dead Japanese boy in this case), Brenda is still a snarky bastard(Telling a dying man that he's a pussy..) and the new characters are still funny(""I'll put it on my Myspace!""). It was nice to see some of the characters from the previous ""Scary Movie""(Charlie Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Simon Rex and others) make brief appearances and I was very glad to see that they hadn't been forgotten! I also enjoyed the fact, that they didn't include a lot of gross things, that would make the people gag(A good example of someone who DID include these things though, is ""Date Movie."" That movie had me wishing to leave the theater several times and I was shocked to hear that some of the ""Scary Movie"" writers had been involved). There were a few minor scare-points, but nothing major.I hear a lot of people complaining that ""Scary Movie"" has gone to hell and that it'll never beat the first movie. But how much can that statement be true? ""Scary Movie"" is made for laughs. No real plot or story is involved, as it is set up for jokes and it's purpose is to make people laugh. And judging by the people who were in the movie theater with me, to see the film, it succeeded. The audience was in laughs many, many times during the film.The second movie of the ""Scary Movie"" series was pretty boring, in my opinion, but everything after (and before) it has been great and has made the viewers laugh. You cannot go to the movie theater to see ""Scary Movie"" and expect to see an awesome plot and a deep story. This is just not what the movie was made for.Be ready for not having to think and wonder of the plot of the movie and prepare yourself for laughing, when you decide to go and see the movie!",Scary Movie 4

The humour was all slapstick, it's as though the writers have just found a liking to watching someone hit their head in this movie, not like in Scary Movie 1 and 2, which usually had many jokes which made the movie actually good. The only line I laughed at was when Shaq says, ""Kobe is that you?"" to the voice which is telling him that he is being held captive against his own free will, and i was only joined by another 10 other people who actually got the joke. The ending was extremely lame too. Many people believed that the Manakin from Saw riding a Tricycle was a joke...

The jokes were too repetitive, not funny and already done in other movies but a lot better then in this movie! The acting was too forced, as if the actors themselves didn't wanna say the things they had to say. The jokes are too predictable and the jokes that did get a laugh they repeated it over and over again until it's not funny anymore.After seeing this movie I really think they should consider stop making these scary movie films. This one was too awful to show to anybody! Be warned!",Scary Movie 4

It was just stupid. The entire theater was full of around 13 year old kids that talked the whole time and moved about the theater, and they were the perfect audience for this film. So if you are above the age of about 14, then you will probably hate this film like my friend and I did. There was only one part of one scene that was funny. The rest was so predictable and just ridiculous. When the movie was about three quarters of the way over, my friend and I both realized that we were wasting our time and left. We walked out, told the theater manager about how stupid it was, and the crazy audience that was with us, and they quickly returned our money . . . It seemed as if they were used to people walking out, considering we were not the only ones that left our theater that night. Hopefully if you still go and see this film, you will at least get it for a matinée price, as to not waste a full price ticket.",Scary Movie 4

This one's for you!,8,20 April 2006,"I had no great expectations for this movie, I saw the trailer and found the jokes pretty lame.The full movie though, was filled with long and crazy jokes, I laughed as much I haven't been doing since Team America (have to see that one too).They make fools out of the exact right things, and when they build up a joke and then fulfill it you will just burst into laughter! It's difficult to make a comedy that continue to surprise till the end without getting out of track, but this one does it pretty good.I give it a strong 8 out of 10, and that's one of the best grades I've given to a comedy.",Scary Movie 4

They should definitely take out the parts with the President...can you say gay?!? I think that this movie was really stupid and they should just stop making scary movies unless the Marlon brothers come back to continue writing it.

370,lilmito,"No fancy title, just a review of Scary Movie 4 from someone normal",8,16 April 2006,"I just want to clarify that i felt the need to say something here coz a lot of people are this and that and simply i just wanted to write exactly what the Scary Movie 4 experience is! As many Scary Movie fans will notice, there is a substantial difference between the first 2 Scary Movies and the 3rd & 4th Scary Movies! The first 2 were a lot more wild, untamed, aimed at teenage audiences and went for the X-rated approach to parodying movies and this worked on an unimaginable level! Sex jokes, racial humour, extracting the laughs from current affairs and smothering the rest with clever original jokes proved to be a massive worldwide success and the style in which it was done, seemed familiar to fans of Pat Proft and the Zuckers (Airplane! Naked Gun! Wrongfully Accused! Kentucky Fried Movie! etc...) who originally paved the way for this type of great comedy! ""Scary Movie 3"" was obviously a no-brainer in a sense that Proft and Zucker and Co. would be a perfect match to continue the trilogy! However, ideas and impressions clashed when the Zuckers took a plain comedic approach and chose to tone down the roudiness that the 1st 2 had! No longer was there over the top language, over the top sexual innuendo or over the top drug content which initially made the first 2 movies stand out from the others... just inventive and hilarious comedy with a complex and subtle naughty undertone that a lot of people may have missed!! Scary Movie 4 is the latest installment and it seems to be slowly creeping it's way back to the bold and shocking (i say 'shocking' in the good sense, not as in 'shocking' bad) humour of the first 2 whilst still possessing the majority of humour from Scary Movie 3! This one returns with it's hilarious sexual innuendo and risky language and cultural humour paced evenly throughout it! A 4th sequel is always extremely daunting but in all honesty, i believe that this franchise, providing it is not OVERDONE (eg: not one released every 6 months or every year) could spawn up to and beyond 5-6 sequels!! This movie is really, very funny and it's great to see it, somewhat, re-incorporate apart of the original, daring, Scary Movie 1 & 2 humour into it as well as continuing on with the tradition of hilarious Zucker/Proft style comedy! Scary Movie 4 is genuinely, worth seeing (also, having worked in a movie theatre for quite some time, seeing this kind of movie with a group of friends actually enhances the comedic effect! It's very true!)",Scary Movie 4

Me and my friend felt so ripped off.I mean i liked Date Movie which was rated worse than this, so i thought i would like this. They really need to get the writers from 1 & 2 on this! UHH!! I FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!!! This movie is most likely suited for children under 12 that think poop jokes are funny.1&2 were much more funny but I don't know what they did to this series, they just made it more disgusting and retarded.

It seemed like they were trying to do too many things with it and some of the jokes got boring after a while. I mean like half of their jokes are either repeated in the movie or done in the past scary movies. Some of the actors seemed to look like they were somewhere else, and i even thought that the plot was a mess. I saw the date movie (which by the way has a pretty bad plot) and i have to say that the scary movie 4 plot was worser then the date movie plot. Nevertheless this movie was an OK movie, and you'll probably get laughs from it, and might be worth you're money just don't expect too much from it though.",Scary Movie 4

I wish I could unsee this profoundly unfunny piece of crap.I've looked over the few posts that mirror my sentiments and have noticed that some ""people"" always attack the original poster saying the movie was funny and ther person who made that post must not have a sense of humor. I have a suspicion that people affiliated with the making of this movie are the perpetrators behind this.The only good part of this movie was seeing the lovely Miss.

375,Doktor_Scribblez,"Wow, just wow",1,17 June 2006,"I have seen all of the scary movies and I tolerated the first 2 because they were new and original. However with the release of the third the series really took a huge downturn. And the fourth,was just straight-up garbage. The jokes were stale and trite, and just generally sucked.I would give this movie no stars but that wasn't an option. Don't waste your money on this film in DVD form or otherwise. If you must see it convince your dumb friend to buy it and then watch it with him/her. Or steal it then once you've watched it sacrifice it to the movie ""gods"" via bonfire, and hope they have mercy on the creator's souls.Overall this was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure to witness. I really hope they don't make another because then I just might have to kill myself.",Scary Movie 4
376,HenryBurton,Horribly unfunny,1,15 April 2006,"Honestly, this must be the worst movie I've seen this year. At least a third of the jokes were people getting hit by things, and a fair proportion of the others were just plain crude. This wouldn't have mattered if there was a plot of any kind, but it seemed to jump from one movie set-piece to another. To be fair, it did copy the look of these movies it was spoofing very well, and they were clearly recognisable - but then instead of there being a joke, someone got hit by something with a loud, slapstick ""Dong"" noise, and then fell over.I went into this movie with low expectations, and still came out disappointed.

In contrast, this film seems to be an auto-pilot all the way through, spoofing movies such as ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" with no zest or imagination.The only bright spot is Leslie Neilson, who only appears in a handful of scenes but is the funniest thing in the film by far.Just a terrible, unoriginal, unimaginative, unmotivated movie which is a complete waste of 80 minutes. And the talents of Bill Pulman and Charlie Sheen.Sadly, I have no doubt it will pull in the crowds and the cash.

380,der-andy,Got story?,1,4 May 2006,"I just saw this movie at the cinema (it started on 2006/04/20 in Germany). I know that this kind of movie is based on slapstick comedy and is not supposed to convince with its elaborate story. Sure, there are some very funny text lines or situations in it. And - as expected - some really cool movie parodies, too. But that's all. The whole story is just so far-fetched and desultory. There are two different story threads which do not really fit together - but at the end, they are forced to connect to each other. This is not funny. It isn't logical either. It is not even comprehensible. At the end of this movie, my girlfriend and me, we did not really know how they finally did it. (Don't want to spoil by telling you WHAT they did.)The first three Scary Movies were really funny and at the end, you had the feeling that the movie was now finished. After the fourth Scary Movie, we went out of the cinema and thought that they have forgotten something. I could not even tell you the story even if I wanted to because it was so weird that I can not really remember what happened. Except for some slapstick jokes, Scary Movie 4 is not really funny (too many of the jokes are just stupid), but it is not thrilling either. It has some funny moments, and some scary, shocking moments. But you can't decide what it is going to be at last. The president (Leslie Nielsen) could have completely left out. He just has two or three jokes, but does not do anything important. I hoped he would be given a bigger role, because I find him hilarious.I love Mel Brooks' movies, I love Leslie Nielsen's movies (Naked Gun, Spaceballs, Men in tights, ...), I liked the old Scary Movies, however I do NOT recommend this movie.",Scary Movie 4

This film has just concentrated on toilet humour and slapstick, there is nothing that even made me chuckle the slightest bit in this film.*SPOILERS* One example is for the beginning where Chingy & Dr.Phil are chained up in the same room, Chingy keeps bumping his head, then keeps ""axidentally"" hitting Dr.Phil over the head, by knocking down objects while trying to get a rock through a basketball hoop.Another example is during the village parody, when they are all having a meeting and the blind woman comes in to go to the ""toilet""...Toilet humour is funny though...if you are about 3! I don't even know really why i went to see this, the previous 2 were just as rubbish, the only good one was the first one that actually said ""No shame. No mercy. NO SEQUEL""...I can see that it's stuck to it's word, seeing as they did change that after the second one was released.This film is so poor that it makes me feel like i've wasted my time just writing about how bad it is, the jokes are so bad, the humour is just the same pretty much all the way through, all they have done is thought up about 4 jokes and relied on them throughout the entire film.",Scary Movie 4

I was reduced to throwing popcorn at my friends down the aisle because I found it so boring.Why name the movies ""Scary movie #"" if they're not even scary? The humour was all crude and sexual but it was only given a M15?

They really didn't make fun of the right movies, or the ones a lot of people saw. Many times, I had to turn to my friends and ask them, what movie was this. Of course there response was, I have no idea. And we love movies. Brokeback Mountain, The Grudge, War of the Worlds, were a few of the obvious ones.You know a movie is good when the entire theater laughs together. This was not the case.

My 7 year olds jokes were of better quality than those dropped in this film. Understandably that this movie was meant for potty humor and cheap laughs, but come on you can only go kicking a dead horse so many times and the joke gets old, really old.The only thing entertaining about seeing this movie was watching the girls in front of me chatting back and forth about what clothes their going to wear tomorrow.

And surprisingly it was funny. It had tons of jokes most of them funny but not laugh out loud funny. I was really hoping for a side-splitting joke but they really didn't have any. You'll definitely like this movie and laugh if you like Scary Movie 3's jokes and gross crude humor which some people like but if your the person who really dislikes that type of stuff you'll hate this movie. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give somewhere between a 6 or 7 because it was way too short and needed some funnier jokes. Also the plot seemed to be all over the place. So sometimes it got a little confusing. In my opinion Scary Movie 3 was a lot funnier than this one. But if your not sure about seeing it you can always rent it when it comes out.,Scary Movie 4

The almost random return of some characters only for a few jokes didn't seem worthwhile considering the horrible reason the person was back. However, the primary purpose of this movie was to be a parody of a coalition of other films, and on that note was excellent. They did they best that they could with the movies they were working with. Some would argue that a better choice of movies could have been used, and I would agree. As a sequel, this ranks fairly low with me. Like the other movies in the series, these movies are best watched after seeing the original movies, not in series sequential order. If you enjoy the humour used in the other Scary Movies, you will definitely enjoy this one. To what extent is entirely up to you.",Scary Movie 4

I love King Kong and expected him to be in the movie because he is on the poster of the movie. However, after watching the movie, which seemed more of a waste of my time, I try to think back to the time in the movie King Kong appeared. The only close thing to a gorilla in the movie are some monkeys which definitely do not look like a gorilla with a cigarette in his mouth. This poster is false advertisement and audiences need to be warned. Especially King Kong fans.",Scary Movie 4
390,daviddoranmedia,"SM4: Take Good Movies, Insert Slapstick, Make Money.",4,17 April 2006,"First off, I am glad to see that the film's rating is going down, as it should for something of this poor quality. It wouldn't have been my first choice of film to see, but it suited at the time. I wasn't expecting much, but at least a few clever laughs. However, I was disappointed and amazed that something so short and poorly scripted could make it into mainstream cinema. But what can we expect from an obviously profit-driven film that it is.In terms of the plot, it was basically a loose mangle of several movies as the characters moved between sets, not exactly plot driven. The sets were faithfully reproduced and the effects were convincing, so that was a sort of plus. However, on consideration the main content of the film, the comedy, seemed to be simply the ""spoofed"" movie's plot with some hap-hazard events thrown in. For example, they might re-create a scene exactly as it was in a movie and then one of the characters gets hit by a ball, or mallet or chair or something. It just shows the limits of the writers creativity that off the top of my head I can remember characters getting hit by 2 balls, a chair, a container and their head of a table. And that's only what I remember now. The main substance of jokes was, literally, cheap slapstick. Every scene seemed to have someone getting hit by something, off something, or flatulence.Over all, after 80 minutes I was both amazed it was over and actually glad.So, if you like people hitting other things then go see it, otherwise I'd give it a pass, a wide pass!",Scary Movie 4
391,shutupandeatfleas,"See it after midnight, and you'll probably like it.",5,22 April 2006,"My friend and I saw the midnight movie of this, so obviously we were more susceptible to laughter. Even still, I have to say there were a good many jokes we did not laugh at. Of course, there were also many jokes that had us in stitches. So I'm giving this film a 5 out of 10, because the first half of it was very funny, and the second half was mind-bogglingly UNfunny. The first half of the film, with the exception of an embarrassing scene featuring Charlie Sheen and a bottle of Viagara, was hilarious mainly because it lampooned the ridiculous movie ""The Grudge."" Nearly all material in that area was well executed and chuckle-inducing. However, once the movie fully transitioned into its War of the Worlds and Village parodies, it simply lost everything. At that point it relied extremely heavily on fart/poop jokes, repetitive and predictable head-bonking, and pointless sex jokes. It regained my enthusiasm with a hilarious spoof of Tom Cruise's fiasco on Oprah, but by then the movie was over. And the scenes with President Harris (Leslie Nielson) were incredibly pointless and dull. Now, as a Conservative who can take a joke, I had no problem whatsoever with the fact that they were making fun of Bush. But the jokes that happened in these parts weren't funny enough to make up for the distractions it made from the main plot. Nielson's scenes just weren't funny.So in summary, I give this movie a half score because it was only half funny and half worth watching. I hope this is helpful to some people, as I have never seen the other Scary Movies, so I can't really have a biased opinion either way.",Scary Movie 4

It's a real disappointment when you expect it to be at least as good as the other 3 so the vote for me is a 7, because even thou I was disappointed it was still a funny movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone in a second because it wasn't that bad. There are a lot of people who say that this movie is all BS because as I said before it's compared to the other ones.

As long as there are movies being made then some people will make a parody of them (to which this was badly done.)I'd strongly recommend you do not watch this movie but if you liked Scary Movie 3 then you'll probably like this one as it's full of childish jokes.

They did that in Scary movie 3 as well but not as much as Scary Movie 4.However, I gotta say, its pretty smart that they made Scary Movie 3 and 4 PG-13. Since they are going to attract so many kids, they are going to think its hilarious when objects are thrown by other people by accident.

I also felt as though the movie was a bit rushed at some points. Also, at least 3 movies spoofed were NOT scary movies. And unlike the other three movies, there was no one real movie that was focused on, like Scream from the first and The Ring from the third. Still, I would like to see a 5th one possibly made. 7/10 stars for me.",Scary Movie 4
399,tcanania,The best one yet!,10,24 April 2006,"This movie is hilarious!! The best Scary Movie ever. The movie was well written and everything went smoothly. There was the constant potty jokes one after another. They had a lot of great cameos as well. Still the Wayans brothers did an awesome job on the first and second one. but the fourth one, i say, is the best one yet. All of the scary movies that they are spoofing ties in really well. I would give this an A+. This is a movie for people who really like stupid-funny movies. For anybody who has not seen the movie, go see it as soon as possible. Seriously, this is the best Scary Movie ever!! You would really enjoy this.",Scary Movie 4
