0,SnoopyStyle,I really don't like these characters,5,15 May 2014,"Igby Slocumb (Kieran Culkin) is from a crazy dysfunctional family. The movie opens with him and brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) smothering their sleeping mother (Susan Sarandon) with a plastic bag. Then it dives back into their lives before. Igby is a rebellious f-up who is sent to military school. His father Jason (Bill Pullman) suffers from mental instability. His domineering mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) is a mess. His older brother Ollie (Ryan Phillippe) is a republican. D.H. Banes (Jeff Goldblum) is his godfather. Then there are Banes' drug-addicted mistress Rachel (Amanda Peet) and the wonderfully charming Sookie (Claire Danes).Kieran could be a great actor. He does a great slacker rebel. Something about his character just rubs me the wrong way. I don't like this character. I don't like anybody in this movie. Don't get me wrong. I love all the actors here, but I just don't like any of the characters. Everybody is mean-spirited and selfish. I can't bring myself to liking this movie.",Igby Goes Down
1,claudio_carvalho,One of the Weirdest Good Movie I Have Ever Seen,8,25 April 2004,"The dominating and careless mother of Jason `Igby' Slocumb Jr. (Kieran Culkin), Mimi (Susan Sarandon), is dying, killed by her other son, Ollie (Ryan Phillipe). Then, we have 97 minutes of an authentic trip inside the weird family of this selfish and careless of love and affection character, Igby. His family is composed by his fascist brother Oliver `Ollie' Slocumb and his crazy and schizophrenic father Jason Slocumb (Bill Pullman). His closest friends are his godfather D.H. Banes (Jeff Goldblum) and his drugged addicted lover Rachel (Amanda Peet). His crush is the nymphomaniac Sookie Sapperstein (Claire Danes). No character has a normal behavior in accordance with the standards or rules of the society. Even his former school teacher, Mrs. Piggee (Cynthia Nixon, from `Sex and the City', with a minor participation) is a drug user, and becomes his client. Having many black humor and dramatic situation, it is indeed a good movie, with a great performance of the whole cast, highlighting Kieran Culkin. However, it is certainly not indicated for all audiences, but those who like a very different screenplay and a constellation of stars. A black comedy that does not make laugh, and a drama that does not make cry. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `A Estranha Familia de Igby' (`The Weird Family of Igby')",Igby Goes Down
2,lee_eisenberg,The first movie that I ever saw with my college friends.,9,9 February 2006,"Macaulay Culkin quickly became a has-been, but his brothers have taken some interesting roles, particularly Kieran in ""Igby Goes Down"". The movie portrays teenager Igby Slocumb, who - although he seems really messed up - has a perfectly good reason for it: his relatives. His mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) tries too hard to be a socialite; his father Jason (Bill Pullman) had a breakdown; his stepfather D.H. (Jeff Goldblum) turned his brother Ollie (Ryan Philippe) into a young Republican; and so on.Obviously, many movies deal with screwy families, but this one does a great job the way that ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" did. Much like a whole slew of great movies came out while my parents were in college, so many have come out while I've been in college (""Igby Goes Down"" was in fact the first movie that I saw with my college friends). It's movies like this that make life worth living.",Igby Goes Down
3,Quinoa1984,The dramatic Sleeper of the year- Grade: A,9,21 September 2002,"Igby Goes Down has remnants of Catcher in the Rye, but I don't think that it is precisely in relation to the novel.  First off, while the main character Igby looks on the world with a spiteful, scathing perspective, there are character elements, with him and with the supporting cast, that don't match. Still, this is not a deterrent to the picture; Kieran Culkin gives a breakout/breakthrough performance as the troubled youth, who has problems with his boarding schools, and his parents (Bill Pullman and Susan Sarandon).  The film has an astute, sarcastic sense of humor that is so subtle that if it doesn't get you to always belly laugh it puts you in a little awe.  Deep down it's a view on the rich, bleak, befuddled lifestyles of not just Igby but of others, and also a compelling character study that doesn't cheat from first frame to last.  Writer/director Steers has created a provocative serio-comedy that gets a great boost from supporting roles from Sarandon (although she's played many mothers before), Pullman, Goldblum, Phillipe, and Claire Danes in a choice pick.",Igby Goes Down
4,wes-connors,A Catcher in the Lie,5,8 August 2012,"Boarding school drop-out Kieran Culkin (as Jason ""Igby"" Slocumb) and his Columbia-educated brother Ryan Phillippe (as Oliver ""Ollie"" Slocumb) put a plastic bag over the head of their bedridden mother Susan Sarandon (as Mimi), and watch as she suffocates. Next, we see them as young boys witnessing father Bill Pullman (as Jason Slocumb Sr.) expose himself, demonstrating cleanliness to the family. These two incidents occur during the opening credits; the former is foreshadowing, the latter is a flashback. The story's protagonist is Mr. Culkin. Other significant people in his life are vacantly sexy Claire Danes (as Sookie Sapperstein), ""godfather"" Jeff Goldblum (as D.H. Baines), his junkie lover Amanda Peet (as Rachel), and indeterminate Jared Harris (as Russel)...The interesting thing about the opening is how it sets up Mr. Culkin's character as both physically (via his mother) and mentally (via his father) threatened. However, this fodder for a literary-type analysis is disposed of by a later plot admission. The intent was for a ""sane"" future, possibly - in this case, the story is richer without the revelation. And, while it's certainly not a mistake to compare Burr Steers' ""Igby"" to J.D. Salinger's ""Holden Caulfield"" (from ""Catcher in the Rye""), the conclusion they are very much alike is in error - most obviously, one is incredibly appealing and the other isn't. There's the rub - little or no admiration for our anti-hero. Appearing briefly, the thought-provoking Gore Vidal (as a priest) and the always spot-on Bill Irwin (as a lieutenant) are appreciated.***** Igby Goes Down (5/23/02) Burr Steers ~ Kieran Culkin, Ryan Phillippe, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes",Igby Goes Down
5,jotix100,Igby is no Holden Caulfield!,5,8 December 2002,"In coming to this film's front page I noticed that Bill Pullman's name is inadvertently omitted from the credits. Was it because he was ashamed of the finished product, or was it he didn't want anything to do with this dud of a comedy?First of all, Burr Steers has no clue whether this was a drama or a black comedy. I guess he must have the right connections to attract the talent he works with in this film, otherwise it doesn't make sense. I kept thinking of The Royal Tannenbaums while watching this mess.Kieran Culkin is a young actor that will go far because he's talented. Mr. Culkin carries the film on his shoulders; he is the whole reason for seeing the movie.The rest of the cast seem to be acting in different films, not in this one. I also wondered about Ryan Phillipe's presence in the movie. Are we to believe he and Igby were brothers? And did Susan Sarandon give birth to these two losers? One only hopes Ms Sarandon chooses a better vehicle next time out, otherwise she won't have enough money left for the philanthropic causes she gets involved with. Poor Haitians their stockings will be empty for Christmas.",Igby Goes Down
6,Doylenf,Great cast livens depressing comedy...,5,12 September 2007,"KIERAN CULKIN gives a marvelous performance as a hip kid who treats everyone with supreme indifference and no shortage of one-liners. Asked by a potential girlfriend why he's not in school, he merely says, ""Sheer ingenuity"", after being kicked out of numerous schools on the east coast and driving his mother (SUSAN SARANDON) and brother (RYAN PHILLIPPE) crazy with his boorish behavior.IGBY GOES DOWN is a smart black comedy that is equal parts depressing and funny at the same time. Culkin refers to his mother as ""the heinous one"" and his father (BILL PULLMAN) as a disturbed man who's ""in a Maryland home for the befuddled."" His girlfriend admits she's been adopted and calls herself ""a vanity project of narcissistic parents."" That gives you an idea of the flavor of most of the dialog in a story about a boy who ends up just like his father--feeling ""a great, great pressure pulling down over him."" The story ends with him and his brother cooperating in the demise of their mom--an act of euthanasia--and parting when Culkin leaves for California and a possibly life on the mean streets without a promising future while brother Ryan merely says, ""There never was a great deal between us."" It's a downer of a comedy but some of it is very effective, thanks largely to the caliber of the performances, all fine. The cast includes JEFF GOLDBLUM, CLAIRE DANES and AMANDA PEET in interesting supporting roles and a soundtrack of pop music that sounded pretty appropriate to me.",Igby Goes Down
7,ferguson-6,Igby goes down a familiar path,7,22 September 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  I am always on the lookout for a well written script that brings new perspective to life.  Had hopes that ""Igby"" was it.  New writer/director Burr Steers borrows from the best - ""Rushmore"" ""Catcher in the Rye"", ""The Graduate"".  However, his script forgot one aspect of a great story - the audience needs at least one character to care about. Some wonderful performance bring us a steady progression of characters whom we merely feel like zoogoers - watching the daily activities within the chimpanzee exhibit.  Kieran, one of the hordes of Culkins, has the lead and his more-talented little brother Rory (""Signs"" ""You Can Count On Me"") plays Igby as a youngster. Stone-faced Ryan Phillipe has the all-knowing snob role perfected, and Jeff Goldblum brings more than a touch of nastiness to his juicy role as Igby's ""God""father.  After an acting hiatus to attend Yale, Claire Danes is back as a brief ray of hope in Igby's life.  Susan Sarandon, who we all wish would take a break from acting, borrows heavily from her ""Stepmom"" role to play what SHOULD have been the pivotal role in the film.  The ever-lightly skilled Bill Pullman walks through his role as the depressed, unable to cope role model, while Amanda Peet shows flashes of brilliance in her whored-out, heroined-up, tough-talking, weak-minded role.  Jared Harris (from the underrated ""Happiness"" and son of esteemed actor Richard Harris) plays the ""artist"" role apparantly written with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in mind.  Eric Begosian (""TalK Radio"") had the theatre buzzing for a few seconds with his cameo.  Drugs, Sex, Ice Cream and Money are all metaphors for what makes life alternatingly miserable and bearable.   When will filmmakers understand that it takes more than a screwed up family for us to FEEL for the rich.  We are all experiencing screwed up family life and many think adding money to mix would not make our lives worse.  A few script adjustments could have made this a significant movie with something to say, instead of an interesting look at all too familiar topics.",Igby Goes Down
8,movieman_kev,slightly keeps it's head above water,6,4 June 2005,"Kieran Culkin, the talented one in the family, portrays Igby Slocumb. A young adult who can't really adjust to life on the surface because of his experiences growing up with a crazed father and a lush mother. He, while 17, prefer's the company of older women bedding both his step-father's mistress Rachel(Amanda Peet) and an older druggie vegetarian Sookie (Claire Daines) while 'on the lam' from going to military school in this slightly coming of age film. I enjoyed this film surprisingly, and while it did seem slightly pretentious, not nearly as much so as ""American Beauty"" did. All the performances are pretty damn good and Kieran far outperforms what his brother, Macaulay, appear to be capable of. Not to over praise it, as it does have fault, growing melancholy and predictable towards the end. It also falls in the trap of using music as a cheap ploy to attempt to provoke and/or manipulate emotion. One feels that it's attempting to be Andersonesque, but fails a bit on that level. Take this for what it is, a slightly above-average life drama and be happy with that.My Grade: C+ Eye Candy: Amanda Peet gets topless",Igby Goes Down
9,=G=,"Coulda, shoula been better",6,5 February 2003,"""Igby Goes Down"" is a condescending, pedantic, darkly comedic misanthro-pic about a rich kid (Culkin) who has too little love and too much attitude...etc. In spite of its critical plaudits; excellent acting (no stretching); and slick, dialed-in synthesis, this film really sucked. Personally I was bored with it from the get go, utterly and completely detatched, and toughed it out with a piecemeal watch. What could have been a good drama was scuttled with a black skew, much too clever script, obvious but purposeless stereotyping, an unabashed absence of humanity, and zero audience empathy. Good fodder for self indulgent critics, buffs, dilettantes, etc. For those who just want entertainment, forget it. (B-)",Igby Goes Down

11,cherold,unpleasant,4,5 June 2004,"Movie about a snotty, self-involved brat surrounded by other snotty, self-involved people.  Aiming for the Catcher in the Rye sensibility, the movie suffers because the main character is just as unpleasant and hypocritical as the characters he disdains.  He was an arrogant little creep feeling sorry for himself and somehow seducing women in spite of little real charm.  Of course, it would have helped if this movie had been, as so many people on this site insist, funny.  I watched an hour waiting for it to be funny, and except for a somewhat clever comment about Jesus Christ it's really not funny in the least.  In the end, a good cast was wasted on pretentious drivel about unlikeable people.",Igby Goes Down
12,tabuno,A Great Look At Teenager Angst,8,26 January 2019,"23 February 2003. With biting humor, a wry sense of the absurd and some great off-beat acting by some well-known actors, this movie presents an excellent look at a young man growing up in the rich and powerful society and indirectly looks at death and the surrealistic world that in some ways may parallel our own youth's obssession today with a new generational way of thinking and behaving. This involving and slanted/angled view to view, breaks ground in American cinema by introducing European avante garde, new wave nihilism, rejecting the customary beliefs in morality and religion. But at the same time, it reveals a deeper subset of emotions and meanings in life that are becoming even more relevant in our lifetime.",Igby Goes Down
13,kenjha,Film Goes South,5,29 December 2010,"High school dropout bums around. Igby seems to be modeled after Holden Caulfield from ""Catcher in the Rye,"" except that he is an unappealing, self-absorbed brat. In fact, none of the characters here is the least bit appealing. In his film debut as writer and director, Steers tries very hard to be hip with an unconventional storytelling style but he pretty much falls flat on his face. For no apparent reason, the film starts with the Sarandon character being murdered by her sons; this happens during the opening credits so this is not a spoiler. It then goes back to fill in the blanks, clumsily moving about in time in a helter skelter fashion. The film has no flow and becomes a drag.",Igby Goes Down
14,leplatypus,"After a good start, Igby goes indeed down (DVD)",4,18 June 2011,"Telling the drama of a wealthy family, it's really far away of the my concerns. If I can't enjoy the misfortunes of the rich, I can at least don't care. Maybe like me you will find the cast interesting. Goldblum as a godfather is excellent as well as Philips as the perfect son. Amanda is fine but it's sad that for this time, she really get drowned. For Culkin, his family scores everywhere: Macaulay for the childhood, and Cieran for the teen. With his golden and rusty scarf, he really looked like Harry Potter becoming a bum: it's funny. He is convincing in playing a soul attached to his broken father and unable to choose his path. Like him, i take a year off but idle doesn't mean indeed happy times. This side of the movie is interesting but unfortunately, at this moment, the movie turns into a teen romance really boring. In conclusion, the idea of breaking family bounds is original but isn't told all the way.",Igby Goes Down
15,Polaris_DiB,Can I get a D? Can I get a Y? Can I get an S? Can I get a -functional family?,6,8 October 2008,"Looking back, it seems American indie filmmakers in the late 90's, early millenial were just crawling over each other to find a way of representing the more dysfunctional family. Igby Goes Down is a good movie, and has its exceptional moments, but time is already starting to drag on this one.Igby is rich, he keeps getting kicked out of school, his father is insane, he hates his mother, his brother is a ""Young Republican"", his Godfather is Jeff Goldblum, and he just is feeling so darned existential all the time. He runs around New York being phony (hence the thousands of people comparing him to Holden Caulfield), attends parties in which he feels alienated (hence the thousands of people comparing him to Ben Braddock), and purposefully attempts to make things awkward to get the attention of his mother (hence my comparing him to Harold Chasen). He's also a teenager's wish fulfillment fantasy as he manages to sleep with hot women who are either not concerned with having a relationship or pleasantly reject him so that he can feel more alienated, run around New York being gloomy and hep, and, well, get his parents out of the way from time to time.Hey, I'm not complaining: all of that is good justification for watching this movie. However, not all of it was all that great. One of the things that kind of ruined it for me was the character Sookie's relationship with Igby and his brother. Now, I'm sorry, but who starts relationships with two brothers based entirely on their bemoaning hatred of their mother? Really, who does that? ""Oh, give me more of that angry childhood trauma, baby, you talk so sexy..."" Nonetheless, most of the beginning is funny, the scene that bookmarks the movie is really cool, and its episodic structure helps it keep moving (this movie is kind of like the weather: if you don't like the scene, it will probably soon change).Anyway, cute film.--PolarisDiB",Igby Goes Down
16,dfranzen70,Down goes Igby! Down goes Igby!,7,12 March 2003,"This is the movie that proves that Macaulay Culkin isn't and wasn't the best Culkin actor. Kieran Culkin, now 20 years old, is spot on as the iconoclastic Jason ""Igby "" Slocumb, Jr., wild child in a very odd family. Think Malcolm in the Middle in which everyone, including Malcolm, is a bit wacky. No, wait, calling the Slocumbs wacky isn't quite fair. Let me explain.Mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon) is a snobby upper-crust matriarch who's dying of breast cancer. Brother Ollie (Ryan Phillippe) follows in her footsteps - except for the dying part, of course. Father Jason (Bill Pullman) is suffering from schizophrenia and resides in a sanitarium, though we see him in the occasional flashback.Because of Igby's upbringing, he's transformed himself into a sort of rebel against everything. He gets kicked out of public schools and private schools alike. In desperation, his mother sends him to military school, which works for a while.So Igby's grown up in a lifestyle of opulence - he has money, he has all the material obsessions anyone could want, and of course he wants something else:  nothing. He wants to escape the clutches of his domineering mother and protective (to a fault) brother. He wants to be his own person, see his own sights, and live life as best he can. Trouble is, he's penniless until his mother dies.Igby's travels take him far and wide, partially aided by the benevolence of his obscenely wealthy godfather, D. H. (Jeff Goldblum). This enables him to escape, for a time, from his schools and his family.So what's the point of all of this ""escaping,"" you ask? After all, he's part of the elite of society, and although escaping from it sounds like fun for a time, is it worth a 90-minute exposition? I think it was, at least in this particular case. I've never been a strong fan of costume dramas - which is what this is, sans period costumery - but I think that the idiosyncrasies and overall oddness of Igby and his family make up for the familiarity of the script. Culkin, in his first ""adult"" role (I remember him best as the youngest child in ""Father of the Bride"") is very well cast, showing us that acting is just as important as being cute and cuddly - in essence, he was able to do what his older brother Mac couldn't, and that's act after hitting puberty. Kieran Culkin's no longer the cute little kid, and that's good - it should work in his favor, not hamper him. True, the script is a little pedestrian, but there are just enough oddball moments to keep the viewer interested. Sometimes screenwriters will try to make a character as weird as possible, and that just leaves the viewer cold, with no way to relate to the character. Igby's character works because he's believable and because he's not infallible.",Igby Goes Down
17,meeza,Igby got me a bit down!,6,2 March 2003,"`Igby Goes Down' is a tale of modern preppie teenage rebellion. Even though it did have its share of youthful intelligence & coming-of-age eccentricities, I must say I do have to give `Igby Goes Down' a marginal thumbs down. Kieran Culkin stars as Igby- our young protagonist who rebels against his controlling mother, spoiled brother, demented father, and egocentric godfather. He finds affectionate comfort in the arms of 2 twenty-something expressive hotties played by Claire Danes & Amanda Peet. I must admit Culkin does have an unfledged cinematic charisma, and I am sure that Kieran does have a bright acting future. He might even star as himself in his own `E Hollywood Story' adaptation of `The Dangerous Lives of Young Hollywood Actor Boys' if he is not too careful. Writer-Director Burt Steers strains too hard to create `Igby Goes Down' as an updated mentally-complex version of `The Graduate'. Unfortunately, Steers steered too far away from the simplistic elements that made `The Graduate' one of the best coming-of-age films ever made. Even though many critics have praised upward positive remarks to `Igby Goes Down', it is more as an up & down cinematic cruise to me. *** Average",Igby Goes Down
18,MBunge,"If Igby was from Omaha, this film would have never gotten made.",4,7 July 2011,"This movie is about a poor little rich boy's journey from insolent, indifferent loser to just-as-insolent-but-slightly-less-indifferent loser. Along the way he mainly lounges around, looking forlorn as much more interesting characters rotate around him. Oh, and a couple of beautiful women inexplicably jump his bones while the worst thing that happens to him in this story is that he deservedly gets his ass kicked. Why writer/director Burr Steers thought this guy and this life were worthy of anyone's attention is beyond me.Igby (Keiran Culkin) is the youngest son in a New York City family that's just rich enough to not have to worry about money, but not rich enough to qualify as wealthy in New York. His dad (Bill Pullman) is a schizophrenic. His mom (Susan Sarandon) is a controlling harridan. His brother Oliver (Ryan Phillippe) is much better looking, more successful and more capable. For his part, Igby is a lazy no account who glides through life relying on the resources of others without ever suffering any sort of material hardship. And he's the ""hero"" of this story.After getting kicked out of one too many private schools, Igby takes a summer job working for his godfather DH (Jeff Goldblum). He puts as little effort into that as everything else in his life and winds up running away from all of his minuscule responsibilities to glom onto DH's girlfriend Rachel (Amanda Peet) and her performance artist lover/friend Russel (Jared Harris). After Rachel starts screwing him for no apparent reason, Igby manages to land another girlfriend in the form of Sookie (Claire Danes). She's from an upper middle class family of intellectuals, which means she has a certain air of sophistication but still has to work for a living.Anyway, after screwing Igby for several weeks or perhaps months, Sookie meets his brother Oliver and starts having sex with him after knowing Oliver for a grand total of perhaps 5 hours. Sookie's explanation for betraying Igby is that she and Oliver are the same age. Throw in Igby's mom having cancer and Igby eventually becoming the bag man for Russel's drug dealing and that's pretty much the whole movie.The only unabashedly good thing about Igby Goes Down is that Amanda Peet takes her top off. Considering you can probably find those images online after a 10 second web search, that means there's no reason at all to watch this self involved, badly thought out mess.Now, Ryan Phillippe does give a pretty good performance as Oliver but it's a case of a fine actor working at cross purposes to the film he's in. Oliver is a much more engaging character than Igby. He grew up in the same sort of family dysfunction but came out the other side as something resembling a grown up who's trying to live something resembling a grown up life. Oliver is screwed up but he's trying to not let that entirely define him. That's much more realistic and appealing than Igby, who is basically a young New York City-version of the Bill Murray slacker character from films like Stripes and Meatballs, but not being played for laughs. In many ways, it's like Igby should be a supporting character in a movie about Oliver.Igby Goes Down is another example of a filmmaker creating a main character without ever seemingly considering how or why the audience should care about him. I don't know why anyone watching this film should care whether Igby succeeds or fails, or even care what success or failure for Igby would look like. That lack of connection fatally undermines anything else the movie tries to do.Not that anything else here is all that good either. There are too many scenes that don't serve the story, too many times the audience is told things instead of shown them and there's one too many college rock songs on the soundtrack. The acting is okay, though Keiran Culkin is the least impressive member of the cast, but in the endIgby Goes Down is one of those bad films that doesn't even offer anything enjoyable in its own badness.

The characters are individually striking, the acting terrific, Phillipe manages to be both obnoxious and seductive, though does Amanda Peet have in her contracts that she has to show her boobs in every movie she's in? Neat trick to be able to have a younger Culkin play Kieran (who was also good in Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys) as his younger self. This writing/directing debut by Burr Steers doesn't really hold together as everything just gets too, too extreme for even black comedy, with several deaths. The hair styling is the best I've ever seen on Phillippe, Sarandon, Claire Danes, etc. -- lead stylist Quentin Harris is a name to watch for. The individual song selections were cool, such as Travis doing ""The Weight,"" but didn't really add anything in the soundtrack.

Very dark and satirical story is like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" written by an extremely angry person. The acting is good by Kieran Culkin who has easily surpassed his brother in the acting department but the performance that stood out for me is Claire Danes. She sort of looks like Franka Potente now but she's blossoming nicely into a solid actress. The writing is sharp but lets face it, no one really talks like this in real life. And that is why I didn't enjoy this film more. Also, Ryan Phillipe seems to be playing the same character he always does in movies. So while I was impressed with the acting and writing and the overall look of the film the black comedy and dark tone and theme make it impossible to embrace completely.

22,bandw,The story of an uninteresting rich brat.,5,2 March 2003,"If this movie is ""The Catcher in the Rye"" for the 21st century, then I think we are in deep trouble. Igby can't seem to feel true affection for anybody. Granted, many of the people he associates with are not the most appealing, but in the main they are not phonys - they are not pretending to be something they are not.  Igby's snobbish brother recognizes himself for what he is, but the care he shows for Igby is rejected.Are we supposed to believe that this underaged brat Igby could score with a couple of beautiful women, with so little effort?

It's hard to care about your main character when the people he associates with seem to have infected him with their corruption even as he protests that he hates how they act.  He's painted as being sensitive and intelligent, so why not pigeonhole him as the 'lovelorn', rather than the acerbic ingenue who STILL gets the women?  Deep down, Igby is much more likeable than the obnoxious Max in ""Rushmore"", and it's easier for him to elicit sympathy - as shown in one particular scene with Claire Danes.  It's a great shame he's not allowed to drop the artifice more often here, and let the audience connect with him on a more basic level as a character.  No, instead he must play the young and world-weary; a furrow already plowed to my general disinterest in the surface-similarities to the mentioned ""Rushmore"".Igby Vs Max: Igby wins - a FAR more appealing character; it's just a shame to me that he's stuck in a story which turns out to be not-half as 'universal', and therefore marginally less affecting.",Igby Goes Down

25,Rogue-32,Holden Caulfield with a Harry Potter scarf,8,16 September 2002,"I'm very pleased to see other reviewers comparing Kieran Culkin's character Jason/Igby to The Catcher in the Rye's Holden Caulfield - while watching the film I was thinking the same thing, much to writer/director Burr Steers' credit.  This is THE Social Commentary movie I have been waiting to see for a long time now - fearless, witty, arch, poignant without being sentimental, and, best of all, the characters are not one-dimensional, they all live and breathe and we feel the agony they are suffering behind their socially privileged masks.  Culkin is especially brilliant (and so sad, with his Harry Potter scarf - a young wizard without any magic), but everyone shines here - Sarandon, Pullman, Danes, Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillippe, Jeff ""how-can-I-be-any-creepier"" Goldblum, and of course Jared Harris, who positively reeks eccentricity without even having to open his mouth (but when he does, it's always good too).  A fine first film from a director/writer who definitely bears watching.",Igby Goes Down
26,TheNorthernMonkee,Igby is one of those films that test the brain to the limit,8,21 October 2003,"SPOILERSTruth be told, before even reviewing Igby, it's probably worth mentioning, that no matter how I feel or describe this film, this review will never be as detailed as some of the reviews I've already read on this website. Since beginning writing reviews on imdb, I've never seen a film produce so many detailed, yet slightly obscure reviews. Ultimately, this is a sign of how good this film really is.In ""Igby Goes Down"", Kieran Culkin proves once and for all that he's the more talented of the Culkin family with a powerful performance as Igby Slocumb, the youngest of two brothers to the hideously dysfunctional Slocumb family. Igby's mother (played with passion by Susan Sarandon) is a bit of a cruel, heartless drug addict who has been diagnosed with cancer. Igby's father (played by Bill Pullman) has by the time of this film slowly gone insane (as shown by cleverly placed flashbacks) and is now in a mental ward in what seems like an almost comatose state. With these parents, it is little wonder then that as well as the disruptive Igby, the family has produced his elder brother Ollie (played by Ryan Phillippe in a way reminicent of his performance in ""Cruel Intentions"") who is a success obsessed college student, who unlike Igby has at least some small link to his mother. With a family like this, it is no surprise really that Igby spends a vast majority of his time attempting to escape from the family, aiming eventually to make it to California (where he can finally see some sun).""Igby Goes Down"" is a very cleverly written film, with a stunning soundtrack and quality cinematography. It reminds us that it doesn't always matter how rich or poor the family is, sometimes we just need to escape them.As well as the main family, the acting is superb. Claire Danes as Sookie the love interest is excellent, as is Jeff Goldbloom as D.H. Igby's rich Godfather (or is he more to Igby perhaps than meets the eye? Queue a surprising throw away line towards the end). Other actors in the film also excel, but ultimately the film belongs to Kieran Culkin.""Igby Goes Down"" is a thought provoking work of genius with all round excellence in all departments. It might not win any awards (possibly the wrong time of year to really be in with an Oscars chance?), but this film provokes us to think in a way that not many films seem to do in recent years. Well worthy of watching, and well worthy of any praise it might receive.",Igby Goes Down
27,FilmOtaku,A film that will stay with you,7,14 July 2003,"My first thought when I finished watching this film was, `I can't believe I really enjoyed a film that starred a Culkin.'  My subsequent conclusions about the film were not as easily reached.When I decided to watch this film, I was expecting The Royal Tennenbaums: Part 2.  Rich family, the story takes place in a big city, eccentric characters.  While both films share these elements, they are very different in that I considered The Royal Tennenbaums to be mostly a comedy; while Igby's few comedic moments are so dark one almost feels badly for chuckling. What this film is really about is family, but not just in the traditional sense. (What is more traditional than a disapproving mother who is more concerned about herself than anyone else in the family, a clinically schizophrenic father, and two brothers: the elder a narcissist (if not practical) and the younger, a rebellious 16 year old who is forced to change schools more often than most of us change our Glade Plug-Ins.) It is about family in any sense: Friends, strangers, anyone Igby encounters and tries to gain acceptance from.  Culkin's Igby, who looks like a waifish Harry Potter without the `imp factor', is an extremely conflicted character.  We have seen rebellious types portrayed ad nauseum in films for decades, but it is a rare occasion when this person is both sympathetic and extremely intelligent.  The character draws you in enough that you actually want to know why he acts the way he does, and you truly want him to find happiness.  Unfortunately, it appears that when a door opens, it slams just as quickly.  Culkin is truly fantastic in this role.  He shoulders a character that is both intelligent enough to defend himself, yet vulnerable enough to give the impression of fragility.  The rest of the cast is also decent, particularly Jeff Goldblum as D.H., a larger than life character who is conflicted in his own right. The story was just complicated enough to keep me very interested, while endearing and thought-provoking enough for me to reflect on it long after it was over.  I'm not entirely sure who I would recommend this film to, but if you are looking for a thought-provoking drama with some great acting, dialogue and story line I would definitely check this movie out.  It has received some rave reviews and I believe they are well-deserved.",Igby Goes Down
28,lawprof,Igby Does Go Down But Not Fast Enough!,6,12 May 2003,"""Igby Goes Down"" is the low budget but high talent twenty-first century cinematic answer to ""The Graduate,"" a true gem from the troubled Vietnam War era.  Directed by Burr Steers, who in added commentary on the DVD version is obviously both unsatisfied with cuts made and unsure of the judgment he exercised in making them, this largely Manhattan with short travel digressions story gives us an adolescent anti-hero with little about him to admire and nothing to respect.Kieran Culkin is Igby, a spoiled kid who doesn't  rebel - he simply whines his way through life seeking gratification from others who, he thinks, owe him some sort of homage. In contrast to the The Graduate's earnest and somewhat naive Dustin Hoffman, this kid strives for a G.E.D., sex that only involves the body below the neck and drugs.Susan Sarandon could have been a devilish latter day Bette Davis if she was cut loose by the director.  Instead, she wobbles on the borderline between ""Mommy Dearest"" cruelty and poor-sitcom mothering. A fine chance for a terrific actress to inhabit a challenging role was wasted here.Similarly, the director never makes it clear if he wants Igby's godfather, D.H., Jeff Goldblum, to be a caricature or a complex fellow.  Neither does Goldblum.  Igby has an older brother, studying at Columbia, a fellow with a leaden voice and unexplainably flat affect.  Their father, briefly but well played by Bill Pullman, is in a mental hospital, the cause of his psychotic break unclear.So we seem to have a dysfunctional family.  But are they funny or tragic? I'm unsure.Two young women are important in Igby's life. Clair Danes is effective as Sookie Sapperstein (what's in a name?), Igby's friend.  Amanda Peet as Rachel is your typical young and ambitious New York artist with a bright future as a druggie.There are some surprises in the film.  Of course I won't relate them.""Igby Goes Down"" could have been a much stronger film.  An advantage of seeing it on DVD is the opportunity to both watch deleted scenes and assess the impact of their absence.  Usually, directors more or less unerringly sense when a scene can and should be cut.  This new director lacked the experience and sent at least two important scenes to the cutting room floor. But he did make a movie that is in parts interesting because of strong acting.Worth renting?  Yes.  But be glad if you didn't spend $10 to see it in a theater.6/10.",Igby Goes Down
29,movieguy1021,Igby Goes Down: 3/10,3,12 April 2003,"Many critics have called Igby Goes Down around the same caliber as The Royal Tenenbaums. Even fellow movie critic Steve Rhodes calls it `The Royal Tenenbaums Lite'. He disliked both films. I happen to have The Royal Tenenbaums as one of my favorite films ever, yet Igby Goes Down goes down as soon as we see the first scene.Jason `Igby' Slocumb, Jr. (Kieran Culkin) is first seen with his brother Oliver (Ryan Phillipe) killing their mother Mimi (Susan Sarandon). Then, we have over 90 minutes of boredom and torture as we see the life of Igby and those around. We don't really get to know any of them. The character development makes Old School seem like it had deep and thoughtful characters. About all we know about characters are their relationships with others, and that's it. Even with Igby, the main character, we don't know anything about, except that he's a misfit. Why? There's no motives behind anything anyone does, and things just `happen' without explanation. And that's not the worst of it.IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A COMEDY, BUT I DIDN'T LAUGH AT ALL! Even though it's billed as a dramedy, it still needs laughs in it! Going back to The Royal Tenenbaums, that was a dramedy also, but even in its ensemble, we got to know and care about the characters, and I LAUGHED! Burr Steers, director and writer, must have been thinking that this was the easy way out. Manipulate the audience into thinking that this is good, even though it has no laughs for a comedy and no poignancy for a drama. A drama has to be touching, at least a little, to be effective, but in Steers' script, it made me not feel for the characters, so I couldn't feel anything at the climax.Only Amanda Peet and Jeff Goldblum were able to work with this weak movie. Here's a good analogy for this movie: if, during the Inquisition, you were accused of being a heretic and were put on The Rack, where all of your joints would come out of their sockets, that's this movie. It's completely disjointed: we can't tell who's sleeping with whom, who is whose parents, etc. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON! Two things make this movie semi-worthwhile: Peet and Goldblum's acting and Peet's nude scene (her second!). Other than that, stay away like the plague, which is what you'll wish you'd infected with as your watching this, so you can be put out of your torture.My rating: 3/10Rated R for language, sexuality and drug content.",Igby Goes Down
30,majikstl,"""Good things come to obsessive-compulsives who fixate.""",7,31 May 2005,"IGBY GOES DOWN is desperately trying to be ""Catcher in the Rye"" but ends up being a crazy hybrid that suggests what Woody Allen might come up with if he tried to remake ORDINARY PEOPLE with the cast of characters from ""The Addams Family."" Writer-director Burr Steers has presented us with a script about oh-so sophisticated New Yorkers that is peppered with an abundance of witty one-liners, but which are delivered with all the deadpan emotional nuance usually displayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Terminator movies. This is a film with humor, but preciously little humanity.Igby, a.k.a., Jason Jr., is the youngest of the Slocumb family. He has a father, Jason Sr. (Bill Pullman), who is in the boobyhatch; an austere, repressive mother, Mimi (Susan Sarandon), whom he has hated for as long as he can remember; and an older brother, Ollie (Ryan Phillippe), who dutifully and unemotionally tidies up after everybody else with the cold, dispassionate efficiency of a faithful butler who secretly hates his job, his life and the world in general. To say that this family is dysfunctional is overpraising their mental health. We are given hints and insinuations that underneath these people are in pain and are genuinely worth caring about, but that is buried under multiple layers of hatred, contempt, self-pity, self-absorption, pettiness and snide repartee. This isn't a family; it is a group therapy session waiting to begin.As Igby, the petulant 17-year-old habitual liar, Kieran Culkin mopes through the film with a massive chip on his shoulder. The ""goes down"" of the title refers to how everybody individually, and life in general, seems to conspire to beat him up, sometimes quite literally. Even his psychiatrist slaps him around. The problem is that he seems to be deserving of being beaten down, or at least being taken down a notch or two -- yet, he seems to enjoy playing the martyr. He is a very unsympathetic individual, or as his brother Ollie points out ""If Gandhi had to spend a prolonged amount of time with you, he'd end up beating the **** out of you, too."" The film wants us to pity Igby, but Igby seems to be doing just fine lavishing pity on himself. However, his alienated youth persona would carry far more impact were it not for the fact that just about everybody in or near the Slocumb family strikes a similar pose of aloof indignation.Everybody, including Culkin, delivers solid performances in their one-note roles, though the emotionally sterile environment the film creates hardly inspires depth. The most subtle performance comes from Phillippe, who, though he seems to cater to his relatives out of a strained sense of duty, manages to instill in Oliver a flickering ember of hope that maybe there is something worth salvaging in this family. Igby's already gone down by the time the story starts, but Ollie has built up a reserve of denial and perseverance to survive. Deadpan as it might be, Ollie is the film's sole hint of optimism.Films about familial stagnation and disintegration (ORDINARY PEOPLE, THE ICE STORM, THE GRADUATE, etc.) generally build to a point where facades crumble and there is a catharsis, a moment where at least one character reaches, if nothing else, an understanding. IGBY GOES DOWN will have none of that; indeed, the closest thing the film offers that is even close to reconciliation or redemption is when the family unites for an assisted suicide. How positively ghoulish. This is a film about people who are incapable of love so it shouldn't be surprising that the film is incapable of human warmth. Indeed, it says something rather sad that the only way these characters can say ""I love you"" is by saying ""I don't hate you."" And the closest thing to praise this film deserves is that ""I don't hate it.""",Igby Goes Down
31,bix171,Preening,2,31 March 2003,"Pretentious. Burr Steers' directorial debut is the kind of black comedy that thinks it's appealing to its audience by taking broad swipes at the grotesquely idle rich but in reality has less contempt for the denizens of Steers' Manhattan social elite than for the uneducated viewers who won't get all the literary nuances the performers pithily deliver. Steers seems to think merely being offhand is funny and every line in his screenplay keeps trying to one-up the previous one, so he has each actor hurriedly dispense the droll bon mots. Not that the actors can really handle his stuff--with the exception of Ryan Phillippe, who has the preppie attitude down pat, everyone seems to be relying on their self-perceived hipness to provide appeal. The film itself is baldly influenced by J.D. Salinger's `The Catcher In The Rye' with Kieran Culkin playing a rebellious rich kid who goes on the lam from his insane family, particularly his spiteful, domineering mother (Susan Sarandon, who eventually conspires with Steers to resort to her usual technique of making a sympathy play), and hooks up with people populating his godfather Jeff Goldblum's wealthy, art-poseur world, including Amanda Peet (grossly overplaying her stock-in-trade, the selfish bitch), Jared Harris and Claire Danes. No one has a clear sense of why they're acting the way they do--virtually every motivation is half-realized and foreign to the viewer, with Steers' preening insistence that we accept on faith their over-privileged lunacy without never really needing to comprehend their behavior. The viewer will quite rightfully find that isn't nearly enough.",Igby Goes Down

Anyways, Igby Goes Down is about a young man named Igby(Kieran Culkin) who struggles with school, family and life. He can't stand being with his dying mother Mimi(Susan Sarandon) and his perfect older brother Oliver(Ryan Phillippe). Igby finally escapes and he goes to Manhattan to live with his Godfather's young sexy girlfriend Rachel(Amanda Peet)and also meanwhile he meets a older woman named Sookie(Claire Danes) and them two become friends and eventually lovers. But in all this, Igby is still not happy and he can't cope with the ugly and cold reality of growing up and not knowing what to do with the rest of his life. This movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, I often found myself bored and wondering when the movie was finally going to end. There are some fine performances in this movie, especially by Kieran Culkin and Claire Danes. But still i found the story to be somewhat of a mess, it just kept on going on and on without actually telling anything. I especially thought the ending was disappointing, I was expecting a big dramatic ending(I was imagining that Igby would commit suicide)but it was nothing like that.The movie had some funny moments but I would definitely not see it again.

33,tnrcooper,Acerbic but not glib,10,6 December 2010,"Sometimes I find films about eccentric rich families a bit too precious by half. Yes these might be goofy people with strange or unconventional habits, but unless we see some vulnerability, some sense that these characters are not soulless, and that they have some likable qualities, it is hard to muster any interest in their lives. Enough decency and empathy exist in the movie, and enough pain has been experienced that one feels that the behavior in the movie is not implausible or that of nitwits who have never known pain in their lives.This film is about some wealthy, eccentric folks in New York City, including one sensitive, smart boy named Igby (Kieran Culkin) and how he deals with some of the craziness that goes on around him, and in which he becomes involved.I liked this movie. The script was, as mentioned, acerbic without being glib. There is some amazing acting. Susan Sarandon just gets better with age, in this case embodying a woman whose self-absorption is seemingly boundless. Bill Pullman is exceptional as her ex-husband, haunted by the ghosts of mental illness. Ryan Phillippe plays a blue-blood named Oliver who is the half-brother of Igby. He knows he's a blue blood, is proud of it, but still may have a bit more sense than his half-brother who Kieran Culkin plays very well. He conveys the sensitivity, the passions, and the confusion which Igby feels regarding his place in his family and in society. Claire Danes excels as a woman named Sookie who he meets at a party in the Hamptons in whom Igby becomes interested. Jeff Goldblum gets a fun role as a high-rolling real-estate developer (think a more laconic Donald Trump) and he plays it to the hilt. Finally, Amanda Peet is exceptional as a troubled woman named Rachel who Igby also becomes interested in.The script is exceptionally good. It retains its acidity without veering into preciousness. First time director Burr Steers also wrote the script and deserves much credit for coaxing such a great number of excellent performances. New York features in such a lovely manner that it should practically get billing in this film.Ultimately, this is a lovely modern story whose heart might not want to fess up to being decidedly old-fashioned. This is a story about family, about friendship, about the demons that haunt people, and about how humans respond in sometimes mystifying ways.",Igby Goes Down

However, as we watch Igby wander about aimlessly, we also see a plot wander with him. There seems to be no real structure here. I realize that the story is not traditional and therefore maybe it should not be structured as so, but it could still be tightened up a bit. As the film starts to move toward a more structured storyline in the end, it starts to feel somewhat uninspired and dull. I guess you can't win for losing.

41,K-Slicer,What would Holden Caulfield say?,9,9 March 2003,"I am not sure what the original ticking time-bomb of adolescent destruction would give as his opinion of ""Igby Goes Down"" but I certainly can give mine. As a blanket movie fiend, I usually give most movies a great review even though they may be flawed as all hell.  In my mind, I think that Igby Slocumb and Holden Caulfield would be drinking buddies.  Both suffer from home lives that would make anybody rich or poor alike cringe.  I figured this movie not to be a really a skewering of the sad upper crust existence in NYC but an interesting story about a kid named Igby.  Here are my reasons for liking this film: (1) Kieran Culkin is the main reason that this film was so interesting.  He pulls together a really good performance with the script he was given. (2) Susan Sarandon plays one the most biting and spite-filled I have seen in cinema recently.  Her pill-popping performance was a bitter swallow for me too. (3) I am still a rather young pup in terms of watching movies but I found this to be a rather good script that was put together for the setting and theme presented. (4) A few lines from this movie are quoteworthy. (5) The soundtrack was excellent.  It really fit since most of the film was centered in bohemia land.  (6) Ryan Phillipe was just disturbingly rotten as Igby's brother. (7) As he meanders through the sometimes broken plot, Igby doesn't completely escape some deserving punishment that he brought on himself. (8) The plot twists were not surprising and they were not meant to be. (9) The film's conclusion was rather fitting considering the theme of the film.  Nine reasons gives this film a score of 9.The major downer for the film was the broken plot.  If this was meant to be a purely character driven piece, the plot would have been a bit simpler.  I believe Burr Steers was trying to write both a character piece that had a tough plot that could be contained in a time of 100 minutes.  To have a great character/plot piece, I think the writing needs to extend over a period of two hours.  Despite that, ""Igby Goes Down"" is an intriguing portrait of a rich kid on the brink of losing his sanity.  Holden Caulfield would probably buy Igby a bottle of something strong to ease the pain of his existence.  Overall, ""Igby Goes Down"" was worth my time.  Here ends my rant!",Igby Goes Down

It's a really strange combination, like you know why he does what he does, but surprises you beyond belief.He plays a rich boy who lives his life as a result of his father's tragedy, a man who went insane. The scene starts out with the two boys killing their mother. Yes, it went there. She's played by Susan Sarandon. Oh man, she plays the most passive aggressive controlling mother, who happens to have the wit and sarcasm that just brings her act all together.Igby (our main character) is determined not to live his life like his father, one that will lead to manic insanity. So he meets people unique to his circumstances and eventally we come to see why he and his brother ends up killing his mother. It's alright story wise, but great character wise.Except for the ho. She'll always be a ho, I hate her. You'll know. and she should not have been forgiven. HO. Freaking Claire Danes",Igby Goes Down
47,mwendel,Igby Searches for the Meaning of Life (Possible Spoilers),8,27 September 2002,"A dark film, with excellent characters, who display the darker side of today's capitalistic and vain realities through the trials and tribulations of Igby, the son of wealthy and privileged parents.  Igby is a young boy whose father mentally breaks down right in front of him at a young age.  His father's failure to cope and his mother's dictatorial self-indulgence (not to mention pill popping and drinking) reinforce the possibilities that the world is not how it is portrayed to the general public.  I believe Igby spends the entire movie acting on fear and the belief that his breakdown is just around the corner.  In trying to avoid the realities of life he finds himself surrounded by a cast of characters that are unreliable at best, because they have found ways to ""cope"" so to speak.Because of these characters, the film can be immensely frustrating and wrenching as you watch Igby.  He appears to accept abuse, beatings and betrayal, by supposed friends and family members, throughout the movie. Igby never seems to once lift a finger in his own defense. He seems to believe that there is no point in doing so and the truth about life, as he sees it, is that it is hopeless and the pressure of life will eventually crush him, as it did his father.Only in the end, with the rapid succession of the completion of his GED, the betrayal by his pseudo-girlfriend (with his older brother), the near death of his godfather's (apparently his biological father too) mistress and the death of his mother, does he actually break through the barriers of his own anger, apparently at the world and his mother, and make some peace with himself, allowing him to begin to heal and move on in his life.",Igby Goes Down
48,cheer88,Dramatic Sophistications but not Overwhelm,8,12 October 2015,"I watched this movie a long time ago. Recently, I picked it up on TV again and still felt fresh. I guessed that is what the good movie is about.To depict the adolescence without heavily focusing on additions and psycho behaviors seems merely impossible in Hollywood. This one struck down that and redefined the prospects. There were witty dialogues beyond four letter words we used to hear. The movie made you think but not too hard. I would say teenager audience out to seek this one instead of ""Paper Town"". We all were young once. Dysfunctional is no longer an adjective but a stage of life.There were partying, drinking and smoking scenes in this movie. However, they did not provoke me like ""Paper Town"" did. They transpired into the story line without the abruptness on their own. Although, brilliant story line and scripts are far in between. This one will stand on both ends.",Igby Goes Down
49,notmicro,Psycho Beach Party,5,3 May 2004,"Its like a prequel to ""Rules of Attraction"", showing the earlier lives of some of those sociopathic characters before they get unleashed on a university.In a way, it is a savage political satire, and a brilliant portrayal of segments of the wealthy drug-and-alcohol-addled psychopaths who own and operate USA Inc for their own benefit.  The brief appearance of Gore Vidal in a cameo role is amusing and ironic in this context.  It will be an interesting minor document for future historians studying the ""Decline and Fall of the American Empire.""Also I thought it was kind of creepy how much the camera seemed to enjoy kind of rubbing itself up against the half-naked body of a boy who is supposed to be under-age; sometimes it seemed like it was made for pedophiles.

50,RARubin,Igby Is Bad,3,15 February 2006,"The only redeeming feature of this ""Comedy"" is the pinpoint-perfect performance of the Waspy, preppy-bro, Ryan Phillippe. I suppose I thought this character capable of intelligent thought, but unfortunately, the script makes him do two so unfunny things, I can't reveal the horror without blowing the script.Look, I know everyone thinks Freud was wrong about homosexuality's derivation related to weak fathers and strong Ethel Merman like mothers, but this film is set up in such a way that I am convinced that the two brothers could not possibly be straight. I think that is a defect in the plot. Sexually they are normal, having sex with two beautiful girls, but, nahhh, I don't believe it from all the perversion of their world, why would they be straight? Black comedies are by definition laughs from unexpected sources, but we at least have to like the characters in a film to care about their problems. By the end of this film, I wanted Igby to do drugs and die.",Igby Goes Down
51,crypticcrytic,Too close for comfort,7,4 October 2002,"'Igby Goes Down' is loaded with characters without much to recommend them. Not that anyone needs to be perpetually perky, but the only sarcastic gesture missing from ""Igby Goes Down"" is the long-cadenced applause accompanied by the look of ennui. This is where the audience comes in.
Igby (Kieran Culkin) is about to make the leap from adolescence to the real world and since there's no evidence that he's ever even visited, there's no reason to expect a bright future. No, not another coming of age' serio-comic teen angst ridden screenplay! At least there's worthwhile talent to entertain us along the way.Igby has a cast of veterans we've enjoyed in other films. Susan Sarandon and Jeff Goldblum deserve each other though we see little of them on-screen together.  Haven't we seen enough of Ms. Sarandon lately? She is more likely to die of overexposure than of anything scripted in ""Moonlight Mile,""  ""The Banger Sisters "" or ""Igby."" Claire Danes plays `a vegetarian for purely moral reasons' who is partial to ice cream sundaes, though there's no evidence that she wears them. As a Bennington student taking a semester off, she has perfected an innocent/impatient air that is wonderful to watch.Jeff Goldblum portrays a one-dimensional capitalist with such panache that he becomes a pitiable. And then there's Igby, a young man who hasn't met a prep school he didn't dislike. We all know that a traditional education isn't for everyone and there are alternatives to consider but Mimi (Sarandon) was so intent on sending Igby to an eastern prep school that she was willing to sacrifice all to complete her mission... or die trying.Here are characters that deserved our disdain more than our sympathy, yet they are likeable.  Igby is a spoiled conniver and pathological liar. His brother Oliver (Ryan Phillipe) is an aloof twit who lacks the decency to mentor a younger brother in need.  Sarandon is a bitchy manipulator who has it her way then makes you feel bad about it.  These characters are real; believable people like those we know, associate and (yikes) love. Rather than love or hate ""Igby,"" perhaps we can identify with it.  And that's kind of sad.",Igby Goes Down
52,cheathamg,Not really worth the effort,3,14 March 2004,"This is an attempt to put on film the type of work that in literature is the output of what comes under the umbrella of the East Coast intelligentsia mafia.  Those authors seem to think that the story of a loser is good fun. They believe that pseudo-clever dialog, an amoral approach to decision-making and a lot of pointless activity culminating in somebody's life falling apart add up to a meaningful commentary on a world that to them is both intimidating and despicable.  Igby does not want to accomplish anything in life except to stay stoned and get laid apparently because his mother didn't love him enough and his father had a nervous breakdown.  The entire film is made up of scenes in which Igby screws up and is told off. Personally, I like a story in which somebody actually accomplishes something.",Igby Goes Down

55,underfire35,Terminally Quirky...,1,10 September 2003,"IGBY GOES DOWN is another entry in the ""oh-so-witty-screwed-up-teen"" genre. Every character is ingrained with so many quirks and clever asides that it is difficult to take any of them seriously. The only ones that escape from this mess intact are Susan Sarandon (who has been spreading herself rather thin) and Jeff Goldblum (former Mr. Blockbuster, who now toils in films like CATS & DOGS). These two actors represent the only above average aspects of IGBY GOES DOWN. The other actors range from serviceable (Danes, Peet) to bad, i.e. Kieran Culkin. (It's well time that the film industry cashes out of the Culkin family, they made money, great, move on and remember the good times.) Kieran Culkin simply cannot carry this film, even though it is light-weight fare, and does not require much from any of the actors.The plot follows the exploits of Igby, a spoiled recalcitrant brat, who upset with his life escapes to New York. There amongst carefully chosen colorful locales he becomes embroiled in the lives of his uncle, his uncle's coked-out mistress, the cartoonish drag queen she lives with, etc... He falls in love and deals drugs, hates his mother, blah, blah. All this set to a trendy soundscape of top-forty pop songs and a score that desperately wants to have been composed by Thomas Newman. Oh yeah, Igby also has a painful past involving his mentally-ill father (Bill Pullman), which by the revelation in the third act, gains little ground in explaining why Igby is an ***hole.I simply do not understand the praise this film has received. Other than being slap-handedly amateurish in its handling of the material, it is for the most part poorly acted. The sloppy sentiment that crops up whenever the film decides to care about what is going on, doesn't help either. The most complex thing about Igby is the dialogue he spouts, but it sounds written, rehearsed. Quirky does not equal good--Igby reminds me of an ornate marsh reed...yes, on the outside it may seem interesting, but on further inspection it is simply hollow. 1/10.",Igby Goes Down
56,fatcat-73450,"Come for the Cast, Stay for the Dialogue",9,27 October 2021,"Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum, and the kid from Home Alone (1992)...OK, not literally the kid from Home Alone, but his twin brother...OK, not literally his twin brother, but his brother who looks and talks exactly like him.This is the story of what one would call the ""aristocracy"" of New York. The characters are the pampered, entitled, nonchalantly confident members of the wealthy class or the intelligentsia of New York.Igby, played by Something Culkin, is a Holden Caufield-esque rich brat who hates his family. The film is mostly about him meandering around New York, meeting women, attending social events, and trying to stay away from his mother and brother, who are trying to straighten him out or, barring that, get rid of him.He claims he hates his brother because of his political beliefs. It does indeed look like the sibling has a more uptight personality than him. It's unclear why he hates his mother, but she's shown to be domineering and uptight as well. You can essentially sum it up as a biography about an emo kid raging over first-world problems.There are some good plot twists and you get to see Goldblum in as close to an action role as I think he's ever done. The directing is also well-done - calm, serene, and what I would characterize as ""clean drama"" directing.Yet the star of the show here is the dialogue. The writer of this film could be the next Oscar Wilde. The dialogue is among the wittiest I've heard in film and the actors really deliver it and play off of each other well. It reminds me of ""The Importance of Being Earnest.""Honourable Mentions: 1: OC and Stiggs (1987) is stylistically very similar in terms of the pacing and camera work. It's also similar in other regards. It's about two characters without real problems who are determined to make some up to pass the time. And they're impossibly smooth and calm while doing it.2: Quigley Down Under (1990): A cheap white saviour action flick about an American (Tom Selleck) who saves aboriginals in Australia with a modified supergun and the skills to wield it. It has no connection to this movie except for the title which is, amusingly, very similar.",Igby Goes Down
57,jbirks106,Groan alone,3,3 August 2014,"This movie has the initial feel of ""Harold and Maude,"" at least in its portrayal of a young man of privileged upbringing, hell bent on defying his parents, who are daft, overbearing or, in the case of ""Igby"" certifiably insane. Just two problems: one, Kieran Culkin is no Bud Cort, and two, Burr Steers is no Hal Ashby. And a third problem: if there is a plot to ""Igby"" I couldn't find it. Or maybe I just couldn't be interested enough to find it.There are plenty of good actors in the film -- Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman -- but their characters are mostly one-dimensional. None are particularly likable, or even dis-likable. They simply exist for Igby to respond to (usually in a sarcastic, juvenile manner that does not age well). Igby himself is interesting enough for awhile, but there comes a point in a picture where the central character has do do something worth watching. Aside from a fling with Sookie, which you know from the start has no future, Igby does little but project an ironic pose. Until the end, that is, when he beats his mother's corpse. Had we seen more of that side throughout the film, this could have been an effective scene; instead it's just ludicrous.Maybe a good actor could've filled that character with more than mordant wit. But Culkin is not that actor. I can't believe he was Steers' first choice, but then again Steers must have approved the script too. He may aspire to be Hal Ashby but the Nora Ephron in him is too much to overcome.The only reason to give this movie a shot is the photography. The scenes of downtown New York, and the interior set design, are truly marvelous.",Igby Goes Down

Give me a break. Spoiled little jerk. This is the kind of film that makes a person hate rich people, especially rich New Yorkers. (If it had been released a little earlier, I could see Al-Qaeda using this movie to inspire recruits to fly planes into NYC skyscrapers - oh, what? Too soon?)

I was surprised by a good, albeit slightly unfocused movie.

But even in black comedies, people laugh.  No one laughed.  People with full buckets of popcorn were getting up in the middle of the movie and leaving.  It had occurred to me to do the same, something I have never done. I found nothing insightful or even artistic about this, unless you think that walking out of a theatre feeling chilled to the bone by a set of characters you wanted to have some feelings for, but you can find no reason to feel for them -- if this is artistic, then art sucks.  This was not art. It was a self-indulgent wallowing in pity for shallow, spoiled people who deserved no pity.If you waste your money on this movie, as I did, don't say you weren't warned.  Again, I had high expectations of this film.  God, I hate film reviewers who think anything ice cold must certainly be art.

The acting was good and some characters I wouldn't go as far as saying that they were realistic, but I don't think the movie was actually depending on these characters to act with a sense of realism, they needed to feel cold and jaded.  It felt that every character in the movie was spoil by money or greed except Igdy, I guess because he was to busy thinking of what happen to his father, I guess that's why he wanted to go to the 'sunshine state' cause he felt like he had a cloud over him.

The plot has many similarities to two other coming-of-age stories catcher in the rye and this side of paradise, not to mention its many filmic antecedents, such as the graduate. The script is rife with great dialogue and loaded with quirky characters straight out of the canon fitzgerald and salinger. Also, directed and filmed rather conventionally with too much annoying hippie music. This film isn't startlingly original or innovative on a cinematic level but it uses standard cinematic techniques and narrativity quite well.

Although, the film is nowhere near as powerful as Salinger's novel, writer and director Burr Steers has made an indelible film about teenage rebellion. Kieran Culkin comes into his own with a career-making performance as Jason 'Igby' Slocumb Jr. Right off the bat, we learn about Igby's rather dysfunctional family. His pill-popping and neglectful mother (Susan Sarandon in a icy yet hysterical performance), his schizophrenic father and prep-school jerk brother (Ryan Phillipe). Igby does not see eye-to-eye with his family, particularly his mother, whom he blames for his father's mental breakdown. Igby constantly p***es of his mother, by taking some of her pills and getting kicked out of school after school. Igby refusing to 'go down' like his father, decides to leave home and make it on his own. He leaves to Manhattan, where he goes on a rather bizarre, yet memorable adventure to find himself.Kieran Culkin has certainly come a long way from his sappy turns in 'Father of the Bride' and 'Nowhere to Run'. Here he rises above the material to create a sarcastic and emotionally charged character. It's an award-caliber performance that was sadly overlooked when the Oscars came rolling around.

Bad move, because the rest of the characters in this film you will find impossible to emphasize with, and about 45 minutes into the movie you'll probably actually be wishing death upon Igby himself.

72,imdbfilmcricket,"Half emotional, half intellectual",8,20 October 2002,"Igby Goes Down is a study of the title character, a 17-year-old boy struggling to break free from a difficult family situation.  Igby, ably played by Kieran Culkin, escapes the grasp of his domineering mother (the superb Susan Sarandon) for a period of time and rattles around New York City, where sex, drugs and violence are everywhere.  Igby lacks direction.  His only plan is a vague idea of moving to California, but he seems to have no idea what he will do when he gets there. In the mean time, he finds a place to stay in New York with the mistress (Amanda Peet) of his godfather (Jeff Goldblum) but that gets complicated.  A relationship with a girl he meets at a party (Clare Danes) is more meaningful and involving but that situation gets complicated also, with the arrival of Igby's brother (Ryan Phillippe).  We've seen this type of set-up before, but first-time director Burr Steers gives us an interesting blend of intellect and emotionalism that avoids listing too far in either direction.  The humor in this film wryly points out the inherent absurdity of life and makes the difficult bits easier to deal with, much the same as it is in the real world.The acting is first-rate here.  Bill Pullman has a short but intense turn as the boys' father and Susan Sarandon does her usual excellent job.  Kieran Culkin shows a lot of promise; it will be interesting to see what he accomplishes in the future.The great shame is that this film has received neither publicity nor wide distribution.  It seems early in the year for it to be merely a brief release for Oscar consideration, but I hope that's the case and a reasonable amount of publicity and wider release will follow.",Igby Goes Down

74,Nog,"Rather pointless, I'd say",2,23 December 2012,"Igby is sort of like Holden Caulfield, but without a serious thought in his head. It's hard to either like or dislike the character, since we only have his cheeky one-liners to define it. The people around him are quite horrible in their own unique ways, so that kinda makes him look better, but they are basically one-dimensional manifestations of various narcissistic types. So, the setup is that Igby is your basic disaffected youth, presumably intelligent (although that is never really established), navigating amongst these jerks for most of the film. It didn't seem quite plausible that these women would be so anxious to sleep with him -- Culkin has this sort of baby-fat thing with his face, he's rather short, and he doesn't seem to do anything to warrant such instant passion. The film goes on and on, without a bit of dramatic tension, only a series of scenes that I suppose are meant to elucidate the incredible range of self-conscious egos striving for hipness in the Big Apple. There are scenes that should really draw the audience in for some emotional connection to Igby's difficulty with his parents, but once the one-liners flee the screen, so does any hope for believable drama. And there's one of the weakest endings I've seen in some time. What is most surprising is that Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman read this script and decided they wanted to be part of this mess. Perhaps the only point is to draw attention to how many phonies there are in the world. Problem is, Holden already did that about 60 years ago.",Igby Goes Down

76,tastyworm,Comfortably Raw,8,20 January 2004,"""I feel this great, great pressure - coming down on me. It's just constantly coming down on me. Crushing me."" Burr Steers' (co-writer of `How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days') film 'Igby Goes Down' is a black comedy set in New York around an 'almost 18 year old' boy named Jason Igby' Slocumb Jnr. (Kieran Culkin). Igby is a deeply troubled boy; constantly barraged and insulted by his overpowering, overbearing, drug-filled, cancer-suffering mother, Mimi (Susan Sarandon) who has already driven his father Jason (Bill Pullman) schizophrenic after a nervous breakdown. Igby's brother Oliver (Ryan Phillipe) is a neatly groomed scholar who always manages to somehow taint any little successes that Igby derives  causing Igby to suffer further.
Getting to know Igby doesn't take long. He is a drug taking, smart-mouthing and yet surprisingly innocent adolescent - displaying the only behaviour that seems to help him survive his surroundings and neurotic family. His god-father D.H. (Jeff Goldblum), a wealthy professional developer, takes Igby under his wing in a half-hearted attempt to groom him into something which Igby will never become. Along the way, Igby meets Rachel (Amanda Peet) who gives him a temporary room to stay and Sookie (Claire Danes) who provides him with a bit of temporary sanity through her care and advice. Culkin's performance exceeded any expectations I had; but with the exception of Jeff Goldblum, the actors in this film seem to have been stereotypically cast, which, surprisingly, is very effective in this instance. The audience, who has no doubt seen the cast before in other films, is given a small amount of stability in an otherwise unstable film. This film will not be everyone's cup of tea; it is raw in many ways and is certainly not a happy film  but it is a wonderfully told story with rich characters played almost flawlessly by a string of great actors.",Igby Goes Down

When it first started I could tell I was in for a treat. The first scene had me in tears. All the characters in this film are great some unlikeable and some lovable. The actors playing this characters played them to perfection especially Kieran Culkin, Susan Sarandon, Jeff Goldblum etc. By the time it was finished I left with a smile on my face because I rarely go to the cinema and this time I left there satisfied with what I just saw.Overall I gave this independent movie an 8 out of 10.",Igby Goes Down
78,karalynnn,Definitely worth the rental price,8,2 May 2005,"Igby Goes Down is great drama, I didn't get much of a dark comedy vibe from it at all. Kieran Culkin gives a sensational performance as Igby. Culkin plays Igby as a great, sarcastic, punk, and I imagine it is the sarcastic remarks that run through the whole of the movie that puts Igby Goes Down in the Comedy Genre. Sarandon is a great overbearing mom. Some of the more dramatic moments are played so well by Culkin that I had to take pause and just absorb it for a moment. This is a unique piece of story telling and execution definitely worth seeing. I did find the movie dragged some near the end but overall a top notch effort by all parties.",Igby Goes Down

The slutty women he comes across?  His philandering God-father?  Not to mention his mother or brother.  I hated every person, as not one of them had a single redeeming quality.

All those things he said that weren't clear to him seemed very clear to me. Yes, Susan Sarandon's character did give birth to both of the boys; except that one was illegitimate by Jeff Goldblums character, and the other was her real son from her husband who was driven crazy by her meddling. Whereas the other reviewer felt that Igby was a mess of a movie and compared it to The Royal Tennenbaums (which I agree was an utter mess and thoroughly unenjoyable), I felt that Igby was a refreshing black comedy. Which is exactly what you get when you cross comedy and drama. It has a lot of heart, excellent and insightful direction, real wit and sharpness in it's approach to the material... I thoroughly enjoyed it. It came across as a cerebral experience for me. Highly recommended.",Igby Goes Down

83,sommerjd,Jeff Goldblum Wasted Again....,5,22 February 2003,"This is a quirky little movie that ultimately leaves a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. Perhaps that's inevitable in a film about dysfunctional relationships, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. It's a coming of age movie about young Igby, his brother, and his overbearing mother. The movie, while surprising at times, follows the predictable arc by the end. There are some excellent performances here by Kieran Culkin in the lead role, Claire Danes, and Susan Sarandon. Perhaps the most affecting performance, small as it is, is given by Bill Pullman, whose work is sensitive and moving. It's always great to see Jeff Goldblum on screen, but once again it's a shame that Goldblum (and Michael Keaton, for that matter) appears so rarely as the lead in a comedy; they are simply the most talented comic actors--not comedians--of their generation, talents sadly misused and underused.OK, so to get back to business: I'm sure glad I didn't fire up the family chariot, drive to the multiplex, and fork out $20 for two tix to this film. It was worth a rental fee and the comfort of my living room. I won't watch it again, however.",Igby Goes Down

Every scene this inept little actor are in are doomed to be boring, unconvincing and full of bad acting.(almost the whole movie ) The women in the movie finds his charms completely beyond their control and he gets his way with them. His brother Oliver(phillipe) and his so called Godfather dad (goldblum) goes for 2nds It difficult to give a review about a movie without meaning but its got goal.To teach the young generation it good to take pills with booze, its cool to smoke weed, it cool to be without any goal in life, but look what it did to his older brother Mr. ex home alone star.

All of the actors were great, the script was great, the plot was um... interesting.  All of the actors were perfect for their characters, and I would not have chosen any other actor for the parts in the movie.  Kieran Culkin is one of my favorite actors and I have been dying to see this movie. It was worth the wait!  I bought it from Blockbuster, and I was shocked that they actually had it, because this movie is not extremely well known. But I really reccomend this movie to ANYONE.  I also sensed a bit of Girl, Interruptedness from the movie, kind of like the male version, only without the mental institution(Kind of).  Kieran Culkin is an excellent actor.  My only complaint about him was that sometimes he would mumble and I couldn't understand what he was saying.  GREAT MOVIE!  But it could have been longer, but I guess it was Burr Steers's idea to leave the audience wondering.

Although, a lot of things happen in the film, it just never came together. It is a very well acted film from a good cast. I felt sorry for the father Jason because he has schizophrenia and is placed in a mental institution. Mimi is a bad mother that is hooked on painkillers and sleeping pills because she had breast cancer in the past and never stopped taking the pills. Her two kids Igby and Oliver makes it clear, especially Igby, that they hate her and they don't care if she dies even after she gets breast cancer again. Igby is a confused teenager that doesn't know what he wants. His brother Oliver is a coincident preppy that wants to follow in a family friend's footsteps. D.H. is that family friend, as well as Igby's Godfather. He is a rich man that only thinks about money and how to make more of it. Igby just wants to get away from everybody and leave it all behind him. A few remember able scenes in the film, but no remember able dialogue that stands out.

And that is something that I don't understand, or maybe I do, because this is not the typical Hollywood feel-good movie. The story could have been based on a early nineties novel by Jay McInerney or Bret Easton Ellis, but it is an original screenplay by writer and director Burr Steers. The mood is very dark, the acting is top shelf and the oneliners are sharp as razorblades. Kieran Culkin and Ryan Philippe are perfectly (type)casted and the choice of music is plain wonderful. The scene where Igby runs off through Central Park accompanied by Coldplay's Don't Panic is close to perfection.

The plot is stupid. It's not believable. I can only surmise that the actors in this film either needed the money or owed someone a favor--they HAD to know that this was a dog of a script; I can't imagine this looking any better on the printed page than it does with the words issuing from the actors' mouth. The actors did the best they could--Sarandon is unlikable (her part calls for that), Goldblum is is suitably callous and cretinous, but the thing just doesn't work. There's no polite way to say it--this film stinks on ice. I would not advise anyone save my worst enemy to watch this hot mess. It's awful. I offer two stars in recognition of the technical work; the camera work, the lighting, the set decoration, even the wardrobes are quite good, and of course, the people who did the continuity work, etc., did a fine job.

91,slonob,Smartly Awful,2,20 April 2003,"Upon seeing ""The Royal Tannenbaums,"" I was convinced that Hollywood would soon be putting the director under the microscope, trying to figure out just what it is that is so appealing about a Wes Anderson.  Anderson has great writing, great casting, great comic timing, and tops it off with great sound-tracks.  Like his films or not, it's hard not to appreciate his style.""Igby Goes Down"" is the first I have seen that tries to capture Anderson's style.  As clones tend to go, it only has a superficial quality.  As it struggles to claim the essence of Anderson's approach, it seems to care little about whether or not any of it adds up to a film worth watching. 
Like an Anderson Igby has a quirky cast.  In Anderson's films, we see the actors at their best.  In Steers' they seem disinterested and are certainly not at their best.  Susan Sarandon, for example, seems to dig up her role in ""Stepmom"" then adds a few digits to the character's income.
Anderson's writing reflects his literary interest.  In particular, the characters of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" seem to be the progeny of Salinger's characters.  They are not replicas, but they seem to have come up in the same world.  Steers seems not to stray much further than the Hollywood canon.  Steers has gone on to write the kind of shallow movie we expect from Hollywood, ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.""Anderson's grasp of comedy is his greatest asset.  He uses visual gags, off-beat timing, and grounded dialog to deliver the laughs.  Steers seems to recognize the dull thud of his delivery as he spruces them up with punchy mood music that seems not unlike a banner reading ""laugh here.""The sound-track in an Anderson film seems very relevant to the story.  It embellishes the characters.  It reveals mood.  He selects the music across many genres.  As with The Faces' 'Ooh La La', his sound-tracks have reintroduced some forgotten gems.  Steers seems to have strayed only a safe distance from the FM dial.  His sound-track never really matches up with mood of any given scene.  It often feels inserted.With all of the failures of ""Igby Goes Down,"" what is disappointing to me is that Steers managed to pull the wool over the eyes of many critics.  Perhaps you will not buy the premise that this film wants to be a Wes Anderson, but I'm sure you will not think it is so original that it ""came out of left field.""  The tone, the sound-track, the subject matter all add up to an Anderson clone.  Heck, the critics even make the same parallels to Salinger.I actually found myself thinking of another awful film, ""Kalifornia."" ""Kalifornia"" was as out of touch with what was hip, while trying desperately to be hip.  It was as irrelevant to the world with its mockish understanding of what makes people tick.  It was also written from a remote, elitist perspective not unlike listening to a cafe-fed, urban intellectual pontificating about the fly-over country he knows nothing about. 
When you find yourself appreciating a movie as a ""character study,"" perhaps alarms should go off.  This is a euphemism for ""I wasn't really all that entertained, but I understand the complexity it wanted to portray.""  If it failed to entertain, it failed period.  If the complexity wasn't as complex as it could have been, it wasn't ultimately complex.  When will these studied characters find themselves in a film worth watching?  The audience need not be afraid to dislike a film that wants to be so smart.  It might simply be posing as a smart film.  By association, you just might appear to be posing.",Igby Goes Down

I saw it twice in a week, owing to scheduling on my satellite package, and enjoyed it even more the second time.The script is unashamed about the sheer awfulness of adolescence and reminded me of how clever, smart and in control I too THOUGHT I was at Igby's age. The central performance by Kieren Culkin is a gem and when he's 40, he'll look back and wonder how he could have been this good, this young.The other performances are also sterling, including Susan Sarandon, playing a mother with claws, Ryan Phillippe as a near-psychotic WASP, Jeff Goldblum as a steely, oversuccessful godfather and a touching performance by Amanda Peet.I suppose for those with chips on their shoulders, the mega-rich New York glitterati setting might be offputting, but I didn't find it so.As an added bonus, the music soundtrack is great.",Igby Goes Down

Igby Goes Down didn't really leave me with a strong feeling after I flicked it off, but along the way it was very amusing. The characters are sort of cliched: the older achiever brother, the younger scamp troubled troublemaker brother, the pernicious mother who tries to force her son back on the ""right track.""

95,exeter-10,Excellent performances,8,18 January 2003,"Between this film and ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"", Kieran Culkin has come into his own, instead of just being known as ""that Home Alone kid's little brother"". Claire Danes also gives perhaps the best performance of her movie life here. The scene between Culkin and Danes that takes place on both sides of a door late in the film is poignant and powerful, and Jeff Goldblum seems as if he was made to play the part of DH. Susan Sarandon is wonderful, and I'm normally not a fan of Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillipe, or Bill Pullman, but each of them delivered in a surprising way. In this film, sometimes facial expressions do just as much as a line can, which is excellently shown in a scene with no dialogue between Goldblum and Peet in a restaurant.The story of the film isn't what I took to be the main focus of the movie, so much as the characters and their interactions between each other. While I found myself getting involved in the plot, I found myself even more anticipating how the characters acted toward each other.
Some people appear not to have liked this movie because they thought it was a comedy going into it. Don't be fooled, it isn't. The subject matter is often heavy and dramatic. But the dialogue is so laden with great clever lines and witty retorts (mostly by Igby), that one can't help laughing at the frankness of the main character, as well as some of the situations he gets himself into. If you're looking for an epic tale into the human psyche, or a side-splitting comedy, you're not going to find it. But if you want a compelling and powerful story with some Oscar-quality acting performances, check this one out.",Igby Goes Down

It really wasn't much more than a gritty coming of age movie about a punk-ass teenager, but it did that very well, and not in a popcorn-teenage-movie kind of way. Kieran Culkin can act, and seems to be picking up where his older brother left off career-wise. Ryan Phillippe continues to disappoint me with yet another sterile performance -- it looks like we might have the next Christian Slater on our hands, but Phillippe's flaccid performance wasn't enough to drag the film down.Bottom line: 7/10",Igby Goes Down
97,donqt,"the last days of ""innocence""",8,17 June 2002,"I associate Burr Steers with Whit Stillman because of his appearance in Stillman's last film.  I was not, therefore, surprised by the style, tone, or content found in Igby.  There's a similar take on wit, a coolness of character, and a not unfamiliar somewhat decadent but empty (though full of people) urban landscape.Sarandon, Goldblum, Danes, Phillippe, and Pullman are all delightful in the ways that they are often delightful.  We get something a bit new (but not less shallow than other supporting characters that they've played) from Goldblum and maybe Sarandon.  D, P and P are the same old, but old pleasures are often good pleasures.Culkin, meanwhile, hits his stride with his (marginally more optimistic) take on a Holden Caulfield-esque character.  Where Home Alone allowed Culkin's brother one note to hit again and again, Culkin here, in a in the cusp of adulthood, is allowed the two or three notes that are appropriate. And hit them well he does.I'm not sure how well this film will play in Peoria, or anywhere else outside of the urban centers.  There's a prep school feel to it all (as if it assumes that you too, have a certain kind of education) that is more exclusive than, say, Wes Anderson's films.  Anderson, perhaps, wants to introduce the general public into the lives of his characters with equal access.  Steers, it seems, assumes that you already understand.  Of course, this sort of thing appeals to me, just as Stillman's Metropoliton appealed to me.  If you dislike that sort of thing, however, you may find yourself at odds with this film.",Igby Goes Down
98,rwtmoore,Pretty awful,1,10 March 2008,"The acting, direction and music are very good. But the writing sinks the ship. There's no cause and effect for any of the characters' actions and there are many incredibly implausible situations. It tries so hard to be quirky, cute, poignant and trendy, but there's no substance.Why would two attractive twenty-something women immediately hop in the sack with a scrawny, whiny seventeen-year-old boy who has nothing to offer. It runs contrary to my experience. I didn't find a single thing he said to be in the least bit witty. And his constant swearing, no matter the company he's in, would probably get his skull cracked in the real world at some point. But here, no one even mentions it. I guess we're supposed to be shocked and amused that everyone is so blasé about it.All the characters are despicable, especially Igby. Jokes were inserted that had no set up and things happened that had no connection to the story. And there were so many implausible situations it became tiresome. For example, the bit with Mimi sitting on the maid's head. Why? She was having a bad day, so she beat up the maid? It's not funny because it makes no sense. We don't even know the maid. Since there's no set-up, there's no payoff. Also, when Igby is in bed with Sookie, he's says that military school made everything clear to him. She asks, ""like what,"" and he says, ""the fight."" Then there's a flashback to his father's breakdown in the bathroom - no fight. When Sookie and Igby are in the park, why do the field hockey girls swear like troopers? How does this move the story along? Is it supposed to be funny? Another preposterous situation is when when he asks Sookie if she's a vegetarian based on the way she roles a joint. Come on. This film had a few nice scenes but I found it hard to swallow that so many people in it thought that Igby was witty and charming. If he was, the film would have worked a lot better, but as it is he's arrogant and dimmed-witted - but in a trendy way.",Igby Goes Down

The last 25%-30% of the movie seemed a little longer than I would have liked, but maybe that is because I was starting to get a bit tired.....this is a movie that one should be awake when they see; not because there is a difficult plot to follow, but because there is no extreme action or humor to grab your attention and wake you up.

100,rutger19,igby is up!,10,20 September 2005,"Hey there, Igby goes down is a great movie. Meet Igby Slocumb (Kieran Culkin), a young, yet full grown cynic boy who just can not fit in with his family and environment. He will do anything to frustrate his mother and drops out of school constantly. ""Igby goes down"" is a dark comedy (or sometimes named bittersweet) and like many other fine (often indie) American movies in this genre the last years it stands out for me as the best one (Garden state, Buffalo '66, confessions of a dangerous mind, ghost world, about schmidt, requiem for a dream, to die for, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, secretary, election, rushmore, donnie darko, lost in translation, American psycho and some others.) They all contain elements of comedy combined with visible, believable drama. The comedy is not explicit, but reflects more the absurd (corrupted) world in which the modern Western peoples sometimes live in.What I think is great about this movie is that you learn why Igby has become like this. Even though Igby is a slacker, you will like him immediately from the first scene. Igby is actually a normal boy who doesn't care much for the superficialities his family (mother Suasan Sarandon & father Bill Pullman) smothers him with. In fact, he only cares much for his dad, a mental patient.Igby runs away from school and house and meets some great characters; his real father's heroin junkie mistress (gorgeous Amanada Peet), her transvestite room mate, a slightly older college girl next door who he falls in love with (Claire Danes). Yeah, Igby is living the life, but like all good things, it comes to an end when reality steps in. His brother steals his girlfriend. His roommates slip further into drugs and Igby must return home to his mother. She has become sick and in a confronting euthanasia scene Igby can finally come to terms with her. He can even come to terms with his numb half brother (Ryan Phillipe), a stiff, young republican, college boy.Forget those stupid Oscar movies. They are either unmanly tearjerkers or unfairly lobbied into winning by scheming execs. Develop your own taste. Revolution now, art has to be made! Anyway highly recommended",Igby Goes Down
101,dbcooper-3,Igby Goes Down to Hollywood (contains spoilers),1,9 May 2006,"This is supposed to be a comedy, but it is really a eulogy to all the things that Hollywood values (money, sex and drugs in unlimited quantities, and I almost forgot, euthanasia as well). That may explain why it isn't really funny. Igby's brother is marginalized in the film because he is a fairly straight student at Columbia (meaning that he will eventually graduate and do the unthinkable - work for a living, even if it is for one of his mom's rich friends). The brother provides an interesting foil to Igby, who gets away with just about everything, and is pretty nasty while doing it too.As a coming of age film it does not work either simply because it is so nasty. In coming of age films the protagonists (if they don't die like James Dean did in ""Rebel Without A Cause"") presumably learn something about life. Igby learns nothing from anybody, not ever, and is totally abrasive in the process.The most fitting part of the film the end when Igby takes the bus to California (presumably Hollywood) where he can live happily ever after in his wanton ways. That is what we are supposed to think anyway, that Igby's life will be one continuous Hollywood party. However the real end of Igby once he makes it to Hollywood will be something like dying from a heroin overdose under the Santa Monica Freeway.For a good coming of age/teen rebellion film, try ""Harold and Maude"". It is a lot wittier with the gratuitous nastiness of Igby. When H&M was made the coming of age genre was showing signs of wear, but not completely worn out. Whenever I see a film like Igby I think that Hollywood has nowhere to go but up, but I always end up being wrong. Apparently the well of vapidity has not run dry yet.",Igby Goes Down

Nevertheless, the velvet-jacketed, argyle-sweatered, knit-scarved armies of ironists that comprise young white culture today are all bit too anemic and muddle-headed for me to even get upset about. That is, like the sort of people who must be its fan base, ""Igby Goes Down"" ultimately annoys in a vague, wheedling, sort of way, like a small insect stuck in your bedroom at night. It keeps making thrusts and feints at your ear, and you keep batting it away, hoping that it will find the crack under the door.In the final analysis, there is nothing really objectionable about the film. It is not poorly written or acted (Kieran Culkin is wooden, but that seems to be called for in this part), but it seems to want to be thought of as erudite, or at least, clever and snarky. One of the other commentators on this site compared it favorably to ""The Graduate"". That person obviously watched the older film with the ""mute"" button on the entire time. The perversity and wackiness of ""The Graduate"" is of a degree and kind that people like Wes Anderson and Burr Steers only dream of attaining in their product. Maybe part of the problem is a lack of identity with us ""normal"" or ""average"" folk (there are fewer hipsters of the Anderson stamp that you might think). That is, in order to subvert ""white middle class culture"" (whatever that means these days) you have to be a card-carrying member of it to begin with.By comparison to Wes Anderson, people like John Hughes and Mike Nichols are Average Joes. That's why their efforts are going to outlast the Andersonian wackiness. By the way, don't misunderstand me; I'm not holding up Hughes or Nichols as examples of ""great"" or ""profound"" art or anything like that. Let's keep in mind that we are talking about 20th and 21st century American film, a debased form to begin with. Examined against that yardstick, ""Igby"" is not terrible -- it's just very, very forgettable.",Igby Goes Down

I know that it may be reality for some people, but the movie offers no hope for those struggling with such a life.  I see no point in making a movie dealing with these circumstances unless you offer a chace at redemption, a better life.  Why make a movie that is just depressing?  Don't we have enough real sadness?

Of course this dysfunctional family biopsy does not fully lack charisma or originality. The defeated father and over-bearing matriarch foundation combined with the alienated youth did elicit a socio-sympathetic intrigue with a fairly fresh angle.So Mommie Dearest (1981) is afflicted with cancer, constantly drugged, and later killed by her own offspring; the godfather's youthful play-thing OD's from bunk heroine (given to her by the ambiguously effeminate 'friend') and gets cast aside like an old rag; the protagonist's love interest is sexually exploited...I guess I'm just not one of those who revels in such thick misogyny... and much less when it accomplishes so little for thematic development. And taking advantage of the momentum here, after all of that drama, after the entire film really, I'm left asking.... so what?Most alluring was the wit-ridden/infused dialogue, which certainly added a satisfying dynamic to the film, but there was a certain homogenous aspect to this between characters, rendering them mere messengers for an, albeit clever, yet nonetheless flat script.I rather enjoy leaving a theater feeling ""Well, my life's not as bad as that guy's"" but this film even denies the chance for that as young Igby :----- NEVER HAS TO WORK! -----(DISCLAIMER: those die-hard, dedicated dealers out there will most likely sympathize... peddling someone else's candy doesn't exactly constitute hard labor.)But any film brave enough to snub the stereotypical aristocratic tier for its failed pretentious values should be shared for its inherent social commentary, methinks.The film was very well technically produced, Susan Sarandon was great, Kieran kept the beat, Claire Danes looked 'real, real nice', but the cast boasts big-time money and the film screams big-cast gimmick.... and that's all the love I've got for Igby.2 n' a halfer outta 4, tops",Igby Goes Down

This film, with a few exceptions, is a modern adaptation of Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. I would be pissed, but Steers creates such a wonderful film. Truly exceptional.The degeneration of Amanda Peet was truly painful to watch for anyone who has seen this happen in real life. The same with Bill Pullman, his marginalization due to illness was a blow my heart still has yet to recover from. And the betrayal of Sookie Sapperstein is so painfully authentic that anyone who has suffered that kind of senseless, unprecipitated heartbreak cannot help but fall inside.Some of the best aspects of Holden Caulfield have been lost in this port of Salinger's work, but they have been replaced with aspects of Jason Slocumb you never expected to find.

Or rather, try to understand them. You know the plot by now, and yes it concerns the demons that haunt many of the upper class.  And yes, many of these characters are unlikeable, and/or have unlikeable moments, including Igby himself.  I suppose this puts people off--but are we supposed to accept all lead characters as being flawless? If you answer 'yes' to that question, then this movie isn't for you.Igby is a flawed soul, with some dark issues, and a dark upbringing.  Yet, you'll find yourself laughing as he moves around basically untouched, and without reproach.  Free to rebel against the very system that gives him the priveleged freedom in the first place.  As Igby grows, his pains increase, but so does his sense of resolution, and self-actualization.A fine film, with great performances.  You aren't supposed to like all of the people in this movie.  But don't let that convince you its not a good film.Oh, and the comparisons to Royal Tennenbaums are overwrought.  I found Tennenbaums to be much more self-indulgent, and at times completely boring.

113,star80,An Engaging and Unique First Film,9,16 September 2002,"This movie is a great first film for Burr Steers.  The performances are uniformly excellent, and Kieran Culkin adeptly carries the film amidst large but enjoyable performances by an impressive roster of experienced older actors.The NYC locations and vibe are great, and reminded me of cinematic love letters to the city like ""Manhattan,"" without being too derivative of that, or other films.The dialogue is snappy, the costume design is excellent, and the film navigates a mix of arch comedy, angst-filled coming-of-age stuff, and social satire well.  The downtown NYC audience I saw the film with responded with more gusto than they might in Toledo, but I think most audiences that enjoy films that do not follow prescribed Hollywood formats will respond to this flick, one that veers unexpectedly from cynicism to soul-searching, satire to tragedy.The ensemble cast is a huge draw, and they are all great.  Big performances and some goofy risks from pros like Sarandon, Goldblum, and Pullman make for lots of fun, and actors who I've not much cared for in previous films (Amanda Peet, Ryan Phillippe) are at ease and doing good work here.It's got flaws:  the narrative wanders a bit, there's one scene of teen angst pushed, arguably, a bit too far into melodrama, and there are a few brief dances with cliche.  But this is a small film that not many people are talking about, but that deserves support. It's funny, touching, intelligent, and well-made, with a wealth of quirks and nice touches for movie buffs.",Igby Goes Down

The film's failure is quite obviously the script, as the actors seemed to do the best they could with it.  The script tried too hard to weird and witty but succeeded only in being dry and sarcastic.

So when I decided to go and see the movie at the local Ritz, I was not really expecting anything. The review in the paper had been good (***1/2), so I thought I'd check it out. I am very glad I did. Igby Goes Down is a terrific dark comedy, though I wouldn't limit it to that. the movie could really be defined as a drama if you looked at it right. The humor can at times be so dry and sark that you may not know if you should laugh. But whether you laugh or not, the movie always entertains. Kieran Culkin was great, and I hope to see more of him, and I expect I will. As a matter of fact, the whole cast was amazing. It's nice to know that some of these big names can still offer some powerful and subtle performances. Burr Steers, when I checked, didn't evenhave a picture on this site under his name, is someone to watch. Thoughnothing glamorous, the writing and direction, of which he did both, were just right.

Cruel Intentions is a wonderful movie, as is Little Boy Blue, Nowhere and (parts of) White Squall. Unfortunately, it seems that since Cruel Intentions, he's become stuck in a bit of an acting ""rut"". He seems typecast now and can't get out of the sleazy, spoiled rich kid role. The other movies that I have seen him in allowed him to express himself as an actor and not just play the same character in a different family or slightly different situation.Claire Danes was wonderful, as usual.I give the entire shabang a 9.

It tells Igby's story in a cynical, detached way, moving quickly from one episode to another. There's no dwelling on or overdoing a scene. No moralizing one way or another. The viewer gets to draw his own conclusions about how everyone in Igby's world is going down and not just Igby, which is I suppose is the whole point of it all.I found it to be entertaining, a Holden Caulfield kind of story updated fifty years later, but no overarching on language or sex, just the details of Igby's world as they are. The dialogue is a bit of a reach, way too wry and witty, but never to the point where you feel it's contrived and done just for the laugh.",Igby Goes Down

The directing was excellent, and the acting was superb, especially Bill Pulman and Keiran Culkin.

Culkin does an excellent job of drawing a viewer in to find out just what it is that's making him tick. Why he does the things he does. It is also an excellent representation of what the rich do best. Parlor games and head trips. Gritty in all the right places, you find yourself feeling the characters at every turn of their life. A great show of how true love ( Sookie and Igby ), can be devoured by modern day social standards. A boy stuck at the line of eighteen, afraid of taking his journey alone, yet left to fend for himself by a poisonous brother, and a confused young woman.A great scene in this movie is when his mother finally died, and Igby broke down. He did love his mother, and you could see this, despite all his talks of hatred. Even his witty comment about the eulogy was enough to put a sad smile on any viewers face.Though I'd love to rain praise on this movie, it did lack in some story elements. I feel Russel may have been underportrayed, and DH, though an important role, sometimes fell behind the story. Until bam, there he is with his pants around the ankles. Amanda Peet was lovely, as always, and I do believe young Culkin did a wonderful job of portraying Igby. I think the movie could have gotten more into the reason Oliver felt so resentful of Igby, but all together I gave it a 7/10.J-Go",Igby Goes Down

127,govinda8,A Poor Hommage to The Catcher in the Rye,4,5 October 2002,"While I liked the cast in this film, I cannot say that Jeff Goldblum did anything spectacular. Ryan Philippe plays the same character in all of his films, and by far, the acting highlight was Kieran Culkin, who did what he could with what he was given.But as far as plot and screenplay goes, I couldn't tell if Burr Steers was actually just a big fan of J.D. Salinger's or if because of restrictions, he was trying to update Catcher in the Rye with a cast of pointless ""phonies"" who enact a lot of random life dramas without the seriousness and feeling of Catcher. The similarities between the film and book are unavoidable, so Steers will have to deal being scrutinized by Catcher fans. Readers understood and empathised with Holden Caulfield. Viewers will only stare in dumb awe and try to make connections that aren't there as Igby's pointless drama unfolds.If you want to see why Hollywood should never make Catcher in the Rye into a film, go see Igby Goes Down.",Igby Goes Down

Burr Steers has done a wonderful job assembling very diverse characters and has woven their dialogues together in a very seamless manner.  Kieran Culkin does an amazing job with this bold of a script.  He drives the movie well, alongside this all-star cast.  Ryan Phillippe does a good job playing Igby's older brother. Susan Sarandon gives a magnificent job as the villain of Igby's life, so much so that you can't help to like her somewhat.  Claire Danes is good as the love interest.  Amanda Peet pulls off a very odd character, Rachel, that is hard to describe. Finally, Jeff Goldblum plays a great scumbag character, as Igby's godfather.Overall I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a movie that is a little odd, a little dark, a little far-fetched, and has a great screen play that is fun and witty.",Igby Goes Down

Burr Steers's marvelous script doesn't confine his finely crafted characters to plot mechanics. Rather, he simply lets them roam through the chilly confines of their upper-class vernacular. He never lets anyone (not glib, money-grubbing D.H., not monstrous mama Mimi, not even self-absorbed Igby) off the hook for their greed or lack of compassion. But, Steers (in a knockout writer-director debut) also doesn't deny them the honest compassion they don't always deserve. The cast, meanwhile, uses their actorly differences to form a unique and unforgettable ensemble. Igby Goes Down is dark, bitter, and more than a little twisted.

It may not ring true for New Yorkers (is every down-and-out person really a drug dealer?), but everyone else will think it's educational!

Neurotic, eccentric, drunken, druggie doesn't even come close to describing his crazy-ass mother. I could go on and on about these annoying characters with nothing redeemable them, but that would ""spoil"" this movie. It was so choppy. A scene would be thrown in, like the crazy-ass mother sitting on the maid's head, with no intro...why was she sitting on the maid's head?

Sure its another coming of age, dark humor story about a rich kid dealing with his family, but never before has a mother been portrayed as so psychotic, a rich father so pitiful, and a brother (a thirty year old Phillippe who made a convincing college aged brother) who is so heartless. My favorite part of the movie had to of been the film work. Perfect lighting and color schemes, (at par with american beauty.)The sound track was also unbelievable. The acting by Kieran blew me away, in fact the entire ensemble (made up of almost exclusively hollywood bignames) did an excellent job. The movie centered on his character, a wise move.

What a revelation!Igby has a bunch of terrific performers, but I pity them trying to act around the pretentious, annoyingly ""intellectual"" dialogue.

138,Grace787,"laughing, crying, or both",10,28 August 2003,"My review will be biased, because ""Igby Goes Down"" touched me on a deeply personal level. First off, as a New Yorker - the film set in NYC - I had an appreciation for this movie that only someone with a true understanding of the city could possibly feel. (I would go into further detail here, but that a New Yorker's connection to New York is quite frankly inexplicable to an outsider.) But beyond that, there were many elements of Igby's life that were eerily similar to my own, particularly in terms of family dynamics (sans the wealth).Hence, I resent Dirtysoap's reference to Igby's troubles as ""sorry little problems."" I assure you that there is nothing slight about divorced and bickering parents, a broken family, an unemployed, self-destructive, schizophrenic father, a cold, vain, brutal mother, a mean-spirited, back-stabbing brother, abuse by a family member, and drug addiction. LocoLady77 also severely misunderstood the emotional dilemnas of the film, thinking Igby's pain to be centered around money (""oh whyyyy was i born rich? whyyyyy? i HATE being rich""). She goes on to say, ""if this movie is a true depiction of real life, i can see why igby hates it so completely and totally."" Well, unfortunately, it can be a 'true depiction of real life,' and Igby is angry at it, perplexed by it, sorrowed by it, and completely lost and alone. To say he hated it reveals the one-dimensional perspective from which you watched the film.Granted, the movie is obviously not for all. Helps to be acquainted with New York, helps even more so to have had some scarring experiences in life. But I know many from elsewhere, say LA, who live rosy little lives, and still fell in love with the movie for its piercing wit and charm. I would say it is much more a film for the younger generations, but past lovers of Catcher in the Rye should enjoy it as well.It is a smart, sharp, hilarious, and beautiful film. Flawed, yes, but what isn't. Read JNM1981's comment. It sums up Igby brilliantly.",Igby Goes Down
139,duffster,I wanted to like this movie.,3,9 February 2003,"Let me start be saying that the acting was wonderful.Let me also add that this should have been my kind of movie. Especially from all of the comments on here.At the end of the movie, though, all that I could think about was how little the whole thing interested me. Why, when the acting was so good, did I fail to care about the characters?I've been thinking about this for a few days now, and the only conclusion that I can come to is that it's hard for me to feel pity for the kinds of characters in the movie.*SPOLIER WARNING* Should I feel bad for a kid who sells drugs because he ""needs money,"" but gets handed wads of hundred dollar bills by his godfather practically every time that they meet? Or maybe what caused me to be totally disinterested was the pretentious art student feel of everything. ""Are those cloves?"" etc. I, like others, was constantly reminded of The Royal Tenenbaums while watching this. The main difference, in my eyes, is that it was bizare enough that the weird stuff seemed to work. It was weird enough of a movie that you actually care about the rich kids who seem to have everything but a family. In this movie, though, two kids flying home to kill their mother just didn't work for me. Another of my big disappointments was the lack of Igby's history. I can think of three ""flashbacks"" that he had. All of them just made me want more of that. I really wanted to see more of what had happened between his non-biological father and his mother.Basically, what it boiled down to is that I didn't give a crap about Igby, or anyone else in the movie. I think that the primary difference between this movie and Catcher in the Rye is that Holden is stumbling through a world very unfamiliar to him. He's haunted by memories of his dead brother and possibly by the expectations of a younger, more innocent sister. Igby seems to know all of the ropes, but wants to find his own way to swing from the tree. He jumps into everything, whether it's sex or selling drugs, with complete success.Before I get blasted by a bunch of fans, let me say that just because I didn't like it, it's a bad movie. However, if you aren't sucked into the movie after about thirty minutes or so, it's probably not going to happen, so don't stick around like I did, thinking that it'll surely turn around at any moment.",Igby Goes Down

141,albs_i_am,born with a silver spoon on the floor,10,13 September 2003,"One of the first images we see as Igby Goes Down opens is a silver spoon falling dramatically to the floor. This image is viewed again later on in the film, when we the audience are able to appreciate its significance. Igby Goes Down is about Igby Slocumb, the black sheep of the Slocumb family who goes on the lam. His mother Mimi is a vile pill-popping nutcase (played magnificently by Susan Sarrandon), his brother Ollie is an over-achieving alcoholic, his father Jason is in a mental institution because he can get a little ""slippery when schizophrenic"", and his exceedingly wealthy money-buckets godfather DH may have a closer connection to Igby than even he realizes. During Igby's strange and eventful escape to New York City, he meets a dancer who doesn't dance who happens to be DH's mistress, her roommate Russel (giving one of the best performances in the film is Jared Harris, playing a performance artist) and Sookie Sapperstein, a ""pseudo-bohemian JAP"" and the object of Igby's affection. The film is essentially about Igby, alone in his own universe, the other characters simply drifting in and out long enough for him to annoy them. And this is what Igby does best. The silver spoon plot twist involves the death of the matriarch of the Slocumb family. She is diagnosed with cancer and reaches the point where she is ready to die. The brothers carry out Mimi's wishes to be euthenized and feed her strawberry flavoured poison. As she dies, the spoon falls from her lips and Igby goes down. This is where we see the depth of Igby's character and the brilliance of Kieran Culkin's performance as he attacks her corpse and howls like a wounded animal. The members of the Slocumb family were born with a silver spoon in their mouths. In Igby's case, the spoon is now on the floor. The dialogue is brilliant (light at times, but packed with wit) the tone is hilarious and wonderfully dark, the score is terrific and fitting, and there is not one single performance in this film that is not perfect. All in all, Igby Goes Down is excellent and far too under appreciated.",Igby Goes Down
142,sashusha,Pleasant Un-Hollywood surprise,10,7 September 2003,"Characters are believable, created atmosphere is superbly real, sad reality of human values is well-captured.

143,Voshie,Disgusting,1,24 June 2007,"I accidentally came upon this movie on TV and I can't state strongly enough how much this movie disgusted me! The movie is obliviously pushing euthanasia ((eu·tha·na·sia (yū'thə-nā'zhə, -zhē-ə) n. The act or practice of ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition, as by lethal injection or the suspension of extraordinary medical treatment.)) But in this case the assisted suicide of a woman who didn't want to live. The problem is they think we are so stupid we won't see that they are trying to desensitize us to the murder of the elderly, physically infirm and mentally infirm by means of involuntary euthanasia by trying to brain-wash us into thinking they don't want to live when really it is because they are not wanted or are a ""burden to society"". I am insulted that they think they can use TV to pull this off. The only recommendation I can make for this movie is DON'T WATCH IT.",Igby Goes Down
144,the_truth3,Down Goes Igby,1,13 November 2002,"Normally I enjoy films that aren't traditional Hollywood, films that are different and character driven and that could be classified as quirky. That being said I really didn't like this film.  I liked it even less than I liked Catcher in the Rye, i found the writing and plot to be extremely self indulgent, I just felt like the writers were screaming for the audience to pat them on the head and tell them how smart they are, while leaving out any real sense of wit and humor(aside for one line about religion).  I thought the characters were very hollow, and perhaps that being the point, but I didn't like a single one of the characters or even care at all what happened to them. if Igby would have decided to follow the fate of his mother i might have even applauded it.  There was nothing thought provoking or earth shattering in it, I didn't find it to be the glossy social commentary that some reviewers have labeled it as, I found it to just show that everyone has problems and images arent always as they appear, and doing so in the most pretentious way possible.   But for what it's worth i have never written a review before and this film has caused me to, so it atleast caused a reaction, even it was one based on the bitter taste left in my mouth, so if that is the aim of art, then it has accomplished its goal.  I would advise anyone to see Punch-Drunk Love instead, if they already haven't, truly a brilliant awe inspiring, thought provoking piece of art.",Igby Goes Down
145,jrdn_paunov,"Generation ""Y""",10,16 March 2009,"After seeing this movie, by total accident with a friend of mine, and we were literally BLOWN AWAY by it, i have to say that i thought of Zach Braff's ""Garden State"" and thinking - these are the two movies that define our generation. These are the films that represent the smart people/youths of today's social overview. One of the normal kid and the other of he slightly intellectual, rebellious type, but ultimately, these are the two films that define the post grunge generation (referred to as ""Generation Y"").These two movies are what ""My Own Private Idaho"", ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Fight Club"", ""Singles"", ""Se7en"", ""Arizona Dream"" and many more were to the 90's - showing most importantly that the ""youths of today"" aren't all hopeless. There are still those smart kids. Thank god.Oh, and by the way - post-grunge-smart kids still worship Soundgarden, Nirvana, Alice In Chains and all 90's music. Grunge ain't dead. It's a state of mind.",Igby Goes Down
146,the_word_for_light,Fails to be either compelling or thought-provoking,1,24 April 2013,"There was nothing remotely redeeming about this self-absorbed flick. The disjointed plot which went in all directions at once and the mostly ho-hum performances meant I was barely able to watch this movie through to the end. In general the dialogue was verging on meaningless (and not in a quirky entertaining kind of way in which the writers were presumably hoping for). Many hipster elements also appeared to be just thrown in for colour and (failed) effect. Igby Goes Down suffered from a lack of flow and thoughtfulness and failed to provide the viewer with a cohesive point of view or an original and compelling story line. This film could have been saved from receiving one star from me if it could have evoked in me an ounce of sympathy for the protagonist played by Kieran Culkin. However, mainly due to his acting and partly due to an unfortunate script, my overall impression of Igby was one of nauseating boredom and incomprehension.",Igby Goes Down
147,big_meatball,Excellent,9,15 January 2005,"One of the best written movies in 2002. I went in with very low expectations but was very surprised. Original and well acted. If your into movies that require you to think a bit into the characters while not tugging at your emotions with bad music and flashing cinematography, watch this movie. The younger Culkin does a wonderful job at showing the complexity and multiple layers of Igby (I was very surprised) and seems to be more talented than his Home Alone boring brother. i would recommend this to anyone looking to see something a bit different and not your usual Hollywood big budget bad movie. Speaking of big budget bad movies, surprisingly good performance from usual sub par actress and holier than thou Susan Surandon. -Damien",Igby Goes Down
148,evannicholsdotcom,"It's original, but not so tasty",3,18 September 2002,"*** Minor spoiler alert ***Igby Goes Down isn't typical, but that doesn't make it agreeable. If you really liked Harold & Maude, but found it way too upbeat, you'll like this film.  For the rest of us, it's like the awkward moment experienced by a young drug dealer who finds himself selling to a grade-school teacher he hasn't seen for years, and their reminiscing reminds them that they didn't like each other much.  Would you seek that out?There are flawed characters in this film.  I can handle flawed characters. I just want someone with redeeming qualities to counterbalance.  The most positive character is a drug-dealing performance artist. I've seen enough people living their lives badly that watching this lot failed to amuse me, even with the handful of funny moments they generate.  I don't want to give away too much, but if you like characters achieving meaningful catharsis or enrichment from their experiences, keep moving down the metroplex.
On the positive side, it may make you grateful that this über-dysfunctional family isn't yours.  You may also think about how zucchini-chutney ice cream is atypical, but not very good. (used with permission)",Igby Goes Down

I must admit to those with an open mind and a host full of intelligence that this is ""a must see movie."" I refer to it as a ""dark comedy"" with a double twist of an ending.  Anyone looking for a great story that leaves you dumbfounded at the end (wondering why you didn't realize what was going on) must see this film.

Susan Sarandon, Bill Pullman, and Kieran Culkin all put in terrific portrayals.  It's nice to have Claire Danes back, who's been off to college for a few years.

I found the characters to be quite real, believeable, engaging as hell. The dialog is tight, smart... one of those movies that has some simply excellent lines in it - someone spent time keeping wasted moments off the screen. Igby isn't too smart or wise in that teen-movie way, and Kieran Culkin's performance is especially impressive... from his question to the priest in an early scene to wide open moments of fear and anguish later in the film, he's fantastic in this movie. Susan Sarandon was also great as the mother, taking a character that could have been a flat caricature of evil, and turning her into a real, flawed, vulnerable person who is no more evil than she is tragic. Jeff Goldblum in an especially uncharacteristic and in some ways over-the-top role.. yes.If they'd cast any performer from _Bully_ in the role of the older brother, rather than Ryan Phillipe, I'd have nothing to complain about in this film.",Igby Goes Down
153,venoman,"""Derivative"" is an understatement",4,20 September 2010,"I didn't entirely dislike this movie, but watching it after so recently rereading The Catcher in the Rye was just making me twitch. I read an IMDb user's review earlier which said something like ""Igby is the modern-day Holden Caufield."" That's the praise the creators of this film were looking for, I'm sure, but it's also far too on the nose. I'll refrain from including spoilers, but I will say that right from the beginning I could parallel scenes in the movie, pretty much exactly, to scenes from Catcher. Even Igby's dialogue mirrors Holden's. He repeats phrases like ""I think you're great, I really do"" and ""that tortures me"". He drinks and chain smokes. I could go on.Let's be clear here: Igby Goes Down doesn't simply pay homage to J.D. Salinger's classic novel. It doesn't stand on its own, which means it also doesn't honor its roots. It felt almost like they wanted to make a film adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye, couldn't get the rights, and said ""forget it then; we'll come up with something ourselves"".The mimetic protagonist made the story as a whole hard for me to swallow, but to be fair, there are plenty of unique characters in Igby Goes Down. The premise is obviously contrived, but it still makes for an okay story. If you have never read Catcher, and therefore aren't forced to draw comparisons, you will probably enjoy this movie quite a bit more than I did.",Igby Goes Down

156,jonniehauwyre,This is the definitive dark comedy.,9,22 July 2005,"Igby Goes Down is not a movie that can be watched casually. At first, the movie will hand out its humorous moments, but as it progresses, the humor crumbles over the dark and ominous of depth that the characters begin to reveal as they are forced to cope with coincidence, personal temptation, arrogance, and the inevitable. Like a cancer, the movie starts off as a slightly disturbing and ironic comedy, but it really begins to unleash its meaning upon the perceptive watcher as the screenwriter points the camera toward the audience and sneaks the movie's tagline into your conscience. Every character was portrayed with the correct amount of ironic subtlety, but the stand-out performance in my eyes goes to Bill Pullman, who will at the very least will provoke an uncomfortable shifting in your seat, but may very well stick a piece of glass through your heart. This movie, and its every discernible aspect, is successful on every level, some of which the viewer may still be forced to uncover.",Igby Goes Down

My favorite movie ghost world contains the same sort of humor and I think Igby goes down is as great as Ghost World is. The power of the dialogs is so great that I truly loved it.My opinion is; when a movie can make you feel like the main person, even though he's nuts, is great. This movie can make you feel as fucked up as Igby but it wont even bother you cause Igby is one of the funniest people in the world.

159,ilovegilmoregirls,Truly Fantastic.,10,5 November 2004,"Many films have attempted to capture the confused and rebellious teen spirit as epitimised by J.D Salinger in ""The Catcher in the Rye"". Igby Goes Downsucceeds.Keiran Culkin (who, with each new film surpasses his older brother) is IgbySlocumb, a precocious 17 year old New Yorker, who is desperately trying toescape his everyday life. Susan Sarandon is Mimi, Igby's self absorbed pill- popping mother, and Bill Pullman is his schizophrenic father Jason. RyanPhillippe is his hugely political, and hugely Republican brother Oliver.In an attempt to forget his life, Igby goes to the city to live with his godfather D.H. (Jeff Goldlbum, who shines as the supreme phony). There he meets D.H'sheroin addicted girlfriend and her bizarre friends. He later finds solance with Sookie Saperstein, played by Clare Danes, who is a bored, ironic studenttemporarily on the run from college. This movie truly brilliant. Rory Culkin is fantastic as young Igby in tender flash backs dealing with his father's breakdown. Watch out for Cynthia Nixon as Igby's pot smoking old teacher. Igby Goes Down (while occasionally flawed) is a stunning and deliberatelyobscure under-rated dramedy. Sufficiently eccentric characters, a disturbing yet intriguing story hold up this film, with it's wit and brilliant cast. I strongly recommend this film, even going so far as to name it as one of the best movies of 2002. The soundtrack is also well worth a listen, with music from Travis, Coldplay, Badly Drawn Boy, The Dandy Warhols etc. The beautiful suites (including thetheme) by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Peterson are also included. Igby may be going down, but he does it in a such a way that makes us all wish our problems could seem as delicious, lovely, and sad as his.

There are a few mildly funny scenes. Basically its a manchild's fantasy of an exciting rebellious youth hidden under the guise of random and useless drama. If its trying to portray the world of old money as a confusing and boring land where peoples actions are motivated by nothing then it truly succeeds. I usually enjoy movies that try to offer something a little different, but if there is anything unique about this director/screenwriter's vision its completely hidden under a pile of thin stereotypes, ridiculous dialogue and poorly conceived plot.",Igby Goes Down

Many elements of life's hardships and vices are represented. There are heroin addicted starving artists; an affluent husband and father cracking from the pressure; a cold and calculating business man; a young man searching for a higher level of understanding so as not to make the same mistakes as his family.I remembered this film about a week ago and decided, after recommending it to some friends, to see it again. I had forgotten the level of wit and sarcasm in each characters dialog. Clare Danes does an outstanding job as Sookie. Keiran Culkin really shines as Igby. His best role to date. Ryan Phillipe, takes on his usual role of a deviant intellectual from the Upper East side. There is just the right amounts of sexual frustration and heart break along with high class sophistication and superficiality. The brothers, Igby and Oliver, try to figure out where their relationship stands as their seemingly cold-hearted mother dies. Then there are the triangles: between DH, Igby and Rachel, and the triangle between Igby, Sookie and Ollie. All of the roles are dynamic. Every character relates in a very sarcastic or dry manor. DH is all about business. Mimi, just trying to keep everything together and make sure her children are taken care of, while maintaining an air of independence. Igby's been kicked out every school his mother has enrolled him in. Desperate not to crack like his father. The movie also provides a couple of great twists.

162,Brunette789,Absolutely Amazing,9,6 January 2005,"This movie is worth seeing! Burr Steers wrote and directed this dark and witty drama about a boy attempting to raise himself amidst an extremely screwed up family, while learning to deal with his own fear of growing up. The wit presented by Kiernan Culkin's character provides light to the movie, without overdoing it and trying to make dramatic scenes overly humorous. The acting is wonderful on all parts, Kiernan does a superb job playing the part of Igby. Claire Danes, Ryan Philippe, among others play well developed and interesting characters who, along with adding to the plot, also help us to see further into the mind of Igby. Casting, in my opinion, was superb. Throughout the movie I came to identify with Igby's feeling that he does not belong in his family, as well as sympathize with him during his times of pain. Kiernan has an ability to reach into the viewer's heart and make them feel just what his character is going through. A talent that I have not seen in many of the younger actors these days. Personally I wish that he would continue making movies and taking on challenging roles such as that of Igby. As much as I would love to explain the entire movie in detail in this one review I can't. Not only would that spoil the movie, but then you would have no reason to go out and rent it. I would suggest this to anyone who enjoys a good drama or dark comedy. This movie brought tears to my eyes, leaving me crying but smiling because I was so happy for Igby. It is impossible for me to explain just how I felt after seeing such an amazing film; I enjoyed it so much that I watched it for a second time the morning after I originally saw it.",Igby Goes Down

'Russel' is played really well, as is Mimi, and Ryan Phillipe's character Oliver is done really well, too. I noticed that when they show Igby as a kid, they used Kieran and Mccauley Culkin's younger brother: Rory Culkin. The dialogue is probably one of the movie's strongest points. It's very witty, funny and there are many good quotes to be taken. All in all, the movie brings on a lot of emotions, I laughed a lot, and cried, it's just done really well.",Igby Goes Down
