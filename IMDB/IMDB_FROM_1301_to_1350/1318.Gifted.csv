0,SnoopyStyle,super duper cute kid,7,27 December 2017,Frank Adler (Chris Evans) has been raising her niece Mary Adler (McKenna Grace) since her mathematical genius mother Diane left her as a baby and then committed suicide. He sends her off to first grade despite her protestation. Her teacher Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) realizes her mathematical skills. Frank resists efforts to put her into special school by the principal and his strict mother Evelyn Adler (Lindsay Duncan) who seeks to take custody. Roberta Taylor (Octavia Spencer) is their friend and landlord.Mckenna Grace is super duper cute missing-my-front-teeth adorable. Director Marc Webb keeps the movie running on the straight and narrow. Slate and Evans have a nice chemistry. This is not the most challenging film but it's an easy watch. I do have a problem with the resolution of the court case but the drama does need to go somewhere. It has the advantage of going where I wasn't expecting. It's a little girl alternate Good Will Hunting.,Gifted
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Not a miracle, but a fairly good watch",6,20 July 2017,"""Gifted"" is an American 100-minute film from this year (2017), so still a really new one we have here. The director is Marc Webb, who is still most known of course for his take on Spider Man starring Andrew Garfield. But this blockbuster should not be in the focus today. Instead, we talk about this film here that is writer Tom Flynn's most known work until now. It is the story of a young girl who is a child prodigy, just like her mother was. She lives with her uncle as her mother's genius was also her demise eventually and the uncle (played by Captain America Chris Evans) tries all he can to keep his niece from living a life as destructible as her mother did. There is also a bit of an evil stepmother character in here and that one is played by Lindsay Duncan, even if she is of course actually the grandmother and she wants her granddaughter to continue her daughter's work. Now I mentioned already some of the actors and characters here and I believe that Duncan is the MVP overall. Admittedly, it is by definition already a role with great potential, but she sure delivers and fulfills the expectations. The only contender for MVP is child actress Mckenna Grace, who I can see really having a bright career if she decides to keep making movies when entering adult life. She really had my eyes glued to the screen in every scene she was in and actually those were not as many scenes as you would expect as we see the people around her more than we see her at times.For Chris Evans, this is a worthy addition to his body of work too. He did a fine job most of the time and he is one of the current superhero actors who still need to establish themselves as character actors (something Cumberbatch, Ruffalo and RDJ have done a long time ago already), but he is on the right track. Jenny Slate I am still undecided. Eventually her character is a bit pointless. But the teacher parts early on were played well by her, the romance parts added almost nothing and in the second half of the film she is just there with no material at all. Oscar winner Octavia Spencer is once again a disappointment. Her character could have been left out completely and it would not have changed a thing. Besides, she has a tendency to play exactly the same character in every film she is in really and by now it has gotten stale and repetitive. Yes she has recognition value (like Slate too, maybe Evans could have a bit more), but that simply is not enough anymore in my opinion. Yeah, she brings some comedy here and there, but honestly the Black lawyer was really enough to have that genre covered.Story-wise, the film was convincingly written I would say. Here and there a minor weakness, but the argument ""kids don't talk/act like that"" can easily be refuted by the protagonist being different. The scene when Evans' character leaves the girl with the foster parents was probably the saddest and most touching of the entire film. Afterward, it turned a bit into a sob story, also with the dog being almost killed before daddy rushes in and then also the scene with Duncan's character back in action and the final confrontation scene when she realizes what she did to her daughter. It's truly walking the edge, probably depends on your perception if you think it's masterfully balancing or crossing the edge. The story arc with the finished theory I am not sure if I liked it. It came a bit surprising in possibly not the best way, but I think that the explanation was nicely handled and the interpretation too as we know the grandma will never leave the girl alone unless she gets these documents of which she did not even know existed. I think I can live with that as I can live with the entire film. It has its moments, both good and bad, and eventually it is worth checking out, even if I would not say it's best-of-the-year material or a must-see by any means. The highs are higher than the lows are lower I guess, so it's a positive recommendation from me. Thumbs up. Oh yeah, before I forget one final note: The entire thing reminded me a bit of ""What Maisie Knew"" from 5 years earlier, perhaps slightly inferior to that one, but both are defined through strong performances by girls playing core characters. If you liked WMK, you may end up enjoying this one too.",Gifted
2,nogodnomasters,The Man Who Shot Liberty Mutual,10,5 July 2017,"Mary Adler is a six year old mathematically gifted child being raised by her uncle Frank, a freelance boat repairman, in Florida. They own a one-eyed cat named Fred and rent from Octavia Spencer who always manages the perfect role or maybe she is just that good. Mary comes from a line of mathematical geniuses. Frank (Chris Evans) is attempting to raise Mary as a ""normal"" child reflecting on the wishes of her melancholy mother who is deceased. However, not everyone agrees with Frank as Mary is ""one in a billion"" which leads to a custody battle.Frank is also intelligent and has a flippant sense of humor. The film's strong points are its characters and underlying humor. Mckenna Grace did an excellent job as the gifted child and I love her more than my stupid niece in medical school. (Just kidding folks). The film focuses on developing gifted children for the benefit of society, or to let them have happy lives.Guide: 1 F-word. Implied sex. No nudity. ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" is a different film enjoyable on a different level",Gifted
3,kosmasp,True talent,9,9 June 2020,"Which is true of the actors involved but also part of the story you are about to embark and enjoy. Now some things may be predictable (relationships and where they are heading), but that does not take anything away from the movie. You had to have charismatic people in this one. To convey everything they go through and to help the movie not sink into some of the cliche traps it has to avoid.The kid actor is great too. You actually believe she is what she portrays. Great drama overall and really nice script and dialog too. I missed this in the cinemas, but got the opportunity to watch it the other day. This will work best with those open to a movie like this. Cynicism aside and you'll enjoy it",Gifted
4,jboothmillard,Gifted,7,25 June 2017,"I saw the trailer for this film no more than a week before it was released, it looked like a really simple idea, a brainy kid with a funny smart aleck personality and a custody battle, I was looking forward to it, directed by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer, The Amazing Spider-Man). Basically in a small town near Tampa, Florida, seven-year-old Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace) is starting her first day at school in the first grade, she impresses and bewilders her teacher Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) showing her remarkable mathematical talent. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for gifted children, but her uncle and guardian Frank (Chris Evans), a freelance boat repairman, turns it down, based on the experience of his family with similar schools, he wants to give Mary the chance to have a ""normal"" childhood. Mary's mother Diane took her own life when Mary was six months old, Diane was a promising mathematician, dedicated to the Navier–Stokes problem, one of the unsolved Millennium Prize Problems, Mary has lived with Frank ever since her suicide. Seeking to gain custody of Mary and move her to Massachusetts is Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, she believes Mary is a ""one-in-a- billion"" mathematical prodigy and should be specially tutored to prepare for a life devoted to mathematics. Frank however is adamant that his sister Diane would want her to be in a normal school and have a childhood she didn't have, so begins a court case to determine who gets custody, but Frank worries the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, he talks often about his concerns with close friend and neighbour Roberta Taylor (Octavia Spencer). Frank and his lawyer Greg Cullen (Glenn Plummer) agree a compromise, Mary will be placed in foster care and attend the private school Evelyn has chosen her to enrol, the foster parents live just 25 minutes from Frank's home, and he will have scheduled visits, Mary will be able to decide where she lives when she turns twelve. Mary is devastated at being placed in foster care, she initially refuses to see Frank, Bonnie finds out their one-eyed cat Fred was put up by the foster parents for adoption, due to allergy issues for Evelyn, Frank retrieves the cat from the pound, Evelyn has taken up residence in Mary's foster home guest house, and oversees Mary's education. Frank confronts Evelyn, revealing that before she killed herself she had solved the Navier–Stokes problem, but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death, it meant everything to Evelyn to see her daughter solve the problem she dedicated her life to. In the end, Frank offers to publish Diane's work, in return for Evelyn dropping her objection to him and gaining custody of Mary, Evelyn reluctantly agrees, Mary returns to the public school, and makes ""normal"" friends, but continues taking higher level courses in the afternoon. Also starring John M. Jackson as Judge Edward Nichols, John Finn as Aubrey Highsmith, Michael Kendall Kaplan as Justin Gilmore and Elizabeth Marvel as Gloria Davis. Evans strips his Captain America armour and shows his softer side well, Spencer gets her moments as the concerned neighbour, and Duncan does well as the English woman not being completely hateful, but the film does almost entirely belong to Grace, she creates both laughs and emotion as the cute, cheeky and highly intelligent girl. It is a very simple story, a girl with a gift, and the two people who can care for her fighting to decide her future, but it is not just all arguments and despair, there is plenty of room for funny moments, especially from the young talent, and there are some thoughtful scenes, including the discussion of God, it is a surprisingly affective and enjoyable comedy drama. Very good!",Gifted
5,neil-476,Lovely,9,9 May 2018,"Frank is bringing up his 7-year old niece Mary, following the suicide of her mother, Diane. The trouble is that Diane was a mathematical prodigy, and so is Mary, and Frank is minded to give Mary as normal a childhood as possible. When Frank's and Diane's mother Evelyn turns up, determined to ensure that Mary's full potential will be realised, it is clear that trouble lies ahead.There are some lovely character dynamics here. The relationship between Frank and Mary is at the heart of the story and is beautifully realised. But, cleverly, Evelyn is not entirely the monster she initially appears to be. Though she and Frank are very much at odds, there is still a mother/son relationship at work. And despite Diane's death over 6 years before the film starts, her relationships with her mother and brother are both crucial to the events of the film.Chris Evans is excellent as Frank, in a performance with not a hint of Johnny Storm or Steve Rogers in it. And British veteran Lindsay Duncan, not an actress given to sympathetic portrayals, gives us a beautifully ( and often very funny) Evelyn. Jenny Slate plays Mary's teacher Bonnie, bemused at finding this extraordinary child in her class, and rapidly discovering the consequences of getting far more involved than she had expected to, and Octavia Spencer plays Frank's next door neighbour Roberta.But Mckenna Grace, as Mary, owns this film. Aged 9 at the time of filming, she gives a performance of subtlety, control, emotion and power. She is undoubtedly a 7-year old child, but she is also a genius, and the conflict between the two - and how it factors into all her relationships - is extraordinarily well-handled by this self- assured child..The script is very good. It isn't full of dazzling wordplay, but it tells the story deftly and entertainingly.I loved this film, and it moved me frequently.",Gifted
6,AlsExGal,"A great family film, and a cut above what I've seen so far this year",8,12 September 2017,"It's not perfect (it becomes too solemn toward the end, and the ending itself seemed abrupt) , but this crowd pleaser pleased me. Chris Evans, out of superhero armor for once, was quite good as a man raising his young prodigy of a niece, Mary, alone following his sister's suicide. The niece, although tough at first, grew on me a lot, Octavia Spenser and Jenny Slate were charming in smaller roles, and Lindsay Duncan was magnificent as the film's villainess so to speak, and Mary's grandmother, imbuing her possibly one-note character with a nuanced, three-dimensional performance so that you couldn't help but understand her from time to time. The script was funny, tender, and moving.It all boils down to a custody fight in which the argument is what is better for Mary: to have every possible option available to her as she will with the grandmother and her money and stress on advanced education, or to be with the uncle in the belief that grandma's opportunities will simply suppress her life. Things are presented so that there really are two valid sides.While I sided with Evan, because the audience is largely following his story, I think there is some evidence to believe that the grandmother is offering a better future for the child, from a judge's perspective at least. How does this all work out? Watch and find out.I'd give it a solid recommendation.",Gifted
7,ferguson-6,how do we choose who chooses?,7,6 April 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. The ""right"" choice isn't always obvious. Things get more complicated when even the ""best"" choice isn't clear. Place a young child at the heart of that decision tree, and the result may yield emotional turmoil and an abundance of moral high ground and judgment. Such best intentions are at the core of this latest from director Marc Webb (his first feature since 500 Days of Summer) and writer Tom Flynn.Frank (Chris Evans) is raising his 10 year old child prodigy niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in low-key small town Florida. The circumstances that brought the two of them together aren't initially known, but are explained in a poignant moment later in the film. Frank has been home-schooling Mary and now believes it's time she transitions to public school for the socialization aspect  ""try being a kid for once"" he urges. Of course, Mary's teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate, Obvious Child) immediately realizes Mary is special, and just like that, the wheels of the educational system are in motion to explain to Frank why they know what's best for Mary  a high-fallutin private school where she can be all she can be.There is a really nice and enjoyable story here of Uncle Frank dedicated to doing what he thinks is best for bright and charming and spirited young Mary, but it all comes crashing down when the bureaucrats, and ultimately Frank's mother (Lindsay Duncan), get involved. When the adults can't agree on the best route for Mary, a courtroom battle ensues. Ms. Duncan gets a witness scene reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, and her overall performance stands in effective stark contrast to the warm fuzzies of Mr. Evans.The supporting cast contributes nicely, though Octavia Spencer's role as kindly neighbor Roberta is more limited than it should be, and the love connection between Evans and Ms. Slate could have easily been omitted - but she is so pleasant on screen, that we don't mind at all. Glenn Plummer and John Finn are the attorneys who go to war, and Fred the one-eyed cat also gets plenty of screen time. But there is little doubt that the movie really belongs to the effervescent Miss Grace. She nails the back and forth between kid and genius, and we never doubt her sincerity.Child prodigies have been explored through other fine movies such as Little Man Tate, Searching for Bobby Fisher, and Shine, and while this one may run a bit heavier on melodrama, but it's worthy of that group. The best discussions after this movie would revolve around what's best for the child. Should she be deprived of ""higher"" education in order to live within a more ""normal"" social environment? Are any of the adults more interested in their own ego than in what's in the child's best interest? Home school vs public school vs private school is always good for some fireworks, and everyone has their own thoughts. So how do we decide who gets to decide? Does a parent get the final say on their child – even if their motivations may be in doubt? Should every kid be pushed to their academic – or artistic – or athletic – limits? The questions are many and the answers are complicated. There is a great line in the film that itself is worthy of conversation: ""You got on the bad side of a small-minded person with authority"". Yikes. Even Cat Stevens' great song ""The Wind"" can't soften that.",Gifted
8,phd_travel,Cute story and remarkable performance by the young actress,8,27 June 2017,There have been other genius kids movies before but this one is more watchable. Mckenna Grace the young actress playing the mathematics e=whiz kid is quite adorable and a very good actress - she looks like a young Kiernan Shipka. Chris Evans acts pretty well as her uncle who wants a normal life for her - don't think of him as an action hero at all here. Lindsay Duncan plays her proper British grandmother who want special things for her grandchild. All the cast are quite suited.The story is well written with some genuine laughs. The comic tone is good. The only part that seems a bit contrived and implausible is the part where the court would take her away and put her with a foster family rather than with either the uncle or grandmother. In the end she did need a special school anyway so he was a little wrong.Worth a watch.,Gifted
9,gradyharp,'He's a good person. He wanted me before I was smart.',10,30 July 2017,"Screenwriter Tom Flynn offers a well-considered and genuinely moving story about how we deal with gifted children – and adults. GIFTED is also about family connections and the impact on children whose parents are lost to them by separation whether in death by natural causes, by suicide, or by desertion. Marc Webb who has gathered an impeccable cast to enact this touching drama directs his sensitive story with aplomb.Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy - his spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in a coastal town in Florida. Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well. The story explores the relationship between a caring uncle who salvaged his niece when the mother of the girl (a brilliant mathematician) commits suicide – yearning to offer the brilliant gifted niece a 'normal life' despite custody battles and grandmother opinions.Chris Evans continues to prove that he is one of our more important serious actors of the day and eleven year old Mckenna Grace demonstrates why she is on of the most frequently seen young actresses in the young role parts. Octavia Spencer and Lindsay Duncan offer definitive performances in tough roles. This is a film with many levels of message and one that should be seen by a very wide audience.",Gifted
10,deloudelouvain,Muche better than I expected,8,12 April 2018,"Drama's are not really my thing, but every now and then I like one. Kids, I don't have any and there's a reason why, I just don't really like them. So when I saw what the movie was about I had real doubts that I would like this movie. It won't change my opinion about kids but I have to admit I did enjoy this movie. A movie about a genious prodigy, with a mind and will of her own. Mckenna Grace did a great job with her character. It's almost impossible not to like her. The story itself is a rollercoaster of emotions. Most of the time a feel good movie, but it also has its sad moments, and that's what makes this movie special. You can't help it to hate the grandmother, but I guess that was also good acting of her. Like the rest of the cast, there isn't anything bad to say about their acting. A good story, easy to watch, with a good cast. Certainly worth a watch.",Gifted
11,Hellmant,A good movie for a certain type of audience.,8,19 April 2017,"'GIFTED': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new family drama from director Marc Webb; who also helmed 2009's '500 DAYS OF SUMMER', 2012's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN' and 2014's 'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2' (all great films in my opinion). It was scripted by Tom Flynn and it stars Chris Evans, Mckenna Grace, Lindsay Duncan, Jenny Slate and Octavia Spencer. The story deals with an aggressive custody battle between the uncle and grandmother of a very gifted 7-year-old girl (who's especially talented with Math skills). It's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also slightly underperformed at the Box Office so far. I enjoyed it.Mary Adler (Grace) lives with her Uncle Frank (Evans), in a small Florida town. On her first day of school she impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Slate), with her amazing math skills. The school wants to give Mary a scholarship, to a special private school for gifted children like her, as a result of this. Frank thinks it's a bad idea though. Mary's mother, Frank's sister, was also very skilled in math, and she committed suicide (when Mary was a baby) because of the pressures of her unique isolated social life. She told Frank that she just wanted Mary to have a normal childhood, before she passed, and Frank wants to honor his sister's wishes. Frank's mother, Evelyn (Duncan), believes Mary's gifts will be wasted in a normal school though, and she seeks custody of Mary, in the Florida courts, as a result of her stubborn thinking. It's later learned that she also obsessively pressured Mary's mother to pursue her gifts.The film is definitely a little clichéd, and overly sentimental, but I still really enjoy movies like this anyway. The film is definitely not Oscar material, nor is it as impressive as Webb's other films, but it's still really moving and sometimes involving. The actors are all likable in it, and the characters are also quite lovable (most of them). It's arguably emotionally manipulative, and somewhat forced at times, but it still works regardless. It's good to see Evans starring in more quality films too (besides just Marvel flicks), Slate is always good as well, and the young girl is obviously very talented in it too. It's a good movie for a certain type of audience, others definitely won't be too impressed by it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/K3Maw4akm_o",Gifted
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Largely predictable and stereotypical, but made with clear passion and technical skill.",6,1 March 2018,"There's not much to say about this inoffensive yet largely pedestrian family drama, aside from perhaps that it is made with a clear passion and technical skill most evident in the realistic screenplay and the nuanced performances. While I have no major complaints about 'Gifted (2017)', other than the fact that it is incredibly predictable and doesn't really stray from the safety of previously established stereotypes, I can't really say that it gripped me in any meaningful way. It's really the lack of emotional investment that stopped me from liking this any more than I did. It isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination and kept me entertained, but these movies live and die by the connection we have with the characters and, for me, there just wasn't much there. 6/10",Gifted
13,ThomasDrufke,"Funny & Touching, Even if it's Sometimes Melodramatic",7,18 April 2017,"Marc Webb is developing a nice little career for himself. Gifted has a keen sense of emotional weight, even if it's ultimately a tad melodramatic with some clunky dialogue.By far the best thing about 'Gifted' are the performances. Amidst the soap opera-ish story are the touching performances from Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. This story only works if these two have great chemistry and you believe in their relationship. Both of them clearly had a blast filming with each other and developed a sweet back and forth. The one detractor being that the dialogue they are given isn't all that effective. Tom Flynn doesn't have a ton of experience working on feature films, and it shows here. As I understand, the screenplay was on one of the Hollywood blacklists, so perhaps he wasn't there on set to tinker with the dialogue as the film was shot. Still, someone switching around some lines every now and then would have been nice.The film always has good intentions, as do all of the characters, and in that way it feels safe. It's a predictable story with enough likable qualities to get by, but it could have probably taken a few more chances here and there. Funny enough, the film is about a young child who's smarter than she should be at 8-years old, and that's kind of similar to the film overall. It's an innocent film that tries to be smarter and more thought provoking than it really has a right to be.However, as I stated before, the film's heart lies with Evans and Grace. Their comradery is undeniable and thus there are quite a few powerful scenes. With all of his outings as Captain America, you don't get to see this side of Chris Evans, so I'm grateful this film gave us that. Webb does a nice job of getting an uncharacteristically emotional turn from Evans, and a funny, touching, and surprising turn from the young Grace. Overall, it's not going to knock anyone's socks off, but it definitely puts a smile on your face and maybe even gets a few tears out of you.+Evans & Grace chemistry+Webb has another hit+Funny & heartwarming-Clunky dialogue & character decisions7.4/10",Gifted
14,Cineanalyst,More a Formulaic Than Differential Equation,3,11 August 2021,"I'd like to see a movie that used mathematics to reflexively prove how formulaic is the movie itself. After all, Western notions of both studies date back to Ancient Greece and sometimes from the same polymaths: the dramatic structure of Aristotelian Poetics, the immortalized theorem surviving from the discipline of Pythagorean mathematics, the Elements of Euclidean geometry. Problem is, pictures such as ""Gifted"" are more along the lines of the 1+1 elementary arithmetic taught in the movie as opposed to its undergraduate level and beyond differential equations that go generally unexplained with, I suppose, the expectation that the not-so-gifted of movie-goers, myself included, will marvel slack-jawed over their incomprehensibility. At least, the math is correct, or so I'm told. My mathematics education topped out around differential equations, and little Mary Sue chalking up multiple blackboards to solve an equation looks like E = MC Hammer to me. Indeed, a one-time real-life child prodigy advised ""Gifted"" on them, but it doesn't much matter; it may as well be gibberish for as inconsequential as it is. Despite what the Matt Damon school of screenwriting may've mislead many to believe, simply writing that a character is smart doesn't make the movie likewise.So, the formulation is a ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) type genius, but a child, plus a ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" courtroom, but cool uncle and very British grandma, with the most important underlying addend methinks being what Charlie Chaplin discovered way back in 1921 with ""The Kid."" Tear a child from the arms of a loving guardian (a male one, in that case, this one, ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and others), to pull the tears from the audience. Arguably, I'm too jaded from a lifetime of movie-watching compulsion, but I don't get how people keep falling for such transparent and by-the-book, or by the three-act structure, manipulation. If an Adam Sandler vehicle such as ""Big Daddy"" (1999) can do it, it's not sophisticated, and I don't respect it. Per usual, the musical scoring is especially egregious--and one song in particular, lyrics an' all, goes on far too long, as do several shots and that bad ADR. In one shot, uncle Chris Evans and schoolteacher Jenny Slate just sit on a boat talking, but their conversation is inaudible, and the shot just lingers there for a beat or two... what is that.One may at least overlook the trope of a kid knowing more than an adult--that she sees the mistake in her uncle and grandmother's proofs for her before they do--as, after all, this one is a genius. And, although for much of the picture it seems as though it will be, this ultimately avoids being entirely a celebration of mediocrity or normality on the level of wicked-smart Captain America going from Boston College philosophy professor to Floridian boat repair man. (I wonder if he ever met Prof. Marky Mark, of ""The Gambler"" (2014) and with presumably a PhD in mutilating Dostoevsky--it would explain his career change.)No, the most calculations required here are studio producing and financing, so pick a black-list script, hire an artistically-bankrupt but fiscally-profitable director, cast a star smile, find a cute kid who can act, release in the spring, and add some product placement (Google searches, special (K) breakfasts, etc.) to protect that bottom line. The only variable of interest I see here is Octavia Spencer. Plot-wise, her character adds next to nothing, and it's awfully close to the mammy stereotype her career seems to have largely fallen into despite some success at the Oscars--the Academy loves that sort of thing, I guess. Why is she here, then? My deduction is it's because of ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Interesting how actors gets cast sometimes that way--just to allude to a better movie and hope some of the prestige of it rubs off. ""Hidden Figures,"" too, was incredibly formulaic--I mean, Kevin Costner ended racism by taking a crowbar to a bathroom sign--but there were some elegant compositions there. Its title is a math and history pun, for crying out loud. ""Gifted,"" though? It doesn't add up.",Gifted
15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,16 July 2017,"GiftedThe key to raising a gifted child is selling them to science before you get too attached.Unfortunately, the mother in this dramedy died before getting her payday.Frank (Chris Evans) gallantly accepts guardianship of his niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) after her mother's death.

Luckily her talent with formulas finds her grandmother (Lindsay Duncan) taking an invested interest in her. So much so, she sues Frank for custody.A paints-by-numbers prodigy anecdote that strokes its brush well within the lines, this charming but predictable squabble only succeeds thanks to its leads who bring humanity to this glorified custody battle.Incidentally, the best way to knock a know-it-all math genius down a few pegs is with gym.

16,851222,Great movie,10,10 August 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.So after seeing high score at IMDb for ""Gifted"" (2017) and some of my favorite critics gave it a maximum score, i was kinda dying to see it for my self. After seeing it i can only say - ""Gifted"" is an amazingly involving and great movie.Story here is not a very original but its great. Script was superb - it is moving, involving, funny, realistic and hopeful story. Acting was superb by all involved and reminded me that Chris Evans is a very compelling actor - actually this was his best performance since ""Puncture"" back in 2011 (because i don't think that working in Marvel movies requires real acting, no offence). Directing by Marc Webb was superb - no dragging moment for entire 1 h 41 min - this is hands down his best movie since his the amazing ""500 Days of Summer"".All in all, i can't recommend ""Gifted"" any higher. It will make you smile, sad and hopeful. Great movie.",Gifted
17,westsideschl,No Genius,3,4 August 2017,"1. Don't call a seven year old a genius as done throughout this movie. Especially since it's initially based on arithmetic tricks. Movie failed to explore her development and talents - what a wasted opportunity. 2. Similarly, ""Autistic savants"" often show above the norm skills in some area, but that is not genius. 3. A put-down on special schools for gifted as being an abnormal environment or an environment for ""not normal"" kids shows a lack of knowledge on the subject by the writers, etc. The majority of students, more so than in regular schools, are highly involved in extracurricular activities such as sports, music, 2/3-D arts. Even the other end of the special schools with ADHD, learning, behavioral issues are often quite intelligent and they are no less normal. 4. Teachers, again usually shown in movies, do not reflect how most teaching is done (calling on ss to answer 1+1? Please!).

18,tabuno,A Decent Drama of a Gifted Child,8,11 January 2019,"16 April 2017. It's apparently not easy to make a great gifted child prodigy movie, but Gifted seems to have taken a difficult theme and developed a rather sensitive, believable storyline that offers up a decent drama. Unlike the more stereotypical clash of striking characters as found in Little Man Tate (1991) or the more mainstream comedy format that originated the prodigy child theme just as Bill Mumy came to Lost In Space in Dear Brigette (1965) with Jimmy Stewart, Life strikes a much more authentic presentation of the conflict between gifted children and normal lives. Movies such as Matilda (1997) used a more flights of fancy to cover over the difficult lives of prodigies with comedy entertainment and offer up their dilemma more as a secondary theme to sci fi adventure as A Wrinkle In Time (2003) or family mystery as August Rush (2007). The same paradoxical conflict between the rare gift of intelligence and a normal life also a found in Good Will Hunting (1997) are the issue is focused at the adolescent, young adult coming of age, yet Gifted directly deals a much more common everyday issue of many parents of gifted students. Perhaps, Gifted might best to be contrasted to Jason Robard's portrayal of a more laid back father to a rather unorthodox boy. It is surprisingly Lindsay Duncan's as the grandmother that makes this movie stand out from the rest because of script's much more sensitive and balanced approach to her own professional and parental conflicts than most movies. Of course though Nell (1994) with Jodie Foster's own stand out performance in another commanding outcast character is a great companion piece to Gifted.",Gifted
19,Reno-Rangan,One's fighting for the child and the other's for her gift!,8,4 December 2017,"Films about battle for child custody is a very familiar theme. There are lots of great films you could find. This is just another, but another great among them. There's actually nothing special about it. It's simple and emotional. The characters were slightly different, and agenda for courtroom drama is interesting aspect of the film.A single uncle who is a by-default guardian for his niece since her mother had died. But the seven year old kid is a math prodigy like her mother. He wanted her to live a normal life like everybody else in her age. That's what her mother wanted as well. When her grandmother learns about the gift, is now seeking a court intervene to provide all she needed to nurture her gift, since she's very rich. So the kid caught between adult's fight, how the rest of the narration folds are emotionally told.I'm not a fan of Captain America, because he's not the Captain Earth or Captain my country. Other than that, Chris Evans is not a big marketable star. But this was a pretty cool performance. The kid too was awesome. The last time I saw her was from 'Mr Church'. Well written and directed. Easily one of the best drama films of the year. A good message film as well. Families should watch it.8/10",Gifted
20,cruise01,Gifted is filled with great performances and a strong emotional heart warming plot.,8,3 August 2017,"Gifted is a down to earth drama about a child prodigy being fought over for custody between her uncle or her hard strict personality grandmother. I was really impressed with Gifted from the lovable performance from Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace to its emotionally drawn direction which may have a predictable premise which the audience can foresee were it will go. But it's definitely worth to watch. Seven year old Mary (Mckenna Grace) is gifted in mathematics. So gifted that she accidentally shows off in her first grade class by outsmarting the teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate). Mary is raised by her uncle Frank (Chris Evans) who is barely making enough to support himself but a nice down to earth guy that loves Mary and will do whatever it takes to raise her in having a normal life. When the attention in school about Mary's mathematics talent gets noticed. Mary's grandmother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) comes to visit and ask for the custody over Mary to stay with her instead for the advanced education. Then, comes the court battle with Frank trying to do whats best for Mary, that she needs to have a normal childhood then being put into sessions trying to solve Navier Stokes problem which was one of the unsolved Millennium problems that Mary's mother almost solved before she took her own life away. The premise may seem familiar with the Uncle raising his niece as his own and trying to live a normal happy life in a small town home in Florida. His friendly neighbor Roberta (Octavia Spencer) watches over Mary when he is going out having fun and flirting with Bonnie. And they also have a one eye cat that Mary adores so much. With Evelyn wanting a different lifestyle for Mary. She is a high class intellectual Englishwoman that is hoping their family line can solve Navier Stokes problem. Living with strict rules and is persistent on having Mary enter the highest level of education and have her challenge the unsolved math problem. The story is predictable and you can tell how the direction is going to end but its about seeing the emotions these characters are going through. The acting was impressive. Chris Evans was great. Mckenna Grace was amazing. Playing a talented first grader, were her sarcastic humor matches up to an adult. And always eager to challenge herself with stuff she does not know. Lindsay Duncan as Evelyn also gave a cold great performance. The court scenes with her giving a monologue speech without even blinking about her life experiences and perspective on why she is better off with Mary was great. Jenny Slate was also good as Bonnie, a supportive first grade teacher that falls for Frank and cares for Mary. Same with Octavia Spencer, playing the neighbor and Mary's babysitter. Besides the film being very predictable. I also felt like the movie could have been trimmed down in some scenes to help with the pacing. For a movie that is an hour and forty minutes. It did feel long in some scenes that dragged on and could have been edited and still maintain its story. Overall, Gifted is a really good drama film that's worth checking out. The plot is sad and sweet at the same time. Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace gave great performances. If you could put aside its slow pacing and predictable premise.",Gifted
21,Floated2,Overlooked as a whole?,7,3 November 2018,"Gifted was seemingly a smaller independent film by Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer). As a whole, Gifted is quite a film as we can see why audiences enjoyed the film. It has the elements and interesting plot devices, along with the chemistry of the cast. Chris Evans, taking a break from Captain America, plays former professor turned repairman Frank, who has been raising his seven-year-old niece Mary (McKenna Grace) since her mother, a maths genius (took her own life).Aware that Mary has the same gift for maths as her mum, Frank has been trying to keep her off the radar. But worried that she is missing out on a normal childhood, he sends her to a nearby school, whereby her talents are quickly discovered and seized upon by her teachers.Gifted has been compared to Good Will Hunting, but it's not far from a stretch within both films. This is more of a complete tamer version if anything, along with a more concise family movie. Gifted is a good overlooked film, which may be considered a ""gem"" in a few years.",Gifted
22,eddie_baggins,A touching family drama,7,21 May 2018,"Head into Gifted expecting to not be surprised where it takes you and you'll find Marc Webb's Chris Evans led heart-warmer being one of 2017's most gently affecting and sweet tales.Back behind the director's chair for the first time since the sadly lacklustre Amazing Spider-Man follow The Rise of Electro, Webb has returned to his lower budget roots that were so successful for him with his breakout 2009 hit 500 Days of Summer and it's great to see the talented filmmaker once more showcasing his ability to craft loveable characters and deliver a breezy narrative that would only not affect those with a heart of stone.Telling the story of Evan's kind-hearted university professor turned boat repairman Frank Adler, who has found himself in charge of his late sister's genius in the making daughter Mary (played brilliantly by child actress Mckenna Grace, think a young Dakota Fanning), Webb's film may never reach the great heights of the colossal's of the mismatched pair sub-genre but it's so well-spirited and well-delivered that you really don't mind.When Frank and Mary's lives are upturned by the arrival of Frank's mother Evelyn, who wants to take Mary under her wing and unleash her full mathematical powers on the world, fighting against Frank's wishes to allow Mary to live a relatively normal childhood, you can sense exactly where the film is going and predict many of the outcomes from a mile away but in true crowd-pleasing fashion, Gifted elevates itself from what could've easily been misguided sentiment and schmaltz to earn all the feels it gives you.Webb gets the best out of Mckenna's fresh-faced turn, while it's great to see Evan's once more away from the Captain America shield and spandex to deliver one of his best turns away from the Marvel universe. Evan's role in the Marvel behemoth has been both a blessing and a curse for the actor who will likely always face an uphill battle to get away from his breakout role but Gifted ranks up there as one of the talented performers best roles outside of non-Marvel films like Sunshine, Snowpiercer and the criminally underseen Puncture.Final Say - There's a chance Gifted could've been something truly special had it veered away from genre trappings like unnecessarily tacked on romances and kindly neighbours but Marc Webb's film is an affecting, well-acted and often touching tale of love, kindness and the bond of a family and acts as one of the most easy to like releases of the 2017 calendar year.3 ½ one-eyed cats out of 5",Gifted
23,subxerogravity,Was pretty good.,8,22 April 2017,"So Chris Evans tries to prove that there is more dimensions to his acting than his work as Captain America could show , but fails in the process, but that does not stop Gifted from being a good movie as it's more about the child actress who plays Mary, a ""gifted youngster"" (Who gets the Marvel Universe Reference? ) who all the grown ups in the movie have to figure out what's best for the child. While it seems like Evans charter, Frank is trying to do what he feels his sister, Mary's mother wants, this may also mean the normal life he gives her will waste the vast potential she has.The interesting parts of the movie were the real genius parts, which the characters interact about being above average. Really like the conversations between Frank and his mom about the pressure she may have put on her daughter, Mary's mom to be a mathematical wiz, pressure that may have been responsible for her committing suicide.Octavia Spencer was OK in the movie too. Nothing near Oscar worthy, she just did her job as a supporting actress and that's it. Otherwise the movie is good for a watch.

I will always remember this quote because it is so hauntingly true. Most people will see the little girl in 'Gifted' as lucky and like she has won the lottery. Ironically smarter people will know just how wrong those other people are. She is in for a very tough life ahead of her. Without explicitly saying that that movie does a good job of implying as much. I thought they handled that fact impeccably.The film has a lot of great scenes filled with rich and thoughtful dialogue. It's a pleasure to watch. The 100 minute runtime flies by. The acting by everyone involved is also top-notch. The only flaw I could see was that it never had a defining element to it. Films like 'Gifted' should be in the running for the Academy Awards, but there just wasn't quite enough to differentiate it from other films to put itself in that category.

Jenny plays Mckenna's teacher that also becomes romantically involved with Chris. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.

28,jimbo-53-186511,"Lacks complexity and depth, but as a basic 'feel-good' film it does the job",6,4 September 2018,"Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is uncle to Mary Adler (McKenna Grace) a gifted 7 year old mathematics genius. When Mary's teachers become aware of her advanced intelligence, they recommend that she is transferred to a school for gifted children. However, Frank declines this offer insisting that Mary lives a normal existence, but when Frank's mother and Mary's grandmother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) arrives on the scene a conflict of interest ensues between mother and son over Mary's future and well-being which culminates in a bitter court battle...In its early stages, the film plays out a little bit like Matilda; whereby a confident youngster attends school and wows her teachers with her exceptional mathematic skills. The key difference between Matilda and Mary is that Matilda has a slightly more friendly demeanour and isn't as hostile towards others in the same way that Mary is.Although a child genius excelling at mathematics is a fairly interesting way to set the story up the film doesn't develop this thread particularly well; Mary's exceptional maths skills and her being a genius seem to exist more to move things forward than as a general area of focus. This hurts the film slightly and does leave the film feeling a bit superficial at times.The other strand of the story (which acts as the main focus) is a custody battle between Frank and Evelyn over Mary's welfare. Despite being related uncle and mother lead very different lives; Frank is your everyday Joe working as a boat repairer for not very much money, but whom cares deeply for Mary. Whereas Evelyn is a wealthy woman whom has a good standard of living and throws money at problems in order to deal with them. Although the film does attempt to expand on these themes through the court scenes and at various points in the film sadly it just never really hits home and part of the problem lies with rather poor character development; the grandmother arrives on the scene with precious little explanation for her absence. Frank is a fairly uninteresting character where very little is learned about him. Mary is an interesting character, but she does really just seem to be there to get the film from A to B - despite being promising at the start of the film.The film isn't all bad though and it was nice to see Chris Evans in a more serious role and to his credit he is actually good in this film. McKenna Grace also puts in an excellent turn (considering her age). It also has 'feel-good' written all over it making it a very difficult film to dislike, but at the same time it lacks a powerful punch meaning that it is still a long way from being a great film.",Gifted

She starts the first grade and of course finds it tedious because she's far beyond that level. Her grandmother comes to take her to live with her in Boston where she can be put in a prestigious school and be surrounded by tutors. Mary's uncle doesn't want that because her mother said she wanted Mary to be a normal kid and enjoy life and not be constantly taught at all her life.

30,myriamlenys,are you crying yet ?,6,19 July 2018,"There's some good acting - even some very good acting - but sadly the movie is too much of a stereotypical tearjerker to be really interesting or compelling. The grandmother character, for instance, is a villain to hiss at, rather than a living, breathing person. The grandmother was even provided with her own ""kick the dog"" moment, so that even the slowest viewers could understand that she was scheming and cold. As soon as I saw her, I thought ""yippee - she is going to mistreat or neglect that adorable cat, or she is going to cause another person to do so"" ; and indeed, before you could say ""cliché"" the cat was carted off to a kill shelter. Happily the cat was saved In The Nick Of Time. Cinema, the kingdom of the imagination ! You never know what is going to happen next !However, it is possible that I am being too critical in this review. There exist people, in real life, who have become caricatures of themselves. Just look around and you'll recognize them - the ""tennis father"" who forces his daughter to train 24/7, the ""ballet mother"" who urges her starving child to lose weight, the ""beauty queen mother"" who drags her unwilling offspring from pageant to pageant. There even exist parents who are so obsessed by the idea of their children becoming models or starlets, that they deliver the said children into the hands of pornographers, blackmailers or perverts. So perhaps the repulsive grandmother isn't all that unrealistic...But to return to ""Gifted"" : the movie contains at least one missed opportunity. The characters talk and talk and talk about mathematics, but no effort is made in order to explain the context or stakes. For instance, there is this one fabled mathematical problem, the resolution of which would revolutionize the world of mathematics and physics both. So what does this supreme puzzle entail ? Why is it looked upon as the Holy Grail of mathematics ? The movie does not bother to provide an explanation, which means that your guess is as good as mine. I was reminded of a French movie I once saw - I've forgotten the name - in which a Famous Movie Director walked around with some kind of camera, but in which you never caught him doing actual work. By the same token the French movie never showed a glimpse of the director's creations or achievements, which were supposed to be stupendously stupendous. Well, one can't have everything...",Gifted
31,aharmas,Happiness,10,30 April 2017,"Chris Evans is in the center of a story where we are to see two sides of an equation and evaluate the process in such a way that we have to understand the logic in here, and most importantly, we can't have logic without the perfect balance of emotion and intelligence.Chris is a substitute parent, an uncle who raises his niece after his sister dies. Things are fine for a while, only to change when the little girl starts showing signs that she's a very special being, someone who has inherited special attributes from the members of her family, and it's that gift that can lead her to achieve remarkable success, not without a few problems along the way. Some of these problems which destroyed her grandmother's and mother's lives and relationships, and might ultimately ruin hers.She's only seven years old and pretty much subject to what courts and adults decide. The film deals with the legal maneuvers to obtain legal guardianship of the prodigy. What gives the film added depth is that we are provided with the quiet moments which helps us understand the human side versus the importance of the gift. They both have to be nurtured without letting any selfish notions kill the importance of support and love. Children are resilient, but it's easily to damage a life if love is not nurtured as well.Evans is very good at presenting the importance of being rational and understanding at the same time. It appears as if he's one of the few who is willing to think about the pro's and the con's in the dilemma. There's a mother/grandmother figure who is herself a force of nature and can only see herself succeeding through the victories of others.

33,rannynm,"Powerful Statement, Outstanding Acting, Stunning Cinematography",8,9 April 2017,"Gifted is a story with not a lot of surprise elements, but it wins the audience over with its powerful statement, outstanding acting and stunning cinematography. Mainly, Gifted has a very dramatic story line. However, Gifted offers much more then that. Viewers also get a subplot of romance, friendship and strong family values as well as some comedy here and there to keep a dramatic movie light.The plot begins when Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace) starts first grade. She isn't like the other kids in her class. Her teacher, Bonnie (Jenny Slate) soon learns that Mary turns out to be a genius in mathematics. She can easily do equations higher than high school level. Despite her clear giftedness, Mary's uncle, Frank (Chris Evans) refuses to put Maryin a school for gifted children, trying to keep the girl's life normal. Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), Mary's grandmother insists on making her do mathematics around the clock and training her to be a math prodigy. What follows is a custody battle between the two for Mary.My favorite scene really stands out due to remarkable lighting and camera work. The scene really doesn't contribute to the plot, but the cinematography makes it one of the most excellent in the film. The scene shows Mary riding on Frank's shoulders. Behind them, a giant sunset completely fills the sky. The lighting from the setting sun comes out stunningly dazzling. Even though it doesn't add to the complexity of the story, the scene is very impressive and demonstrates the closeness of the uncle and his niece.One of Gifted's weak points waters down to the story. Even though the film is unique from other stories about genius kids, by focusing on the family values and relationships instead of Mary's exceptional mathematical skills, it still comes out very predictable and rather simple. The main conflict never really feels like a major issue but rather, just a side story. Despite those issues, Gifted still entertains through the acting. All the actors deliver outstanding performances. Mckenna Grace, despite being only 10-years-old, completely steals the show. Never does the acting feel forced and the actors seem to authentically connect with their characters and have a true bond on-screen.There are a few adult references in the film, but nothing too worry about. I recommend this for ages 8 to 18 and give it 4 out of 5 stars because, although the story needs work, the acting and cinematography make Gifted a very entertaining and memorable film.By Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

35,krocheav,Gifted - Invites Us To Think And Feel,8,10 June 2018,"Hadn't heard anything about this movie but sounded interesting so took a chance - couldn't miss. Astutely written by Tom Flynn who has a natural flair for involving dialog that works on several levels: in 'Gifted' he creates what must be perhaps one of the best child prodigy stories of the last decade (or more). Reminiscent of (but different to) 'Little Man Tate' it looks at the importance of considering the 'child' trapped inside the genius. This is a classic study of relationships and how we should all learn to treasure them - young and old. Marvel comic director Marc Webb, comes back to grassroots and along with his star Chris Evans, they ensure a movie experience that's sure to engage. With a tremendous blend of humour and drama (some courtroom scenes have genuine sting) this quite poignant story unfolds in an easy-style that draws you to the point of eventually being enthralled. Flynn covers analytical questions about the origins of life, existence of God, sibling relationships, and gently challenges us to engage in thoughts above the commonality of every day small talk but, in ways to fit with who we are. The actor's drawls at times make it difficult to understand every word - this caused me to think I may have had amplifier trouble - until Scottish actress Lindsay Vere Duncan started speaking perfect English (some will have more trouble with this than others) Careful annunciation and lack of sound stages shows at times. Cinematography by Stuart Dryburg is alternately superb and mediocre - a couple of brief hand held shots look messy (but these could have been work added by a second unit?)
 
In a somewhat demanding role, young Mckenna Grace wins with her committed performance and comic Jenny Slate, is divine as her public school teacher. Octavia Spencer (The Shack) turns in another of her special performances. Some popular songs are used as dressing for certain scenes - although the sound mix tends to be a little high - drowning out some dialogue here and there. Stories like this make movie watching a treat and it's always good to find them turning up in-between the comic book CGI blockbusters! -well worth the time- PG/M for some mild adult concepts.",Gifted
36,jacobs-greenwood,Who says there aren't any good movies being made anymore?,9,25 August 2017,"I want to be worthy of writing this summary but, even if I blow it, you should see Gifted (2017). Firstly, what's not to like about Chris Evans. Yes, he's best known for playing Captain America in all those Marvel blockbusters but, if you haven't seen his self- directed Before We Go (2014), do yourself a favor and watch it on Netflix soon. In Gifted, he plays the kind of father every little girl deserves, and wishes she had.Gifted is a beautifully filmed (and edited), heartfelt story about parenting and familial conflict that's as real and insightful as it is funny: its fully developed characters are perfectly cast with actors that deliver spot on performances. The narrative backdrop involves how to best raise a genius child.Evans plays Frank Adler, whose brilliant mathematician sister Diane took her own life and left him with an infant to raise 6 1/2 years ago. McKenna Grace plays Mary, Frank's 7-year-old niece to whom the movie's title refers. Olivia Spencer (who seems to appear in everything lately) plays Roberta, their neighbor, friend and weekend babysitter.As the film opens, Roberta is scolding Frank for putting Mary on a school bus that morning. He believes that Mary is socially awkward and needs to spend time with friends her own age instead of contemplating the future of the Euro. Roberta is afraid that Mary will be taken away from Frank, a fear that is warranted as the story plays out.Jenny Slate plays Mary's first grade teacher Mrs. Stevenson (aka Bonnie), who notices the child's extraordinary gifting which, although she didn't wish it, ends up bringing Mary to the attention of Frank's estranged mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan). Obsessed with her own daughter's mathematical gifts, Evelyn had driven away Diane's friends, leaving her socially immature, which may have contributed to the suicide.These details come to light during a custody battle for Mary between Frank and Evelyn in the courtroom of Judge Nichols (John M. Jackson); Glenn Plummer is excellent as Frank's attorney. She argues that Frank, who was an Assistant Philosophy Professor at a northeastern university when Diane was alive but now fixes boats in the Florida town where he moved Mary, is not adequately providing for her granddaughter. However, it becomes clear that what she really wants is to use Mary as she did Diane to fulfill her own ambitions - Evelyn still regrets having given up a promising career when she'd married - to complete an historically significant and as yet unresolved math problem.In the meantime, what we see is that Frank is truly committed to Mary's well-roundedness. He doesn't give answers to most of her questions so that she is free to come to her own conclusions. There's an ironic scene in which the two are playing on the beach silhouetted against a brilliant orange sky while the sun sets and yet Frank doesn't confirm the existence of its creator when Mary asks if there is a God.In my favorite scene, Frank demonstrates unparalleled parenting ability when he takes Mary, in tears because her biological father didn't even try to see her while in town as Evelyn's pawn, to the maternity ward of a hospital so that she can witness the loving celebration of family that occurred when she was born vicariously.Olivia Spencer is marvelous, her character a stabilizing force of fun for Mary, and so is Jenny Slate as Bonnie, with whom Frank journeys into an unwise relationship; fortunately Frank's indiscretion with Mary's teacher doesn't become a factor in court. Instead, their interactions are used to further reveal Frank's personality and parental philosophy; these more lighthearted and humorous scenes serve to balance the serious nature of the custody trial.Lastly, Miss Grace is excellent as Mary, making her character's genius believable (though it's dismaying that her smarts are too often translated as sarcasm). There are some really sweet scenes between Frank and Mary, but also several involving her teacher, first grade classmates, and one-eyed cat Fred.Highly recommended!",Gifted
37,arungeorge13,Drama with a tinge of 'genius'! [+72%],7,12 July 2017,"Marc Webb proves yet again that he is a master dramatist than a helmer of superhero projects. He needs to be known more for being the guy behind films like 'Gifted' and '500 Days of Summer' (and the upcoming 'The Only Living Boy in New York') than the subpar Amazing Spiderman series. 'Gifted' mostly revolves around Mary (McKenna Grace) and her uncle Frank (Chris Evans). Mary like her late mother Diane (who committed suicide, leaving her daughter in the hands of her brother) is a skilled mathematician and displays her skills quite early on in school. Bonnie (Jenny Slate) is the one who initially draws conclusion that Mary is a powerhouse of mathematical talent. Mary enjoys residing at uncle Frank's, and is fond of routinely staying over at their neighbor Roberta's (Octavia Spencer in a heartwarming role). The funny exchanges between niece and uncle make you smile on most instances. McKenna's adorable expressions and her cute banter (with the upper-incisors-missing) is bound to melt even the coldest of hearts. Mary is intelligent as hell, relishes company of adults but still enjoys Lego and Spongebob. Enter Frank's mom and Mary's grandmother Evelyn, who's adamant on exploiting Mary's flair in math to solve a complex Millennium problem (previously pursued by Diane), and wishes to move her to a special school for the gifted. Frank, who believes his mom was responsible for turning Diane into a lifeless arithmetic engine, strongly opposes the idea as he wants Mary to have a normal life.What ensues is a court-room battle between Frank and Evelyn for the custody of Mary, however the director is keen to stick to detailed character sketches over staging thrills. Therefore, a higher weightage is given to what happens outside of the court-room. The lead characters with all their flaws are beautifully written. Tom Flynn's screenplay even gives due importance to Mary's monocular cat Fred who adds on to the film's winsome nature. Chris Evans is at his relaxed best in 'Gifted' and seems perfectly cast. Jenny Slate is spunky as always and although not occupying a lot of screen-time, delivers a memorable performance. The rest of the supporting cast rise to the occasion. Some of the pieces don't really add up to a coherent whole but the positives override the minor negatives and this works in favor of the film. Scenes such as the one when Frank takes Mary to the waiting area next to a labor room where she witnesses the unbounded joy of couples / family members in welcoming newborns into this world, are worthy of acclamation. The climax though, is a predictable crowd- pleaser that succeeds to an extent in raising smiles aplenty.Verdict: Laudable feel-good flick!",Gifted

43,jon.h.ochiai,Gifted and Whole,8,20 April 2017,"In ""Gifted"" after her taxing first day of main stream school, 7 year- old mathematics prodigy Mary, played by amazing Mckenna Grace, sits on her guardian Uncle Frank, played by gentle Chris Evans, on their beach day near their Florida home. Frank asks Mary about making friends at school. Mary says that she can't make friends with ""idiots"". The older and wiser Frank tells her, ""Your Mother would have wanted you to have compassion."" Mary's Mother Diane was the brilliant mathematician, who tragically committed suicide after Mary was born. Director Marc Webb's ""Gifted"" is predictable, contrived, and could have been better. I loved that scene with Frank and Mary at the beach which defines the movie. ""Gifted"" is about compassion, love, and seeing people as whole beyond just their gifts. I liked ""Gifted"" a lot. Evans and Grace are touching and beautiful together. They compel and shine within the movie's frailties. Writer Tom Flynn has best intentions; however, some of the plot lines and characters falter. Frank's Mother Evelyn played by dominating Lindsay Duncan is too cold and singular without heart. I don't think she is supposed to be the villain, but she is in the movie. Frank and Mary's kind sage landlord Roberta, played by wonderful Octavia Spencer, is not so much a breathing character, rather a paternal narrative device. This wastes the talents of Spencer. Jenny Slate plays Mary's understanding First Grade Teacher Bonnie, who predictably falls in love with Frank. This creates conflict for Mary and Frank which does not have an entirely authentic feel. However, Evans and Slate's chemistry make this work; because we believe Mary's life is in both of their hearts. Bonnie discovers Mary's genius in math class. She informs Frank, of which he is already aware. Frank was the former Philosophy Professor at Boston University, before leaving to care for his late sister's daughter. Frank works odd jobs repairing boats. He home schooled Mary as much as possible. While the kids in Mary's class are doing simple arithmetic, she is schooling herself in partial differential equations. A bully trips Mary's friend on the bus, destroying his school project. Mary responds punching out the bully. Meeting with the school principal, Frank agrees that what she did was wrong. However, he is very proud that she took a stand for someone weaker. The principal reminds Frank that Mary is gifted and would be better suited at the private school for kids like her. Frank says no. He says that Mary's Mother would have wanted her grow up as a kid, and that she would have ""wanted her to be happy"". He promised Diane. He confesses, ""I would rather you dumb her down, if that makes her a good person."" ""Gifted"" is eloquently about choice. Frank's estranged Mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) visits from her home in London. She wants charge of Mary to foster her amazing gifts at Harvard. Evelyn is also the former math prodigy, like her daughter Diane and now Mary. The family is gifted. She despises Frank for wasting Mary's gift. Mary's Mom Diane was the brilliant mathematician on the verge of solving the unsolvable Navier-Stokes Expressions. Apparently, Diane's gift was a curse that consumed her, and her driven Mother Evelyn didn't allow young Diane to live life—or fall in love. Frank knows this all too well. In the tragically disheartening scene, Frank and Evelyn have lunch at the beach. Evelyn tells Frank the reason why Mary committed suicide: ""She was weak!"" Sadly Evelyn only saw her daughter's gift and not the whole Diane. She intends to sue Frank for custody of Mary. This is the dramatic family conflict of ""Gifted"". ""Gifted"" intimately embodies love and compassion. At the narrative arc, Frank must forsake Mary. As Frank tearfully leaves Mary screams, ""Don't go Frank!"" Frank profoundly discovers what he has with Mary in the loss. Evans and Grace are moving and authentic in their partnership. In the wondrous sunset scene on their beach day, Mary literally climbs on Frank. She asks ""Is there a God?"" Frank answers, ""I don't know"" Mary asks, ""What about Jesus?"" Frank answers, ""Love that guy One way or another we all end up together in the end."" In ""Gifted"" we are all together in the end. In the closing scenes we watch Grace smiling and being a little girl with her Girl Scout friends in the park. The choices matter. Kids should be allowed to be kids—it's only right. In the end, ""Gifted"" brings us all together.",Gifted

45,dave-mcclain,"""Gifted"" is a wonderful family story, wonderfully executed.",9,16 April 2017,"Octavia Spencer has carved out quite a niche for herself in feel-good, family-friendly dramas. At first, she often played caregivers (mostly nurses) during her feature film career, which began in 1996 when she played a nurse in ""A Time to Kill"". But then she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2011's ""The Help"" (in which she played a maid). Since her Oscar win, the variety in her movie roles has expanded, but she seems to have gravitated towards a certain kind of cinematic story. She took on roles like the peace-loving Johanna in the ""Divergent"" films, a loving grandmother involved in a child custody battle in ""Black or White"" (2015) and a brilliant and protective NASA supervisor in ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Then, in 2017, she played God himself (well, HERself) in ""The Shack"" – and a loving grandmotherly figure on the fringes of a child custody battle in the terrific family-friendly drama ""Gifted"" (PG-13, 1:41).The character to whom the title ""Gifted"" refers is a precocious 7-year-old girl named Mary, played by Mckenna Grace (previously mainly known for her TV roles in ""The Young and the Restless"", ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Designated Survivor""). Mary never knew her father (who disappeared from the picture when Mary's mother learned that she was pregnant) and her mother died when Mary was six months old. Mary is being raised by her uncle Frank (Chris Evans) in his modest Florida home, which he pays for by freelancing as a boat repairman. Frank's landlady is an older woman named Roberta (Spencer) who loves Mary like she's her own granddaughter. Good thing. Mary's real grandmother (Frank's mom) is an arrogant and controlling woman who lives in Massachusetts. Which is why Frank lives in Florida.After home-schooling Mary for a while, Frank decides that it's time for Mary to go to school, so he enrolls her in first grade. Frank thinks it's critically important that Mary socialize and make friends with kids her own age. Mary doesn't think she should go to school. Roberta agrees and isn't shy about expressing her concerns to Frank. Roberta knows that Mary is special and is concerned about protecting her from a world which can't understand her. Mary doesn't want to go to school because she knows that she can't relate to kids who aren't on her intellectual level. Also because elementary school is so well, elementary. Mary's concerns about school play out very quickly when she hits a boy in the face with a book for bullying a younger child – and when she gets disgusted with her strict, but caring teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) for asking the kids what 3+3 equals, when Mary can do calculus! Ms. Stevenson clearly recognizes Mary's genius in mathematics and the school's principal (Elizabeth Marvel) tells Frank that the school is unable to academically challenge a child like Mary and offers to help get Mary into a very prestigious private school nearby. Frank refuses, insisting that what Mary needs more at this point is to learn to socialize with her peers (chronological peers, if not intellectual ones) and to just ""be a kid"". It's at this point that grandma Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) shows up on Frank's doorstep. A mathematical genius herself (but surpassed by her late daughter), she tries to convince Frank that his method of raising Mary will rob her of her potential and deprive the world of major contributions that she seems destined to make. When Frank refuses to budge, Evelyn drags him into court for a bitter and very personal custody battle. Roberta and Evelyn become more involved in the lives of Mary and Frank, but it's unlikely they can do much to help Frank sort through his limited options.""Gifted"" is a wonderful movie, wonderfully executed. Screenwriter Tom Flynn and director Marc Webb give us a sweet and meaningful story of love, family and finding balance in life. It also makes for outstanding drama, with well-constructed twists and multi-layered plot lines. Grace is adorable – and exceptionally talented, as shown not just by this role, but by the impressive list of screen credits she accumulated by the age of 10! Evans may not be carrying Captain America's shield in this movie, but he's still pretty heroic as the loving but conflicted father figure who desperately wants to do right by his niece. Slate reminds us that she's an excellent actress with more range than most of her fellow SNL alumni. She also has great chemistry with Evans, with whom she had a year-long relationship after making this movie. Duncan plays her pseudo-villain role with depth and Spencer is both fun and heart-warming to watch. The occasional adult language and allusions to sex take a little away from this film's family-friendliness, but ""Gifted"" really is a great gift to Movie Fans. ""A""",Gifted

The Gifted in this case is a 7 year old girl who is seems is incredibly good at maths and those sorts of problems most of us have difficulty with when in school-she doesn't. She lives with her uncle and hasn't seen any family member for close on 7 years. the premise of the film is what happens when ""family"" come a wanting! the ""villain"" has to be (quite common now) played by an English actress and she is completely vile and lacking in any form of morality-given she can buy anything she wants and is used to her own way.

53,CinematicInceptions,Food for thought with just a couple flaws.,7,28 April 2017,"This was not a stellar film, but it was pretty good and there should definitely be more movies like it. It's a very human story that examines a dynamic and debatable social issue, perhaps in a biased manner, but still in a way that should provoke thought and conversation among those who watch it. On the surface, it is like a blend of Matilda, Good Will Hunting, and Captain Fantastic, but it felt a bit more like The Help in how it masqueraded as a feel-good movie but was in fact deeper and less uplifting than it seemed. For the most part, I thought it was good, but there were a few issues I had with it.Beginning with the good parts, I thought it gave a fair examination of each aspect of a very tricky issue. With Mary being at a university level of learning, it hardly seems logical that she should be required to spend twelve years learning things that she already knows. But on the other hand, the story of her mother's suicide shows that sending her off to a think tank is not a good idea either. This leaves a murky gray area with a lot of options, several of which are tested and discussed throughout the movie. I also liked that the protagonists were likable, but also realistically flawed. Frank and Mary's relationship in particular was great and involved a lot of conflict, but always remained positive overall. Mary's character in particular was done really well. She was easy to like, but not overly cute or overly sassy like a lot of movie kids. I didn't really buy that she would be *that* smart at seven years old, but the extremity of her intelligence improved the movie enough that I was able to suspend my disbelief. Tom Flynn shows impressive skill in writing effective and realistic dialogue and especially with presenting characters and names in a way that makes them easy to remember. Even people that we never see on screen like Mary's mother Diane, or Evelyn's second husband are easy to remember by name.On the downside, I was not huge on the ending. Having the plot twist before the climax hinge on Fred the cat was a little contrived, and the story to that point felt like any major turns should have been character driven rather than a random plot twist. I liked Frank's final confrontation with Evelyn, but Mary's final fate didn't feel quite right. Yes, she's getting the best of both worlds, but that doesn't solve the major problem of her going to school with adults and having playmates that are light years behind her mentally. The way it was presented made it seem like perfection had been achieved, but I think there was probably a long and hard battle to be fought after that. The court scenes were not the best. They weren't so bad, but there was definitely something off about them. Lastly, Marc Webb showed once more that he cannot portray a school scene without resorting to bullying tropes and clichés. Fortunately, there were only a couple of these scenes, but they reminded me of the few school scenes in Marc Webb's Spiderman movies, which were similarly weak. Still, those are pretty small issues that didn't detract much from the overall experience of the movie.I would definitely recommend that anyone over the age of 12 go see it, especially if you want to see the potential Oscar nominees. Mckenna Grace's performance isn't incredible, but the academy has favored some kid actors in the past, and I think she performed well enough to gain their attention. It won't be the most entertaining movie of the year by any stretch of the imagination, but it will provide some great food for thought. See it with a group if you can, because it should spark some good discussions, and definitely try to see it soon because it won't stay in theaters for long. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Gifted

Though the story focuses more on Evans and Grace, I personally undestand both sides. The uncle wants to fulfill his sister's wish of her child having her own freedom, being happy and being who she might want to be while the grandma wants what, from her point her view, is best for her granddaughter. That is not a flaw! Understanding both characters, aside from the storytelling and acting, is what makes this movie great!Note: If you loved this, watch ""Wonder"" (2017). It is also great!",Gifted

56,EthanBJones_03,"Powerful, Beautiful and Heartwarming; an emotional ride I definitely recommend",7,13 June 2017,"'GIFTED' was directed by Marc Webb and stars Chris Evans, McKenna Grace and Lindsay Duncan. When his niece is discovered to be a child prodigy, Frank(Chris Evans) battles with his Mother(Lindsay Duncan) and the US Justice System to keep his niece and let her live a normal life.Mr Webb, if you're reading this(which I'm positive you are), I now forgive you for that atrocity that was 'The Amazing Spider-Man' 1 and 2 because this movie is an emotional, heartfelt story that brings up some deceptively complex and though provoking questions. McKenna Grace was fantastic in this movie as Mary and I will tell you now, she has a bright future ahead of her. She made me laugh, brought me to tears, and convinced me that she was a freaking genius. Backing her up(and in our lead) is Chris Evans' providing a current career highlight performance as Frank. I wouldn't say that Evans has convinced me of his acting capabilities up to this point, that is to say until I watched this movie. If you want a very enjoyable ride, I highly recommend you check this out.The story for this movie is very emotional and heartfelt and, like previously stated, brings up questions on what we SHOULD do in these situations. Granted, they kind of try to answer those questions but I still see it as up to the viewer to ask themselves. This movie is a feelgood movie so just take it for what it is and don't expect a complex plot similar to 'Inception' or 'Enemy'.Supporting our two wonderful leads are a colourful cast of characters and performances. Lindsay Duncan provides a solid performance as our villain, Evelyn while Octavia Spencer provides an incredible comic relief. The only character with a leading purpose I actively disliked in the movie, merely for there inclusion, was Jenny Slate as Bonnie. I don't see why she needed to be in the movie any further than exclaiming 'LOOK. THIS KID IS SMART!' and I think leaving her out of the film after that point would have made it better.Technically speaking, it is a very proficient film. Webb shoots is very, very nicely and the editing is top notch. I did quite like the set design, even if there wasn't much special to it.Overall, this movie was funny yet harrowing, uplifting yet disheartening but most importantly, it was a pleasure to watch.

58,coreyjdenford,Okay Gift,6,16 June 2017,"This review of Gifted is spoiler free*** (3/5)GIFTED CHILDREN. THEY'RE adorable. Clever beyond their years and inertly sweet. They're also a rarity to see, not only in the natural world but in the glitz and glam world of film too. There are, of course, a few examples of this shown in other movies – notably Little Man Tate, Good Will Hunting and Roald Dahl's Matilda – while all these were successful in their material, cleverly writing around these characters, deftly handling them with emotional heft, and finally proving their brain power on the screen. There aren't enough films like that. Director Marc Webb, who has shown his loyalty to the big screen with his hilarious debut 500 Days of Summer, then taking a heroic turn with both of The Amazing Spider-Man films he proves his way again with Gifted, an inertly sweet drama about a young mathematics prodigy. Analogy aside, like the previous gifted child examples it's cleverly written around two normal human beings. There's single man Frank (Chris Evans), sporting a Captain America hairstyle and a rugged goatee. He lives a relatively simple life as a freelance boat repairman in a modest Florida apartment joined by a cat with only one eye and his high spirited young niece, seven-year-old Mary (Mckenna Grace) - who within the first few minutes of the film shows her brain power on the first day at school.That's the second point, Mary may be young but she is outstandingly clever working at a level over double her own age, this later comes to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsey Duncan) who wants to enrol the youngster at a school for gifted children. Frank, however, wants otherwise he just wants her to be a normal kid and have the life that her mother would want. The premise is I Am Sam meets Matilda - it works, for a while at least, the film suffers from problems, firstly a subtle problem, the scripting is clever there are a few lines that don't quite match with the film's inert sweetness - it's small but over time this becomes more noticeable thus dragging the film's tender moments. The bigger problem comes in the film's second act - for a while the material here has the right impact deftly carrying more emotion, through more dramatically impacting feelings and more love. Sadly, this is squandered by custody hearings with Frank and Evelyn - perhaps this is used for a stronger purpose but the problems with the editing sadly bring it down. That said - the problems are quickly glossed over by the nuances of family ties - adding more drama between the two leads. And it's here when the third and final point rings true; there is more emotional heft that surrounds the characters. Though nothing significant happens in the second act - thanks to the fantastic lead performances - the film doesn't fully lose its bearings. Evans is sensational but it's the charismatic Grace who lifts the film and really earns her casting. She quickly proves to be the crowning glory, the attachment with her co-star, through the emotional heft, and the pathos that she leaves. Child actors are only ever as good as their director, but here she stands above the others in a phenomenal performance - topping the film's always sensational veteran actors Octavia Spencer and Duncan. Indeed, it's not perfect due to the drop in the second act - but thanks to the flawless performances, emotional heft and good old fashioned sweetness. This is an enjoyable drama, and it narrowly joins the gifted child film hall of fame. VERDICT: Gifted's plot is indeed nothing spectacular or memorable but thanks to fantastic performances by both leads it's an enjoyable drama about extraordinary human beings.",Gifted

Although thought-provoking , and sharing the same serious concern, the picture does not reach the quality of ""Manchester by the sea"", both in terms of screenplay and acting. Lonergan's movie had a more introspective attitude towards family bonds, and fatherhood as well. Here we find a more entertaining attitude and plot, but managing to involve the viewer: the story proceeds with a steady pace and a focused direction, probably without rolling too much in the deep, but still capable of arousing thoughts and feelings. Acting is also good, the little girl especially offers a very heartfelt interpretation in a tough role, and shows a very good chemistry with Chris Evans, who does a good job, but is less convincing than Casey Affleck.

63,teddyryan,No Presents For This One,3,15 May 2017,"GIFTED mixes up story tones –forces emotions - is loaded with clichéd characters - and is the victim of a wonky script gone awry. GIFTED is a toxic mix of Good Will Hunting and a failed TV pilot. One dimensional characters litter the film like jellyfish in the Florida ocean. The main kid actor – who is a supposed mathematical genius, although otherwise perfectly normal as a child – desperately tries to come off as cute – but in doing so, fails miserably. If the kid wasn't haltered (or misdirected) into an over the top Jerry Maguire ""look how adorable I am"" scenery chewing performer, she actually might have been endearing. As bitter and condescending as I sound, GIFTED is made by a top tier team. The director, actors, and screenwriter are established players in Hollywood. Still, filmmaker Marc Webb – who brought us the delightful 500 DAYS OF SUMMER – phones this one in big time. He shoots the whole picture hand-held - giving the story a stale mumblecore vibe. In my opinion, it's like producing Metallica's Enter Sandman as an N Sync Song. Or drizzling ice cream with olives and cheddar cheese. The evidence will speak for itself (**SPOILER ALERT**) – bonding scene with poorly improvised dialogue - sloppily combined with the Cat Stevens song ""The Wind."" There's plenty more of these agonizing instances, trust me.Note to filmmakers: please don't use ""The Wind"" in your movie. It was done successfully by Wes Anderson in 1998. But, poor deployment of the song has subsequently poisoned many a film. Even Cameron Crowe fell into the trap when making the endearing ALMOST FAMOUS.

Frank's plans for a normal scho,7,18 December 2017,"Gifted (2017):There are two types of dramas in Hollywood.One is hard-hitting drama which remains in our heart and crawls into skin which is clearly Oscar contender and the other type is a drama which may not look great and doesn't even try to be great.Gifted comes into second category but with casting of Chris Evans and Octavia Spencer,we expect this to look great which acts a drawback to this film.Plot:Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is a single man raising a child prodigy - his spirited young niece Mary (Mckenna Grace) in a coastal town in Florida. Frank's plans for a normal school life for Mary are foiled when the seven-year-old's mathematical abilities come to the attention of Frank's formidable mother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan) whose plans for her granddaughter threaten to separate Frank and Mary. Octavia Spencer plays Roberta, Frank and Mary's landlady and best friend. Jenny Slate is Mary's teacher, Bonnie, a young woman whose concern for her student develops into a connection with her uncle as well.My Review:Gifted is from Marc Webb,the director of The Amazing Spiderman series and,100 Days of Summer.He is kinda uneven filmmaker so there are 50-50 chances of his movies being good.Fortunately Gifted didn't disappoint.Gifted has ages-old predictable plot about father-esque
relationship between a talented child and a adult and a conflict about her custodian rights.So with all this cliched backdrop,Gifted should have something special to impress.Marc Webb succeeded by casting stellar cast like Chris Evans,Octavia Spencer and Mckenna Grace.There are few scenes which really leaves a good impression like the scene where Mary shows her talent is school,the scene where Frank takes Mary to a hospital are amazing and heart touching.Rest of the scenes are simple and engaging.Performances played a key role in making this film memorable even with cliched content.Mc.Kenna Grace is a show-stealer with one of the best child performances of the year.She deserves applause for this film.Evans is very good and this role does not match for his Captain-Stardom.Octavia Spencer is wasted in such a small role.So,Gifted may not have enough content but Young Mckenna Grace holds our attention till the last frame.My rating 6.5/10",Gifted
65,FallenEye,"""Irregardless"".",7,23 June 2019,"This movie is another reason why Evans is without question, the best of the Chris's, while Mckenna Grace's performance was simply, graceful.Gifted is a simple story of a battle of custody, with a script that produces some well constructed and humorously ""frank"" dialogue, delivered by a gifted cast that maintains the film's appeal, from the court room to the class room and everywhere in between.Webb's direction was well above average, and the screenplay flowed fluently enough. The composition also played its part pretty well, as it imperceptibly complemented the film gently in the background.Though I loved Evans and Mckenna, I have to admit however that, Lindsay Duncan arguably delivered many of the movies best lines, and perhaps even the movies most engaging moments, and well; Gifted was all the better for it, ""irregardless"". 7.4/10.",Gifted
66,austin0731,The subtle brilliance of normality,8,8 May 2017,"Gifted is the newest film by Mark Webb and sees to a return to form of his earlier hits like ""500 days of summer"", after the Amazing Spider man franchise's finish we finally get a Mark Webb film that puts him in a position where he is truly comfortable in; Like ""500 days of summer"", ""Gifted"" takes its time and Mark Webb has a thing with patient filmmaking. Along with the brilliant performance by Chris Evans and child actress: McKenna Grace this experience has been an enjoyable one. As I said this film really takes its time developing these characters and the two leads had great chemistry; The dialogue between the leads are both comedic and thoughtful. Even though there are no true climactic moments or 'explosive moments' where the story really rockets off, it manages to be a very subtle and 'normal' movie, perhaps to reflect the central theme of the film in which this child prodigy attempts to live a normal life despite her uniqueness. In a summer box office season where we have multiple big action box office draws its a nice breath of fresh air, it was a relaxing, warm and heartfelt film with various comedic quirks. The ray of sunlight that shines across one's face. I suppose this is what the film does best, to emit this feeling of warmth and closure seamlessly.",Gifted
67,asifahsankhan,Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace are exceedingly appealing together!,9,24 February 2018,"Everybody shows their work in the winning math of Gifted, which finds a simple formula for success with a flawed father figure and his prodigious niece. Chris Evans swaps Captain America's shield-slinging for adventures in parenting in this film from (500) Days of Summer and Amazing Spider- director Marc Webb's - heartfelt and uplifting comedy/drama. The film is decidedly emotionally manipulative without being cloying, and often finds real humor in the complicated situation that arises around a genius 7-year-old, played by Mckenna Grace.Evans and Grace are exceedingly appealing together, and their charming chemistry keeps the film afloat even when it doesn't seem to know which direction to move in. Lindsay Duncan works her way through a thorny character, and even makes off with one outstanding monologue, and her scenes with Evans highlight the superhero star's ability to match wits with even the most formative of talents. Still, Webb rarely puts his trio together, and the film suffers all the more for it.That's to say nothing of the handful of strange sequences that pepper the latter half of the film, including a visit to a hospital (ostensibly designed to make a despondent Mary feel better) and a third-act jag that sees a foster family suddenly, weirdly entering the action, even though the interpersonal dynamics of the characters at hand are more than enough to make a meal out of. Tom Flynn's script isn't afraid of asking tough questions when it comes to Mary's fate (What's good for an exceptional child? What do parents owe their offsprings?) but couches the rest of the film in such superfluous material that it's nearly impossible to cut through the noise. In short, the math doesn't add up.In the end though, the film is pretty sweet and entertaining and keeps you on a wonderfully heartwarming and charming cinema experience which by the way, absolutely impacted me emotionally. It introduced relatable and interesting characters and really made you care which is what is most critical for a human drama like this one. Definitely a film that people should go and see!",Gifted

69,heisenberg12,"Interesting Source Material, but Falls Short of Anything Special",6,15 December 2019,"I've been really wanting to see this for years, and finally caught it on cable. It was decent, but a little too disappointing to give it a positive review. I love the premise of it, and that's why I thought it would be special.However, there are redeemable qualities to it. First, it is a touching movie at times. There are about three to four moments that really touch you and that has value. Then, there is the little girl who is adorable in it; you really want the best for her. There were a few funny moments and the girl who played the teacher was pretty good in her limited role. Finally, there are some inferred realities of what it means to be gifted and how gifted people can be maladjusted due to society's norms.On the downside, there were too many courtroom scenes, the lead actor was not likable or enjoyable in my opinion (it felt more like a showboating role for him as he comes across in love with himself and there is nothing special at all about his delivering of the material although he does well and is competent in one regard, which is coming across as an assistant philosophy professor who changed careers), and the film didn't delve far in deep enough with the realities of being gifted.Understand that not all gifted people are math prodigies. There are at least 13 different subjects one can be gifted in, including music, neurolinguistics, writing, visual-spatial, athletics/coordination, memory recall, specific sciences, and the list goes on. It was cool that she was good at math, but it seems like it's the conventional one to pick, too, that conveniently fits into a Hollywood script.Being gifted is not a joke. Parents, society, peers, and the jealousy, superficiality, and average-level thinking and social norms surrounding a gifted person as they go through all levels of school can truly derail gifted people from ever fulfilling any potential.Ironically, due to the school system's status quo pursuance of mediocre-level achievements, many gifted people don't even know that they're truly gifted until they find out later in life, and never forget that the brain doesn't stop developing and growing until around 24 years old....so it's probably best to approach the topic with an open-mind and try less to judge people than to allow them to pursue their areas or subjects of interest on their own autonomy and motivation.6.5/10",Gifted
70,blrnani,healthy v realising one's potential,7,28 October 2020,"The film's young lead puts in a terrific performance that has Captain America always struggling to keep up, but he isn't doing such a bad job of giving his young niece and ward a happy and stimulating childhood.
The problems begin when she starts school and the educational establishment joins forces with her rigid and demanding grandmother to get her into a rarified atmosphere that will push her to realise her full potential.
That is the same atmosphere that drove her mother to suicide, so her uncle is strongly against his mother's plans to 'ruin her grandchild's life too' (though this is tactfully never said outright in the film).
It's a fascinating subject and this charming film makes a nice companion piece for a film I think addressed it even more strongly: Captain Fantastic (which I avoided for a long time thinking it was just another film about superheroes we are being overdosed on).",Gifted
71,maddiebuggie,gifted review,9,27 April 2020,"This was a great movie. There were lot of great relationships. They all had great chemistry wether they were friends, family or lovers. I loved seeing how much the father cared about his daughter. The father was good at also making sure his wife the little girl mother wishes were taken care of. He made sure that the kids had a great social life by being around kids and was able to be challenged by taking college classes. The father cared more about the girl then the mother gradma had. The mother gradma might have acted like she cared about the girl but she truly didn't. The gradma only cared about making sure the girl could get into a good college. She never cared about the social life of the child. She also wanted to make sure the little girl could have the best life so she could make lots of money off of her. By the end of the movie the girl got the life that was good for her. There was enough drama, love and storyline to keep the story interesting. The character development was really good. I recommend the movie to everyone it a really good movie. It great for all ages.",Gifted

74,lucasnochez,Film Review: Gifted,10,6 June 2017,"On January 17th 2009, visionary and talented music video director Marc Webb made his feature length debut with the totally original and highly unusual romantic/comedy/drama 500 Days of Summer. The film, which went on to be a total critical success, box office spectacle and cult classic, made a name for Webb, who, with his original first film, landed the second leg of Spider- Man's totally unnecessary ""The Amazing"" series reboot. Webb, who went on to direct two instalments of our friendliest neighbourhood superhero, re-casting Peter Parker with Andrew Garfield, (in our opinion) the best Peter Parker we have seen so far, was unable to tap into what made Summer so great, and really showed audiences how little creativity and imagination exists inside studio tent pole films. Sadly, while Webb's Spider-Man films went on to make a ton of money, it proved that just because your movies make money after such a beloved independent film, does not mean that audiences actually adore your body of work. Luckily for audiences, Webb has finally returned to the small scale end of filmmaking, with his newest film Gifted; an emotional and human story of extraordinary circumstances, set with ordinary people.Sadly, while big name studios continue to cultivate independent break-out directors for their high- profile tentpoles (Colin Treverrow and Jurassic World, Jordan Vogt-Roberts and Kong: Skull Island and Gareth Edwards and Godzilla) we are hoping that the day arrives that these absolutely amazing visionaries find a way to blend the creativeness that once made them recognized, with the profitable property they are in charged of brining to the big screen.This time around, instead of Spidey, director Marc Webb had the chance of directing the Avenger's Cap in this emotional and human story of selflessness and unconditional love. Gifted is by no means a large scale film, despite having Captain Avenger himself front and centre.Evans plays Frank Adler, an ivy-league educated man who, until recently, was given the responsibility of raising his brilliant but deceased sister's daughter Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace). Frank's sister Diane was a brilliant mind, who was on the cusp of solving the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Millennium problem; one of seven of the Millennium Prize Problems. Now, if you are any no way mathematically inclined and have no idea what a Millennium Problem is, here is your history lesson. A Millennium Problem consists of seven of the most complex and difficult mathematical equations known to mankind (yes, they really exist).Upon learning of Diane's suicide, Frank acts as Mary's de facto guardian, and keeping his promise to his sister, devotes his life to keeping Mary's life as normal as possible; which includes enrolling her into public school in Florida, having friends (even if her only friend is a fifty year old Motown- loving neighbour Roberta Taylor, played wonderfully by Octavia Spencer), and most of all, making a life for herself outside of her wicked mathematical talents.On Mary's first day in school, despite Frank's wishes to stay under the radar, Mary does the complete opposite of Frank's demands, acting up and showcases her math skills, immediately becoming the star-studded student of the school, especially to that of her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate) and school principle Gloria Davis (Elizabeth Marvel). Mary, unable to contain her big personality in such a little shell, is beyond herself and really not able to contain her spunky personality. Noticing her immense gift and talents, Principle Davis is willing to give Mary a free ride and ticket to a prestigious private school nearby. Frank, who gives his own very convincing case, declines all of the offers given to Mary, insisting she live a normal life filled with childhood instances, friendships and most of all, playfulness.While Frank and Mary seem to be blending into their humble and comfortable lives in Florida, both of their lives are shaken drastically with the emergence of Frank's mother (Mary's grandmother) Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), who believes that Mary's mind is a gifted one-in-a-billion mathematical prodigy mind, who should continue her late mother's legacy and begin working, while still a child, on the Millennium Problem, given her very abstract and young handle of advance calculus problems and solutions. What continues is an ugly and emotional custody battle for Mary between her Uncle Frank and Grandmother Evelyn,.While the majority of the film shows a firm direction in which Frank wants Mary's life to play out, Frank is never certain that what and how he is allowing Mary's life to unfold is the right choice. Stricken with constant doubt and uneasiness, Frank's biggest fear in his life is ruining Mary's. As the relationship between Bonnie and Frank grows, and their fears and desires for Mary are shared on Friday nights at a local bar (a day that is given to Frank to alleviate from his duties as caregiver), Bonnie and Frank make it very clear that Mary is just a child, one who needs to act accordingly and live out the innocent portions of her life, unlike her mother, who's life in a lab arguably lead to her tragic suicide.Gifted is a very tender and touching story of love lost, love found and love cherished. The film is never sensationalized at any points given the very rare circumstances of Mary's talents. Instead, while many may argue that Gifted spends too much time exploring different genres (a courtroom drama, a romantic comedy, a melodrama and a buddy comedy), Gifted shows how easily capable a narrative with a heart and soul can tread water into so many genres without seeming all too clichéd or overplayed.",Gifted
75,rutzelb,Possible Best Picture,10,4 August 2017,"We see that Frank Adler (Chris Evans) is raising 7-year old Mary (Mckenna Grace) alone. Frank's sister Diane, a gifted mathematician had committed suicide and Frank then took the baby. The father of Mary was out of the picture and not heard from. All is good for a while until the grandmother, Evelyn Adler (Lindsay Duncan), and Frank's mother too finds out that Mary is Gifted in Mathematics and she wants the top schools for Mary. Frank wants Mary to enjoy being a kid and wants her to stay with him. Court battles ensue to see who will win: Frank or Evelyn, who by the way is also a gifted mathematician.Before you start to watch this movie, be sure you have a box of Kleenex handy because you will need it all the way to the end. You will fall in love with Mary and the relationship she has with her uncle is simply amazing. The banter between Frank and Mary is pure gold. I think we have a rising star in Mckenna Grace so be warned she will warm your heart like no other. She is a breath of fresh air. Talk about perfect casting, wow!You almost wish that this is a true story. Well, consider that somewhere at some time maybe something like this story has happened to someone. Maybe. Remember, there is nothing new under the sun so all is possible. Yes, I wished this was a true story, but maybe it happened at some distant time. Maybe. You just never know. And yes I did have a box of Kleenex nearby, but I wasn't prepared for this to be so touching. Touching sounds like such an understatement and it is. We see the court battles and one thing I noticed: at no time did Frank talk to Mary about what was going on in the court. It was like Mary was going to be blindsided if Frank loses. I did not recognize Chris Evans mostly because he sports a beard in here. Beards are in. One cannot see anyone anymore because the beards hide the face, but beards are in. Well, at least he is not bearded when he plays Captain America. Yes, that Chris Evans. Notables: Octavia Spenser as Roberta, Frank's Landlady and best friend to Frank and Mary; Jenny Slate as Bonnie Stevenson, Mary's teacher, who first noticed that Mary was Gifted and she is also Frank's love interest; Glenn Plummer as Greg Cullen, Frank's lawyer; and John Finn as Aubrey Highsmith, Evelyn's lawyer.The acting all around, cinematography and dialogues throughout were exceptional. Kudos must be given to the director also as we got to see great scenes. There is a twist of sorts, but it is nothing we could have seen or known about, but it does resolve everything. Hey, we like happy endings. (So true)I would nominate this movie for Best Picture and a Best Actress Oscar for Mckenna Grace as she is perfect in here, and I think I need to buy another box of Kleenex.

78,danielharden,The Numbers Mary... What do they mean?,7,29 June 2017,"Back in 2009, Marc Webb would make his big screen debut with the fantastically unique romance that is, 500 Days of Summer. Webb would then, having probably impressed some big dogs at Sony, go on to direct the big budget blockbuster reboot that was The Amazing Spider-Man... After the second film crashed and burned and Sony made a deal with Marvel, Webb now directs Captain America, returning to his comfort zone of feel good indiewood movies with his new film Gifted. Gifted is the story of child prodigy, Mary and her uncle/guardian, Frank as Frank battles for the future and custody of Mary against his own success seeking mother. This film marks a step in the right direction for Webb after The not so Amazing Spider-Man mess, while also giving underrated/ typecast actors a platform to really act.Firstly, the film boasts a decent cast who in effect the backbone of the film. Octavia Spencer doesn't disappoint and Jenny Slate does a decent job as Mary's teacher Bonnie. However the entire film would be nothing without it's two stars; Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. The on screen chemistry of their father-daughter bond is extremely believable and is what gives the films story its emotional weight. As well as with Evans, Mckenna's entire performance is mesmerising and is hands down the absolute highlight of the film. What is it with cinema and fantastic child actors at the moment? Jacob Tremblay (Room), Sunny Pawar (Lion), Jaeden Lieberher (Midnight Special), Mackenzie Foy (Interstellar) and now Mckenna Grace. I don't know what has happened, but long gone are the days of Jake Lloyd Meesa happy about that.The film itself is your standard fare feel good film about a special child and a custody battle. Gifted is conventional for the most part due to the way it chooses to handle its subject matter and story. It's essentially Kramer vs Kramer at its core. However, the film uses its conventions in a winning combination which is still rather effective and emotional, with more than a little help from its cast as well. The film ends somewhat realistically, and in parts, cynically surrounding the character of Evelyn played by Lindsay Duncan. I personally liked this angle, as it made the ending not too cliché, but I can see many people disliking it, thinking the complete opposite. Films like these can often tend to dip into utter fantasy for that 'Happily Ever After' ending, and so I appreciate the element of realism that Gifted seeked to retain.Nonetheless, Gifted has one major flaw and that is the scripts narrow mindedness. The film becomes almost like everyone in the custody battle courtroom, so focused on Mary's life and what is right for her that is ignores other important factors and fails to open its eyes to the bigger picture. Characters aren't developed upon as they are only relevant to the role they play in Mary's life. For example, Octavia Spencer's character Roberta feels like she was only written so that Octavia Spenser could be in this film. Jenny Slate's character Bonnie is just a teacher and love interest for Frank. And Frank is Mary's carer, to whom we only learn about through being the brother of Diane, Mary's mother. When Frank takes the stand in the courtroom, a lot of information is briefly mentioned about him as a person, information that I would have loved to see developed upon. At the end of the day the whole story is revolving around Frank's ability to be Mary's legal guardian, so I believe a lot more character development is needed with his character. Yes the film is from Frank's perspective, but we are simply watching Frank watching Mary's life. As Frank is the primary complication in the films narrative, perhaps the film could have focused on his rehabilitation, or at least getting a job with healthcare But then again this could be handled poorly and come off as cliché, but would provide the ending with some actual resolution and answers, either way a much deeper development of character is needed.Gifted is a good comeback for Marc Webb to his comfort zone and offers up an impressive feat of acting for a largely underrated cast. Although the script needs to widen its focus, developing characters such as Roberta, Bonnie and Frank, the acting and feel good formula is enough to satisfy and overall makes the film enjoyable. Webb may not have had the best go at Spider-Man, but his go with Captain America is definitely a huge step up.",Gifted

I loved the chemistry between Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace. Something to watch out. The direction is great and the story very much moving. Story (8/10): Mary is a gifted child who is way above her biological age. She solves complex math problems and provides expert views on politics. However, her late mother's brother, Frank, is determined to give her a normal life like every other kid. However there is as much he can hide from the world, especially her school. Eventually, it turns into a courtroom battle of Mary's custody between Frank and his mother, Mary's grandmother, Evelyn, who wants to have her in top schools for gifted in the country and solve some of the all time great problems in mathematics. In the midst of all this, there is a secret kept safe around Mary's mother's death. While the plot isn't so powerful, the script was very well written which is why the movie was gripping and managed to keep audience's attention. I loved the character sketch of Mary and Evelyn in particular - very assertive, except that Mary had more subtlety instead of visible aggression. Acting (9/10): Chris Evans is great in the role of Frank. His brilliant chemistry with Mckenna Grace is perhaps the reason the movie was so enjoyable. Mckenna Grace had definitely tough role playing a gifted child with all the jargons. However, the raw naughtiness she was able to project just normal to any child of her age brought a lot of life to her role. Lindsay Duncan was good too - reminded me of Leonard's mother from BBT. This was only the second movie of Octavia Spencer I've watched and she was good again even in a limited role. She made her presence felt strongly in the movie even with two other leading ladies more closely related to the protagonists. Overall, the movie had some very good performances to watch out for. Direction (9/10): Marc Webb elevated an average story into an excellent cinema. His projection of the artistic side (right brain) of an otherwise math genius (left brain) was great and something to take away from the movie. The humor kept the movie light and fun to watch. I loved the way the relationship of Frank and Mary was projected. Some of the scenes, like the hospital one, were beautifully conceptualized and executed.

88,rioplaydrum,Charming And Gripping,9,19 April 2017,"I knew nothing about this film. Had seen no adds, heard no word of mouth, pretty much nothing. I only found it only after tapping out the local AMC 24 and driving a few extra miles to see something new.The premise was intriguing: What to do with a seven year old mathematical prodigy caught between a cozy, loving household occupied by her doting Uncle Frank and a one-eyed cat named Fred, and a challenging but cold academic world ready to pace her on mental treadmills for the rest of her life.McKenna Grace plays little Mary who's character is at the center of attention whether she likes it or not. Mostly not.Grace's performance does raise a few eye brows as she very convincingly plays a precocious and genius little girl plagued with boredom being surrounded by the dead-weight of average students she has nothing in common with.In fact, Mary's personality is also far developed beyond her peers, exhibiting a sarcastic and jaded sense of humor more on par with a bunch of 40-year olds downing a shot or two after a particularly bad day at work.After Mary's abilities are discovered by her first grade teacher, the inevitable battle for command of her future quickly unfolds.One very powerful supporting role is supplied by Lindsay Duncan who portrays Evelyn the Grandmother. Evelyn is a poised and proper Englishwoman armed with a titanium intellect few would want to challenge. As the legal proceedings unfold, Evelyn verbally fire-bombs the entire court room from the stand without batting an eye in her fight for custody of Mary.Her arguments and assessments are hopelessly air-tight and seamless, leaving Uncle Frank and his lawyer scrambling.Frank just wants Mary to be a little girl. Grandma wants to plug her into The Matrix. Who will win? 'Gifted' is not without it's displays of some original laughs. My favorite was a scene in which little Mary discovers her Uncle Frank is sleeping with her 1st grade teacher, who one morning comes stumbling into the kitchen wearing only a towel.Their reaction to each other is priceless.As to why this production is flying under the radar with virtually no advertising or promotion is baffling.The hour-and-a-half flew by for me and left me with an odd feeling it ended too soon. Aside from that, there was almost nothing wrong with this film, at least not that I could find.Warm, unique and entertaining, 'Gifted' should stay with you for days afterwards.A great family night movie.",Gifted

This title is very hard to review because it has the same plot as hundred other titles. Anyway , somehow this one managed to deliver a good experience.As i think about it more and more i guess its the little girl's (Mckenna Grace) performance, i don't know where they found this child but she is one hell of an actress. They film is just about the right length so the fact that its a known plot drama won't really matter , it manages to stay interesting and touching until the end and that's why i recommend it to everyone.",Gifted

91,alanpgini,"Good movie, not too realistic, but entertaining",7,14 August 2017,"Pretty good, I give it an 7 of 10. Kind of a weird dichotomy here though. The message of where you draw the line between genius and real life is a little too pat in this movie. The life of the mind, is not so easily reconciled with the life of the world. There are no such happy endings in real life, as it is in this flick. Your either a machine totally immersed in your world, while the ones you love are dragged behind you. Or, you are part of the real world. There really is no in-between. The flick is worth the watch though, for asking this question. Even if there really is no happy ending answer. Mckenna Grace is maybe the best of some recent examples of great child actors today. Chis Evans is very convincing as usual.",Gifted
92,achmoye,Well handled drama,8,29 July 2017,"After seeing the trailer, I was really interested in this dilemma about how to properly educate a gifted child. And I can say the question has been really well developed in this movie. The Synergy between main actors, playing the uncle and the gifted girl, is remarkable. Mckenna Grace's acting is interesting because you can actually see that Mary is a gifted child, but she is still a child though, and this ambivalence helps to the complexity of the character. I just think there is a lack of her point of view, I wondered several times what Mary was thinking about the situation.What I like in this movie is that there is not too much emphasis on the genius aspect of Mary. We can see that she is a genius, but it's not showing off, just enough. This movie is exactly what I expect from a drama. Moving moments, perfectly enhanced by the music, some twists, and a continuous tension and affection for the characters. Great if you are bored of blockbusters and if you want to actually feel something.",Gifted

It was a light hearted drama- so one doesn't go with a lot of expectations and that is precisely where this movie manages to surprise you. The plot was well managed. The story wasn't out of the box, only a bit unreal, if you are too much into art films and the way it crew handled such old wine in new glass makes this effort commendable. Character development didn't have immense scope but was heralded well. The underlying message was loud in its subtlety and despite a fantastic setting, the director and actors tried keeping things very real, pleasant and funny.After having seen him in Captain America and other such ""not so serious"" movies, it is good to see the acting prowess of Chris Evan on display. The supporting crew was great and Mckenna Grace, that kid is immensely talented- she held the movie together with her acting skills. I think the movie lacked some much needed ""powerful"" background music. The cinematography was top notch, which makes me feel a few more minutes of scenic landscape- wouldn't have harmed!I have a list of favourite feel good dramas, this one goes right into that bucket with its happy ending.",Gifted

Not only can Chris Evans be a heartthrob for tons of underage girls, but also a good versatile actor who is capable of portraying emotionally strong characters! This flick showed how solid and robust chemistry can be between niece and uncle. It proves that sometimes it's not necessary to be a parent in order to love someone as your own child. The rivalry between authoritarian grandmother and devoted uncle was very intense, but pretty understandable to me - both parties wanted nothing but the best for the girl, however, their viewpoints weren't the same.It's a debatable topic- whether it's worth sacrificing child's personal freedom in favour of greater achievements or not. The philosophy of both relatives is more than conceivable, but, unfortunately, it should take some time to grasp what would be better for a kid. Luckily, the ending sorted all things out, but usually in real life it takes ages for adults to fathom that even child geniuses are still human beings and they are entitled to have their own privacy. This movie teaches us how to embrace our inner selves no matter how smart or dumb we are, and also induces parents to look at their gifted kids from a different angle.",Gifted

103,DonutLover,Doesn't happen this way in real life,7,27 August 2017,"People who don't know geniuses like to fantasize that problems can be fixed so easily; the scene in the end of the little genius wearing a brownie uniform, running happily to fit in with her friend at the playground. Uh......no.Spoilers!!! In real life, people who are that profoundly gifted (the new euphemism for genius) have more than one exception: she would also be proficient in music, or writing, or something other than math. Unless she was autistic, which she is not. She is merely a genius. And yes, their brains DO work better and faster than the average smart student, contrary to what a very loud poster on this site claims. It is not just about rich kids who get tutored a lot, and score high on tests. IQ tests can show that genius occurs in kids who are BORN that way, and their brain works like a purebred race horse, compared to the normal horse most of us are. It's also usually inherited genius. Grandma had it, dad, etc. The boredom of the classroom would have physical effects as well: boredom for geniuses is crippling. This movie showed the girl not having headaches, or tummy aches, or anything that normally happens when a child is placed in a classroom that is years under their ability. I like in the end that she ends up learning in a university class; this is good. I'm just saying that it's not this easy in real life, folks. Also, geniuses never finish high school in four years, again because they can't stand the boredom. So, the Ivy Leagues don't want them as students, since their path is off the beaten path. Ivies want them to come teach, however, once the genius has made a name for themselves! But read up on how many kids who are geniuses ( coming out of a school like the Davidson Academy, for example) end up at an Ivy League. Very few!! The Ivies want smart kids, not geniuses. Geniuses who can't take the boredom of high school graduate early or drop out. They don't play the game the Ivies want and take the two years of AP classes, etc. etc. Let me tell you raising these kinds of kids has its blessings and challenges!!",Gifted
104,CasualFnSViewer,Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace's great chemistry and performances make for a simple yet heartwarming family drama,8,1 May 2019,"Frank Adler (Chris Evans) cares for his gifted niece, Mary Adler (Mckenna Grace) , and hopes to give her the normal life Frank's sister requested of him. In the quaint town where they lived, they led a life that they were both contented with. This life would soon be disturbed after Frank refuses to send Mary to a school for gifted children and a legal battle to gain custody of Mary ensues between Frank and Evelyn Adler (Lindsay Duncan), Frank's mother and Mary's maternal grandmother.Chris Evans and Mckenna Grace have both filled their roles as their own respective family members the way a supportive and loving family would. Even characters such as Frank and Mary's neghbour Roberta Taylor (Octavia Spencer), Mary's teacher Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate), play important roles in the lives of the two as uncle and niece. Grandmother Evelyn Adler (Lindsay Duncan) on the other hand presents herself as the academically focused family member who wants her niece to lead a life of success as a gifted Mathematician.This heartwarming drama is beautiful as it is simple. The sense of wanting to give your child or younger family member a normal, simple life as opposed to the life a successful and recognized member of society would lead, sends a message of finding just the right balance and determining what is in that person's best interests to prevent them from leading a successful yet miserable life, or a simple yet seemingly insignificant one.",Gifted

There really are not enough character dramas out there, and this tries to tell the story of a gifted girl, her troubled mother and uncle (Chris Evans) who looks after her.Evans is solid, if unspectacular, and McKenna Grace (who plays the girl) skates a thin line between child actor annoying and adorable. Lindsey Duncan and Octavia Spencer weigh in as supporting roles and everything should be hunky dory.The problem is is that the notion of a gifted child being born from a gifted mathematician is a little thin and the protracted custody battle feels hackneyed and full of predictable narratives that push us towards a conclusion you can see a mile off. Trying to make the grandmother evil is simply done by making her English and how Mary has procured the methodology of advanced and abstract math (to college level) is glossed over.I wanted to like this, I really did, but it felt false.

109,darcywinchester,A heartwarming film,9,7 November 2017,"In this Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer, The Amazing Spiderman) directed film, written by Tom Flynn (Second String, Watch It), Chris Evans (Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers Assemble) stars as Frank Adler who is bringing up his dead sister's daughter, seven year old Mary (Mckenna Grace: Designated Survivor, Mr. Church), a child prodigy in coastal Florida. His plan to give her a normal school life, much to his neighbour Roberta Taylor's (The Help, Hidden Figures) disapproval, backfires when her teacher Bonnie Stevenson (Jenny Slate: Zootropolis, The Secret Life of Pets) realises her mathematical abilities. A scholarship is offered, which he turns down as he is worried it will bring them into the radar of his mother Evelyn Adler (Lindsay Duncan: About Time, Alice in Wonderland), but sadly this happens any way. He has to hire a lawyer Greg Cullen (Glenn Plummer: Speed, Saw II) as she takes him to court to get custody, will she succeed? This is a beautiful little film where the cinematography mirrors the acting ability and centres on the bond between the Uncle (Evans) and his niece (Grace). There are no huge surprises in plot or story, the little twist was easy to guess for me, but it is utterly charming.Evans delivers a nuanced performance and Grace is superb with her world-weary personality totally convincing that she a) does not want to be at school, and b) finds it all so boring and unchallenging. You can clearly see how being home-schooled by Evans has shaded her opinions and it makes it all the more heart-wrenching for the viewer when their relationship is threatened by a grandmother who is only interested in her for what she can achieve, and what that would mean for her.It is a moving story and the best moments come when Evans and Grace are together as you really feel that he knows what is best for Mary. She should get to be just a little girl despite being a child prodigy and though Spencer's role is sadly too limited, it is what she predicted would happen all along when Frank lets Mary go to school.There is one beautiful moment, backed with Cat Steven's 'The Wind' as a soundtrack, where their chemistry sets the screen alight and the film takes you through the hope and heartbreak right along with the characters.A heartwarming film which will leave you wondering what is best for a child like Mary.",Gifted

113,lobstersurreal,Amazing!!,10,16 October 2019,"Wow. Bravo Hollywood.See, I always wanted to satiate my Good Will Hunting-fix and while there were some sparse ones with occasional glimmers of it, I never could. This movie pretty much fell into my lap and I got what I wanted all the time without trying to look for the same 'type'. And thank God, I found it while looking for some low key movies.The dialogue was catchy and not corny unlike majority of the movies churned out by Hollywood. Cutty, edgy, funny and Mary gave a very nuanced performance.While the plot has similar vibe to Good Will Hunting, it kinda had that 'small town community' vibe as well where everyone knows almost one another with relationship forming...and also had the Phenomenon vibe with John Travolta.The theme is pretty simple: the unconditional love and nurture of Chris Evans (I always confuse my Chris Evanss and Chris Pratts) for a natural flourishing of genius vs. a helicopter grandma.As I said it was very tonal and layers revealed carefully in appropriate times. For instance, at one stage we get to hear the background of the Brother who was a professor, or rather 'associate professor'.Chris Evans had his 'oh so sexy' aura and I bet even if he played a wooden plank he would still be damn sexy.Spencer is...to echo, the gold standard. The acting of the teacher was careful where she had her own character who from the first impression of an authoritarian revealed herself to be more soft-natured and shy at times.And in fact, even Grandma's character was also not black and white and villainous as we got to share from the moments (say making Mary happy by offering her the things she likes) as much control freak she turned out to be.All in all a great cast and a fantastic film. I wish they made more movies like this. Surprised to see them mention Navier-Stokes from the beginning which was a trigger it wasn't going to be your another average Joe Schmoe movie. A bit like Proof meets Good Will Hunting meet Phenomenon.A millennium prize movie...and it's a pity you don't see intellectual conversations, subtle allusions and references...Two thumbs up.

121,alex-klein2424,A Gifted Treat,8,13 June 2017,"Gifted was a movie that could easily be overlooked by many as a run of the mill story but what sells this movie goes beyond that. The story is basic but the characters and how they come to the end of the story is what pulls you in. Frank played by Captain America Chris Evans is the surrogate father of a gifted young girl who we find out comes from a long line of gifted people. After her mother takes her life shortly after she is born, Frank, her brother, takes the child in, as no one else will. The crux of the movie is that Frank believes his sister wanted this bright young girl to have a normal life and not be stuck in some fancy school to develop her math skills. The problem comes when Franks very distant mother comes into the picture and tries to take her away so that she can have a ""better"" life and live up to the potential she has inside her. The supporting cast delivers in spades along with a very touching and emotion turn from Chris Evans with whom you all know I share a rich history with due to his prior commitments. Marc Webb the director, who also directed the Amazing Spider-Man movies does a great job guiding these characters and really pulling out the love inside them. I think it is funny that Marc directed a super hero movie and Evans also was a super hero so I hope they had a conversation about that on setI can only imagine ""Hey how's everything being Captain America? Did Marvel mention the work I did on Amazing Spider-Man?"" ""Uh sure thing, your movies were hogwash and clearly Sony doesn't know how to make a Spider-Man movie these days so it makes sense they had Marvel help out, also I am a handsome rugged simple guy just playing a cool super hero and you made a critically and financially panned movie where you tried to cram too many things into it"". Maybe they had a different conversation but who knows, I wasn't there.The setting of the movie was also really cool being that it was in Florida. It was not New York and there were no web slingers swinging around crying about how no one understands what they are going through. What I also enjoyed was how they treated Mary, the young girl. She was brilliant in every sense of the word and everyone around treated her like an adult so if there was tough news to be shared it was shared or very deep conversations that were had. I really enjoy seeing that in movies because it seems like parents treat their children the same way Sony treats the Spider-Man property: with total disregard of who these characters really are and what they can become.Overall, I loved this movie. I was engrossed the entire time, unlike when I saw Amazing Spider-Man 1 & 2. If you love movies with brilliant child actors, see this movie. If you love Chris Evans then you have to check this out. If you love cool movies about math and geniuses, catch this flick.",Gifted

128,obiegimmie,'Gifted': An Overall Enjoyable Film,9,27 April 2017,"""Gifted"" is a 2017 Fox Searchlight Pictures drama directed by Marc Webb, with a screenplay by Tom Flynn. The music is by Rob Simonsen; the cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh; the editing by Bill Pankow; and production by Karen Lunder and Andy Cohen. It stars Chris Evans (""Captain America""), Mckenna Grace (""The Young and the Restless""), Lindsay Duncan (""Birdman""), Jenny Slate (""Obvious Child""), and Octavia Spencer (""Hidden Figures""). Filming began October 2015, largely in Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia. Its budget totaled at $7 million, and its box office sales end at approximately $12.5 million internationally, ending at an estimated grand profit of $5.5 million. It runs at 1 hour; 41 minutes (101 minutes total) and is grouped as PG-13 for some swearing and sexual situations. Now to my review:7 year old Mary (Mckenna Grace) has been spending the prime of her childhood with her Uncle Frank (Chris Evans). However, with first grade beginning, Frank decides that enrolling her in public school will ultimately be beneficial. It is made clear from the beginning scenes that socially, Mary is severely lacking and of course, Frank and his landlady/best friend/babysitter Roberta (Octavia Spencer) are painfully aware of this. Thus, Mary is understandably frustrated by the curriculum and ignorance of her grade level. There, she meets her teacher Bonnie (Jenny Slate) who, after questioning Mary, discovers that she is in fact, gifted. After some googling on both Frank and Mary, Bonnie learns that Mary's mother, Diane, was a brilliant mathematician who ended up committing suicide shortly after Mary's birth. Enter Frank's mother and Mary's grandmother Evelyn (Lindsay Duncan), an equally brilliant and intellectual mathematician, who brings a conflicted antagonist that this movie was undeniably in need of. Evelyn and Frank indulge in some predictable skirmishes over Mary's future, and whether an education that matches her intellect is what she is in need of. Since the two are in such disagreement over the girl's future, Evelyn begins a crusade for full custody. Evelyn and Frank duke it out over Mary in a series of nail-biting court battles (That was sarcasm); Mary, Roberta, and Frank stop at a hospital to watch families' excitement over newborns (eye-roller); and Bonnie and Frank begin romantic entanglements (annoying and unnecessary). + Grace and Evans have wonderful and undeniable chemistry.+ The acting is beautifully executed; the casting is superb. + It raises important arguments over the future and childhood of gifted children. + All of the characters (even the child genius) are relatable and easy to admire. + Evelyn makes a layered and complex antagonist. The court scenes are boring, and take away from the overall story.-The whole Bonnie/Frank romance is extremely unrealistic. Mary's mother, Diane, is too underdeveloped.9/1090%A-",Gifted
129,rstarzecmoviecritic,"Decent Movie, A Little Cheesy",7,31 July 2019,"""Gifted"" proves to be a decent heartfelt story about a young math prodigy in the middle of a custody battle between her uncle and her maternal grandmother. Its tone has a great range from delightfully charming to morbidly dramatic. We become connected to the main characters enough to sympathize with them, but certain aspects of the film make it tough to ""buy"" the story. The movie has enough potential to be hailed as an award-worthy film, but falls short of that type of quality for a few reasons. ""Gifted"" is not necessarily a bad movie, but it has its weak points.The performance from child actress Mckenna Grace is actually somewhat problematic upon second viewing. Being a genius/prodigy, her character has a certain attitude towards authority figures, but the bad attitude never feels genuine. The way Grace plays it, the attitude comes across as forced. Not only that, but when Grace has to portray Mary while she is working out problems, there is almost no emotion in these segments. If not showing happiness, the audience would think that while Mary does challenging math work she would at least give off a sense of eagerness - racing to get the problem solved in a standoffish nature - or maybe more irritability that she has to do work well below her full capabilities. Instead we get a more robotic performance from the young actress. Sometimes it is difficult to cast the right child actor or actress for a role, and that seemed to be the case for ""Gifted.""The movie does have good intentions, on the other hand. Mary is torn between two very different worlds by her uncle and grandmother. While her uncle, played by Chris Evans, is trying to keep her in public school so that she can be a kid like her mother would have wanted, her maternal grandmother is basically using her genius to complete a complex mathematical ""proof"" that her mother had started when she was alive. This poses a good philosophical discussion about whether Mary's happiness is more important or if she should work her mind since her capabilities are extraordinary. Letting the kid have fun just seems like common sense, but the question is posed nonetheless.While ""Gifted"" is filled with great moments such as Mary standing up to a bully who ruins one of her classmates' art projects, you cannot help but notice cheesiness that is sprinkled throughout the film as well. A few scenes that focus on portraying Mary's grandmother as a villain are a little over the top to be honest. In a courtroom scene, the grandmother delivers a monologue while on the stand that clearly marks her as a villain, but it is filled with cliché ""bad guy"" remarks. The performance itself is fine, but the writing combined with the camera moving in on her face really forces a dismal tone upon the audience. It would be nice if there was more of a moral ambiguity in the portrayal of the two main adult characters in ""Gifted."" Evans is shown as all-good while Duncan is basically portrayed as all-bad, but a little gray area for the characters would make their presence more interesting.All that being said, ""Gifted,"" has some key flaws, but it is no means a bad movie. It is a nice, heartwarming film that can be enjoyed especially by families. Although Mckenna Grace's performance is not perfect, we can all learn from her character, Mary, and we can learn from the adults in this film how important their roles are in a child's life.7/10",Gifted

The acting, writing, photography and story all were a complete knock out of the park. Now - You may be wondering why I mentioned in the title a certain cat named Fred who is the beloved sidekick of the little girl.

Never been a fan of Chris Evans, but this movie made me change my view about it. Some expressions, dialog's and the looks are very matured and smooth, he doesn't go overboard with his acting whether it is smiling, crying, or love.Mckenna grace as the smart and gifted kid was lovely. one of the best acting done by a kid i have seen. her dialog delivery was good, crying, compassion, innocence everything was done to almost perfect level. The chemistry between Evans and Grace is one to remember and to cherish, scenes including them will make you go through every emotions. Every other actors were good to their role.

141,Faizel-R,Well portrayed formula family drama,7,5 September 2017,"""Gifted"" is a family drama delving into many areas of contention with regards to children and guardianship. Mckenna Grace portrays Mary, a mathematics child prodigy, whose mother was also a mathematics child prodigy. The story begins where Mary's uncle is her guardian after her mother had died in an apparent suicide.McKenna delivers an outstanding performance that makes her character totally believable and her situation understandable. Chris Evans as the uncle, also puts in an outstanding performance. The interaction between child and guardian is what drives the narrative and as obstacles appear they deal with them.The major plot point is a battle for custody of the child between the the uncle who wants her to have a childhood and the grandmother who wants her to reach her full potential and eventually become like her mother and suffer her mother's outcome? This was where the movie lost some rating points because the portrayal of the grandmother, Evelyn, by Lindsay Duncan was like cardboard. I would have liked to have seen some of the emotion related to the loss of a loved one even if it was six years earlier. The relationship between mother and son was not believable at all.The movie is enjoyable, but it has been done before. I do however see a bright future for Mckenna Grace.",Gifted

The young actress who plays Mary is gifted herself. I literally can't stand the precocious kid thing. Both on movies and in real life, but she, both actress and character, had such a wide range, it was enjoyable to watch. The school teacher is cute as a button and gives a wonderful downplayed and nuanced performance. Captain America was good, but way over used the brooding head down eyes looking through his forehead pose. Great dynamic between he and his mother though. Those were interesting scenes I thought.

143,lauravalerietaylor,An Emotional Ride,8,7 April 2017,"I really enjoyed this film. I went into it not knowing what to expect, but I'm glad that I saw it.From the very beginning of the film, the stage is set to show us what kind of relationship Frank Adler has with his niece Mary. He isn't just her guardian; he's her friend. She trusts him, loves him, knows he'll take care of her, and believes with all her heart that whatever he does is best for her because he loves her (even when it involves doing something she doesn't want to do, like going to public school). Throughout the movie, we get to see little snippets of Frank and Mary's life together, and it becomes evident early on that they love each other very much. What I loved about the film is that you never lose sight of that fact.McKenna Grace was absolutely brilliant as Mary. She managed to pull me in from her very first line, and so convincing was she that I had to continue to remind myself that she was acting. It was nice to see Chris Evans in a different sort of role, and one that he handled beautifully. As always, Lindsay Duncan was excellent in her role as (as he described her) Frank's ""exacting"" woman of a mother, and I enjoyed Octavia Spencer's supporting role as Roberta. I didn't particularly enjoy Jenny Slate's role as Bonnie, and I was a bit relieved when they decided not to make her relationship with Frank a main storyline. The focus should have been the custody war for Mary, and it was.I laughed at some scenes, cried at others, and became angry at still others. It was an emotional ride that managed to put me in the situation with the characters, feeling what they were feeling and taking the ride with them. I certainly enjoyed it, and it's definitely a film that I hope to add to my collection.",Gifted
144,laceydelrae,Black and white ideas leads to anti-climatic ending,4,4 February 2020,"Lots of spoilers!I feel like I'm the only person that thought this movie was overly simplistic and boring. On some positive notes the cinematography is great and it has an amazing ensemble of actors but sadly their talent was completely wasted. Whike the relationship between Mary and her uncle Frank is sweet and cute I found that Frank's attitude and overall demeanor just appeared very nonchalant and somewhat apathetic. The entire movie centers around a custody battle between her uncle (who's raised her since she was a baby) and her grandma who comes into her life at seven years old. Her grandma only wants to exploit her mathematical genius to solve a millennium math problem the girls mother didn't didn't finish before committing suicide. We're supposed to believe the grandma and uncle are completely at odds however every time the two conversed on screen their conversation was cordial and friendly and got along just fine. The ideas in this movie are far-fetched and just presents itself as an all or nothing scenario. Either the child stays with the uncle and lives a life as a normal kid (staying in first grade which bores her and she's disruptive) or the grandma gets custody and the girl will be drowned in tutors and constant mathematics. The court room drama is so far-fetched and unlike anything that would ever happen in real life. They put the grandmother on the stand solely to try and prove that she never truly cared about her kids and that's why she shouldn't get the girl. This serves nothing to determine the best interests of the child. I mean even the uncles lawyer is against the dude forcing him to take some ""plea deal"" even though they could have won. The movie tries to be emotional and deeply moving yet I could not get past all the craziness of it all. There was no sound logic in the ideas presented. I mean the uncle who has provided for this girl and raised her since birth loses custody because he can't provide the girl with medical insurance and she doesn't have her own bedroom (things that can be remedied) so they send her to live with a foster family Instead where secretly the grandmother is staying in the guest house. I mean really?!That is why there is Medicaid and if the grandma wants to flaunt her money so much (which the judge is old school and will side with the money) easily the courts could come up with an agreement that would Ensure the child is well provided for and cause least amount of disruption in the child's life.The Entire movie the uncle is unwilling to put his niece in a gifted school because he just wants her to be like a normal kid. This is the entire basis of the movie, I mean the ending solves the first 15 minutes of the movies problem. Because somehow before this legal nonsense he was so stubborn about keeping her in first grade (Or she'd never be a normal kid otherwise) yet by the end he somehow sees there's an easy answer to this all along and she's enrolled in college courses, Girl Scouts now has friends.The little girl who played Mary was the only redeeming quality of this movie. Chris Evans tried to act like a very deeply feeling father figure but I just found his character lacking in any sort of emotion or commonsense. He barely reacted to anything happening around him- like he wasn't bothered by it. The movie has all these ideas that go nowhere, supporting cast members who add nothing to the film and tries to lead up to this big tearjerker moment but is bogged down by completely illogical ideas and lack of conviction from the uncle.",Gifted

Not because it's a blockbuster (actually I don't know if it is, or not, and I don't care.) or because of any hype. (I've watched it by pure chance.) I enjoyed the story, which was well thought through. I enjoyed the acting -- by everyone. Really. That doesn't happen to me often. And it is beautifully shot.The movie has drama, humor, sadness, and happiness. Even a little romance. The story revolves around a little girl, Mary, who, at 7 years old, is found to be a mathematical genius. Her uncle, Frank, is bringing her up, after his sister committed suicide. When it comes to light that little Mary is truly exceptional, Frank's mother enters the equation (pardon the math pun). She wants Mary to go to a school where her gifts are challenged, where she can advance her level of mathematics. Frank, however, wants Mary to be a kid. To grow up playing, having friends, and tromping around with her one eyed cat Fred, and go to a regular school, with regular kids, so she's not alienated from kids her own age. Basically, he wants her to have a normal life, where she can be normal. A custody battle ensues between Grandmother and Uncle, and Mary is caught in the middle. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm keeping it vague. :) Sorry. The movie has many ""Moments"". Things that you'll recognize from your own life, the troubles and the joys. I loved it for that. I would say it's suitable for kids to watch, although there are some adult themes. Nothing graphic though. It's a quiet movie, not something flashy, not hugely dramatic.

The philosophical questions this film provides its viewers are something any sane and intelligent parent should contemplate.How do you react to a gifted child when all you want for them is a normal life? What is a normal life? Do you as a parent - or guardian - have the right to deny a life, in whatever form it takes?There are many more philosophical questions surrounding this film. But the weight of such questions are difficult to process, so I truly have sympathy for people who find themselves in this situation.A great film, with realistic acting, in a situation many of us have no concept of understanding.8/10.

One of them plays the bad cop like always and like always, the good cop wins the end. But there is still something good about this movie. It is not a high flying one but it still gives you a good feeling inside though I am yet to figure that out. And hence I'll stick with 7 only.",Gifted

166,lthes81,"Excellent, entertaining, thought-provoking movie",10,19 May 2017,"The simplest stories make the best movies and those involving the human condition are the best of those. I can draw a parallel between this story and the one of William Sidis, who, although a 'manufactured' genius, suffered a life so completely different from the one Frank Adler wisely mapped out for his niece. What a lesson in sociology! Exactly what do you do with a gifted child? What must you do? What SHOULD you do? The grandmother sees only one narrow-minded goal and presents herself as the wisest and most intelligent authority of what path her gifted grandchild should choose - preferably, have chosen for her. In fact, she takes it all the way to court, resorting to low blows to get what she wants. Mary's uncle Frank, on the other hand, proves himself to be much wiser than his mother in guiding the future of his brilliant sister's child. He considers the whole child, not just her mind. He literally picks her up and carries her away from her beloved books and computer to play in the sand and be a kid. ""Dumb her down into a decent human being."" That should be the motto of anyone raising or teaching a gifted child. William Sidis was never given this opportunity; he was consigned to a think tank, so to speak, and was never allowed to develop normally. Consequently he died too young, unable to live in a world outside an academic vacuum. There are clear similarities between Sidis and Diane Adler as well as those between Sidis' father and Evelyn Adler, in all her blindness and stupidity.

His direction is focused and heartwarming in nature here as well.This movie is powerfully acted. Everyone does an amazing job but the stars here are obviously Mckenna Grace and Chris Evans. They both sell the father-daughter dynamic quite well and you feel their ups and downs.Technically, this is a great film. Some lovely songs are interwoven in between scenes and the cinematography is brilliant.""Gifted"" also raises some important questions on parenting and what's really best for a child.Overall, a fantastic film that you should see with your child to remind yourself why you became a parent in the first place.Both your turbulent emotions, as well as Fred the Cat, will stay with you long after the credits roll.10/10",Gifted

The reasons i haven't rated it higher is the story on its own and acting from Chris Evans. Story had some holes and overall for me it seems like it wasn't invested lot of time and will to make the story more original.

After watching it, I kinda feel human and recharge again and made you realized the meaning of kindness. Thank you for creating a very good movie that so enjoyable.First the acting. Mary is just unbelievable here. Never once i felt i am watching a kid act in-front of a camera. Well ..., i am saying she has done a very very good job compared to other child actor. We can really feel her when she sad, cry, happy or when she tried to hide her 'grown up and geniuses from coming out because her dad told her so. And, because she is cute too, it's amplify sadness when she gets hurt. I almost cry when frank left her at her foster parent. Now, because I love action movie, I really hope that there is a director out there that will offer her a character in an action movie just like kick-ass. It will fits her perfectly and will surpassed chloe moretz easily.All of the adults also doing very good but that should be expected from them. What i want to say is something about their chemistry. Thank goodness, it is there!! That captain America did a very good job as a guardian and comparable to the wolverine in real-steel movie as a trouble father. He did a very good job here.Frank and mary's teacher, mary and roberta in some scene have a fantastic and inspirational dialog that can 'wake' you and make you realized there are other perspective to understand about life.Scenery shown during Frank and mary out together is so amazing and beautiful. And that scene when mary said 'you lied to me' is so intense that i am sure many of you will be touched. There are also scene that makes you heart pumped faster when that that old lady evelyn terrifies everyone in court with her intelligent and non-stop reasoning.

180,chrisecasey,"Guardian manages to re-gift child to his ""you'll go down in history"" mama",4,26 October 2017,"The intro was so touching, I had to watch... Getting on the bus for first day of school, ever. Tears actually came to my eyes. It went downhill from there, and if I was a drinker - ""get him a bucket of beer,"" grand mama said in one of the movie's scenes - I'd be crying in the pale ale. The alcohol dependency of ""Re-gifted's"" first grade teacher was so tacky, and ""re-gifted"" so unbelievably facile with math... Yet, I found meaning in some of the dialogue. But due to the usual stresses of life, I'd have to see it again to recall the exact poignant phrases. Though in retrospect, I might be giving credit where credit isn't due. I mean many of the story's lines had occurred to me in different contexts, and putting those lines together in one signal movie was admirable, but somehow suspect - who can pull that off, someone very talented, more than me obviously, or someone with some really dumb luck, like the one monkey out of a million trillion that can do Shakespeare on a typewriter. So many threads, so little time. Here's one - teasing grand mama's husband, (not there to defend himself, but who cares) for being home on the range, as it were. It is a fact that there is a mass migration of people moving off of the land and into the cities. Is someone who is rich moving in the opposite direction, I'm talking about grand mama's second hubby, supposed to be a humorous touchstone, a boldfaced lie, or an irony that we're supposed to believe which entails a myth of life on the land that needs to be sardonically addressed. My take - isn't a twenty five minute commute to home from places that supply us with what we need (food, amenities, creature comforts) better than a two and a half hour one. There's no real difference between getting off a Lear jet and getting off an Airbus - the airports are the same - between a Porsche SUV and a Mazda, between a ten thousand acre ranch, and a house with a view of the local mountain range.

182,dmcarefuldriver,Interesting premise weighed down by a messy plot,6,20 April 2017,"With better writing and a more focused plot line, this could've been a great movie. As it stands, it's merely okay.The story is about the relationship between a child prodigy and the man raising her, who himself is a pretty interesting guy with an unconventional background. Actually, that's not really the story – that's what it should've been. Instead, it's a sloppy courtroom custody battle with a pointless romantic subplot that feels like something you'd see on a lesser episode of Suits. There are some interesting moments in the courtroom scenes, but they feel somewhat out of place in what should be a more character-driven story.The execution suffers most in the third act, in which new characters are introduced on a whim and the movie further loses sight of its central premise. This movie does know what message it wants to deliver, but it gets way too caught up in the specific motivations of each character. I can't really say any more without spoiling, but I will say that the ending, given the problems that are set up earlier in the film, was less than satisfying for me.If you really love child prodigy movies, this one might be worth an iTunes rental a month from now. But for now, you're better off staying home and re-watching Good Will Hunting, which does everything this movie tries to do but with far better execution and emotional resonance.",Gifted

195,tonyx-90260,Absolute mess of a movie,2,15 December 2017,"In the opening half hour or so, we see a gifted girl who lives with her uncle going to school and trying to fit in despite her obviously superior intellect. I will say that the main character, the ""gifted"" girl, is played by a very good actor. Everything else about this movie was a mess. After an okay start, the movie gets to the convoluted main plot point, which is that the girl's grandmother (the uncle's mom) shows up to try to take custody of the girl away from her uncle, who is her guardian and parental figure. The girl is 7 years old, so where has the grandmother been this whole time? We never really get a satisfactory explanation. It becomes clear that grandma wants custody so she can put the girl through more intense study so she can become a math genius and solve a great math problem that has yet to be solved. The girl's mother had made solving the problem her life's work and had apparently died before solving it. The uncle gained custody of the girl apparently because his sister had wanted her daughter to live a normal happy life, unlike how her life had been, and therefore put her with her uncle and then took her own life. So grandma feels the girl's potential is being wasted with uncle, who is not pushing her enough in her mind. Grandma wants to put the little girl to work solving this great problem while the uncle wants her to live a happy, normal life. The court battle that ensues is beyond ridiculous. They should have consulted some lawyers and educators before making this film. Setting aside the flawed way it portrays the education system and mathematics, the court battle is pathetically unrealistic. First off, after 7 years with the uncle basically being the girl's dad, no court would change custody unless it was in the best interest of the child, which is the legal standard. No evidence is given that the uncle is unfit, yet the grandmother appears to convince the court that he shouldn't have custody. Before the judge has to decide between the two, the two sides agree to let some unknowns adopt the girl, which is an insane and unrealistic compromise that no one in real life would agree to. In fact the uncle has no incentive whatsoever. He would be better off losing custody to the grandmother, with whom he gets along, so that he could still see his niece from time to time. Anyway, after the compromise, uncle is cut off from seeing neice by the adopted parents. The adopted parents put the girl's beloved cat up for adoption, which prompts uncle to go save the cat and storm over to confront the adopted parents. Uncle learns then that the grandmother is living in the adopted parents' guest house and is working the little girl all day trying to turn her into a math wiz. The whole situation is preposterous. I guess the adopted parents were cool with being used to defraud the court (a felony) and let a crazy woman live on their property and basically abuse a little girl in the name of science? The girl's beloved cat was given away simply because grandma went from being a reasonable character earlier in the movie to a crazy vindictive one with no warning and no setup. On top of this mess, the resolution is that the math problem has already been solved by the girl's mom and uncle has been sitting on the answer this whole time. Uncle reveals this and grandma then gives the girl back to the uncle and the movie is over. Why didn't uncle bring this up earlier? Why would grandma fight so hard to get custody and then just give up after one problem is solved? If she is so obsessed with using the girl's brain to solve important math problems, aren't there more problems to be solved? In fact we are told earlier in the movie that there are 7 great unsolved math mysteries and only 1 (now 2 apparently) have ever been solved. The plot makes no sense, the conflicts make no sense, the characters are inconsistent, and the resolution to the conflict makes no sense. Terrible movie with contrived and often cruel emotional knife twists that make no sense. Almost nothing that happens in this movie is realistic. Basically every few minutes I was shaking my head going no that isn't how that works at all or why is this happening this doesn't makes sense, wasn't set up by the plot, is inconsistent with this character, etc. I can't believe how many good reviews its gotten.

In fact, all the adult women characters were one dimensional - saints or demons. There was a lovely, funny scene when it appeared grandmother and son were going to have a rapprochement - then she reverted to her previous behavior making that scene almost feel like a continuity error. There was a great scene in a waiting room - no spoiler, you'll have to see it.

This magic translates beyond the script, beyond the set, beyond the costumes and carries the story beyond the screen - in this case straight to my heart.A simple yet complex story that carefully considers gifted children and what this means for them. Tom Flynn has delivered this perspective with insight, sensitivity and joy in equal parts. McKenna Grace was a perfect choice for Mary.I fell in love with Mary in the opening sequence - you know those first five minutes when you know you're in a for a real treat, or the creeping realisation that whatever it is you're watching is a cast off from the Hallmark Slush pile. Gifted, in my highly unqualified opinion is most certainly the former.It has it all: Humour, bullying, narcissism, class division, family law, the traditional concept of money equaling power, educational institutions stoked by the coals of smouldering egos and the most important point - gifted children are not freaks. While their gift may seem freakish - we need to be careful to nurture them as children, and to regard them as children with a gift, and not primarily as gifted.Can highly recommend.",Gifted

Chris Evans does a commendable job but mostly stays in his typical hunky, free spirit, type cast.Too much of the movie revolved around a ridiculously executed custody battle. The compromised agreement reached between the plaintiff and defendent was unbelievable. Family courts always seek to preserve families. I cannot imagine any scenario where a judge would place a child in foster care over an uncle and grandmother who seemingly are both capable, safe choices. The foster storyline was implausible and forced a traumatic, ridiculously sad play on viewers tears.Young Mary's giftedness gets stretched from child prodigy to pure fantasy.There are some touching parts to this story however they largely get destroyed by glaring absurdities.",Gifted

What I'd really like to know is how did Hollywood figure out how to take an very talented adult actress and make her look like a seven year old?
Mckenna Graces performance is well beyond her years. I expect we'll see many great performances from her in the years to come.
Chris Evans has come a long way from Johnny Storm and I look forward to seeing him in more dramatic roles.
Octavia Spencer was great in Hidden Figures but in this different type of role, I think she did just as good of job with the amount of screen time she had.

While watching the movie your heart will sink to the bottom of the ocean at one point, and you would want to give 1 rating to this movie for taking you to a place where no father would ever want to go.

225,naba_movies,"It is a nice Emotional movie, worth watching one time",7,13 April 2019,"It's a movie about an uncle named Frank raising his 7 years old adorable nice Mary who has an extraordinary talent in solving mathematical problems. Frank is raising Mary since she was six months old when her mother Diane (another extraordinary brain in mathematics) committed suicide. Frank is drawn into a custody battle with his mother Evelyn over Mary. It seems Evelyn is obsessed with a problem named Navier-Stokes problem one of the unsolved Millennium Prize Problem. Since her daughter Diane who was dedicated to solve Navier-Stokes problem died before solving it, she wants her granddaughter Mary to solve it. On the other hand based on his experience with similar things about his sister, Frank wants Mary to live a normal childhood and not get involved only into mathematics like Diane. It's a nice emotional movie with a great performance especially from Mckenna Grace (plays Mary). But there are few things which seems unreasonable to me such as why Frank leave his teaching job? Why did Diane put a condition that her solution to the Navier-Stokes problem should not be published until her mother's death? However, these small mistakes are smartly taken care of by some good acting and emotional moments. It's a light hearted movie and worth watching for one time.",Gifted

Octavia Spencer's amusing attitude added a soft yet fun side to the movie deviating from the serious and intriguing character of Lindsay Duncan. Mckenna Grace is a rising star and she has the ability to be an amazing actor in the future.

McKenna Grace completely steals the show. Chris Evans is perfect in the role as a troubled Uncle and Octavia Spencer is a concerned neighbor along with an amazing performance by Lindsay Duncan as the practical grandmother.

Seems that the conflict which school is better is more important than the conflict between mother and son on child custody, which in this movie looks kind a bizarre to my opinion. I say bizarre as this movie displays it possible to fight on a child custody in a court and be loving family after. Probably, I'm naïve as I do not live in USA.",Gifted

248,mirandaspahn,not only gifted,9,31 October 2019,"This movie was directed by Marc Webb; the plot of the movie was written by Tom Flynn. The male main character is played by Chris Evans, who is famous for his role as Captain America. The film is set in St. Pertersburg, Florida, but it was mainly filmed in Georgia. The genre of the film is drama.
Gifted is about a seven-year-old girl, Mary, who lives with her uncle, Frank, in Florida. But Mary isn't just a normal girl, she has a extremly big mathematical talent and when she went to school for the first time, her teacher notices this. She wants to convince the uncle to send Mary to a private school, where her talent could be supported. Meanwhile the grandmother had been searching for Mary the last 7 years, yet the girl and her uncle have been found. Now Frank is under pressure, from the theacher and the grandmother, for sending her to a private school. The idea had been turned down by Frank, because he wants Mary to have a normal childhood. The grandmother tries to become the job of the guardian of Mary: Frank is definitly not okay about that. So Mary slides in the middle of a huge litigation.
I strongly recommend the film because, it's an extremly emotional movie, with many different aspects in it. It stars are perfectly chosen for their role in the movie. Actually i don't think that there's one scene, which i like the most, but those scenes in which you can see what a complicate but deep love is between Frank and Mary are all just wonderful.",Gifted

They had gold with this film! Perfect cast, script, chemistry. I even loved the cinematography when the sun is setting and Mary is climbing up Frank's torso. And then out of left field, the writers decided that when two family members are litigating for custody, the real life solution is to give a child to STRANGERS! Yes, you read that right.

This girl deserves to, at the very least, be in the conversation for awards. It's a head-scratcher.See this movie. It's the kind they don't make anymore.

261,ru66-679-398758,Go see this movie!,10,26 April 2017,"I had been anxiously awaiting this movie since summer of 2015. I was predisposed to like it because two of my favorite actors (Chris Evans and Octavia Spencer) were cast in it - movie gold, automatic win for me. Though truthfully, I had a slight hesitation about how certain aspects would be portrayed - Florida, small, coastal town, home school, small school, blue collar worker, simple living, flawed characters, not an easy but ""normal"" life. All things I identified with, yet sadly are often depicted in a negative light or as exceedingly cheesy. Yesterday I finally saw Gifted with my niece. It far surpassed every hope I had held, so much so that when it was over we walked to the lobby, bought two more tickets for the next showing and immediately walked right back in, same seats, and watched it again. Again laughing, again crying, again feeling hopeful with hearts overflowing. Honestly I could have sat and watched it all day. It was THAT good. Chris Evans was outstanding. Just when I think I can't possibly like him more, he hits a home run. He brought a natural, warm, smart, charming quality to his character, Frank, and as the movie progressed let the audience see vulnerability and depth of character. A+ He truly made us feel this guy was real, which we all want. More of that please. Mckenna Grace was a delight. Loved watching this little girl beautifully play this role and capture our hearts all at the same time. I hope to see her in more movies. Within 10 seconds, Octavia Spencer makes me wish she was my neighbor/friend. Strong, sassy, kind, funny, loving. She was perfect. Great job casting these three, can not imagine anyone else in these roles. They nailed it. Fred the cat was a lovely, touching addition. Marc Webb, bravo sir, bravo. Thank you for directing such a heartwarming, beautiful, quality movie. Outstanding story, perfectly executed, gorgeous cinematography and brilliant acting.

279,mingnanwang,3 moved points about Gifted,8,3 August 2017,"After I watched the movie Gifted, I was so moved about the scenario through the whole situation. There are 3 reasons that lead me so moved.The first part is about the uncle's whole dedication. We can see from it, Uncle Frank is an incredible person. He may seem kind of not that rich person, though. He can't offer her niece a good condition as Mary's grandma. Anyhow, the most precious thing that Frank offer to Mary is happiness and freedom. We all know that for a little 7 year old girl, freedom and happiness is so crucial to her. Thank God, finally Mary is living with her Uncle Frank and a fun neighbor as well. She is lucky, of course. Studying in a college and can also play with the kids at her age, just like other normal kids do. What's more, she has no need to take her mother's way. We can not guarantee that whether it's good for her future or not. But at least, Mary is happy with her situation right now, just as 7 years old child. It's enough for her to choose what she like or dislike. If adults push her do so-called they thought it's good for her. It is not only part of damage her life, but also solidifying her thoughts. Nowadays, it seems kind of moral kidnapping or stereotype. All kids have they are thoughts. From my perspective, give them enough freedom and respect and then give them some suggestions. Next, let them to choose, even though the choice is unsatisfactory, perhaps. Nonetheless, it is their choices. If they succeed, we should give encouragement. If things don't happen to what he thinks, we should also give encouragement to him. After all, he took the first step------try. He will also learn responsibility and experiences from it. Many helicopter parents want to remove all danger from their children's growth path. Actually, it is impossible. Children needs time and chances to try things. If you don't give them enough freedom and even don't give them chances to try. How can he be independent? How could he face all the difficulties by himself? Thus I am very appreciated with the uncle's action, to give not a very rich education, but actually it's a rich one.Secondly, I was moved by the teacher and neighbor. A close neighbor is better than a brother far off. For 7 years, the neighbor R regarded Mary as her own child. She didn't ask for payments. On Saturdays, always allow Mary to be her home and watch videos. Let us think about that, we can do it a day or a month. Doing this kind of things for whole 7 years is so amazing. Singing in the drawing room and dancing as well. Thanks for R to do this things to protect the little Mary's childlike innocence. About the teacher Bonnie, is also a great guy. Once she found out Mary is a gifted child, she didn't express any dissatisfaction with Mary's irreverence, but she took great care of her learning ability. She gave her harder texts, ""unfortunately"", Mary successfully figured that out. She is a good teacher and knows how to teach Mary in her way.Thirdly, it is about Mary. Facing all this things happened. She still likes a ray of sunshine with happiness and believes in her uncle Frank and herself. As a genius, I don't know how she thought about herself. I am surely not a genius. But to some extent, I admire her. For even grandma and foster family can offer her better living and educational condition. But she refused. For even uncle had to give up her custody once. She still forgives Frank. By the way, it is too touched scenario. For her takes good care of one eye cat------Fred. Oh, Frank as well. Don't forget that she can uphold justice for friends. brave girl.Last thing I want to mention is that if Mary's grandma can serve her daughter D and Mary both a normal child. Do not push them so hard. Things may be different. It is more about way she actions. She is also a good guy, though. That is all my view upon the movie Gifted.",Gifted
280,bana-13748,Super great movie,10,3 August 2017,This movie tugs at the heart string. The actors really got the emotions across. I don't know what i would do in franks position. Its rough. For me it shows how painful love can be and just how fragile kids are. I wouldn't ask for this situation for anyone..... .... ...,Gifted
281,dscott-33808,Beautiful,9,6 August 2017,"Subject line says it all. I am no critic and do not presume to be a Leonard Maltin, but I am a movie lover. As far as movies go in this genre, this one is beautiful. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and yes, it may even make you take a look at your own life and the decisions you have made. Worth a watch, you will not be disappointed. Seems Chris Evans doesn't have to wear tights to save the world.",Gifted
282,nickelsonline,Custody battles are wrenching!,8,24 January 2018,"Here, a special upbringing by Uncle Frank of Niece Mary gets fouled up when educators, grandmothers, lawyers, judges, foster parents and the powers that be try to do ""what's in the best interest of a child."" Frank knew the mother, his brilliant sister, was totally certain about her wishes before she died. The wealthy Boston, powerful British-born grandmother, uninterested in the child until Mary starts a public first grade, and is then found ""gifted.""",Gifted
283,kasakscathen,WATCH. IT.,9,3 February 2018,"When my mom first asked me to check out this movie i was reluctant, mostly cause i had never heard of it and wasn't willing to risk wasting the few good hours of movie time that i get every weekend. 
But trust me, this one's worth it. Now the movie is basically about an uncle and a grandmother fighting over the custody of a prodigy. And it pulls you into the the moral conflict and makes you choose your side. Aside from the gripping but cozy plot and the amazing acting, there are these little scenes in it that literally make you tear. i would definitely recommend you to watch, and re-watch it, and re-watch it again.It is extremely sad that non-commercial movies like this one get so little recognition, even though they deserve it more than crappy films filled with painful graphics and dialogues and plots that make you wish you just stuck to finishing your homework",Gifted
284,thescipioni,One of few American films that can be compared with European films,9,18 March 2018,"Yes, i am European, but the title refers only to a miserable american film industry focused to amuse. 
Gifted is a film that pictures an issue of quality of raising children, with a philosophical thought on balance of allowing a child to perceive the world on it self and adult lore of it. (Comparable with Captain Fantastic and Raising Hope. not in quality, but in thought)
The acting is far from good. It's superb. A true academy award class, especialy Mckenna Grace. Joined with Chris Evans and Octavia Spencer, they made quite an emotional roller coaster.
The only thing that is lacking is a touch of artistic frames. Although cinematography in overall is good.
Gifted, a film to look upon.",Gifted

286,tiapayne-38939,Great but is Matilda,9,20 October 2018,So the film takes a scene from Matilda and literally copies it. It's a really great film though. Has different conext and subtext to Matilda yet is so similar to Matilda at times I'm honestly suprised it's not been copyrighted.,Gifted
