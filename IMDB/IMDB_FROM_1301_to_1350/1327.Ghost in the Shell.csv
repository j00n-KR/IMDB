0,Leofwine_draca,Visually impressive,6,13 August 2017,"GHOST IN THE SHELL is the new Hollywood adaptation of the famous Japanese phenomenon that originated as a manga and was later made into a hugely successful anime. This live action tale brings in Western stars and simplifies things somewhat. The main problem I had with it is that the story is too familiar and guessable from the outset. Perhaps the types of Hollywood films that have used this storyline in the past stole it in turn from the original anime.Scarlet Johansson carries on her new-found tradition of playing violent femme fatales with an otherworldly feel (see UNDER THE SKIN and LUCY for more of the same). She's a human mind in a robotic body, on the hunt for a sinister killer played to the hilt by BOARDWALK EMPIRE's Michael Pitt. Helping her are the ever-great ""Beat"" Takeshi and Pilou Asbaek, of GAME OF THRONES fame and also very fine. What follows is an action-dominated mystery that gets by on the visuals alone. The CGI effects are very good and the depiction of a futuristic society looks great, reminiscent of BLADE RUNNER but more hi-tech. The action is fun, the fights choreographed by Richard Norton no less, and things build to a predictable but visually impressive climax.",Ghost in the Shell
1,SnoopyStyle,cool looking world,6,19 September 2017,"In the near future, people seeks enhancements by cybernetics. Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson) wakes up to be told by Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) that she had survived a terrorist attack. Her mind or ghost has been transferred into a robotic body shell. Hanka CEO Cutter convinces her to join a counter-terrorism team. A year later, she's Major in Section 9 working with Batou and Togusa. They are pursuing a villain called Kuze (Michael Carmen Pitt) who reveals a shocking truth about their existence.This is a cool looking world. The visuals are awesome but the plot is weak in comparison. It starts with the great spider geisha and the HK inspired cityscape. Johnansson is doing her robot acting. While it may be fitting, it keeps her from fully engaging with charisma overwhelmed by the tech magic on the screen. The meandering story is a simplistic Bladerunner. The forgettable plot leaves me cold. It probably should have started with the memory of her barely surviving the terrorist attack. It would have opened the movie with a great action sequence and also concentrated on the concept of memories by zeroing in on that event. Some slow motion is cool, but too much slow motion drags the pacing down. There is no intensity in this movie. It is missing its soul or quite frankly the ghost.",Ghost in the Shell
2,Prismark10,Dance to the beat,6,4 February 2018,"Based on a Japanese Manga animation. Scarlett Johansson plays Major, cybernaut with a human brain implanted. She is the first of her kind, the future of the human species. She is used as a soldier to take on terrorists and cyber criminals.However when leading scientists from Hanka Robotics start to get killed, Major learns more about her past and questions the motives of the people who created her.This is a heavy CGI action film, the visuals are a treat but the city landscape has been heavily inspired by Blade Runner. Johansson is rather by the numbers. So soon after being in Lucy, I think she was miscast here. There must be other young female action thespians.Despite the underwhelming and derivative plot which reminds you of films like Minority Report, it is a mildly entertaining film.",Ghost in the Shell
3,claudio_carvalho,Visually Engaging Adventure,7,9 July 2017,"In the future, human organs are enhanced by the cybernetics technology developed by the powerful Hanka Robotics Corporation owned by Cutter (Peter Ferdinando). Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) is the responsible for the development of the secret project 2571 of a full mechanical body to be connected to a human brain. She uses the brain of a young woman (Scarlett Johansson) that lost her parents in a cyber attack as subject of a prototype. One year later, the woman is ranked Major and has joined the Section 9, an anti-terrorist division commanded by Chief Saisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano), working with agents Batou (Pilou Asbæk) and Togusa (Chin Han). She needs to use a medicine to help the integration of her brain with the mechanical body and has no recollections of her previous life. When Section 9 hunts down the terrorist Kuze (Michael Carmen Pitt), Major learns secrets about Hanka and the experiment she was subjected. What will happen next?""Ghost in the Shell"" is a visually engaging adventure based on the Japanese manga and animation. The vision of future in the big city is scary, visually polluted with excessive billboards and humans blended with human enhanced. Unfortunately the characters are not well developed and the Japanese Major is now Caucasian. Scarlett Johansson has great performance as usual and despite the above flaws, the film is entertaining. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Vigilante do Amanhã: Ghost in the Shell"" (""The Tomorrow's Vigilant: Ghost in the Shell"")",Ghost in the Shell
4,nogodnomasters,I wasn't built to dance,7,6 July 2017,"The film takes place about 150 years in the future in a fictional Japanese city. Hanka Robotics has placed a human brain in a robot, hence the title. ""Ghost"" refers to soul and was taken from ""Ghosts in the Machine."" Major (Scarlett Johansson) is built to be the ultimate weapon, but her job is to monitor cyber crime and protect the corporation. The antagonist takes the form of Kuze (Michael Pitt) who is attacking Hanka Robotics. Batou (Pilou Asbæk) works with her.I am not familiar with this series, but I was able to figure out who Kuze was when he first appeared and the medicine Major was taking. This is a standard film formula. Apparently Milla Jovovich was busy so they employed Scarlett Johansson who can't act and they filmed her stunts with her face obscured from camera. All that money and you would think she would get her nose fixed for those close ups. The background was CG as was much of Scarlett's body aka Angelina as Grendel's Mother. Was that a DeLorean they were driving? Did they get that from Marty McFly? I liked the special effects and the basic premise of the story, however the plot was stale. The dialogue was anything but hip and did I mention Johansson can't act? Guide: No F-words. No sex. Barbie Doll nudity.",Ghost in the Shell
5,kosmasp,Review in a Shell,7,5 August 2017,"Which apart from being a pun (I know, forgive me, but also hear me out), is meant to be taken literally too. It has been a while since I saw the anime, so while certain things were just in the back of my head, I couldn't talk about details. There was a bit of big thing about a white woman playing the main role here, but that is explained pretty neatly in the movie.Not to mention the backstory which comes later. But you also have Takeshi Kitano who talks in Japanese. Yes there will be subtitles (though in the cinema version there was no blood - not even at that one sequence we saw it in the trailer). The story and the pace are neat, it's all there to entertain you. It's not like a masterpiece, but it does what it is supposed to. Also some anime traits (like the walk) are here (which may look funny to some, but does mean they did care about some of the iconic things). Just enjoy it for what it is and try not to compare it",Ghost in the Shell
6,classicsoncall,"""When we see our uniqueness as a virtue, only then do we find peace.""",7,12 August 2019,"I had to chuckle at the name Hanka Robotics in the story. My Polish grandmother used to call her sister 'Hanka' as a term of endearment, so that kept intruding on my focus of the story. I haven't read the manga comic or seen the original anime picture, so this was my introduction to ""Ghost in the Shell"". The premise is pretty simple if not wildly futuristic, a human brain is transplanted into a synthetic body, and in the case of Hanka Robotics, that body is intended to be weaponized for a coming war. If life imitates art to any degree, there are probably any number of government scientists working on just such a concept. A stunning idea was explored here when Major Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson) performed that deep dive into the cerebral nether regions to learn the source of her nemesis Kuze (Michael Pitt). When her own personal memories are restored, she learns that both she and Kuze were originally runaways kidnapped by a mercenary named Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) in service to the government's experiments. A lot I'd say, like those body snatchers of British lore who dug up graves to sell corpses to university medical schools. My favorite character here was the Japanese program director Aramaki ('Beat' Takeshi Kitano), who at one point looked like dead meat, but wryly outwitted the thugs hunting him down. His watchword - ""Don't send a rabbit to kill a fox"". I liked that.",Ghost in the Shell
7,jboothmillard,Ghost in the Shell,6,8 April 2017,"The trailer for this sci-fi movie looked fantastic, I was especially excited by the leading actress in her costume, I watched the original 1995 Japanese anime version first, based on the popular manga comics, so I hoped this live action remake would be as good, directed by Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman). Basically in the future, the vast majority of humans are augmented with cybernetics, enhancing various traits like vision, strength, and intelligence, a mechanical body, or the ""shell"", can integrate a human brain, or a ""ghost"", rather than an AI, Hanka Robotics is the world's leading developer of augmentative technology. Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson), the sole survivor of the cyberterrorist attack that killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is apparently damaged beyond repair, her designer Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) objects, but Hanka CEO Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative. A year later, Mira has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou (Pilou Asbæk) and Togusa (Chin Han) under Chief Daisuke Aramaki ('Beat' Takeshi Kitano). The team successfully thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, Killian has been experiencing hallucinations, but Ouelet dismisses these as glitches, Killian is becoming increasingly bothered by her lack of memory of her past. During the mission, Killian destroyed a rogue mechanical red robed geisha (Rila Fukushima), it is discovered it was hacked by an unknown entity, known only as Kuze (Funny Games' Michael Pitt), Killian breaks protocol and ""dives"" into its AI for answers, the entity tries to counter-hack, but Batou disconnects her in time. Killian uses the information she was able to gather, the hacker is traced to a Yakuza nightclub, but Killian and Batou are lured into a trap, an explosion destroys Batou's eyes, and Killian's body is severely damaged, Cutter is enraged and threatens to shut down Section 9 unless Aramaki keeps Killian in line. Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin (Anamaria Marinca), is killed by Kuze, linking her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers, the team realise the next target is Dr. Ouelet, two sanitation workers are hacked and controlled by Kuze in an attempt to kill Ouelet. Batou, now with cybernetic eyes, kills of of them, the other is subdued by a repaired Killian, Kuze briefly talks through the surviving worker during interrogation, before committing suicide, Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, there the team discover a large number of humans mentally linked together as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured, and Kuze reveals he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian, he urges to question her memories, before freeing and her and escaping, confronting Ouelet, she admits to Killian that she is the 98th test subject, the only survivor of the process, and her memories are fake implants. Cutter decides Killian is too much of liability and orders Ouelet to euthanize her, but Ouelet gives her an address and helps her escape, Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killians, saying she has gone rogue, he also informs Aramaki and the team that she must be terminated. Following the address, Killians finds an apartment occupied by widow (Kaori Momoi), who talks about her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, running away, being arrested, and taking her own life while in custody. Unable to process her emotions, Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who intentionally allows Cutter to listen, Cutter's men attempt to kill Batou, Togusa and Aramaki, but they survive, while Killian follows her memories to the last place Motoko was seen, there she meets with Kuze, they recall their past lives and their use as test subjects. A ""spider-tank"" is deployed by Cutter to kill them, Kuze nearly dies, Killian tears off the tank's motor, losing her left arm in the process, mortally wounded Kuze offers to merge his ""ghost"" with Killian's before he is killed by snipers, Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Killian allows Aramaki to execute Cutter. In the end, the next day, Killian is now repaired, and embraces her true identity as Motoko, reconnecting her mother, before returning to work with Section 9. Also starring Danusia Samal as Ladriya and Michael Wincott as Dr. Osmund. There was controversy over the casting of Johansson, this ""whitewashing"" apparently lead to the lack of success at box office, I personally think it is a good choice, she is beautiful, she looks great with the short, dark hair, and plays a great action heroine, she is especially gorgeous in the ""naked"" thermoptic suit, Binoche is good as the scientist who gave her life, and Asbæk, Kitano and Ferdinando also do well in their supporting roles. I was amazed by the special effects, the Japanese cityscape evokes that of Blade Runner, it is spectacular with its use of colour, and the technology effects to bring the many robots and mechanical limbs to life is brilliant, it really gets your adrenaline going with the fast-paced action sequences, I admit it does not have the same charm as the original cartoon, it is perhaps more style over substance, but it is a watchable science-fiction thriller. Good!",Ghost in the Shell
8,Tweekums,An impressive retelling of an anime classic,9,21 August 2018,"Set in a not too distant future, where most people are augmented with technology, Hanka Robotics the leader in the field of augmentation, has made a breakthrough. They have developed technology to but a human mind in an entirely synthetic body. The first successful test is a woman; she has lost her previous memories and is told she is Mira Killian, survivor of a terrorist attack that killed her parents. A year later she is 'The Major', working for anti-cyberterrorist group; Department Nine. Here she and her colleagues are tracking a terrorist known as Kuze who appears to be targeting Hanka but as she does so she learns more about her past and it doesn't match what she had been told... she becomes determined to discover who she really was and what happened to her; something certain people don't want exposed.I was a little unsure about this film before watching as I really enjoyed the original anime film and 'Stand Alone Complex'; I needn't have worried. This adaption kept the feel of the original without being a mere remake... that said some iconic scenes from the original are recreated. Scarlett Johansson does a really fine job as The Major; given the fact that her character is a cyborg it doesn't matter that she isn't Japanese. She is ably supported by Danish actor Pilou Asbæk, as her partner Batou, and Takeshi Kitano as her boss, Chief Aramaki, among others. The story kept me gripped with a combination of thrilling action and solid character development. The special effects are really impressive even on a relatively small TV screen; I'm sure the cityscapes would look absolutely amazing in high definition on a big screen. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to science fiction fans, especially if you enjoyed the anime... it is clear that not everybody likes this adaption but you won't know till you try.",Ghost in the Shell
9,paul_haakonsen,But the ghost didn't rattle much...,5,4 May 2017,"I am only vaguely familiar with the Manga upon which this 2017 live action adaptation is based, so I will not be comparing it to those.Major is the first of her kind, a truly unique individual consisting of a synthetic body outfitted with a live human brain. This combines the enhanced functionality of cyborg with the ability of free thought and will. She is to become a perfect soldier in the war on cyber-criminals.Right, well the story was adequate enough, although it was a bit too mundane and simplistic, almost to the point where it bordered on being too generic. The events that took place throughout the course of the story offered no surprises, as it was quite predictable. And given the premise of the movie, then you already knew the outcome of the movie from the very beginning.As for the acting, well I will say that they had some good enough talents to portray the characters and roles, and it was essentially Pilou Asbæk who carried the movie. Personally, I don't understand why they opted for Scarlett Johansson for the lead, because she is not a particularly versatile actress in my opinion. And in ""Ghost in the Shell"" she put on a very bland and emotionless performance. It was a real shame that Michael Wincott didn't have a bigger role in this movie, because he could definitely have added a lot to the movie.What made this movie watchable was the impressive display of special effects and CGI. It was just overwhelming, especially because there was so much of it in almost every single scene. So if all those holographic images in the cityscape becomes a reality, it will indeed be a colorful future that we greet.I wasn't particularly impressed with ""Ghost in the Shell"", and the myriad of special effects were hardly enough to make due for a lack of interesting storyline. As such, this was but a mere mediocre movie experience for me. I doubt that it is a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.",Ghost in the Shell
10,michaelRokeefe,What does it mean to be human?,8,10 January 2018,"A fantastic Scarlet Johansson vehicle that stands out in a crowd of movies in this genre. Why tend to be so complicated, when keeping a story line simple enough to appreciate. The atmosphere is busy and hectic at times, but you can't totally blame CGI. Visually striking. The sci-fi thriller focuses on a cyborg policewoman, Major (Johansson), who heads an elite task force with the mission to crackdown on cybercriminals and devious hackers. One such villain has the goal to destroy the very technology that makes Major's existence possible. Don't try to overthink this one; just enjoy. Johansson makes it a done deal!The cast also features: Pilou Asbaek, Juliette Binoche, Michael Pitt, Takeshi Kitano, Lasarus Ratuere, Peter Ferdinando and Danusia Samal.",Ghost in the Shell
11,Theo Robertson,You Know It Already,4,2 April 2017,"I came in to this movie not knowing much about it apart from what I'd seen in the trailers, which gave me the impression I'd be watching a sort of cross between BLADE RUNNER and THE MATRIX . Again I'm in danger of sounding like a very predictable stuck record but I have noticed how uncannily accurate trailers have been over the last couple of years but the downside is that the films they're plugging almost always give an uninspiring feeling to this audience member Looking on this site GHOST IN THE SHELL is based on a Japanese manga series but BLADE RUNNER meets THE MATRIX is still an accurate summary. One wonders if Japanese imperial ambitions in the 1930s and 40s might have led the producers to make it an international friendly type of sci-fi action adventure and just about every nation on Earth is represented here somewhere. It does give the feel it has been entirely produced by committee where even a potential Chinese will enjoy it never having seen Ridley Scott's 1982 cult film There's two problems though . First is you realise you're watching something totally unoriginal and when GHOST IN THE SHELL reminds you of other films you're constantly reminded the originals were probably better. Secondly and this is a bigger problem in that despite all the stunts, firefights , CGI , noise and bluster you're quickly puzzled as to what is happening and why it is happening. The film can be summed up about two thirds of the way through the running time where the gun totting cyborg heroine meets a male character where he gives her a long winded explanation and finishes with the line ""You know it already"" which is a great example of very poor plot exposition. In short not only GHOST IN THE SHELL a mess but it's a ill thought out derivative mess",Ghost in the Shell

13,CinemaSerf,"Interesting concept, lacklustre execution.",6,12 October 2021,"I was quite interested in the premiss of this film, and we all know that Scarlett Johannson likes a kick-ass movie - but somewhere along the way (actually very near the start) it all starts to fall apart and after twenty minutes is a visually stunning piece of sci-fi that is totally devoid of meaningful characterisation, or a sensible plot. Her's is an human consciousness implanted in the artificial frame of a super soldier. Not a great big muscly thing, but a lithe and supple - agile - kind of warrior designed to think like an intelligent human being, but capable of much more physically. Guided by ""Dr. Ouelet"" (Juliette Binoche) our hero trains and becomes effective enough to join an elite anti-terrorism outfit where she is gradually exposed to parts of her previous life of which she had no knowledge. It's the usual corporate domination style of plot, with ""Kuze"" (a typically over the top Michael Pitt) being the baddie trying to hack into these artificial creations and to control them. The ending is weak, but then so is the whole thing really - stylishly put together but empty, soulless and after a while really quite dreary to look at and dull. Might have looked better on big screen, but on a small one does little more than kill 100 minutes.",Ghost in the Shell
14,grantss,Dull,4,1 October 2017,"Major Motoko Kusanagi is unique, a human brain implanted in a robot's body. This, the intelligence of a human combined with the physical qualities of a machine, has enabled her to be the ultimate crime fighter. Now she faces her ultimate enemy: Kuze, a criminal who has managed to hack into the brains of androids and control them.The original, animated Ghost in the Shell from 1995 was very good, with a decent plot, great action scenes and some interesting themes. (Not brilliant though, lest you think my views on the first movie are influencing my view of this one).This, the 2017 movie, is not even close to that movie. This doesn't come close to the coherence of plot and theme-development of the first movie. This leaves it basically a (largely CGI-driven) action movie with a very simple (yet somehow confusing) plot and not much in the way of profundity. It also makes it quite dull.",Ghost in the Shell
15,oscaralbert,My name is Major E.A. Pooh & I do NOT give my consent . . .,6,20 April 2017,". . . to have GHOST IN THE SHELL mentioned in the same sentence as BLADE RUNNER, or even EX MACHINA. This Man-as-a-Machine flick is so lame that its main improvement upon the original animated feature is to cast a Caucasian--Scarlett Johansson--to play Motormouth's New Shell, which adds a slight touch of Bathos--""Who ARE you?"" ""I don't know""--to Moto's reunion with her Mom. However, these maudlin moments are not enough to flesh out this formulaic Sci-Fi flick, which rings as hollow as the holograms which seem to pervade its every frame. Though Johansson's Maxim Magazine-style ""Nudity"" may provide nourishing eye candy to a few seven-year-old boys, GHOST's plot is as predictable as a ""Happy Meal."" If you're at all in touch with our 2017 Zeitgeist, you'll find your mind wandering off during GHOST to wonder if the USA's alleged President #45--Don Juan Trump--is actually a Hologram himself. THAT would explain a lot!",Ghost in the Shell
16,neil-476,"Empty, but great looking",7,14 May 2018,"It is the future. In an unnamed far East city, a young woman's brain is transplanted into an artificial body by Hanka, a company specialising in cybernetic enhancements. A year later, now dubbed Major, she is an operative for Section 9, a semi-official law enforcement body combating cyber-crime. But fragmented memories of her earlier life lead her to try to find out who she was and what happened to her.This American adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga is an interesting mixture of success and failure. It looks absolutely spectacular. It captures the manga-style look of a stylised Japanese-flavoured future incredibly well. The DVD/Blu-ray will reward re-watching in slow motion for the many tiny details, like the word ""Police"" on high-viz jackets cycling between red and blue. The film is packed with visual invention.The action sequences are also excellent. They blend fluent martial arts with smart camerawork, greenscreen, and physical sets, and do so seamlessly. I have one criticism: much as I like Scarlet Johansson's *rse, rear views of her running don't do her any favours.We know the story, unfortunately - it's the same story as Robocop. The origin is dealt with in an efficient prologue, and doesn't interfere with narrative flow. But although the trimmings are fresh, the story holds no real surprises.The performances are all fine, although I don't think the film will feature in next year's acting Oscars. Juliet Binoche plays an important, but underwritten, character and is completely wasted.But is ScarJo right? I don't think so. She has done enthusiastic PR for the film, but that's not enough. She's there to generate box office results, of course. It's seen as a role like Black Widow, and she will surely put bums on seats internationally. But I don't think this should have been colour blind casting. Although an artificial body can be any race, I think the film would have looked right with an Asian actress.Through much of the film, Miss Johansson wears a skintight bodysuit. Perhaps this is a CGI motion-capture suit. In either case, it makes her look strangely completely naked and not naked at all. At the same time.The part of the story which is intended to make you care is Major's search for her past. But, if I'm honest, the film didn't make me care very much. For a story which is about a soul - the Ghost - in an artificial body - the Shell - the film ironically has very little soul of its own.If you are a geek - let's face it, if you are reading this then you probably are - then of course you should see it. If nothing else, you will geek out over the visuals. If you like something a bit deeper - well, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did. And a review is only one person's opinion, so go and make up your own mind!",Ghost in the Shell
17,Uriah43,Some Really Good Computer Graphics,6,5 August 2017,"This movie takes place in the future where robotic and artificial intelligence have taken a huge leap forward and most people are technologically enhanced with cybernetic features. One particular woman by the name of ""Mira Killian"" (Scarlett Johansson) is an exception as her brain has been successfully transplanted into a robotic creation that gives her incredible physical abilities. To that end, the company which created her has chosen to use these abilities to create a super-soldier which they maintain is for the purpose of killing terrorists. However, during one particular mission, she learns that everything she has been told has been a lie--and rather than have that knowledge compromised the company unleashes all of their resources against her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had a lot of action and some really good computer graphics as well. Unfortunately, the action scenes moved much too quickly which created a little confusion at times on my part. Additionally, I thought that the characters could also have used a bit more development. Even so, despite the flaws just mentioned, I enjoyed this movie for the most part and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Ghost in the Shell
18,FlashCallahan,Maybe next time you can design me better....,2,2 April 2017,"How Ironic.....In a future in which humanity and technology have begun to merge, a cyber enhanced woman hunts a mysterious terrorist who can hack into his victims' minds and control their thoughts and memories. Her pursuit eventually leads her to discover the full truth about her traumatic past.....Having never seen the original anime, I had no right to comment on how the film compares to that, but my gosh, I saw some other science fiction films flash before my eyes whilst I had to endure this.The first twenty minutes of the film are quite remarkable, and I must admit, I was prepared to change my top 25 films of all time. The score is amazing, the visuals are stunning, and the initial set piece where Johannson tries to save Michael Wincott, is a sublime slice of cinema.And then it all goes downhill from there. Johansson has confirmed with this that she is better off as a supporting character, even though she is supposed to be more machine than human, she still has a Ghost in the Shell, so I was hoping for a Robocop type performance, slowly getting her emotions back, but all I got was Keanu in The Day The Earth Stood Still.And from the trailer, the film has obviously a lot of deleted scenes, for I never saw her kiss the woman she picks up, and i'm sure in the trailer, I saw urban music legend Tricky as some sort of monk.If the much used quote 'All Style Over Substance' was a BBFC classification, this would be one of the biggest offenders of all time.Michael Pitt as the...... I'm not spoiling anything, looks like the main antagonist from Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars, and you will be forgiven if when watching the film you think of Blade Runner, Jupiter Ascending, The Fifth Element, Johnny Mnemonic, Judge Dredd 95, and Brazil.I would say The Matrix, but we all know that this inspired the Wachowskis.Which is ironic because i'd rather sit and watch the Matrix Revolutions on loop for a week.A major disappointment.The studio must have been wary, it's quite astonishing how many production companies are shown before the film begins proper.",Ghost in the Shell
19,Aaron1375,I really enjoyed this anime inspired film,9,25 October 2017,"First off, I have never seen the anime, so I would say that is why I enjoyed this more than others, but I believe I would have enjoyed it even if I have seen the anime. I can differentiate between one format and another so I don't mind if this film is not an exact duplicate of the original. Also, I find the complaints about the casting ridiculous. Seems a lot of people forget that Major is a machine body so it does not really have to be Asian. To me, this movie was just really cool as I loved the visuals and style of the film. It reminded me of a cooler version of that Keanu Reeves film from the 90's, Johnny Mnemonic which I also really enjoyed and it pretty much bombed at the box office. I just like the whole future setting, but the future along with its cool colors and stuff kind of is depressing too scenario. I enjoy the anime Akira for this reason too, that would be cool to see a live action adaptation, but chances are it will not happen as it was floated around for a bit, but considering this one's lack of success and most anime adaptations failures I am pretty sure it will never be made unless the Japanese themselves take the initiative to do so.This one features a future where people are able to augment their bodies with robotic parts. However, a new technique has been devised that is all robotic body with the exception of a living brain. A female's brain is transferred into one such body and she becomes known as Major and uses her augmented body to help a special unit that fights cyber crimes and terrorism. The latest criminal they are trying to track down is a particularly devious one that is targeting scientist from the corporation that created Major. She along with the team try to track him down, but Major soon learns that there may be some secrets that the corporation that has given her the gift of a second life may be withholding from her about her past and how she came to be a ghost in a shell.As I have stated I really enjoyed the visuals in this film, but I also really thought the characters were cool too. Along with Major there is also a character named Batou who is really cool too. I have seen part of the second Ghost in the Shell film where he is the primary character and they did a really good job of making the actor who played him look like his anime counterpart. I also really liked the old man with the six shooter! Another reason I am sad this did poorly is because I would have really enjoyed another film featuring these characters.So, yes, I thought this movie was really good and it makes me want to watch the anime version of the film. It also makes me want to track down as many anime films as possible that have this kind of weird future setting as it just makes for a great looking film in live or animation form. The action was cool and the story was interesting too as I kept wondering what revelations would be made.",Ghost in the Shell
20,Mr-Fusion,Insert pun about being a shell of its former self,4,9 November 2017,"If anything springs to mind about the original ""Ghost in the Shell"" it's the vibrance. The movie had more color than it knew what to do with, and the dark was appropriately offset by the bright. No so with this live-action version, where everything is grayed out, drab and sterile. In this case, CGI (even higher-quality) is no replacement for '90s Japanese animation. It's just not a good-looking movie.Or involving for that matter. There's a stiffness to the whole thing (even the fight scenes) and Scarlett Johansson movies aren't usually this boring. Which is a good thing, but I can't see myself recommending this to anyone. It's awful.4/10",Ghost in the Shell

My fears were unfounded, though.This is a movie that simplifies the original story, discarding some of the philosophy for futuristic action. But if I were to criticize it for something it would be that it didn't pay as much attention to detail, rather than the overall theme. They spent a lot of time showing overviews of a cyberpunk city (you know, neon and holographic commercials everywhere) and less explaining the minutiae of the world.Other than that, it was a good sci-fi action movie. It touched on the important issues that made the original a classic like the nature of the soul. The worse parts of the film were the beginning and the end, where some executive felt the need for pointless walls of text and/or narration. The moral in the ending is doing a disservice to the rest of the film which was well done, well acted and faithful to the original material. While focusing a little too much on the Major and less on her team (sniper Saito gets like a one second scene)Now I am going to rewatch the original and see if it was ever as good as I remember it. And BTW, if I hear another idiot saying that this was whitewashing I am going to slap them. Not knowing the original material is bad enough.

22,Hellmant,Practically the ultimate example of style over substance!,8,5 April 2017,"'GHOST IN THE SHELL': Four Stars (Out of Five)A big budget American sci-fi action film, based on the popular Japanese manga, of the same name, by Masamune Shirow (which ran from 1991 to 1997). It stars Scarlett Johansson as a cyborg counter- terrorist commander, taking on hackers, cyber terrorists and other criminals (in a futuristic world). The movie also costars Pilou Asbaek (who also costarred with Johansson in the sci-fi action hit 'LUCY'), Michael Pitt, Takeshi Kitano, Juliette Binoche and Chin Han. It was directed by Rupert Sanders (who also helmed 2012's 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN'), and it was written by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and fans, and it's also underperformed at the Box Office so far. It's also been heavily criticized for it's casting of Johansson as well, in an originally Asian role. I absolutely loved the film's visuals, but I definitely can't say I found the story that interesting or involving.The Major (Johansson) is the cyborg head of a counter-cyber terrorist task force, known as Section 9. Her team catches and kills cyber criminals, and terrorists, in a future world that's becoming more and more machine. The Major is the ghost of a human, with a forgotten past, that functions in an almost entirely machine body. As she tries to defeat an unknown new threat, she also struggles to identify with who she really is.The film is absolutely stunning to watch, but I could not find myself interested, or involved, in any of the characters or story, in the slightest, until the third act (but even then it was just a very slight interest). It seems like such a waste too, because the action, music and overall style of the movie is absolutely breathtaking to experience. In many ways it reminds me of classic sci-fi from yesteryear, but only on a purely visual level. It's practically the ultimate example of style over substance, and I'm sure the casting of an Asian actress, in the lead, would have benefited the film immensely as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/216048414",Ghost in the Shell
23,cherold,Middling action picture,6,2 August 2017,"In Ghost in the Shell, a woman has her brain put into a synthetic body and becomes a super cop on the trail of a terrorist, all the while wondering, is she human or machine?That's the basics, as best I can recall, of the original anime as well, although where that one offered less explanation and more philosophizing. While the original's story was sometimes obscure and full of existentialist-lite musings from a philosophy 101 class, this remake offers slight but clear story and only the occasional moment of pondering.Having not been that thrilled with the original, I don't mind the changes. My main issue with the movie is that I never believe in its world.The first thing that bothered me were the advertisements. The city has giant Bladerunner-style ads, only these are holographic. They look pretty cool. They also look ugly and frightening, which means no advertising company would create such things. The movie goes for a sci-fi look without thinking about the underlying realities of the world.That may sound like a minor thing, but that sense of unreality suffuses the movie. No one is going to want service robots that look disturbing. It makes no sense that Major has a patchwork body but a face that is perfect in every detail. There's no reason that in a message from a terrorist his holographic face keeps shifting.Everything is done for effect. Nothing is done because it comes from a specific version of the future.Some of the action is pretty good, but less effective than had I cared about the main character. I was more intrigued by Takeshi Kitano's Aramaki than by Scarlet Johansson's rather bland heroine.This is very much an uninspired Hollywood action flick, with good special effects, a disposable story, and not a thought in its head even when it's trying to pretend to be thinking. For that, it's fine.",Ghost in the Shell

The overabundance of CGI makes the world seem intangible, especially when some obviously digitally enhanced characters come into play, and the original's examination of the human condition is all but stripped away, making for a generic experience that's predictable and dull. There are flashes of interesting elements, and some pieces of the soundtrack similar to those in the animated film are aural treats, but there's nothing really here to warrant this film over the first, or even over the many other mindless, money-grubbing Studio flicks clawing for your attention. 4/10",Ghost in the Shell

27,bowmanblue,I should like this more,6,28 March 2019,"I love science-fiction. I love cyber-punk. I love action. And I'm at least tolerant of excessive use of computer-generated effects in cinema in general. Oh, and I guess I might as well confess that my DVD collection contains many films containing women in skin-tight attire wiping out hordes of muscular henchmen (think 'Resident Evil' meets the 'Underworld' saga). Anyway, seeing as I like all those (plus I'm a fan of Marvel's Cinematic Universe which contains Scarlett Johansson doing all of the above) then you'd think that the film 'Ghost in the Shell' was absolutely made for me 100%.I've finished watching it at last (it was on an online streaming service, allowing me to watch the whole film in three segments - I guess that some people may say that the 'stop/start' approach to watching a film may ruin the enjoyment of it, however I beg to differ in this case). And, although I may be sounding a little cynical about the whole experience, I definitely didn't hate it. In fact, there's very little negative I can say about it. However, the problem is that there's very little positive about it, too.It's the very definition of 'average.' If you've seen one film where someone has superpowers and has to kill a load of people (combine it with memory loss for added cliches) then you've basically seen this one. Scarlett Johansson plays 'Major' - a cyborg assassin in the near future who hunts down and kills... blah, blah, blah. She then gets double-crossed... blah, blah, blag and you're left with her running around killing every human baddie and spider-tank that stands in her way.I guess I better write this review quickly as I'm already starting to forget what it was all about. I know it was based on an anime series/film (er, I think!), but I know for a fact that I've never seen the source material so I can't claim to know how two two mediums compare.There's plenty to say that's good about it - cool city-background (CGI, obviously), neat and original gadgets and tech (I think I mentioned the 'spider-tank!') and Scarlett Johansson is pretty damn easy on the eye (for us guys, anyway) and basically plays the MCU's 'Black Widow,' albeit in cyborg form (and looking more 'CGI' when she runs up walls!). If you're not familiar with the genre and generally haven't seen many similar movies then I'm guessing you'll absolutely love this film and I apologise for my (distinctly average) final score. However, I've seen so many of these sorts of films that they really need to pull off something really special in order for it to rise above all the others I've seen.I would imagine that, judging by the ending, the producers of this film really were hoping that this will be the start of some sort of major (no pun intended!) franchise. However, I just can't see that happening. Although, if it does get a sequel, I'll happily sit down and watch that, too. Again, I didn't hate this film - far from it - it just didn't really leave much of a lasting impression with me. Sorry, Scarlett.",Ghost in the Shell
28,dromasca,"men, machines and in-between",8,9 April 2017,"I did not see the original Japanese anime film with the same name which triggered the idea of Ghost in the Shell and this may be an advantage or a disadvantage. I have read some articles that compare the two works, and also refer to the comics series, as well as to 'Matrix' which took apparently many ideas from it. It seems to me that I can enjoy and appreciate director Rupert Sanders' film even better without that comparison, although I may be missing some of the nuances or different directions the original work was taking the theme to.What may have changed in the two decades since the Japanese original works were created is the fact that much of the technology that is described in the film became reality, and for the rest the feasibility is a confirmed fact. Artificial organs are now more and more replacing organs and tissues damaged by diseases or accidents. We know much more about how brain functions, how information circulates between brain and body, and how mechanical actions of the human body or artificial prosthesis are controlled. Brain transplant was not achieved, but it's considered feasible, as well as a future implant in a completely artificial body. As in the film, many of the humans are or will become hybrids with a higher and higher percentage of replaced parts.The film deals with a future in which the first brain implant is made in an artificial body. This makes of the lead heroine (Scarlett Johansson) kind of a super-hero, a living weapon to fight terrorists. It's just that her former identity (her 'ghost') comes to haunt her, and while she slowly recovers her human identity the reality around becomes less connected to the truth. What follows is a combination of action (or even super-heroes action) and smart science-fiction genres, which takes place in a world where men coexist with hybrids, or maybe better said almost any man also became a hybrid. It's a film which succeeds both to entertain as well as to ask difficult questions about the future evolution of mankind and it's relation with the thinking machines created by men.Some exceptional work was performed in order to create on screen the possible world of the future described in Ghost in the Shell. The visual concept makes reference to previous art like the one in Metropolis or Blade Runner, but develops those into new directions starting from the images and shapes that define today's Asian big cities. There are a lot of computerized effects but they all have logic and are backing the story line, and so do the action scenes. The film succeeds to satisfy both action fans as well as viewers who are looking for meaningful science-fiction. Scarlett Johansson is very good in the lead role, she continues her daring undertaking of roles in science-fiction movies, but each one of the roles is different and this should help her avoid automatic casting in a new stereotype which replaces the older beautiful-fragile girl one in the first years of her career. It's a pleasure to see huge actors as Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche also involved in this project.",Ghost in the Shell
29,ThomasDrufke,We've Seen it All Before,6,30 March 2017,"Surrounded by casting controversies and mediocre reviews, I wasn't expecting a lot going into Ghost in the Shell. I'm always down for original science fiction, and although this is a live-action remake of a beloved anime, it seemed original enough for my liking. While every frame is gorgeous, there isn't a ton under the surface with this adaptation.Putting casting controversies aside, Scarlett Johansson provides a compelling performance as 'The Major' amidst plenty of other talented actors and actresses. Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbæk are particularly good, rounding out the cast in this futuristic sci-fi. The acting is superb, the visuals are intricate, and the action is visceral, but you need more than that to win over an audience. The one thing this film is really missing is heart and humanity. There are small attempts to polish the characters with human qualities here and there, but nothing to make me truly care about the characters. Sadly, the only reason I was invested in Major was because it's Scar-jo being a bada** action hero. It's kind of like 'Lucy' in that way, though it's much more of a focused and controlled story than that.Much like 'Power Rangers' this past week, there's nothing overtly wrong with Ghost in the Shell, but there's not anything that will come across as overtly memorable either. It's one of those action- revenge films that you'll find on cable or Netflix down the road and you may watch bits and pieces, but you won't watch the entire film because you've seen it all before. The classic ""everything they told you was a lie"" is written all over the story, as is the trope of having the A.I. go rogue on her creators. You see it in every movie like this, so I can't say the film's originality is its greatest quality.With that said, I haven't seen the original anime, so perhaps this was just a faithful adaptation of a film that's been copied over and over throughout the years. I wanted to go in fresh with this one, and I came out pleased that I saw it, but far from impressed. Although colorful in its appearance, the dark brooding tone washes away the chance of re-watching it a few times. Having said all of this, I'm still game for sequels and more stories in this world. I find these types of movies fascinating and usually beautiful to look at, I just wish the characters were fleshed out with more humanity.

You knew who the bad guys were and what they were lying about. And I didn't really care for the look of the film. For example, the look of Major's robot body was just weird, like she's wearing nude spandex.
And the sci-fi aspect of this was just boring, half human half machine. That's not original. And of course you knew there had been many experiments. Basically, Major, half human and half machine is trying to figure out her origins and meets someone whom came before her who is killing the top scientists at

They don't exactly drop the title, but tell you what it's about. The best thing about this movie is probably how gorgeous it looks. I mean, these are some great special effects and we get beautiful visuals with everything looking so creative. We need futuristic stuff like this.The downsides are that it is in fact poorly paced. The length is good, but it's hard to get that good of a feel for the characters. They're not bad, it's just that I might have watched so many movies I'm putting them up to higher standards for more unique things. The action scenes are good.

37,tabuno,"A Dazzling, Coherent Shell of a Movie",9,11 January 2019,"5 April 2017. The live version of the animated 1995 Japanese Oshii movie offers up a much more coherent and visually stunning experience of the robotic human hybrid genre. Shirow Masasume the writer for the original anime gets to improve on his original script as well as incorporate various scenes from his first work where various set designs and scenes bear a striking resemblance with an enhanced, vibrant, and dazzling updated version. The urban landscapes have fleshed out a futuristic Blade Runner (1982) full of the ambiance. Scarlett Johansson stars in this stunning sci fi movie with a character that humanizes the animated version and somewhat softens her character somewhat from Lucy (2014) where she plays a human who accidentally ingests a chemical that enhances one's brain potential which also diminishes her experience of human emotions.Ghost in the Shell shares various human-computer jacked-in elements with its contemporary William Gibson's cyberpunk that resulted in Keanu Reeves in Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and the virtual reality of Virtuosity (1995). And there are plenty of strong mental cognitive images used in this movie that echo back to the classic Keanu Reeves The Matrix (1999) and Jennifer Lopez in The Cell (2000). What sets this movie apart from most of the other cyberpunk movies is its infusion of emotional and moral questions regarding human life and its intersection with the man-made, electronic existence that are only suggested in Phillip K. Dick's script for breakthrough of Total Recall (1990) and attempted later in Isaac Asimov's inspired I, Robot (2004) and Robocop (1987) that was influenced by Blade Runner.The few weaknesses if that's what they are is the Major (Johansson) striking resemblance to her character in Lucy and the ease in which she appears to be overcome in two scenes that don't mesh with her character as a perfect military weapon. Overall, this movie succeeds in its depiction of a possible future with its amazing vibrant and exciting visuals, and futurescape as well as offering a coherent and morally and humanly sensitive reflection what makes us important. A comparable but even more focused and intimate cyberpunk movie is Caradog Jame's The Machine (2013).",Ghost in the Shell
38,The-Sarkologist,Awesome - But Not the Original,9,1 April 2017,"There was a time, a while back, when I watched Manga, and half the reason I watched Manga was because I had a friend who lent me some Manga and said 'hey, this is Manga, it's cool, you should watch it'. Well, I watched it and I came to the conclusion that I didn't like it. Actually, I found it really, really boring. Sure, it was fantasy sci-fi, but there weren't all that many that actually caught my attention. Maybe it had something to do with it being animated, and a part of us seems to connect animated features with kids movies. Actually, it could simply be that the shows were just boring. That is with the exception of Ghost in the Shell.Well, that same friend has pretty much written off this movie, and in a way I'm not all that surprised – what Ghost in the Shell basically is is a remake of the original Manga film using live action and American actors – basically what they are doing is Americanising the franchise, and to be honest whenever Hollywood gets its hands on a foreign film and attempts to remake it they inevitability stuff it up. However, when one isn't familiar with the original film, or simply switched off the entire concept, then one may actually discover that they enjoy the remake – as was the case with this film.Not surprisingly Ghost in the Shell is set in the future at a time where humans and machines are slowly becoming one and the same. Pretty much everybody has implants, but the idea of Ghost in the Shell is that the robot basically has a human brain, so the robot basically has the best of both worlds – they are powerful in the sense that they are robots, but they also have the intellectual capacity of a human, which is something that the scientists have yet to create in a robot, that is beyond actually putting a brain into a robot shell. Actually, I will basically leave it at that since I really don't want to give too much away since there are quite a few twists and turns.Ghost in the Shell is basically a film about identity, or one discovering one's identity. It is also a film about reality, and truth. In a way it seems that by changing our memories we can change our identity, and in many ways this is true – our memories, and in turn our history, define who we are. So, what happens when somebody is able to reprogram our brain and implant different memories into us – does this turn us into a different person. Quite possibly. However, when the person implanting memories is a government (or corporate) entity then there is a degree of power that they have over us. In fact by controlling our memories, and by feeding our beliefs into us they in effect not only define us, but also control us.So, I guess this is also a question about reality. The problem with a digital world is that it creates a digital reality which can change at the whim of those around us. In a way the world of Ghost in the Shell seems have have lost any meaning or purpose – it is the world of the cyberpunk, a world of darkness and shadow where nature and beauty have been eliminated. Not quite, because we have the stray dogs, and the cats wandering around, however it seems as if this world has not only changed, but is in a way dying – it seems that in this world there is no longer any history, only the present, and no identity beyond that which the corporation, and the government, creates.",Ghost in the Shell
39,Reno-Rangan,Too late to come out to impress its fans!,5,14 December 2017,"It was not my most anticipated film of the year. Like usual for any film, I just wanted to see it and enjoy it. The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!The storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.Visual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.5/10",Ghost in the Shell

41,tomgillespie2002,"Works as a spectacle, but will never justify its existence to die-hard fans of the original",6,29 October 2017,"Hollywood remakes of beloved foreign-language movies are rarely a welcome idea, but Ghost in the Shell seemed particularly doomed from the get-go. Alongside the cries from fans claiming the industry has officially run out of ideas, and from those who hold the original close to their heart and fail to see any other purpose in a remake other than to allow the fat cats to count the green, the announcement of Caucasian Scarlett Johnansson's casting in a role originally voiced by an Asian actor generated all-too familiar claims of 'whitewashing'. Tempers were only inflamed when it was rumoured that Johnasson's appearance was to be digitally-tweaked to make her appear more Eastern-looking, an idea that was quickly abandoned. Predictably, Ghost in the Shell arrived in cinemas back in March to underwhelming box-office.As a result, I approached Rupert Sanders' 2017 re-do with a sense of trepidation and caution, knowing full well that it would lack the philosophical musings of the Masaume Shirow manga the story originated from, and the big questions raised by Mamoru Oshii's landmark anime adaptation. After all, this is a blockbuster wannabe starring one of the most in-demand actresses around, so of course the makers will feel the need to dumb everything down to suit a mainstream audience (even though Christopher Nolan has proved more than once that a film can be complex and intelligent and still rake in the cash). It is perhaps thanks to my low expectations that I found much to enjoy with Ghost in the Shell. Like the 'shells' depicted in the film, it's certainly hollow and jittery, but as a piece of entertainment, I was never bored, and the visuals offer plenty of colour and detail to distract from the straightforward plot.Taking inspiration from everything from Shirow's manga, Oshii's 1995 movie and its 2004 sequel, and the hugely popular spin-off series, certain scenes will certainly feel familiar while the story of a shady corporation turning human beings into weapons against their will feels like it could be lifted from most Blade Runner-inspired science- fiction movies of the past couple of decades. Major (Johansson) is the first cyborg to employ a fully mechanised body with the mind, or 'ghost', of a human. Her employer, Hanka CEO Cutter (Peter Ferdinando), decides to use her in the fight against cyber-terrorism, which has become a real problem since the majority of the population have now been cybernetically enhanced. She works at Section 9 with her gruff partner Batou (a bleach-blonde Pilou Asbaek) and boss Aramaki ('Beat' Takeshi Kitano), and they are forced into action when Hanka finds itself under attack from a mysterious hacker named Kuze (Michael Pitt).Oshii's 1995 incarnation tackled big themes such as humanity and identity, offering explosive moments of action to allow some relief from the head-scratching central plot. The result was one of the best animes of all time. Sanders' Ghost in the Shell has much smaller ambitions, and feels very much like a product of the post- Matrix world we now live in, even though the Wachowskis were mainly inspired by Oshii's film. It works only as spectacle, and this world of spider-legged geisha robots and giant animated advertisements really does catch the eye. The action, while hardly breaking down barriers, has a physicality behind it, and the punches and bullets land with a force that really pushes its 12A certificate to the very limits. As the lead, Johansson has proved time and time again that she is accomplished with the physical demands of such a role, and she gives Major a hunched, stompy awkwardness, despite the blandness of the character. It will never justify its existence to the die- hard fans of the original, but Ghost in the Shell 2017 offers enough visual panache and energy to engage those curious enough to check it out.",Ghost in the Shell
42,cruise01,Ghost in the Shell is an exciting science fiction film with neat visuals and concept.,7,2 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell being brought to life in a live action science fiction film based on a Japanese manga series does recreate the futuristic world were humans and cybernetics advancements are at play. The future setting seems grim, flashy, many people with cybernetics parts on them such as eyes, limbs, etc. Which enhances a person with stronger abilities, and strength. The future setting does remind me a bit of Blade Runner. The plot follows Major (Scarlett Johansson) a cybernetic mechanic body ""shell"" with a human brain. Major is tasked with working for a group Section 9, who is assigned in a anti terrorist mission when the Hanka conference is interrupted by mechanic geisha's. She has been following the trace to who is behind the attacks that leads her to Kuze (Michael Pitt). Kuze is very similar to Major, which he informs her about her past and memories. Which she questions about the accident, that led her to being part of the cybernetic experiment. The positive aspect about the film is the direction and style on the films setting. I really like the concept and plot about how people are using cybernetics technology to improve their body after an injury. And they are making superhuman strength soldiers. Think of it as an advance improved Robocop type of an idea. Also, plays with the idea as they transplant a human brain into a mechanic body. The action sequences were exciting, seeing Major fight against others. Using the invisible approach to fight a guy in a cool action scene. The visual effects were also pretty neat. It also had some weakness in laying out every detail when it has those wide camera shots of the future setting and displaying cars on the background. I also thought the film could have used more action to keep the pace flowing with the movie. Scarlett Johansson is a beautiful stunning actress, and she was able to play Major and give her that awesome performance. Also, delivering the curiosity emotions with her character. I also understand that the characters race in the manga series was different compared to the film. Without giving details away, there is an explanation that could turn fans argument around about the choice. The lighting and cinematography were pretty cool and well shot when capturing the settings and the action fight scenes. Major running down the hallway, shooting at the robotic geisha's was beautiful and exciting. The negative aspect about the film I felt like it didn't work was the villain. The villain was too cliché and undeveloped. Like they only had one purpose in the last half hour of the movie. Which makes the villains motivation kind of boring. I also thought the movie could have used more action. It had some awesome set pieces and beautiful visual effects. Overall, the action was too short in the film.",Ghost in the Shell
43,Floated2,Confusing and boring,1,7 July 2018,"Having not being familiar with the original source material, their were little to no expectations about the film. Overall Ghost in the Shell feels quite bland, generic and confusing at times. The visuals are nice to look at, due to its big budget but as a film, nothing caught of interest. The film seemed to drag on to a point where one was losing focus and was zoning out of the picture. Reminiscent of Ex-Machine, Ghost of the Shell isn't nearly as intriguing or engaging. This film feels very serious and wasn't fun at all, with little to no light hearted moments. One can see as to why this film flopped at the box office.",Ghost in the Shell
44,leonblackwood,Decent action but I expected better. 5/10,5,13 August 2017,"Ghost In The Shell (2017)Plot: Scarlett Johansson is terrific in the visually stunning 'Ghost in the Shell', an action-packed adventure set in a future world where people are enhanced with technology. Believing she was rescued from near death, Major (Johansson) becomes the first of her kind: a human mind inside an artificial body designed to fight the war against cyber crime. While investigating a dangerous criminal, Major makes a shocking discovery -the corporation that created her lied about her past life in order to control her. Unsure what to believe, Major will stop at nothing to unravel the mystery of her true identity and exact revenge against the corporation she was built to serve.Review: Although this movie looked pretty impressive, I wasn't that impressed with the storyline, and the characters. It jumps right in at the deep end, so you don't have time to get to know the characters, and Scarlett Johansson is playing the same type of character, as she did in Lucy. The scenery reminded of Blade Runner, and the action scenes were the same as Lucy, so it wasn't that original. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson plays Major, who has the body of a robot and the mind of a human. The company that transformed her into the superhuman, use her to fight against terrorist and crime, and while she is saving the city, she comes across some information about her makers, who lied to her about her past. She then joins forces with an abandoned robot, and a couple of her fellow soldiers, to fight against the company that made her but they are always 2 steps ahead. There are some other elements to the storyline but it's quite detailed and hard to explain. I personally got a bit bored after a while, because it seemed to go round in circles, and the predictable storyline became uninteresting after a while. I liked the chemistry between Major and Batou (Pilou Asbaek), and Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano), was super intense throughout but it wasn't enough to make this a classic, like the animated movie. If they are to make a sequel, they really need to give Major some screen charisma, because I think she was one of the main problems with this film. With that aside, it's still an action packed movie, with some decent futuristic scenes but I won't be rushing to see the sequel. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Rupert Sanders, 46, who brought you Snow White and the Huntsman in 2012. With only one big budget movie in his portfolio, I wouldn't have given him such a big project, especially as the original was such a huge hit but at least it made a profit at the box office. Scarlett Johansson was the perfect choice for the role but it's just too close to Lucy for me. I also think that this movie could have done with some other stars, so it didn't rely on Johansson so much. Anyway, it's not a film that I can watch time and time again but I have seen worse, when it comes to remakes.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $170millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas, starring Scarlett Johansson, Pilou Asbaek, Juliette Binoche, Michael Pitt, Chin Han and Takeshi Kitano. 5/10",Ghost in the Shell
45,Tweetienator,Not Whitewashed But A Many Brainwashed Criticism,7,21 October 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is not a masterpiece but at least a decent adaption of the manga/anime universe by Masamune Shirow. Scarlett Johansson plays the lead character Motoko Kusanagi/Major well, the cinematography and all the technicals are really good and an eye-candy, the movie is entertaining but in no way, something extraordinary like Matrix or Fight Club were at their times.To the matter of ""whitewashing"" - many of those critics just show their own cultural bias or should I say ""bubble"". A many figures of the Japanese manga/anime series look more like white people as Asian people. Just look at the eyes, the hair colors, the body posture (Asian woman mostly don't have that big boobs and they are more tender, smaller built than in mangas/animes shown - at least without a surgical ""improvement""). I remember many discussion in the 80s/90s why many Japanese artists used in many animes/mangas Western looking characters and not Asian looking ones (Captain Future and many others like Appleseed etc.) Everyone with eyes but not with tomatoes for eyes can see that fact if he reads a manga or watches an anime. Or take e.g. Link, the great hero of the Zelda franchise - omg, he is blond and white!In my opinion, Scarlett Johannson is a good choice for the Major - she just fits into those kinds of movies well (Lucy, Under the Skin, Black Widow). Ofc it is not p.c. to say so - how racist it is if a Japanese writer or comic artist draws white characters instead of Asian ones! Yeez, that's so narrow- minded, that I just gotta say, yes, Nazis are racists, but those left-""liberal""-brainwashed-zombie- walkers walk just the same road hand in hand with the rightwingers: if the production company would have cast a black actress for the Major this kind of people would call the casting ""progressive"" and rate the same movie 10+ Well, I will tell you one ""truth"": if you judge people by the color of their skin it is always racism, no matter what your intention in judging so is.So what's left to say!? Ghost in the Shell is a good movie for all lovers of sci-fi but it is no ""must-see"". Well, for fans of Johansson (like me) it is.",Ghost in the Shell

I found it engaging and interesting and entertaining.Cool universe.",Ghost in the Shell
47,digitalbeachbum,A Disappointment,3,14 April 2017,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was, visually stimulating. Think of Blade Runner and Fifth Element as similar movies which influenced this director. Many of the city scenes were right out of Blade Runner. The make-up and costumes used, very much like Fifth Element.The movie is not true to the original story, but more of a mix of several volumes. Scenes are a mishmash of ""Stand Alone Complex"" and ""Innocence"", along with a variety of new content never seen previously.I heard several complaints about the lack of Japanese actors but honestly the original story shows Tokyo as a international hub of all kinds of people. I didn't ever think that the Major was Japanese. I always thought she was Caucasian. The one thing I would like to have seen was a white woman's body with a Japanese voice.I agree with the complaints that they did not stick with the theme of the original. They did touch on it, but not to the level needed to be true to the story. What makes you human? What is next for the human race?I think the director failed. They gave up the most important part of Ghost in the Shell so they could make a typical Hollywood action movie.I saw this movie in 3D and some of the scenes didn't look really sharp. I saw the car in one scene jump/appear jittery. There were some other scenes were the computer generated effects were glossed over. Not impressive considering the money spent.3/10.",Ghost in the Shell
48,matthewssilverhammer,"Choices Were Made...Dumb, Dumb Choices",5,6 April 2017,"Christians, Muslims, Republicans, Democrats, gay, straight, black, white; we all agree on one thing: people who say ""the book is better"" are the worst. Well, bring your hate to me: 2017's Ghost in the Shell doesn't hold a neon-candle to its 1995 progenitor. Some of the intrigue, entertainment and beautiful sci-fi visuals hold over nicely, but where the original is a potent and mind-bending trip of sci-fi thoughts and action, this new one is awkwardly broad, surface-y, and plain sloppy. Like all artificial-intelligence stories, it's about what makes someone ""human"", with Johansson playing a cyborg with a human brain (""ghost"" in this world) searching for the originator of a deadly virus. Blade-Runner-like in many ways, it's a grimy world full of bright lights and mysterious characters. But where the original holds tightly to its effectively enigmatic nature, this one unnecessarily expands on backstory, spells-out themes, rolls-out unearned platitudes and projects emotions to such an extent that you wanna yell at the screen, ""We get it! This is all REAL important!"" At the center is Johansson. Her casting should be no surprise as she is currently a premier action heroine. However, she faced backlash after many saw her casting as the next in a long-line of Hollywood whitewashing Asian characters (Aloha, Great Wall). Ghost in the Shell has a fairly understandable explanation for her look, and even uses it thematically. However, that casting mixed with the frustrating plot changes point somewhere less noble: insurance of a franchise. Ultimately, the bare bones of sci-fi greatness are covered by insecurity, bringing us a dumb-down version of a great product.",Ghost in the Shell
49,Vartiainen,"Not as good as the original, but also not as bad as it could have been",7,23 June 2017,"You hear that Ghost in the Shell gets a big budget Hollywood adaptation, you get cautiously optimistic and excited. You hear that Rupert Sanders, the guy behind Snow White and the Huntsman, is directing, you die a little inside. And keeping these two facts in mind, the film is actually pretty decent.I mean, let's face it, the film was never going to reach the philosophical and thematic depth of the original. Not without a huge name behind the camera. I'm talking about James Cameron level of talent here. So the fact that it looks great - the visuals are easily the best part of the film - sounds nice and has some genuinely good acting moments in it, is probably the most we were ever going to get. And that's exactly what was delivered here.But yeah, then the downsides. They do mess up with the story more than a little. Personally I'm okay with it as they're clearly trying to make the central theme and conflict - that of the value of humanity during the rise of cybernetics - more accessible to general audiences. And for the most part they succeed in this. But it does leave the story a bit lacking. Because such a huge part of the original was its depth. The fact that it quite honestly required a couple of viewings and some real thinking to get the message. That's simply not here.And while I do think that the acting in this film is okay for the most part - with Pilou Asbæk as Batou deserving the MVP trophy many times over - I was disappointed by Scarlett Johansson's Major. I blame the script for the most part, but the fact remains that her delivery and presence is about as flat as a piece of rice paper.Ghost in the Shell is worth a watch for fans of science fiction. It would be even for the visuals and practical effects alone, but it also has some good action, some good acting and even watered down the story ain't half bad.",Ghost in the Shell

The visual effects were good. Straight out of the manga (and Anime) it was based on.So there is a bit of controversy about Scarlett Johansson as the lead. Me personally, I just don't click with Johansson as a movie star. Would think that a hot chick would make me run to the movie theater, but she does not do it for me.It's a step up form a movie like Avatar which like Ghost in the Shell had visuals that were mind blowing but a so so story. The Manga was not the greatest story to comprehend and this adaption does a lackluster job of trying to fix that.You can blame Johansson for that as it was important to focus on the movie star therefore expanding the lead characters background story beyond that of the comic book, and adding the stuff that explains why a white woman is playing an Asian charter.So not that impressive of a movie, but definitely not bad too watch, literally.

52,jamesrupert2014,Visually impressive but otherwise routine 'cyperpunk' opus,7,19 February 2018,"As others have pointed out, this iteration of ""Ghost in the Shell"", with a memory-wiped human brain transplanted into superhuman crime-fighting cyber-body and then betrayed by its constructors, is essentially a retelling of the much more imaginative and interesting (and bloody) ""Robocop"" (1987). This may reflect a departure from, and simplification of, the original story, which was in part an exploration of existential philosophy. That aside, the 2017 live-action version of the story is visually stunning, with excellent character makeup/prosthetics and hardware (e.g. the 'spidertank""), although I found endless holographically-enhanced cityscape motif to be repetitive and not very 'realistic' (in the 'probable' sense of the term). When brewed down, there is not much of a story and the characters don't have a lot to do other than be predictable. Scarlett Johansson was fine playing her usual jump-suited super hero shtick but, while I don't really care about the PC 'white washing' critiques, the film would have been a little more coherent if the character had been played by a Japanese actress (of course, the character is a synthetic person and could look like anyone, but, again of course, this being Hollywood, is going to be slim and photogenic). Overall, an entertaining enough CGI-fest but nothing novel, clever, or memorable (expect maybe the spider tank).",Ghost in the Shell
53,freemantle_uk,Wasted potential,4,6 August 2021,"Based on the seminal anime, 2017 was a film that had the potential to be a great remake because of the world that was created and the ideas presence. But the remake was a shallow action/neo-noir style film.Ghost in the Shell was directed by Rupert Sanders, who was best known for Snow White and the Huntsman. What he does well is visuals. The film had some great cityscapes, even if there were a bit too influenced by Blade Runner and the Geisha Robots were cool. There were also so decent action sequences even if the film just recreated some of the big set-pieces from the anime.As stated, Ghost in the Shell did have big ideas. They were ideas about the blurring lines between humanity and technology, and the role of memory and its importance on identity. But the live-action film's approach was skin deep.The film was notorious for its casting of Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. If the remake had been set in North America, Europe, or a culturally ubiquitous city it wouldn't have been much of an issue. However, the film was clearly set in Hong Kong and the reveal in the film was ScarJo's character was really an Asian woman's brain in a robot that looks like a white woman.

54,stevendbeard,Visually Stunning,7,31 March 2017,"I saw ""Ghost in the Shell"", starring Scarlett Johansson-Lucy, Home Alone 3; Pilou Asbaek-Game of Thrones_tv, Lucy; Juliette Binoche-The 33, Dan in Real Life and Michael Pitt-Seven Psychopaths, Dawson's Creek_tv.This movie is based on a popular Japanese Manga. There was a 1995 animated movie but I have not seen it. I'm not a big Manga fan, so I can only tell you what I thought of the movie-I have heard some purists complain about things, such as having Scarlett, a white actress, portray an Asian character. Anyway, Scarlett plays the first of her kind; a cyber enhanced law enforcer in the not-too-distant future, where lots of people have little accessories, such as vision or body parts replaced. After an accident, Scarlett's brain was the only salvageable part of her body left alive. Juliette plays the doctor that performs the operation, which puts her human brain into a robot body. She is now trained in fighting and other useful traits, such as turning invisible, and she usually takes on terrorists or other criminals that are too tough for normal police to handle. Pilou is her partner-he has had his vision worked on. Michael plays the villain, a man causing havoc by his hacking abilities, of both machines and other things. He also has a connection to Scarlett. The movie is visually stunning, especially with all the little things going on all around the characters as the story unfolds, plus, Scarlett looks really good in that white suit. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence, disturbing images and some suggestive content and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. I don't know how close it stayed to the source material-I did mention that I am not a Manga fan earlier, didn't I?-but I enjoyed the movie enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Ghost in the Shell
55,dee.reid,"""Blade Runner"" + ""RoboCop"" + ""The Matrix"" = ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017",6,31 March 2017,"In many ways, ""Ghost in the Shell,"" the 2017 live-action film adaptation of the Japanese Manga series of the same name by Shirow Masamune, represents how the film industry has come full circle.Mamoru Oshii directed the original 1995 Anime' ""Ghost in the Shell,"" which was one of the earliest Anime' films I ever saw as a teenager in high school and is one of my all-time favorite films ever, and one of my all-time favorite science fiction films. The Wachowskis cited ""Ghost in the Shell"" as one of the key cinematic and visual influences on ""The Matrix"" (1999). And we all know ""The Matrix,"" with its groundbreaking, time-bending ""bullet time"" effects, would influence many action films afterward.(Is it also a coincidence that today marks the 18th anniversary of ""The Matrix""?)And now ""Ghost in the Shell"" has been released, which employs many of the same slow-motion special effects that ""The Matrix"" pioneered. It only seems natural that the source material would return the favor in some way. That, and the obvious cyber-punk visual influences borrowed from Anime', William Gibson's 1984 novel ""Neuromancer,"" and also Ridley Scott's landmark sci-fi picture ""Blade Runner"" (1982) are about the only things really worth mentioning here.Like many others, I was concerned with the obvious Hollywood white-washing of a uniquely Japanese film and Manga property. Rupert Sanders's take on ""Ghost in the Shell"" tries to remedy those concerns by having a multi-national cast of actors - some of whom are Japanese themselves (but are still short-changed for screen-time, anyway) - playing characters who were originally ALL Japanese. The biggest sin of all, of course, was the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Major Motoko Kusanagi.To be fair, and as I've commented many times in the past when news of this film first broke, Scarlett Johansson's career has probably led up to this point. After her roles in ""Lucy"" (2014) and as The Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Ghost in the Shell"" seemed like the next logical career step for her. In fact, I kept thinking throughout this film how her portrayal of Major Motoko Kusanagi was just a cyber-punk-influenced variation of her role AS The Black Widow from the MCU, complete with dazzling, ""Matrix""-inspired gun-play and martial arts action sequences.(And as I've ALSO stated plenty of times before, they should have gotten actress Rinko Kikuchi, who IS Japanese, to play the Japanese Major Motoko Kusanagi, but alas.)It's a shame, because ""Ghost in the Shell"" did have the potential to be something good. Of course in translating Masamune's work to English-speaking American audiences, some things inevitably get lost in the translation. For instance, the original 1995 film was a great philosophical and quasi-religious meditation on the human soul and the meaning of individual identity and the impact that rapidly advancing technology has on either one, as well as the integration of computers and ""'Net"" into nearly every aspect of society. This film does make some odd references to the role memories play in forming individual identity (one's ""ghost,"" if you will), but it gets muddled by a spotty script and performances, and weak simplifications of Oshii's ideas for the American mainstream.""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 follows very closely to the 1995 Anime', and also borrows a few ideas from the TV series ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" (which I also love, and the film's opening action sequence reproduces the opening moments from the first-season episode). Another of the only things it does retain is the profound seriousness of the 1995 Anime' film, and none of the humor that was present in the original Manga series.Using a story set-up that will strike fans of the American sci-fi satire ""RoboCop"" (1987) as oddly familiar, Johansson plays the ""Major Mira Killian,"" instead of Major Motoko Kusanagi, who as a child was badly injured in a terrorist attack and whose brain was then placed in a cyborg body, the first of its kind. (The film also treats us to an opening credits sequence that's reminiscent of the opening credits of Oshii's film.) A year later, she is with Public Security Section 9 as their top operative. She's investigating a series of ghost-hacking incidents that are being perpetrated by a master computer hacker named Kuze (Michael Carmen Pitt), who is somehow connected to Killian's past. Together with her cyborg partner Batou (Pilou Asbæk) and her supervisor Aramaki (""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano), they go about trying to track him down and bring him to justice.Fans of the original 1995 ""Ghost in the Shell"" or Shirow Masamune's Manga may be sorely disappointed with Rupert Sanders's take on the material. The film looks dazzling; it's a perfectly realized live-action cyber-punk fantasy inspired by the not-so-futuristic visuals of ""Blade Runner"" and action scenes that seem like something out of ""The Matrix."" But die-hards may have a hard time buying Scarlett Johansson as the Major, and just may see her playing another version of The Black Widow - or hell, even Lucy. She can deliver the goods in the action sequences, but when it comes time to meditating on her cybernetic existence - like her Japanese Anime' counterparts were prone to doing on their downtime - she's kind of a bore and quite wooden.""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano, a legendary figure in Japan, is the only other real stand-out here. As the paternal father figure in the Major's life, he speaks all of his lines in his native Japanese tongue (though the filmmakers could have forced him to speak English, which I know he can) - which is about one of the most authentic things about his performance, and the film, period.In short, I would suggest seeing ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 just once to satisfy your curiosity and to say that you've seen it. And then you can go back and re-watch Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece or re-read Shirow Masamune's original Manga series.6/10",Ghost in the Shell

The premise of this film sees a girl who has her brain transplanted to a cyborg body and become a soldier. Also I have never seen the anime so I will not compare anything from that to this film. Scarlett Johansson plays the major in this film and she does a great job in the role, she is great in the action scenes and you totally buy her as an action star. Also she was a really interesting character as you see her learning more you really do end up caring about her character. Also when it comes to the controversy I don't believe it is truly merited and it definitely isn't whitewashing especially given the quality of her performance but that is just my opinion. I really liked the character of batou, I thought there chemistry together was great and I ended up caring about his character. I liked all the performances whether it was the doctor who helps her or her team leader or the terrorist hell bent on taking down her company. The performances were solid across the board which is nice to see in a film like this. The story in this film has some interesting character depth in this film, I loved the way the film dealt with the major and her development across the film. However, especially towards the third act of the film it changes a bit in its story element's and is a very predictable which is disappointing. The script has some good dramatic dialogue as you see the major deal with the dramatic circumstances in this film. However, I think every film should have at least a couple of humorous moments in it and this film really fails to have any humour in it to help flush out even more depth to the characters. The style is absolutely breathtaking in this film, the CGI world created looks perfectly suited for this world and I loved it. Also there are some decent action scenes in this film, but there is just way too much slow mo used in this film like it is trying to homage the matrix and 300 but in this day you need more to your action scenes.

Plot wise the films are different (although perhaps with some overlapping). Anyway with that observation out of the way I'll crack on with some further thoughts...To start with the positives; the film looks great and some of the special effects are pretty impressive and the way that Scarlett nicely fills that 'shell' is also hard to ignore, but beyond the superficial I didn't find a great deal about this film that's worthy of much praise to be honest...Despite appearing to be interesting at the start the film soon becomes rather clichéd and obvious; the fact that it seems to contain strands of many science fiction films from yesteryear certainly doesn't do the film any favours. It perhaps wouldn't have been as bad if the film would have either been exciting, fast-paced or fun (which may have acted as a distraction to the obvious plotting) but the truth is that it is none of these things and unfortunately it does take itself far too seriously and the end result is something that is far less worthy than it thinks it is.OK to be fair a serious story told in a serious manner can work, but this can only work if key components exist within the story (such as depth, intrigue and characters that one can care about), but the honest truth is that you get none of this here. For example; there is absolutely no character development afforded to a single character (there is a slight arc with the protagonist, but not really enough to make me care). Hanka Robotics and their experiments aren't elaborated on in any great detail; I think we learn that 98 people have been selected for their programme, but why were these people selected? There is a modicum of intrigue at the start of the film, but this soon becomes dissipated and takes a fairly generic turn. Many of the characters are uninteresting and one-dimensional and the lack of depth afforded to them does make it hard to give a damn about them or anything that happens to them.I'm not really sure what else to say; it's a pretty film with a bit of action and a bit of soul-searching, but it doesn't amount to very much. It never quite falls into the realms of being boring (the director moves things along well enough for it never to get that bad), but at the same time I just had this feeling of indifference about the story and the characters all the way through the film which sadly meant that I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.",Ghost in the Shell

62,kluseba,More of the same on a consistent level,7,12 April 2017,"I haven't read the manga yet but as a fan of both dystopian science- fiction stories and Japanese culture, I decided to watch this movie yesterday. It was overall entertaining but on the other side, it offered more of the same if you are familiar with science-fiction scenarios.The story is basically a mixture of Blade Runner, Equilibrium and maybe Tokyo Gore Police and therefore highly predictable. A young female cyborg called Mira Killian, who works as a major for an anti- terrorist bureau in a futuristic world, finds out that she wasn't saved but rather kidnapped by her creators. The beautiful soul in her disposable shell is searching for a sense of life. She tries to find out about her true identity while also chasing a mysterious hacker who is manipulating cyborgs and robots across the city to execute members of the company that created Mira Killian. She will have to choose sides in what might be her most personal case.While the plot isn't all that convincing, the acting performances are at least of an average quality. Scarlett Johansson isn't as convincing as in Lucy but even an average performance by her is still above average in general and you will also sympathize with her character. Pilou Asbæk had played alongside Johansson in Lucy and he does the same here and this time around he has a bigger role and does a great job as cool special operative with a dry sense of humor. It's also a pleasure to see Kitano Takeshi on the big screen and Japan's most legendary contemporary actor does a great job as rough and resilient Chief Executive Director.The movie focuses mostly on its visual special effects and portrays a futuristic city without a soul. One gets to see many quirky cyborgs, complicated machines, colorful screens, elegant vehicles and sophisticated weapons. The film actually looks closer to a video game than to an actual movie. Everything is very artficial and superficial despite being technically and visually stunning. In this case, the shell looks beautiful but there isn't any ghost inside. The movie actually makes you feel hollow at times but I suppose this was intentional and that's why I won't criticize that in this particular case. The different characters soon realize that they are living in a fake paradise. The underlying message of the movie is that too much technology will make humanity regress instead of progress which is an important statement in the early twenty-first century.In the end, Ghost in the Shell is an entertaining dystopian science- fiction movie with an important message. It clearly isn't the bets of its kind but it also isn't the worst. Genre fans should be pleased while those who aren't familiar with that kind of movie will surely start to explore this genre further after watching this film that might serve as an appropriate introduction to its genre. Overall, I still wasn't impressed enough to actually check out the manga of the same name.",Ghost in the Shell
63,TdSmth5,So-so,6,22 May 2017,"In the future in Tokio some corporation creates a Robocop named Major. She's got the brain/mind (ghost as it's called here) of a human with some type of organic robotic body. Bionic body enhancements are all the rage at the time, with regular folk getting some body parts enhanced.When there's some attack on the corporations executives, Major intervenes against the orders of her superior. There she discovers the villain, a geisha that is some type of robot who spews an ominous message warning all the employees of the corporation. We learn that something's wrong with Major's system. She sees things that then vanish. We learn that in the process of her creation, her memories have been wiped clean and she was told she's the first of her kind.To get some lead on the bad guy behind the attack, Major decides to undergo a risky procedure where she interfaces with the system of the geisha. It helps her discover a location for the bad guy that she and her partner cop then raid. But the bad guy, named Kuze, was ready for them and they end up badly damaged. In the meantime, Kuze keeps going after the corporation. During an attack, Major captures one of Kuze's minions. When she faces him, Kuze speaks through him. That allows our law enforcement group to track Kuze's location. There Major finds a bunch of human connected to some network. Finally she runs into Kuze who tells her something revealing about herself and also about him. He shares some of her broken memories and is working on an alternate network and suggests she look into these visions/memories, which she does and discovers some more about herself.Once the agenda of the corporation and of Kuze are known, the battle lines are drawn and there's a bit of a surprise about who's good and who's bad. There will be some final confrontation between Kuze and the corporate higherups and Major will have to pick a side.Ghost in the Shell is a rather visually ugly sci-fi movie with a good message. Things are pretty dry and Johansson is starting to specialize in these robotic flat performances. I found the Japanese angle to be a distraction since you have to keep track of the Japanese names and one cast-member's dialogue is even in Japanese.A sci-fi movie should at the very least offer something of an interesting world. This movie doesn't. Granted it's based on some comic that I'm not familiar with, but still, surely they could have at least tried to give us something interesting to look at. As it is, the world of the movie is the standard big city dark gray future with lots of big neon signs while cars fly by. So both visually and conceptually, the movie fails. Visually appealing is only Johansson in some tight skin-colored rubber suit, if that's what it is, it might as well be CGI, so even there the appeal is minimized. But in typical Japanese fashion, she's got a terrible haircut. The movie could have given us some interesting science, but it doesn't. Things improve with the appearance of Kuze and Michael Pitt's performance. At that point we get a bit of morality injected into the story which helps a lot and something meaningful is finally at stake.Ghost in the Shell doesn't live up to its potential. It is somewhat lackluster but it's still worth a watch.",Ghost in the Shell
64,s3276169,May disappoint purists but will entertain sci-fi action fans.....,7,11 May 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is competent but in no way exceptional sci-fi action flick but then does it have to be? This is an action film at its heart and it does work on this level. I know many have been critical of the watering down of the concept(s) found in the Manga series but considering this is only a 106 minute film I'd say personally, its hard to capture the depth to be found in the comic books. Action wise there's a lot to like here. Its well paced if not frenetic and the action sequences have a polish that brings this imagined world to life nicely. In terms of story, I do feel a little more time spent on characterization would have fleshed out out this film. In particular, a little more focus on how the key characters past life impacts on her. Her realizations of who she is, lack emotion and are all too brief. My advice don't come to this film expecting what you find in the books. This is in action film and in a functional kind of way as I said, it does work. I do agree it could have done more but it is constrained by time limitations and I would imagine financial ones too. Seven out of ten from me.",Ghost in the Shell
65,Enchorde,Entertaining but predictable,7,9 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is a entertaining movie. Set in a gloomy future where humans and machines merge more and more. Major Mira Killian is the individual that exemplifies this the most, with only a human brain in a cybernetic body. Employed as a weapon in an elite task force she often is the spearhead in the force's battles. But now a new terrorist named Kuze, with powers over the cybernetic world than no other, threatens them all.Good action set in a peculiar future. The world is both stunning and beautiful, but also dark, gloomy and dystopic. The characters are good and well played by Johansson, Asbaek and the others. It contains a lot of good ideas and concepts that more movies might be able to build upon. But the movie has one big flaw, it didn't have a story that captivated me fully. It was way too predictable and full of clichés.This is a typical movie to establish a heroine. That there was to be doubts about her mysterious past, and that it turned out to be foul play involved can't have surprised anybody. It is almost a given in these kind of movies. But that there wasn't any more to it did surprise me. Therefore the movie seemed a little bit simple, afraid to push the frontiers further. So it is good, but stays at good, leaving me wondering what would have been with a little more inventive story.7/10",Ghost in the Shell
66,questl-18592,Ghost in the Half Shell,3,24 September 2019,Do you like movies that are all flash with minimum story? How about regularly pointed out cultural missteps and  washing? Maybe you're after a plot so simple you can still guess the ending even when barely paying attention to it? Or maybe you just like the idea of a movie with a lot of Scarlett Johansson wearing a skin tight bodysuit?If that's your checklist then this is the movie for you. It's pretty and some of the action is fun but there isn't much to this.It's also pretty hard to overlook the white washing. Not just because of the source material but because everything else in this movie is so very Japanese! They didn't even try to hide it by altering the world a little. Epic fail there Hollywood.,Ghost in the Shell
67,valleyjohn,Give it a rest Scarlett,6,7 May 2017,"I think it's about time Scarlett Johansson showed us her acting chops if she has any. This is yet another role where she jumps around and acts dumb and she is beginning typecast herself with superhero /sci-fi roles. I would love to see her do something with a little substance, . Ghost in the Shell is set in the future in which humans and technology have begun to merge, a cybernetically enhanced soldier hunts a mysterious terrorist who can hack into his victims' minds and control their thoughts and memories. Her pursuit eventually leads her to discover the full truth about her past.I wasn't surprised to read Ghost in the Shell was adapted from a Japanese Manga series from the 80's as it has that fantastical feel about it. Fantastical not fantastic. It also has the feel of a video game which is perhaps why it didn't do too much for me. The first 45 minutes bored me silly but thankfully the last hour was much better.

72,jadepietro,Spirit in Disguise,9,6 April 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: One of the best looking films of the year, GITS is gorgeous to inhale, even if the plot is all action with more wisps of smoke and lots of mirrors.SYNOPSIS: A cyborg killing machine discovers her inner woman.Can all dazzling visuals a movie make? Does style trump substance? Has the message been altered to affect the messenger? From the manga series to anime form and now a live action avatar in Rupert Sanders technically impressive but emotionally distant version, Ghost in the Machine has taken many forms. Yet none is as striking as Scarlett Johansson in the title role as The Major, a babe-o-licious killing machine. Major has become a cyber-enhanced android weapon living in a neon-lit world of giant holograms that become landmarks that engorge its urban futuristic city. In this Blade Runner inspired sci-fi universe, the world is one violent melee. Caught in the crossfire is Mira Killian, a helpless victim before reincarnated as a female Robo-cop whose sole purpose is to fight terrorism. An effective cyborg Amazon, Mira aka The Major starts to feel unexpected emotions that gets in the way of her combat missions. An android becoming human can be a lethal disruption, one that needs to be stopped before going rogue. She has a ghost (soul) somewhere in her shell.The plot is familiar and highly predictable. But Ms. Johansson is perfectly cast. The actress has had much practice playing this prototype before in her mad array of superhero warriors (from Lucy and Black Widow in the Avengers series), a sub-human creature (Under the Skin), and computer types (the voice in Her). Here, she becomes the perfect natural unnatural model of beauty, the embodiment of the ideal woman. All electronic circuitry in place and all the right curves as well, a quintessential sex doll for those viewers trapped in a state of arrested development (which is the film's target audience). There is ample supporting in the film's international casting which includes the luminous Juliette Binoche as Mira's creator, Micheal Pitt, Peter Ferdinado, ""Beat' Takeshi Kitano, and Pilou Asbaek as Major's loyal sidekick. All bring to their roles enough swagger and authority that fills in the blanks to their stock characters. Screenwriters Jamie Moss William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger try to bring some pathos to their main character, but the non-stop violence upstages any subtlety. ( I wish there were more quieter moments to help establish the anguish of the main character.) The physical encounters seem to be more of interest, with little time spent on her poignant dilemma. This literally sacrifices Major's major character development. She remains an enigma, a ghost in a shell, although that is not the film's intent. One is suppose to feel some empathy for our hero, that is, between the cracking of bones and bloody carnage.There is plenty of that, and I mean plenty of chases and fight moves, but there is also some stunning eye candy to savor in beautifully staged scene after scene. Even if there is not real emotional connection, the overall effect of Sanders' images is breathtaking. Credit Jess Hall's cinematography, quite remarkable in its splendor. The production design by Jan Roelfs covers any of the film's narrative deficits in its detailed coolness. The music score by Lorne Balfe and Clint Mansell adds the right techno- pop atmosphere and the taut editing by Billy Rich and Neil Smith is thrilling. Director Sanders has a dark hypnotic vision and blends the action and CGI seamlessly. Large holographic geisha, giant floating koi, bodies that dissolve into thin air, ethereal disembodied figures, are just a few the the arresting images, giving the perfect sense of eeriness that more than suggests a world off balance. He gives us enough of the old ""razzle-dazzle"" that one could overdose on the film's stunning hallucinations But the reality is that the film is all clever visual trickery used to deflect the hollowness of his film genre itself. Action. after all, is the main event.Ghost in the Shell is definitely an intriguing shell game. It's an interesting sleight of hand when viewing, even if it is ultimately empty inside. But the journey, especially for moviegoers who like their action with imaginative state-of-the-arts edginess, couldn't be more pleasing or satisfied. (This film may be destined to become a cult film.)",Ghost in the Shell
73,rgkarim,"Sci-Fi Thinker, Action Stinker",6,1 April 2017,"Robbie K here, back with another review. This time we review the latest comic book inspired film ghost in a shell starring leading lady Scarlett Johansson as an ""epic"" cybernetic cop trying to stop terrorism. With a large cult following, this movie certainly has a lot to live up to in terms of quality, and if you're not familiar with the series than you are probably hoping action. What is the verdict? Please read on to hear my thoughts on the latest film. LIKES:  Decent Sci-Fi Plot  Cool visuals  Nice character design  Okay actingSummary: I'll lay it out now, I haven't read nor seen any ghost in the shell media, so I can't justify how it matches. However, from a movie perspective, this film has a decent Sci-Fi plot that fits into the genre where anything can happen. A dark plot about cybernetics, Ghost in The Shell again diverts from the fantasy train, and takes a more realistic (albeit theatrical) turn into science territory of humans becoming robots. The more realistic plot is not much of a stretch and provides an ample medium to create awesome visuals to sell that realism. And that, my friends, is the best part of this movie. Ghost in the Shell's visuals are impressive, overlaying futuristic advertising onto a real life setting that doesn't look cheesy. In all honesty, it is like taking a look at what Japan can look like in the future and how our desire to ""progress"" can ruin it. Outside the city look, the characters themselves look like something out of a comic, each with a flare that scream Japanese animation. While some looks are certainly worth a chuckle, a few characters like Major (Johansson) and Kuze (Michael Pitt) are well developed, looking sleek, deadly, or horrifying and standing out in terms of the realistic design you are seeking. But while visuals are impressive, you also hope the actors can bring their characters to life in a way that will meet expectations. Happy to say, the cast did a decent job in their goal, though again I'm uncertain how the characters are supposed to act having not read the comic. If Major is supposed to be very monotone and hardly reactive, Johansson nails that approach, hardly diluting from the calm, stoic battle mode of the robotic assassin. Pitt having to act like a tortured (albeit enlightened) terrorist wins points for gruesome tactics, prolonged speeches, and many other things that a cyberterrorist is expected to have. The rest of the cast is decent, but we have limited space and more to cover, so let's wrap and say the rest aren't bad given their little screen time. DISLIKES:  Little involvement with other characters  Plot is very predictable and dragged out  Action is sub-par most of the timeSummary: My dislikes start with the lack of involvement in other characters. Johansson carries most of the film as major, taking much of the screen time and stunts this movie requires. Her team ""helps"" out at certain points, and her director certainly gets some good jabs in, but overall the other characters are almost pointless. For being an elite team, Section 9's agents did little to impress me and that team approach could have amped up the movie. This is especially true given how lackluster the plot was. While realistic, Ghost In A Shell has little in terms of uniqueness to justify the nearly two hour run time. Even if you haven't read the books, the ending can be seen from a mile away and the delivery wasn't spectacular enough to wait for (at least for me). The dramatic flare and character development are certainly nice, don't get me wrong on that, but the ""exciting"" climax I was waiting for just wasn't there. This brings me to the action component. Ghost In the Shell was promoted as action packed and exciting, but for me it was mediocre at best. A nice Matrix style opening shows promise for the movie, but it doesn't take long for the stunts to be diluted to quick, unimpressive bouts that last mere minutes (if not seconds). There is little challenge to the fights, and little technology used, which is disappointing given the movie is all about technology. And after all the waiting you would think an epic fight at the end, but no, it's just Johansson running from CGI bullets until a very dramatic finish occurs. This boring display of technology just made the nearly 2 hour run time seem worthless, given the promise the trailers made. The VERDICT:Ghost In The Shell is a visual display that certainly representative of its comic book origins. Unfortunately, outside of these impressive visual displays, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to what I expected from the trailers. The story is mediocre and the execution is flawed, to promote a boring mess with only character development as its redeeming grace. Despite the impressive design of the movie, this reviewer does not recommend this one for the theater, unless you go in with low expectations. Instead hold out for home rental and instead read the comic book it is based on. My scores are:Action/Crime/Drama: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0",Ghost in the Shell

I agree with him. Now finally on bluray and digital hd, this underrated gem has great visual effects, a good soundtrack that borrows elements from the anime movie, its sequel, and the series, yet the story moves at a slow pace sometimes and can be confusing if anyone hasn't seen the original stories.

76,Rob_Taylor,Ghost of a Movie,5,18 May 2017,"So first things first. No, I haven't seen the original anime/manga movies/shows which this movie draws its title from. My perspective is from someone new to the franchise.That said, I can't imagine those earlier works are as dull and predictable as this outing. Are they? Ghost in the Shell has a plot... a plot that is about as tissue-thin and predictable as it can be. A cyborg woman learns that she has been duped into thinking she is someone else and her whole life is a lie, so she sets out for revenge against the evil Corporation(tm) responsible.Yeah, it really is that trite and yes, it is predictable. But revenge movies can be good, if the subject matter is handled well. Sadly, GitS does not do this. It isn't terrible, but it is as if they decided to put minimal effort into making the story (as cliché as it is) interesting and exciting. In fact, everything about the story is put on screen with so little enthusiasm as to make you wonder if this was the first movie that everyone involved had ever made.It skirts with dullness and tedium, particularly in the first half-hour or so, only managing to be vaguely interesting for the rest of the runtime.Nothing is explained about the setting, or the tech, or anything else really. Which makes you wonder if this was targeted at preexisting fans (much like the Warcraft movie) and so you were expected to have the back knowledge already. If so, and judging by the comments of the fans, then they have done a poor job of satisfying those fans.As for me, a non-fan. I found the movie barely interesting. The acting is fine, the effects... mostly fine, but the simplistic story and predictability let it down. Even the action is rather boring, with fight scenes and shootouts being rather formulaic.It's a movie that you will watch and then promptly forget about within a few days. After a week, you won't remember what happened or be able to say what the highlights of the film were (hint: there aren't any!) and even when it inevitably comes on TV, you'll frown and be unable to decide if you've seen it before. It really is that unmemorable.It had promise, in the hands of better film-makers, perhaps. But not this time.SUMMARY: Kind of tedious and very predictable.

77,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A ghost of a shell of a plot.,2,6 April 2017,"Glitzy, glossy, and downright dull sci-fi, hallucinatory, I remember it being very colourful, but with enough substance to fill an upturned Heineken bottle cap, which I felt as though I had drunk several of after having watched this one.My mind wandered and drifted in and out for so much of this generically plotted stolen identity plot line, bored for most of the second half, to the point where I cannot even remember some of the characters' names.Scarlett Johannson's body is the only part of this which held my attention, and the holographic Hong Kong present, which had visible, holograms of a pig with wings (a Pink Floyd reference?) , a car which looks like a cross between a Ferrari and a DeLorean, and imitation Predator invisibility effects. One character had steel-capped teeth, like Jaws, from The Spy Who Loved Me, another looked like Rutger Hauer from Split Second (a vastly superior film, even if it's just in a "" so bad it's good "" way)I went into this knowing virtually nothing about the earlier films and comics, aside from the fact that they exist, so perhaps that was part of the reason I was so bored?

78,bkrauser-81-311064,A Remake That Only Gives 10%,6,1 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is like the Velvet Underground of anime; the few, who were introduced to it early on, went on to start their own thing, resulting in a subtle cultural reverberation that still lingers in some of your favorite science fiction. You can see shades of the Ghost in the Shell manga, film (1995), subsequent TV series (2002-2003) and videogames in everything from the Matrix franchise (1999-2003) to A.I. (2001), Ex Machina (2015), Surrogates (2009), and even RoboCop (2014) (the s**t remake, not the original). Thus when it was finally deemed necessary to cobble together a watered-down, whitewashed, live-action remake of the influential anime, the best one could have hoped for was an echo of what once was - A slight but enjoyable jaunt through the recent history of sci-fi ephemera only with 15% of the charisma and 10% of the brain power. In that regard, the latest incarnation of Ghost in the Shell is a marginal success.For those unfamiliar with the original, the ghost that characters repeatedly refer to throughout the film is, in essence the soul. The story takes place in a far off future where nearly everyone on earth has been fitted with various technological advancements; coaxing questions like when do humans cease becoming human? Such advancements include robotic limbs, eyes capable of seeing beyond the visible spectrum, brain plug-ins capable of connecting with vast networks and in one smirk-worthy case, a robotic liver that allows one minor character to consume more alcohol.Major (Johansson) however is a special case. Due to an accident, her entire body (with the exception of her brain) is completely synthetic. This makes her an important asset to Section 9, a cybercrime police force tasked with bringing down the world's most dangerous hackers and cyber-criminals. When a slew of company bigwigs are murdered by those under the control of a mysterious puppeteer, it becomes the job of Major, Batou (Asbaek) and their superior officer Aramaki (Kitano) to bring him down.While the look and feel of Ghost in the Shell is taken nearly whole-cloth from the anime, the story is very much its own beast. It takes bits and pieces of the original, but only so specific fan-favorite set pieces can be squeezed in and gawked at. Such scenes of course have to include Major's invisible base jumping and the semi-ethereal assembly build that dominates the title sequence. Otherwise we're given what basically amounts to an oppressive and dour retelling of RoboCop (1987) without its satirical bite. In the most succinct way I can sum this up (Spoiler alert): Man creates Evil Corporation, Evil Corporation makes Major, Major finds out Evil Corporation is lying, Major kills Evil Corporation.It's all so pedestrian and cloying; a sad predicament when you consider the original was laid thick with existential and determinist ponderings, political intrigue, understated gender politics and feral body horror. This adaptation not only ignores everything that made Ghost in the Shell so special, it neuters its impressive visuals with enough imposing clutter to make The Island (2005) look like a minimalist masterpiece. It'd be one thing if the film's 3D adverts and cumbersome techno-enhancements did something to further the plot but their domination of the negative space combined with their constant movement only serves to distract.Its visual filigree that means nothing combined with a story that's a pastiche of other better films, helmed by a star that did the exact same thing only better in Under the Skin (2013). For what it's worth, Scarlett Johansson does a swell job playing a character whose main attribute is she's too intelligent, gorgeous and deadly to truly be real. While I am very sympathetic to those upset by Major's whitewashing and will definitely attest that literally any Japanese actress could have filled in and been just as fine, from the perspective of the film's money-men, Johansson was the surefire choice.In fact nearly everything about this movie is a ""surefire choice,"" made for the sole purpose of maximizing profit potential by stymieing anything that even smells of originality. The sets, the effects, the story; Ghost in the Shell isn't so much a movie as it is a marketing decision. One could draw an elaborate graph detailing how every frame of the film sits at some mean between bankability and fiscal risk. If I were you however, I wouldn't be buying what they're selling no matter how good Scarlett Johansson looks in a skin-tight latex suit.",Ghost in the Shell
79,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Ghost in the Shell (2017)""- While it lacks some of the depth of its predecessors, open-minded filmgoers will find plenty of entertainment in its action and spectacle",8,19 April 2017,"There's been a great deal of backlash against director Rupert Sanders' American remake of the iconic Manga and anime property ""Ghost in the Shell."" Whether it be suggestions that the film was white-washed, accusations of the heady and lofty themes of the original being watered down or general dismissal of the film as simple eye-candy and nothing more... the movie's gotten it's fair share of flack. It's one of those movies that just can't seem to catch a break. And yet, I went in with an open mind and found myself very much enjoying the film. Yes, it's certainly no masterpiece and it's safe to say that the original did it better, but I think it's also fair to say that the film doesn't deserve even a fraction of the hate it's received and it's a great bit of fun. The franchise has existed in one form or another for nearly thirty years now... and with various adaptations already existing, I see no reason to bemoan another take on the material that will introduce newer audiences to the series and hopefully inspire them to go back and check out its origins. It's a perfectly valid retelling of a classic story, and I for one hope that as time goes on, more people will learn to appreciate it.We follow Major Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in the not-too-distant future whose mind and ""ghost"" (a sort-of catch all description of one's being and consciousness) have been placed into a synthetic cybernetic body after her original form was allegedly damaged beyond medical repair. Now working as an anti-terrorist operative for an organization known as Section 9, Major Killian works together with others to thwart various attacks and protect the public and Section 9's benefactors. However, after an assassination droid murders a doctor working for Hanka Robotics (the same company responsible for the construction of Killian's synthetic body), Killian and her partners are drawn into a deeper and more troubling conflict than they could have imagined... one that will make them question their allegiances and wonder just who is on their side...The strengths of the film lay in its excellent casting and top-notch visual direction, which both contribute to crafting and maintaining a constant sense of entertainment and intrigue, despite a somewhat stock script. Casting controversies aside, every role is well-cast and extremely well-played, and every player fits their part near- perfectly. Scarlett Johansson makes for a very compelling and troubled protagonist, and she does quite a bit with the role. Supporting roles played by the likes of Michael Pitt, Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche are quite good and make for a great ensemble. And special praise goes to Pilou Asbæk in his excellent role as ""Batou"", Major's closest friend and human connection. He's just fantastic in the part.Sanders' guidance in the film is just extraordinary, and I'll be keeping an eye out for him, because the man clearly knows how to tell one heck of a visual story. His sense of framing, movement and composition is slick and stylish and he works together perfectly with cinematographer Jess Hall in crafting some simply gorgeous imagery. He's one of those directors who understands how to competently construct a sequence without relying too much on gimmicks and lazy conventions... You won't see a bland and poorly-framed shaky-came fight sequence or laughably complex CGI nightmare of a shot here. He's intent to glide the camera smoothly around the scene in a very subtle way and let us take in the sights. Which is quite refreshing. And by god... the action is just awe-inspiring. It's exciting. It's stylish and wild. And yet it never goes too far. Sure, there's a lot of digital effects... but they're used appropriately and never feel contrived or overtly fake.Where the film loses some points however, is in the script by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger. Not that it's necessarily bad by any means. It's a solid enough storyline. But it's a bit too stock. A bit too basic. And yes... it's missing a lot of the depth and themes of the original works that inspired it. What we have here is a sort- of tribute to the source material that doesn't feel quite confident enough in itself to sneak in the subtext of what came before. And as a result... it becomes predictable and unfortunately relies on more basic tropes and clichés. There's the shell of a great script here... (I had to make one ""shell"" joke) but the substance is only partially present.Still, I can't say that the script dragged the film down too much. Sanders and his writing team seem intent on taking what came before and turning it into a beautiful action extravaganza... and I think they succeeded. Yes, the 1995 film was a better adaptation. But that doesn't change the fact that the 2017 film is a great bit of entertainment and is very much enjoyable in its own way. This is a faster, crazier and somewhat more blunt ""Ghost in the Shell."" But I think it's still most certainly a decent take on the material Masamune Shirow created so many years ago.Strictly taking the film on its own, I gotta give it an 8 out of 10. It's a blast to behold on the big-screen, and I think fans are doing themselves a great disservice by so quickly dismissing it. Sure, what came before might have objectively been better. But this one is still pretty darned good.",Ghost in the Shell
80,quincytheodore,"Vibrant futuristic world and basic plot, it's a simple sci-fi wearing skin of Ghost in the Shell, beautiful it may be.",6,29 March 2017,"Looking at the highlights of Ghost in the Shell, one can see the spirit of the original series from the quirky scenery and heavy eye candy. Fans and casual audience would appreciate the effort, but Ghost's world is notoriously riddled with complex, even philosophical undertone, and in attempt to make it simpler, the movie became a streamlined sci-fi thriller.First spotlight falls on the Mayor (Scarlett Johansson). This is a very daunting character to translate to big screen as she has barely shown any emotions across the series, yet there's a sense of guile, charm and slyness within. Conveying underlying emotions while looking stoic, also in runtime of a movie, can be a challenge. Not to mention she has makeover across animation series, so there will be most likely any disagreement regardless of whoever cast.Fortunately, Scar Jo provides more than just the big name allure. For most she carries herself well, there are occasional faint glows of hidden humanity, they are not as pronounced or often yet serendipitously fits the character. Still, content doesn't help much with the usual self-doubt and mundane thriller troupes. That being said, Scar Jo dons the main heroine's suit as effectively and captivatingly as possible.This futuristic world is not without its charm, a trait the movie showcases with high rise building and holographic ads plastered across the horizon every time it changes location or scene. Thankfully, the angle, little details and cinematography for major set pieces stay true to the original vibe. If anything, the occupants of this world are not fully fleshed out. The villain is lacking in sense of dread and perhaps only a couple of characters aside Mayor get any significant development.Action might remind audience of The Matrix, rightfully so as the two are inspired by one another. It provides undoubtedly stunning visual, one on the wetland is especially impeccable. The cosmetic, gadgetry and suits offer enhance futuristic world even more. It's appreciated that, at the very least, the studio went to such extend to honor the original source.The impressive visual trinkets and the cast of Scarlett Johansson help elevate the movie adaptation, one would find something charming in the damp futuristic world. However, with basic plot and crude development, the movie feels like an ordinary sci-fi wearing the skin of Ghost in the Shell.",Ghost in the Shell

82,arungeorge13,"High on style, low on soul (or ghost as they say!) [+54%]",5,14 July 2017,"Rupert Sanders' live action adaptation of the Japanese animation feature / Manga, starring Scarlett Johansson in the titular role of Major is a visually enthralling experience. Set in the future where robotics rule the roost, Major Mira Killian is a cyborg with a human brain (soul) invented and employed by Hanka Robotics, leading a team of counter-terrorism operatives. While I haven't watched the 1995 version to make a comparison as to how sincere this film is to the source material, the aesthetics are, by all means, grandiose and the hard work put in by the visual effects department is indeed evident.Credit goes to the team who handled the set designs and practical effects (fused brilliantly with cutting-edge CGI). Neat action choreography and the application of an effectually minimal musical score fetch plaudits. This isn't a role that requires Johansson the performer; she is wooden-faced throughout (as required by character), though she gets to score during the set-pieces where she coolly lands her punches and kicks in slo-mo, reminding us a little of 'Black Widow'. One also wonders how long Scarlett can keep donning superhero / sci-fi roles where she is seen in shiny spandex or computer- generated shells in sharp contrast to her realistic character portrayals of the previous decade. Almost every film since Don Jon has cast Scarlett either in a voice-role or as a spandex-wearer (and heavily CGI-supported).I wouldn't really accuse the film of white-washing as the theme is a universal one, although certain casting choices appear middling. Danish actor Pilou Asbæk does a fine job playing Batou, another Hanka operative. One does feel that the screenplay (by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger) could have laid out the characters slightly better and added in a couple of scenes depicting the humanness of the lead characters Major and Kuze rather than reiterating the fact through just dialogue. I would say that 'Ghost in the Shell' is fun while it lasts, but it doesn't leave you yearning for a sequel.Verdict: Visual treat with thinly written characters!",Ghost in the Shell
83,MR_Heraclius,Not amazing,6,23 February 2020,It's good but aside from Scarlett Jo there's nothing really special about this movie. It's a standard sci-fi flick that could've been written by a high schooler. The CGI doesn't look great and it already feels dated. This was my first exposure to the Ghost in the Shell franchise so forgive me if I'm not nostalgic about it. Overall I wouldn't rec this movie unless you're a huge Scarlett Jo fan.,Ghost in the Shell
84,Screen_Blitz,"While defusing the impact of its original source material, Ghost in the Shell is a versatile cyberpunk ride",7,7 April 2017,"This electrifying cyberpunk thriller marks a surprisingly competent remake of the 1995 anime hit 'Ghost in the Shell', compacted in the world of filled of unnecessary redos of popular source material. As the original animated feature set a touchstone for the science- fiction genre for its introduction of seminal ideas, this film sadly falls short of the impact that the original left on the cyberpunk genre, which should come to only little surprise since this reimagining operates as a more technological rehash of the events from the source material. What results is an entertaining, but somewhat predictable ride as this film manages to rip many scenes from the original and execute here in a similar fashion. Although director Rupert Sanders breaths a reasonable amount of spirit into this flick, it is hard to find this one blowing anything in the cyberpunk genre out of the water, which maybe could have been possible if the 1995 original never came about. Set in the futuristic city in Japan where human minds are connected by a network, this film enters Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cybernetically engineered humanoid who is revived by Dr. Ouelet (played by Juliette Binoche) after surviving a horrific accident. With her mind transferred inside her new humanoid body, Major is assigned by an anti-terrorist organization run by Chief Daisuke Aramaki (played by Takeshi Kitano) to take down cyber-terrorist Cutter (played by Peter Ferdinando) while struggling to uncover her mysterious past. Rupert Sanders uproots a visually stimulating ride clamoring with visceral cyberpunk themes and flashy action sequences that gracefully made the Japanese-animated picture a hit. But for a film that heavily borrows from its superior source material, its unfortunately not as impactful as it sets out to be. Addressing complex themes of artificial intelligence, the story boasts a strong edge of compelling ideas along with some subtle thrills to drive the briskly paced plot. The subplot dealing with the lead character fighting to uncover her past makes a good source of twists and turns sprinkled throughout the entirety. While Sanders employs just a fair amount of gun-blazing action sequences to pump up the adrenaline, it is the visual presentation of the futuristic setting is what takes the crown for the most powerful eye-grabber. Sanders sets the action in a techno-packed metropolitan city complete with giant CGI holograms towers above every corner and and flying cars soaring through the air; a wildly absorbing eye candy that echoes futuristic Los Angeles from Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner'. As for the acting department, Scarlett Johansson, veteran action star of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, does a fairly well job in the lead role. Although whether or not her performance defies against the whole white-washing controversy that has target this project is debatable, it is hard not to admire her effort. The rest of the cast including Juliette Binoche, Takeshi Kitano, Peter Ferninando, Michael Pitt, and Pilou Asbaek all get the job done, but their character fall short memorability and charisma. Furthermore, none of the characters with the exception of the lead character carry a strong emotional gravitas to their figures, and results in a rather disappointing roster. Ghost in the Shell is an visually stunning cyberpunk thrill ride that may not hold the thoughtful energy of the original film, but nonetheless sets ground for an compelling good time. As for remake of original material, this one is nothing out of the ordinary (unless for those who have not seen the 1995 film), but that does not mean it isn't an entertaining ride.",Ghost in the Shell
85,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,This film has GREAT franchise potential.,7,25 April 2017,"I went into this film having watched the original 1995 Mamoru Oshii anime film years ago; and loving it ever since. While I personally think that for what the remake lacks in story, it makes up for it with its amazing visuals, gorgeous cinematography and some standout performances from the cast (particularly Takeshi Kitano as Daisuke Arakami). The visuals are great, the atmosphere is great, but I oddly thought that Scarlett Johansson's performance wasn't underwhelming because she wasn't Japanese like her character is meant to be, but because she kind of acts like a robot (no pun intended) at times during the movie.Rupert Sanders does a fantastic job at emulating Mamoru Oshii's directorial style, but he doesn't have the out-of-body direction that Oshii gave us with the original '95 classic. It's not that his directing skills are lackluster (far from it); it's that the script suffers from simplifying the original source material a little bit TOO much. There are some changes regarding the 'Puppet Master' here, but I don't really want to spill the beans here.Go into this movie for what it is: a Westernisation of an anime classic that for the most part works. And even when it does fall short of the original, it's actually an entertaining ride nonetheless. Give it a watch, and give it some much-needed love.

While she performs as an agent for the government, it is revealed to her that her memories could have been stolen from her. She begins the hunt for her own identity.The look of the film is brilliant. It is colorful, it is grim, it keeps getting you pulled into the screen. However, I haven't seen the anime and at least this adaption doesn't deliever an immense plot. Why should the human brain be that much better than advanced technology? Questionable. Why should a partly human fighter be THAT much better than any other? Questionable. And if you take those questions into consideration, the plot just doesn't work anymore.All in all this is a solid action/sci-fi movie with beautiful styles but a rather weak plot.

87,miguelneto-74936,Another movie with a potential wasted,6,10 July 2017,"Ghost in the Shell caused a lot of controversy by the scoring of Scarlett Johansson, because it is a Japanese anime being played by an American, but the anime Major has European traits, so perhaps the choice was not a bad decision, but with Scarlett or Without Scarlett, is a film that had an incredible potential for being an adaptation of an anime of a great plot, but was much lower than expected, the beginning 20 minutes of the film are very good, we know the world, with its look very similar With the film Blade Runner up, and with several characters with very exotic visuals, and the action scene is very exciting, but this does not support the film, in the process it loses its strength, the direction of Rupert Sanders begins to have problems, many actors wasted , Scarlett Johansson is very well, but with a better script would be even more prominent, that in talking about it his look is very good, the soundtrack is quite forgettable, and the pace is good at first, but it gets weak Then Ghost in the Shell is a cool movie, most likely going to disappoint the fans, but I'd recommend watching it as time goes by.

Visually, it's exceptional and as true an adaptation of the original material as it's possible. Though not necessarily a fan of Scarjo, I admit she can be a pretty good actress, but I found her performance absolutely terrible here. They also completely dumbed down the original story to make it more accessible to a wider audience I guess, turning this into an origin story of the main character and giving up on some of the bigger themes around humanity, soul, evolution and AI. Also, serious lack of Fuchikomas. <3 Beat Takeshi though!",Ghost in the Shell
89,Stephen_A_Abell,Forget This Mish-Mash Of A Remake & Watch The Superior Original,4,10 July 2017,"There's a problem with re-filming classic and iconic movies and that is perception. This film fails mostly due to the writers and directors not knowing what they wanted from this movie. They had a massive budget to craft and create a beautiful and thought-provoking piece of art. Was the estimated $110,000,000 worth it... NO! Not one penny of it.The writers strangely opted to not tell the original story but to create a mish-mash of the Original 1995 Ghost In The Shell Movie and the Second Gig of the 2004 Series, along with the Basset Hound from the less-than- stellar Ghost In The Shell II: Innocence and make it a 12a Certificate (WHY?). Unfortunately by doing this the messages which the originals gave the audience is lost. In fact, the idea of ""The Ghost"" is so heavy-handedly hammered into you I thought I might need a doctor. If the writers, Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger couldn't come up with a decent original story based on the G.I.T.S. Universe than a straight forward remake would have been better. To be honest, now that A.I.'s are closer than ever the original story would have been more poignant.As for the direction, this was lazy, to say the least as director, Rupert Sanders copies some scenes and mixes others together. All the original shots within the film are pretty unimpressive.I also hope that the acting and characterisations of the cast were down to Sanders vision of the movie as most of them put in sub-standard portrayals. The worst of which is Takeshi Kitano who plays Section 9's leader Aramaki. This character is wily like a fox, though does show quite a bit of emotion on his face and in his voice. Kitano just feels like he turned up, said his lines, then went home. It's such a lacklustre appearance that in some scenes I thought Sanders had just inserted a still shot and dubbed the speech over. As for Scarlett Johansson their's nowhere near enough presence or assurance in her portrayal of the major. For most of the scenes, she skulks around with her head down. This is a strong and assured character. Bad guys and people, in general, should be weary of her. This could be down to the butchering of her backstory that Moss, Wheeler, and Kruger did. Not only does it lessen the character but is nonsensical and quite stupid. The only one who comes out of this film looking good is Pilou Asbaek as his Batou was pretty decent, though the writers again messed up a solid backstory - though not so bad this time.As for the special effects and CGI, these were okay, though not too impressive. However, the Geisha sequence is really good, as is the arm tearing sequence, and I really like the doctor's eyes and the PA's fingers.which kept in with the original. Though the fight sequences were a little strange. In the Geisha fight scene, the Major hangs too long in the air; then in the Bin-Man Puppet fight there are times when his movement through the air doesn't look right, it's as if the harness wasn't working right and they were pushed for time... The worst thing though is the streets. I don't mind that they are garishly lit, as this may be the case, it's the huge holographic people throughout. This wouldn't be too bad if you can figure out what they were selling but they just appear to be people doing... well, not much at all, really.Since the original films are still available I would strongly recommend you watch them instead of this. Even Innocence, which is the weakest of the series, is much stronger in story and characterisation. However, if you still haven't watched the original, why not? Find yourself a copy, it is a beautiful and intelligent movie. Something this should have been. I cannot understand why they did this to something that was so good, to begin with. Do they know that the saying isn't ""If it ain't broke... BREAK IT!"" Well, it goes to show that it doesn't matter how much money you throw at something... if the talent isn't there, or it isn't used to it's fullest potential, then you will usually get a pile of...",Ghost in the Shell

I never really cared about Major, when she got blown-up they just repaired her, and for all the effort it took to save her brain and ""ghost"" she has zero personality - not even a favourite colour.Then, after an hour of emptying pistols into peoples faces, Major gets in a huff because she finds out her boss has lied to her.So she abandons the people who care about her to go on a hunt for a family that she has absolutely no recollection of.I vaguely remember the manga version as being exciting and visually thrilling - this just isn't.Scarlett Johansson is a human being so her body has to make space for things like internal organs. Compared to a stylised anime depiction of a vaguely woman shaped weapon, Scarlet looks fleshy, dumpy and slow - this is not me body shaming its just the reality of the human form.Why use a human to play a robot if you are not going to use the emotional range of the human actor?Eventually the bad guy pulls a big tank out of his butt-hole and we have a fight, which I spent glancing at my watch, until Major inevitably kicked its head in.The original Ghost in the Shell was made in the correct medium and did not need a live action remake - to be honest I don't remember anyone asking for one.",Ghost in the Shell

I thought it was very entertaining and thought provoking. I was hoping for something even have as good with this 2017 installment. Ghost in the Shell is fairly faithful to it's origin source and is beautiful cinematically. While I don't say the film is fantastic, I don't see it disappointing many.The story takes place in the future where a cybernetic android with the brain of a human tries to come with grips with the glitches she is seeing recently. On top of that The Major (Scarlett Johansson's lead character) tries to uncover the mystery behind her past and the dark secrets that he creators are hiding. First things first, I definitely understand when people ha e grievances about whitewashing in Hollywood. I understand that concern but also realize that these films need a really marketable actor to appease audiences and make bank. I also love ScarJo and think she's perfect for these badass heroic protagonist roles she's had in recent years. She's great in this. The supporting cast also works, nice to see Michael Pitt here.The visuals are stunning. Like gorgeous. The world of Ghost in the Shell was brought to life in a fantastic way, and then some. It's up there with some of the most beautiful city scenery I've seen in a film. If there is CG in multiple places, It's hard to notice. The action sequences and opening scenes are seamless, crisp, and sleek. It's made to be seen on the big screen.Rupert Sanders takes liberties in some areas but this film is mostly faithful to that of the 1995 film. I wish the film had an R rating just because I think more could have been accomplished in this universe with a more mature rating. It's still perfectly fine as the films futuristic tones are so alluring. The film doesn't really drag anywhere and the concepts are thought provoking.There's really not many things I can think of that detract from this film. It's great however isn't phenomenal as a whole unit, which is perfectly fine. It's on par or slightly above with expectations. The film should have enough legs for a sequel though I'd rather this be a one off deal. Final thoughts, see this in the theaters as it's visually glorious.

Scarlett Johansson is heroic compassion as the human and mostly machine Major in Director Rupert Sanders's ""Ghost in the Shell"". ""Ghost in the Shell"" is the wonderful surprise that is both visually provocative action and the compelling existential exploration of humanity. Set in near futuristic Japan, cybernetic or robotic enhancements of humans are common place in the world. In this global incarnation Hanka Corporation is the technology leader seeking to change the world. Whether this change is for good is the real question?In the enthralling visual opening narrative scientists implant the residual human brain in the robotic 'shell' that becomes Johansson's Major. Composed of electronics and metal alloy, the beautiful Major emerges from the laboratory liquid pool of flesh and hair—nearly human. Johansson is awesome. She has this mesmerizing stillness even in the gate of her walk. She disposes villains with explosive martial arts excellence. Sanders wisely leverages close ups of Johansson, whose face in both the spoken and unspoken eloquently expresses courage and vulnerability. Johansson commands ""Ghost in the Shell"" as her own. Scarlett powerfully captures the emblematic paradox; her Major is more machine, than human in her search for her very humanity—her soul. She inspires as the hero discovering and defining herself. Her creators create and design her as the perfect soldier to combat the global terrorist threat. She confesses to her beloved creator caretaker Dr. Ouelet, played by poignant and strong Juliette Binoche, ""What I have is not real."" She speaks of her memories and her past. Dr. Ouelet tells her hero that it is not the memories you hold, ""It's what you do that defines you"" The screenplay by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger is based on the classic Manga by Masamune Shirow. This movie is also the reinvention of the 1995 Amine feature film. The 'ghost' is the remnant of soul implanted in the robotic or cybernetic 'shell'. Does the soul exist? One's design doesn't determine your purpose. Does the Major deserve to find love? I was happy that the search for the soul infused in this narrative, and that Johansson embodies the existential hero's purpose—discovering who she is. With brazen visual style the Major battles evil villains in literal pseudo-nakedness. Johansson is sexy, haunting, and isolated. This kind of symbolizes the stark lone nature of her very quest. As in the original Anime, the Major dramatically disrobes from her overcoat, then like the Dark Knight descends upon her evil prey. In a conflict arc the naked Major pummels the fleeing criminal in the rain filled pond, nearly killing. Her hulking fellow cyborg Batou, played by sarcastic but nurturing Pilou Asbaek, mercifully prevents her. The Major fights with calculated precision, and consumed rage. Since 'high-jacking' the program of a terrorist robot, the Major has bizarre images perhaps from her past. Is her dormant humanity emerging?This makes ""Ghost in the Shell"" compelling. Sanders's future Japan has the layered holographic feel of ""Blade Runner"" and the austere heroic night imagery of ""The Dark Knight"". The collective cyber- consciousness and virtual 'plug-ins' remind of ""The Matrix"". The Major discovering her inherent soul is amazing. Sanders falters a bit in the story arc when Johansson's Major talks with someone dear from her passed life. He is too restrained; he could have risked bringing us to tears. Poetically, he resolves this later in the Major's hero journey. After creating the Major, Machiavellian Hanka CEO Cutter, played by ruthlessly good Peter Ferdinado, transfers her to Section 9—the Government's elite anti-terrorist group. Section 9 is headed by the old and wise Aramaki, played with gravitas by Takeshi Kitnao. Batou becomes the Major's protector and friend, who may also be in love with her. Cutter distinguishes the Major as the revolutionary first of her kind. But is she the first? There are so many lies, including those surrounding the Major. The possible villain arises in cyber-enhanced Kuze, played by charismatic Michael Pitt. Section 9 and the Major investigates Kuze's murder of all those associated with 'Project 2571'—cloaked in secrecy. Perhaps, the Major was not the first? And the stories of her origins may be lies as well. The Major and Kuze's present and past may be tragically bound. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Ghost in the Shell"" for its visual style, thought provoking story, and entirely for Scarlett Johansson's performance. Her movie star presence transcends the character and the movie. I read and heard about the ""whitewashing"" in casting Scarlett instead of a Japanese actress as the Major. Johansson is amazing. The character of the Major is more machine, than human. ""The Ghost in the Shell"" is about the nature of the soul. Perhaps, the shape of your eyes has little to do with the quality of your soul. I say this as a Japanese American movie fan. The touching epilogue of ""Ghost in the Shell"" makes this perfectly clear. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is surprising and very gratifying.",Ghost in the Shell
99,RforFilm,Ghost in the Shell is better at looking like the anime rather then replicating it,5,4 April 2017,"Let's talk about anime. For those that don't know, anime is animation that is produced in Japan. What separates it from American animation is that while the craft is seen as family-based entertainment in the states, it is taken very seriously in Japan. It's hard to describe it on paper, but when you see stuff like Sailor Moon, Speed Racer, Cowboy Bebop (an all-time favorite of mine) and anything from Studio Ghibli, you'll see what I mean. This has been the same when it comes to full anime movies. This had led to a lot of Japanese movies that have even seen releases in the states like Akira, Pokémon: The First Movie, and the subject of today, Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 original film is seen not just as an excellent anime, but one of the best-animated movies in general. It's themes of artificial intelligence, computer hacking, and blurring the line between human and robots were perfect to explore as the mid nineties had seen a growth in computer usage. A live action adaptation could potentially work, but the track record of American remakes of anime has been bad (Speed Racer and Dragonball: Evolution being such). Let's see if the new Ghost in the Shell can break that curse. In the near future in Japan, Major Killian (played by Scarlett Johansson) is a cyborg with a human brain after her original body was destroyed beyond repair and was chosen in an experiment by Hanka Robotics to put her mind into a mechanical body. Now she works for Section 9, an anti- terrorist bureau whose mission is to stop major hacking. She's really good at her job, but experiences occasional visions that her maker dismisses as glitches. With the help of her second in command Batou (played by Pilou Asbæk), the city seems safe,During one mission, they stop a terrorist attack at a Hanka business conference. They use a destroyed rouge robot to find out that the perpetrator is a hacker named Kuze. Though they manage to catch to garbage men who worked for him, they find that little is known about Kuze. The race is on the clock to find him, only for Major to start considering more about her life before becoming a cop as she does not remember any of it. I'll clarify now that this does not follow the 1995 original movie, but rather Ghost in the Shell adapts elements from it's TV series and manga source to tell something original. This one adapts more of an identity finding story along with the notion of stopping a terrorist. The good news is that the story is goodfor a while. Also like the 1995 original, this can get heavy within it's own world. I started losing interest about halfway in when I was starting to lose track on what the goals were. This I blame on the acting of Scarlet Johansson, who I normally love in other movies, but she is so wooden. Taking the whitewashing controversy out of it, I'd still say the performance wouldn't have worked due to the directing of Rupert Sanders.The film seems to be better at directing the world around our heroes as it looks really cool. A lot of people will probably say that it's a lot like Blade Runner, but consider that it's been a while since we've seen something like this. The action scenes also do a good job recreating scenes from the anime while adding in some stylized fighting. Another problem however is that its 2017. We've gotten a lot of movies about computer hacking and AI identity (such as The Matrix series, A.I., Ex Machina), so what's this version of Ghost in the Shell going to add? Much of the deep philosophy from the anime is removed and what is kept seems a bit redundant and feels like has been said before. I'll give this five anime pictures of Major out of ten. Ghost in the Shell works better as an action movie when not comparing it to the original. I'd still say watch the anime, but you might get something out of this if your just looking for action. This adaptation is a lot like a cyborg; looks good, but lacks little humanity under the surface.",Ghost in the Shell

102,dave-mcclain,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is visually stunning, exciting and deep.",8,31 March 2017,"Like many big budget Hollywood productions these days, 2017's sci-fi actioner ""Ghost in the Shell"" (PG-13, 1:47) comes from a long and diverse background. The title was originally inspired by the phrase ""the Ghost in the Machine"", which was 20th century British philosopher Gilbert Ryle's derisive description of 17th century French philosopher René Descartes' concept of mind-body dualism. From Ryle's phrase arose the Japanese entertainment franchise ""Ghost in the Machine"". Originally a seinen manga series (comics targeted at adolescent boys and young men) that appeared in 1989, the comics were adapted into a 1995 feature film (which reportedly helped inspire ""The Matrix""), followed be several other films, a television series and video games. The American live-action adaptation is clearly designed for wider international appeal and features a diverse cast, but has been criticized for ""whitewashing"" because of casting a white actress (Scarlett Johansson) in the lead role of this Japanese property (although many Japanese, including the director of the original anime films, said that this was a non-issue). Besides all that, this film also seems influenced by the visuals, mood and plot of films like ""The Terminator"" (1984), ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Minority Report"" (2002) and the ""Bourne"" series, but with an identity all its own.In the future (in mid-21st century Japan, according to the manga, even though the film is less specific), technology allows for the enhancement of human beings with cybernetic limbs and organs so they can function better and live longer but it doesn't stop there. Science has now gotten to the point where a human brain can be placed in a completely cybernetic body, allowing for the creation of a virtually indestructible super soldier with human intelligence and sensibilities (which, by the way, can be technologically manipulated too). Major Mira Killian is the first of her kind – the first completely successful implantation of a human brain into an artificial body (and a very shapely one at that – covered only with a skin tight silver/grey spandex-looking suit). Sure, Major has to regularly take medicine to keep her human brain from rejecting her manufactured body, she sometimes experiences disturbing and unexplained memory glitches and she wishes she could remember more of her past than the story of childhood tragedy she has been told (and she wishes she knew what it was to feel), but, hey, she's a Hanka Corporation success story and the Hanka CEO (Peter Ferdinando) wants more just like her.The action takes place in a crowded cosmopolitan city with unusual-looking buildings, bright lights of many different colors and giant holograms of people doing various activities (which aren't explained, but are probably some form of futuristic advertising campaigns.) Major leads a team called Section 9, which includes an enhanced human named Batou (Danish actor Pilou Asbæk) and which finds and neutralizes the criminals that ordinary law enforcement can't handle. Under the supervision of Chief Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano) and with Dr. Ouélet (Juliette Binoche) and her high-tech machinery ""healing"" Major when a mission gets too physical, the whole thing is working like a well-oiled machine (or well-programmed computer) until mysterious hacker Hideo Kuze (Michael Pitt) shows up. Kuze seems to know more, be more elusive and more determined than most criminals. He's killing Hanka scientists – and repeatedly leaving behind a cryptic holographic warning, ""Collaborate with Hanka robotics and be destroyed!"" Even as Major pursues Kuze, she's wondering if that statement is a threat... or a warning.""Ghost in the Shell"" is visually stunning, exciting and deep. The images that director Rupert Sanders (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") put on screen are almost too much to take in, but it's a lot of fun to try and you can't help but marvel at their Oscar-worthy quality. The assembled work of screenwriters Jamie Moss (""Street Kings""), William Wheeler (""The Lego Ninjago Movie"", ""Queen of Katwe"") and Ehren Kruger (three of the ""Transformers"" movies, ""Arlington Road"") combine to give us an interesting story and a few moments of reflection about what it means to be human and the nature of reality. The diverse cast fits together well, without a weak link, and Johansson is so good that I can almost forgive her for 2014's utterly ridiculous sci-fi actioner ""Lucy"". Johansson's 2017 enhanced character actually makes some sense – and is much more interesting to watch – and the movie is much more fun. You should check it out. I mean, you might as well, before the inevitable sequels. Regardless, this one makes for an enjoyable two hours at the movies. ""A-""",Ghost in the Shell
103,joebloggscity,Is the 'Ghost' still here in this remake?,5,1 April 2017,"The original was a seminal film, and so hugely influential to many in the arts. I'm a major devotee of the original (and have watched it countless times), and this is the third incarnation of this film (I'm including the redux version), so it was always going to be hard to see this as a stand-alone. It was inevitable that this would be marked against its peers, and meant a hiding to nothing for the creators.From the off, it's clear that they decided to not play it safe, but opted for a loose recreation of the original, preferring instead to make their own parallel storyline which little seems to mirror the originals. That is a major loss in this case, and what was most celebrated about the first movie was its existential arc (which was like an extension of what Blade Runner had been attempting). I don't even think the existentialism that is even in this film matches the original's attempts in any way.This film instead relies on the action and special effects, and even though the action is enjoyable, it's the philosophical touches that made the original interesting. They even cut out the realpolitik and espionage stories which were intriguing in the first film. In reflection there were many strands in the first film that have not been carried over.The action and special effects are good, but in this day and age of CGI it has been much copied since the original came out long back. You even just need to see the opening credits of the recent 'Westworld' TV series to see where it got its influences from this film.The backdrops, the meandering flights through the cityscapes and the academic dialogues. All that seems to be lost (although the city views in this are still beautiful). Granted the makers of this version wanted a more accessible movie, but a bit of courage would have meant that they could still have kept those elements listed to introduce the universe to the viewers, and then expand on them in later films (this should have had the legs for further).As for the choice of actors, the 'white-washing' furore has been covered in detail heavily already by many others, and I do sympathise with it. Regardless, even without that charge, I just don't feel that some of the actors fitted their roles well, and some of the newer characters were poor. The chief was nothing like he was in the original but more just Takeshi Kitano, and I'm not sure that Cutter was anything but a 'Robocop' style cut-out corporate executive villain.I could say more, but best leave it there.As a standalone it's not a bad movie, and has points to commend it for, BUT it's not a standalone movie. It has the uncomfortable act of following on from a well watched and respected anime classic. It very much misses the mark for me.Many who are watching this without having first known or seen the original will likely accept this more than those who have watched the original. We'll just have to lump it, but if you did like this version then please take my advice and check out the original, you'll be blown away by it.",Ghost in the Shell
104,agmoldham,Thought provoking,4,12 April 2017,"On the way into Ghost in the Shell I was in a discussion about movie budgets. It seems sensible that if you have more money to spend on film production it would make for a better movie. It is very arguable if this is true and sometimes it even seems that some films would be better with a lower budget. I certainly think Ghost in the Shell would have been a much better movie with a smaller budget. This would have forced the focus away from the visuals in favour of the storyline and script. The concept of Ghost in the Shell is both very interesting and timely. The brain of a person is captured and integrated into a robot. The robot in question is Major played by Scarlett Johansson who seems to play a lot of roles in a catsuit for some reason. Whilst the concept is very interesting and something that will no doubt be possible in the future the plot is dull. I suppose some people may find the endless shots of the future cityscape entertaining, but it seemed rather pointless and irrelevant.",Ghost in the Shell
105,swilliky,Wasted opportunity for iconic Japanese Sci-fi Franchise,5,31 March 2017,"The live-action version of the popular anime was beset by controversy nearly a year before the film came out with the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Motoko Kusanagi aka Major. I went into the film with pretty low expectations after reading several articles and lots of posts about the controversy and the issue of whitewashing in films and found the film to be interesting visually but mediocre overall. Some of the action was entertaining but nothing that stands out that couldn't be seen in a more intelligent film and no great plot or philosophy to help propel the story along.Major is a rebuilt human from just a brain and sent to work for a government anti-terrorism unit called Section 9. There is some back story delivered by Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) about how her family was murdered by terrorists on a refugee boat that drives her to hunt down criminals. Her most recent assignment is to attack the hacker Kuze (Michael Pitt) who uses some cool looking Geisha robots to attack a leader of the Hanka corporation, the same corporation that built Major and sold her to the government.

107,bob-the-movie-man,A robot you could take home to meet mother,6,30 April 2017,"Scarlett Johansson is a stunning actress, with unquestionably a stunning figure that she loves to show off, but you would have to start questioning her film choices: since there is hardly a hair's breadth between the emotionally reserved superhero depiction here and her recent roles in ""Lucy"" and ""Under the Skin"". With her other ongoing ""Avengers"" superhero work as Natasha Romanoff, and nothing much else beyond that other than brief cameos (""Hail Caesar"", ""Hitchcock"") and voice work, its all getting a bit 'samey': I'd like to see her get back to her more dramatic roles like ""Lost in Translation"" that really launched her career.Anyhoo, back to this flick. Set in the dazzling fictional Japanese city of Niihama, Johansson plays a terrorist victim saved only by having her brain transplanted into an android by the Hanka corporation. In this time (40 years in the future) human 'upgrades' with cybernetic technology are commonplace, but Major is a 'first of a kind' experiment. Hanka are not pure humanitarians though, since they have turned Major into a lethal fighting weapon with powers of invisibility and lightning reactions. She works for a shadowy anti- terrorism unit called Section 9, led by the Japanese speaking Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano, ""Battle Royale"").The upside of having no human form is that if you get burned or blown up, the team of cyber-surgeons back at Hanka, led by Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche), can rebuild her - - they ""have the technology"" to quote another bionic hero.But all is not necessarily well in the idyll of anti-terrorist slashing and burning. Major suffers from recurring 'glitches' of memories from her past life: a life that she has no clear memories of. Her latest mission against a deformed and vindictive terrorist called Kuze (Michael Pitt) progressively resurfaces more of these memories, since Kuze clearly knows more about Major than she does.""Ghost in the Shell"" looks glorious, with the Hong Kong-like city being in the style of Blade Runner but with more holograms. (What exactly the holograms are supposed to be doing or advertising is rather unclear!). The cinematography and special effects deserve an Oscar nomination. Given the film is based on an original Manga series, written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow and well known for its complexity, this Hollywood version has a surprisingly simple and linear story. As such it may disappoint the hoard of fans who adore the original materials.Treating it as a standalone film, it should have an emotional depth beyond the superficial action, dealing as it does with loyalty and family ties. However, the scripting and editing is rather pedestrian making the whole thing a bit dull. Johansson and Pilou Asbæk, as her co-worker Batou, breathe what life they can into the material; but Binoche is less convincing as the Dr Frankenstein-style doctor. The best act in the piece though is Takeshi Kitano as the kick-ass OAP with attitude. Where I had particular issues was in some of the detail of the action. 'Invisibility' is an attribute that needs to be metered out very carefully in the movies: Harry Potter just about got away with it; in ""Die Another Day"" it nearly killed the Bond franchise for good. Here, exactly how the androids can achieve invisibility is never explained and I disliked that intently. Similarly, the androids can clearly be physically damaged, yet Major seems to start each mission by throwing herself headfirst off the tallest skyscraper. Again, never explained. Even though the premise, and the opening titles, brought back bad memories of that truly terrible Star Trek episode ""Spock's Brain"", this is a dark and thoughtful adaptation with great CGI effects but unfortunately its pedestrian pace means it is one that never truly breaks through into the upper echelons of Sci Fi greatness.

Set in the near future, Scarlet Johansson is 'Major' who has died and has her conscience (the ghost) transferred to a cyborg body (the shell), she is the first to have her brain transferred into an entirely synthetic body. 'Major' becomes a member of an anti-terror group and is ready to be called into action, but there's something more sinister going on. She explores whether she has a soul or whether just a machine, she has flash-backs that make her question her humanity (sounds too familiar?). There's a reoccurring theme of ownership and consent. She tries to put right what the corporation (that made her) has done to her (also too familiar?!)The visual effects are breathtaking, but even this looks familiar and a little cliché now.

111,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,6 August 2017,"I didn't watch the original anime film. The truth is, even if this is a remake, it should stand on its own with no needed comparisons to the original, something I usually don't quite follow (I tend to watch the original film in order to understand better the remake, reboot, live-action adaptation, whatever). However, I do know about the huge influence that Ghost in the Shell (1995) had on great movies from the past and I also understand that it's one of the best anime movies ever made, based on most fans and critics' opinions.With that in mind, this version of Ghost in the Shell it's definitely far from that. Its story goes from interesting and captivating to a boring, slow-paced film with surprisingly just ""ok"" action scenes. The concept of the whole film is really something amazing: Major searching for answers (does she have a soul? Is she human? Is she a cyborg? Are there more like her or is she really different?) and the visually stunning world (that's definitely where the budget went to) are key elements to the film ... In concept ... Execution-wise, well, not that much.Scarlett Johansson does a great job and her character has a compelling backstory, as well as Kuze (Michael Pitt), who I think could have been more explored. Batou (Pilou Asbaek) is also a great side-character and an excellent partner for Major, I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with them together (action-wise and not). The soundtrack is what astound me the most, it's really memorable and I have it on my Spotify playlist already. It's amazing.The big problem with this film is its execution. Rupert Sanders isn't able to moderate the pacing with the character development scenes, therefore a dull, boring and uneventful second act comes to life. The action that the trailers show are really the best that the movie has since the rest is super choppy. I don't understand how an actress as Scarlett Johansson, who does most of her own stunts and choreography in the Marvel universe, isn't able to perform a sequence without dozens of cuts between (bad director?).Furthermore, the ""villain"" feature of the movie isn't that great either. They try to put up a twist at the beginning of the third act and switch things a bit ... It didn't work. I can't really go in detail, but it's a failed try to boost up the film and end it with a thrilling finale.All in all, Ghost in the Shell has an excellent concept that is badly executed. The story itself is interesting and deserves the beautifully captured CGI that gives birth to a whole new stunning world, as well as the amazing soundtrack. Scarlett Johansson is as compelling as her character (I honestly don't understand what's the ""whitewash"" problem that Hollywood keeps trying to fault movies for) and the supporting cast also does a great job. Execution-wise, the movie faults due to its slow-pace which brings the whole film down to an extremely boring second act. The action is disappointingly directed and the villain should have been a lot better.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Ghost in the Shell

Based on the manga/anime of the same name, this film fails to engage the audience's interest, despite its interesting subject matter and influential source material.In the not-too-distant future, human beings are now able to be enhanced with robotic parts to help them with various daily tasks. One such human, Major (Scarlett Johansson), is reinforced with cybernetics to become the perfect soldier by the Hanka Robotics organisation. With these new upgrades, the organisation uses Major to hunt down cyber- criminals wreaking havoc across the city of Tokyo.Taken on its own, it is a mediocre action film but when compared to its original source material, it is a failed adaptation. The film's bland script and poorly paced direction does little to immerse the audience in the story. Occasionally there will be a decent action scene, but it feels like it is only there to prod the viewer awake after a tedious moment of exposition. Whitewashing controversy aside, Scarlett Johansson is decent in the lead role, but that is not saying much when compared to how flat and uninteresting every other character is in the film. The one thing that this film does particularly well is the visuals. The sprawling, Blade Runner-esque city of Tokyo is indeed nice to look at, but the film barely shows enough of it to leave a lasting impression. If this is the future for Hollywood adaptations of manga/anime, then I'm not too excited.I rate it 4.5/10",Ghost in the Shell

At all not the fan of the Japanese culture, I don't understand. It was interesting to me Ghost in the Shell was only because it is the real cyberpunk who is guided by the reference. And the movie has caused full disappointment. Or picturized badly, or it is the Japanese style. But the same Blade Runner 2049 looks a cut above. In Ghost in the Shell characters don't manage to reveal, history too trivial and boring. The world around is registered not up to the end. A lot of things stay behind scenes. It is a pity that the movie was such mediocre cyberpunk, even the fine game Scarlett Johansson hasn't saved.",Ghost in the Shell
118,CANpatbuck3664,Tons of Visual Style but Lacks Emotional Stakes,5,9 April 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin with a nice montage about how the body of the Major (Scarlett Johansson) was created and how her brain was transplanted into it. Once she survives the operation, her designer Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) and the CEO of Hanka Robotics Mr. Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) are arguing over her purpose. Dr. Ouelet wants more time for her to acclimate but the Major represents a significant investment for Hanka and Cutter insists she be assigned to Section 9 immediately. Section 9 is a special division for hunting terrorists, considering the Major's backstory, it's something she should be personally interested in.I think that most people who were excited for this movie were either fans of the manga for Ghost in the Shell or the animated movie that carried the same name. I was familiar with neither so when I talk about the story in Ghost in the Shell, I can only talk about it from that perspective. I can see why people love this property, there was the concept for an epic sci-fi adventure here. The problem is that the way they present the Major's story in this movie, it feels so cold and without emotion. It may not be the nicest thing to say but we have seen similar stories in film done so many times in other movies. Even if this was the original property that most of the later stories copied, its been done so many times that it felt rehashed.The movie wants you to care about characters like The Major or Bantou or Aramaki but you don't get much time with them or learn intimate details about them that you probably need to know. The movie almost expects you to bring your connection from previous material so you'll feel for their struggle. Coming into this completely fresh, I didn't have that relationship with the story so the movie didn't grab at me emotionally. The characterization is pretty weak here and it feels like the deeper meaning of this material was sacrificed for the visual sensibility of Ghost in the Shell and the action.Sometimes when you can't stay interested in the plot, the acting will compensate and help bring you back. This wasn't the case here. I don't think any of the main cast flat-out sucked but they didn't elevate the movie past its plot issues. Scarlett Johannson is normally one of the best A-list actresses working but I didn't think she delivered her typically excellent work. I get she's a robot and her characterization was lacking but she was still so wooden that I couldn't attach myself to the Major. Pilou Asbaek was fine, the part of the movie that interested me the most was his friendship with the Major but again, it was left relatively unexplored. Takeshi Kitano was also decent but he doesn't get much screen time, he's also the only central character that speaks Japanese when everyone speaks English which was weird. Juliette Binoche didn't really sell her part for me, her character arc was really predictable. Michael Carmen Pitt actually seemed to have the most committed performance but he gets very little time and the movie assumes you care more about his character than you actually end up doing.I've done a lot of complaining about this movie, I think its time I threw it a couple of bones. Rupert Sanders has a background in special effects and he really shows that in Ghost in the Shell. It is the most impressive part of the movie. The attention to detail is impressive and the holographic world he builds up always has some neat visual trick up its sleeve. My favourite scene was where the Major decided to hack the geisha bot and she transports herself into the robot's mind. The action largely functions properly too, there were times that the CGI looked a little rough but they definitely got the job done.I'm not trying to provoke fans of this property, I can only judge this movie. This movie had visual style to burn and some solid action set pieces but it glosses over some of the most essential parts of making a great movie. Ghost in the Shell comes off as bland and a little boring once you move past how pretty it is. Fans of the manga and the animated movie deserved better than this. This movie wasn't downright awful but unless you're a fan, you can probably skip this.",Ghost in the Shell
119,Littleman95,An... Adaptation?,4,5 March 2021,"Very low in every side, really. Totally not recommanded, I recommend you the anime movie, not this... mess.

120,PyroSikTh,"Dulled Down High Concept, but still Enjoyable Action Sci-fi",7,5 April 2017,"Major is a breakthrough in cybernetics, in a futuristic world where cybernetic enhancements are commonplace. Humans and robots are often indistinguishable due to the over-enhancements many humans have, and the life-like resemblance of robots. Major though, as said, is a breakthrough in that field, being the first successful marriage of human brain and entirely cybernetic body. The company she was made for regards her a weapon, and she lacks any memory of her previous life before the incident, beyond a few meaningless 'glitches' she suffers. Her latest assignment has her on the tail of a cybernetic terrorist who's attacking her company's scientists and is proving particularly difficult to find.While Ghost in the Shell ends up being a fairly regular tale of stolen identity, as Major slowly begins to uncover who she was before, there are subtle references to something deeper. The lines between man and machine are well and truly blurred, and while the movie doesn't make a big point of it, it certainly flirts with the idea. For instance, they catch an accomplice and in the interrogation learn that he's had his mind wiped and false memories installed remotely. His brain has been, quite literally, hacked from an outside source. He's human, but his brain is a machine like any CPU, just made of organic matter rather than wiring.My biggest complaint about Ghost in the Shell though is that these ideas are only hinted at and flirted with. They're never given much focus or developed much. Even in the movie we got, I could tell there was more between scenes that had been cut for whatever reason. Major has a tender moment with a prostitute, touching and examining her face, but it's never given much weight and is never touched upon again. When Major goes to investigate her past, a nice elder lady just lets her into her home and offers her tea without cause or reason to. She's apprehended by the company, but she doesn't put up any kind of fight and just lets them take her. In each of these instances it feels like there was more there, more motive, development and reason behind what we see, but are never shown. As such, the movie feels like it's over as soon as it's started. The big climax at the end feels less like a climax and more as build-up to the climax, giving the end a little bit of an unsatisfactory edge.Visually, Ghost in the Shell is top-notch, full of lots of little details that bring the world to life. It does a great job of not just presenting a futuristic world, but offering a particular view of a futuristic world. It mirrors sci-fi movies from the 80s and 90s, and what their view of the future was, more than ours. For instance all the cars are modded sports cars from the 80s and 90s, like you would see in those kinds of movies back then. Even fashions and hairstyles have that almost future-90s look. In this regard, I can only assume that Ghost in the Shell is at least very visually faithful to the original, while also looking good enough for modern audiences. Despite the deliberately dated aesthetic, I definitely got a whiff of the Total Recall and Robocop remakes in it's presentation.Of course the quality is thousand-fold. The cityscapes are breathtaking, full of imaginative, holographic advertisements jumping out from buildings and walls, roads are interconnected highways full of 'futuristic' looking cars, and the robotics themselves are perfection of design and execution. WETA did a great job in creating animatronics for much of the robotics, to give them a truly robotic appearance rather than just falling back on CGI, and Ghost in the Shell's visual quality benefits from this greatly.The music deserves mention as well. Clint Mansell's score is deep and rich in sonic quality, giving the film's music it's own identity. He manages to blend typical orchestration effortlessly with sweeping synths and booming sub-bass that feels both typical and new. I'm genuinely quite disappointed I can't find the score anywhere to re-live. The soundtrack contains various similarly electronic tracks as well though, including a remix of the original theme into dubstep. Not sure I'm a fan of it, but I'm not sure I particularly like the original theme either. Tricky, DJ Shadow, and Gary Numan offer great subtle tracks though (although I can't particularly place them in the movie).Ghost in the Shell is a worthy addition to Hollywood's latest crop of sci-fi remakes. While this is absolutely an unpopular opinion, I've enjoyed almost all of them, and Ghost in the Shell is no different. My biggest criticism is simply that it was too short. There's so much going on that some of the more interesting elements got left behind in favour of a tighter run time, and this does hurt it a little bit. I give Ghost in the Shell an enjoyable, but unrevolutionary 7/10.",Ghost in the Shell
121,nikola17,Don't let the Animation Fans let you hate this movie,10,11 April 2017,"come on what the fans are expect for i mean i never expect the fans to hate this film, i thought this was so related to Animation i have watched Animation Ghost in Shell and (1995)does live action film based on anything has to make a huge flop anyone explain and movie shamefully Since the release of the movie last week in the U.S. it has not only bombed at the box office but will also lose around $60 million what are shame this movie stupid thing i have heard somewhere is that Failed Because It Did Not Understand Its Source Material meaning ? what they made it something that is not related something to Animation give me a break fans and everyone i have seen Animation but this become something different the story the style of film they got everything from original film and Animation shows but never understand what fans bushed this film into ashes, never understood if you like or love this movie let you know never let anyone change your mind or make you force to this hate movie to make you check out Animation first, but in this live action is a lot better its still noting wrong with film i enjoyed Scarlett Johansson She suited for Her character she really looks Animation character Mira Killian / Motoko Kusanagi but Margot Robbie. On October 16, it was announced that DreamWorks had made a $10 million offer to Scarlett Johansson for the lead role after Robbie's talks for the role fell apart when she was cast as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. in my opinion she would suit for her i would say for Margot more in suicide squad then this if she toke role for this movie i would have said it wont suit her at all, scarlett was more better for her own role for this movie as major the action was SO great specially scene at building was great and club scene and all rest of action is so enjoyable and watchable film 1h 47min running time its perfect in my opinion this film didn't do any justice, this film has made it just like original 95 film just like but with different story line The atmosphere, effects, music and aesthetics are stunningly beautiful! You can still feel the heart and soul of Ghost in the Shell. The story is there - slightly changed but still thought provoking. There are many scenes where you can really see the amount of work that was put into making this movie - tiny details in the background noting like 95 film, the aura of Hong Kong and other locations where this film was shot and just the overall look and feel.and different way of film plot the way it follows, there wasn't much punching holes in film there wasn't much of confusing scenes makes you wanna ask questions, you need to watch this movie i don't want to spoil it When it comes to getting high IMDb ratings this movie was already destined to fail just because it is an anime adaptation of a highly beloved nineties classic. rotten tomatoes got %46 witch is still good not like batman vs superman got 26 that is still bit high but this is much higher film then that. This is NOT the original film, this is its own film that you need to appreciate as it stands (I know that is difficult, believe me). If you haven't already seen it, please take my word for it and go in with no expectations, go in cold (like it is a new experience). go and see it if not go and see it, i understand for fans its not what they dreamed off but hey i am not saying its for everyone but give it a go its movie its not a big deal.the cast as i said scarlett suits for this role she was perfect she was great character i loved her in this movie a lot more then Lucy but hey its my opinion what to like her character, character of Lucy is bit different to this film. everyone and me i said maybe Ron perlman could play Batou i thought he be in it but it ended up Scarlett had played role with (pilou asbæk) in Lucy he was just in opening scene of Lucy (2014) strange. he was very good as Batou good but i rather have Ron perlman being Batou better suits for him a lot more for his role. plot In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: A human saved from a terrible crash, who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier (Scarlett Johansson) devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. and Batou kicked a lot ass sametime with Major a lot great action never lost faith with original film made a lot different but in live action film never wanted ruin any plot you need to see it Seeing a 6.9 as the current user score (as of 30 March) is unfortunate, because this film captures EVERYTHING that Ghost in the Shell was and thanks to this film IS CURRENTLY. As a film it stands strong in the Sci-Fi genre and does manage to still be thought-provoking. Please take your time before giving it a low rating or hating this film, movie goes on its own. if fans and everyone understand little bit better before you hate this flick, this flick is awesome 10.10 great flick go see it, its worth it",Ghost in the Shell
122,blackmamba99971,First time around is always the best,5,5 April 2017,"This is the first re-done film that I have marked with a five star rating. Ghost in the shell... a story of Kusanagi Makoto, who was a first of her kind Cyborg with an artificial body that houses her real brain. Assigned different tasks to keep order in the city of Neo-Tokyo the Major as she is called heads up a team of ex-soldiers or policemen designated Section 9. Her chief Daisuki Aramaki is her employer, and boss but has hardly enough pull unless it comes from the Prime minister himself if something were to go wrong with the Major or section 9.This re-make was by any standards a let down. Now before I go into details let me say that it was a good attempt. Yet this film could have used Japanese Characters since it is Japanese oriented. Since the last film Scarlet Johanssen did called Lucy it was safe to assume that she could play an emotionless cyborg in this movie. But many things about it were off. First there was never memory gaps even with the animated character. If they stuck to the original content this film would have done much better at the box office.Second... introducing Batou before his eyes were taken from him from an explosion was another mistake. He was in fact blinded during his career as a special forces officer and not in some sting operation in the live action version, which is portrayed here. If they used a flash back insert then the audience would have accepted that more. Third... although this movie was a nice pretext from the animated version I was highly disappointed that Kenji Kawai's hauntingly poetic introduction music was not included to kick off the film until the very end of the movie. The INTRO was THE most important factor to the entire film even with a second portion of its poetic tale during its showing where the major and her fellow section 9 team tries to unravel the mystery about who is Cyber-attacking the city.One of the most fundamental aspects about doing a live action from animation version is that fans from around the world will nit pick, and autopsy a movie to the letter. Not having Kawai's music playing through the film was the worst move that Rupert Sanders did. It was supposed to be a cerebral trip through wonderland but all we got was a highly decorative back drop of eye candy billboards amidst electronic neon playgrounds and floating fish. Even the animated version had next to none of that. The city was supposed to have a gritty, dark and dirty atmosphere in the slums while the elite fed off the poor from on up high.All in all, a nice attempt but very predictable in many areas. We did not need the memory story. We needed the real story of why the major had so many attempts on her life not some catch up tale of a daughter finding her mommy which coincided with another cyborg's life that inevitably clashes together as some coincidence. Five out of ten stars. For me that is as the best I can do for this film. Unless someone out there really studies this plot, and the Manga comics before attempting to put it into a live action film, then don't bother.",Ghost in the Shell
123,stevenrotherforth,"Sadly it's too little, too late",7,11 February 2018,"Ghost in the shell (2017)The adaptation of the popular anime title of the same name. The live action version of Ghost in the shell seems to have arrived late to the party.
A visually stunning piece of cinema which looks to have borrowed from every Sci-Fi classic made in the last thirty years or so.
This couldn't be further from the truth when in fact it is many a movie that has actually took inspiration from Shrirow Masamune's work.This live action version on face value looks wonderful but it sadly lacks depth and the storyline soon descends into the norm with a Robocop 2 -esque finale.
Speaking of Robocop there are hints and nods to that movie throughout. Or should that be the other way around?
Unless you are a fan of Anime and Manga then like me you won't be familiar with this films premise.
This has allowed many mainstream Sci-fi script writers to capitalise on Ghost in the shells extensive imagery and boundless concepts.The story tells of Major, seemingly the first of her kind. A human brain united with a complete robotic frame.
Enhanced to be the perfect soldier. A soul trapped in a manufactured shell struggling to find what it is to be human again.
Sounds familiar doesn't it?Scarlett Johansson gives a solid performance but it is sad that the movie scores as somewhat above average considering that the source material is so rich with creativity.
The opening titles of this movie accompanied by a wonderfully haunting score trick the audience into believing that they are going to witness something truly special.
Sadly after the films title is displayed the movie fails to deliver.
By no means is Ghost in the shell a bad movie.
It's maybe that my expectations were a little too high.
I have elevated my original score from six to seven out of ten after numerous rewatches.
It is a movie made to showcase a good HDR TV.
It's easy watching too.
The actual problem with this film is that it has indeed arrived too late and by doing so it doesn't bring anything extra to the party.
We've all seen it before and no amount of 4K HDR glitz thrown at the screen can polish over this fact.The Blade runner style visuals are pleasing on the eye but there's too much style over substance. Blade runner 2049 did it better!
I for one must check out the original anime version of the story to fully appreciate Masamunes work.I can't say I didn't get enjoyment from this movie because I did. The sight of Johansson dispatching bad guys at first glance to be totally naked is worth the price of the Blu-ray alone.
It's a stunning looking film. One that will get Home Cinema nerds salavating at their UHD screens.A shame then that overall judged solely as a movie it is too little too late.",Ghost in the Shell
124,p-jonsson,Okay but that's it,6,29 August 2017,"This is an okay movie but that is about it. The blurb sounded quite interesting and the trailers were promising even though I always take trailers with a huge pinch of salt. I have never read the original Manga. Whether that is good or bad with respect to the movie I do not know.The good stuff as far as this movie is concerned is, not surprisingly, the visuals. I would not say that they are stunning but the are quite good. The environments are interesting and the special effects are not bad at all. I have to say that the tank design was pretty poor though. Not very exiting as a fictional design and utter nonsense from a functional point of view.This is as far as the good stuff goes. The story is okay but it is pretty predictable and not that much to get exited about. It could have been more developed for sure. I would actually have liked to see the Major do a few more missions beating up the bad guys. That was where the movie shined a bit and showed the best visuals and special effects.The acting is pretty mediocre to be honest. Even Daisuke Aramaki, which was a character that I did like, felt rather bland. The main bad guy was just a uninspiring thug.To me the movie more or less felt like the pilote episode of a TV- show with a huge budget for visuals. It was not WOW god but showed promise and I felt like I would like to see more ""episodes"". The fact that it is actually a movie and it seems unlikely that a sequel, even though the ending makes it pretty clear that they hoped there would be one, will be made left me with a unsatisfied feeling.Bottom line, average movie with enjoyable visuals and special effects but one which do not manage to reach above the ""just another sci-fi manga movie"" segment for me.",Ghost in the Shell
125,James_De_Bello,5.5/10,5,4 April 2017,"After being victim of a terrible terrorist attack, Mina (Scarlet Johansson) wakes up in a body that doesn't belong to her (shell). Her brain has been transplanted into a completely synthetic body, making her the first example in human history of her kind. She is then employed by the government to stop the world's most dangerous criminals, one of which starts to arouse an identity crisis in her.I have never been exposed to this story having never read the original comic nor seen the original anime, my take on this story was completely new and fresh. Whilst it hasn't left much of an impact in me to further any knowledge on this mythology, it still left me fascinated enough by its world to have a decent time at the theater.Whilst many have defined this film as visually spectacular I take issue with that definition, especially if assigned to this film. ""Ghost in the Shell"" has many things going for it, but I guarantee you that visually stunning isn't one of those. The editing and cinematography of the picture are quite unfocused and pretty much follow the rhythm of many generic blockbusters. Sanders might have a great eye for design and world building, but he has a really hard time in deciding when to cut and how to progress the visual grammar.The story is pretty derivative (I understand it is an older story, but in modern day there is no fresh update) and many elements in it feel derivative too, many of the gimmicks employed in the action scenes and the story beats feel very familiar. And over this familiarity Sanders builds a film that doesn't have much style to spare. He doesn't have the bravery to hold on certain shots, to cut with thriftiness. The action scenes have no grit or tension to them, they are assembled with generic cuts and slow-mo. There are no breathtaking shots or ingeniously choreographed sequences that make the world built in the film stand out. At no point does the film manage to gather intensity and make realize you are clutching your seat tightly.Sanders does have a good touch for character but he struggles in giving the feature an original or fresh touch, there is no style applied to the story: many elements try to come into the picture, but almost none of them manage to have much relevance. The electronic score never manages to find its place, the cyber punk undertones never stick out as interesting, there is no unity to how the sequences are built, each one has a different rhythm and it all ends up feeling like pretty CGI and random editing.Fortunately the packaging of the whole movie overall isn't in anyway terrible or void of interesting ideas. Firstly the cast is well chosen and whilst the relevant characters are five at best they all manage to stick out and make an impression. They all have a dynamic that's personal to them and that evolves through the film's structure. It also suits that all the actors mold into the world seamlessly and give us performances that manage to make this world's implications and ideas grounded and believable.The design and art direction of the film also help it incredibly in making an impact on the viewer. As I said before some of it might be derivative and the references or quotes of ""Blade Runner"" might be a little too many, but there is so much going on and so many characters and places that it is hard not to be somewhat enchanted by them. It helps that the CGI and the practical effects work together beautifully here and just as in his last feature Sanders excels in making a polished picture with unnoticeable CGI and solid effects work all around.""Ghost in the Shell"" sadly fails as a medium to introduce worldwide audiences to anime and manga by not imprinting any style or freshness to the Sci-Fi genre, favoring a traditional and unfortunately bland aesthetic in the editing of the picture, but it sure has enough pop to spare for at least making an impression.",Ghost in the Shell

127,coreyjdenford,More Shell than Ghost,6,30 March 2017,"This review of Ghost in the Shell is spoiler free*** (3/5)GHOST IN THE Shell isn't the first in line for an anime to be given the live-actionification process Attack on Titan which was released in 2015, and also there is going to be Akira to be given the live-action bump up when it comes out of the deep development hell that it's been in for more than a decade now. It's been almost two decades since Maromu Oshii's excellent original was released and since then there have been several other movies and a couple of TV movie exclusives, it's fair that the spirit of the anime has lived on for a long time, and given this revamp the spirit still lives.However there's nothing new here, there are no new ideas everything has been done before, it follows a formula and keeps that going throughout. It's not necessarily a bad thing but the story feels slightly generic. But it is absolutely stunning to look at; the entire cityscape of Tokyo is filled giant building-sized holograms, which are presented to look almost real thanks to the effects team. Yet they look old because we've seen these before, Ridley Scott did the same with his sci-fi thriller Blade Runner, there are also bullet dodging cyborgs taken out of The Matrix. So as far as there isn't any new ideas here it's still stunning, though a far cry from the original. This took a hit from earlier judgment claiming that director Rupert Sanders was 'whitewashing' by casting a Caucasian as the lead character, but it's not all a whitewash because there's diversity here too, Major's companion Batou is played by Danish Pilou Asbaek, and Japanese cinema legend 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano plays her boss Aramaki he gives her the contract kills.Scarlett Johansson plays her role well as merciless contract killer Major, a curiously nippless cybernetic organism with no sex appeal of the original. She's been down the merciless killer route before as an actor, in Under the Skin she played as an alien who seduces lonely men which then lead to self-discovering her body. Then there was Lucy which had her evolve into a warrior who kills because it's fun, and she even travels down this route as Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ghost in the Shell '17 plays practically the same way as Major just kills because it's fun, there's more of her Shell a.k.a her body on show here than her Ghost a.k.a her soul she has no personality, she's a little heavy-footed than her original and she shows no emotion so when it comes to the blank kills she just shrugs off the tears with an invisible shoulder lift. Still she does the job well beating off her enemies with just her hands and her Matrix-esque reflexes, but there's not much else here in fact it'll be better to watch this for the special effects because they are stunning. Director Rupert Sanders makes this look as real as possible just as he did with his debut Snow White and the Huntsman which also had a muddled story yet looked stunning. And as much as everything looks real and shows a standing point there isn't much else to go on. It's hard to escape the flaws here too, they are huge from the moment the film opens the flaws show up, there is no characterization and also at about 24 minutes longer than it's original it takes longer to get to the point. Although the story lacks the spirit and the brutality of the original, and this certainly isn't new it has spirit and the flaws are easy to forgive thanks to the stunning visuals. And despite Scar Jo having no personality she still does her job well and it's fair to say that the spirit stays in this rather expensive shell and no ghost.VERDICT: Johansson gives her all in this slightly heavy-footed style of the anime original. Not a great addition to the world of live-action cinema it still packs a Major punch.",Ghost in the Shell

Don't waste your time watching this shell of a story..The main character (the way it was written) is a dumb child that doesn't know what to be. And yes, I get that's the point of the story, but it is done horribly!! She is human inside, and acts as if she was made into existence and hates it. The way it was written and delivered doesn't work or sell this idea. It's so fast paced and blurred in this regard, that the ideology, impact and weight of this trauma and concerns is hollow. I utterly hate how simplistic it is.Why so much change to such a great story? Adapt it properly instead of dumbing it down!! And why does Scarlet slouch so much?

They would tell they were in a fatal accident, and that they saved you, then comes Major, she was told she was the first of her kind, and they made her take medicine to not get her memories back, she then went on a job, and she met a man who was told the same thing, and that the government is doing terrible things, she later rebels for a bit, and then after the main villain dies, and then she goes back to working for the government. I didn't like the ending what so ever, I felt like it ended out of nowhere in the climax, and they ended the bad guy unsatisfying.Characters: 7/10Major: Major is such a cliché good guy working for the bad guys, she's like Douglas Quaid from total recall, and the fact that she kept working for the government feels incomplete.Batou: Batou is likable I think he's a good sidekick, and he has a good personality, he's a good character.Kuze: Kuze has the same story as major he told her the truth. I think he looks cool, but I felt like he didn't get enough screen time.Action: 9/10The action is superb, I love the futuristic look, and the visuals. Ghost in the Shell is also very entertaining, there's lots of gunfights, and great music. The only thing holding me back from a 10/10 action is there's no blood it looks unrealistic, or silly, but overall good action.Ghost in the Shell is a great movie, I have little problems, but the ending. I think if they put this movie to two hours long, and end it properly, it could reach a 7/10 or a 8/10.",Ghost in the Shell
132,gavinp9,OK remake with some decent action,6,2 January 2018,"'Ghost in the Shell' is a remake of the mid-90s anime film, which explored cyborgs and digital immersion before the internet became commonplace. It's a bit of a shame there's not more Japanese actors, seeing as it's still set in futuristic Tokyo (but filmed in New Zealand & China...), with heaps of shots of the annoying super-size digital billboards. Aramaki (Kitano) has an OK cameo as the police chief, but is otherwise wasted. Basically, Major (Johansson, doing her best to walk stiffly) is a human brain (""ghost"") transplanted into a robot body (""shell""), who's then trained to be a SWAT operative - they show you all this in the first 5min, before picking up where the original film starts. Her partner's Batou (Asbaek), who they do a good job of how he gets his enhancements. Dr Ouelet (Binoche) is her ""creator"" and conscience, as Major battles to define her humanity and 'soul'. Cutter (Ferdinando) is a poorly-written bad-guy.It's quick - just over 90min - and, like the original, I'm left feeling ""why?"". Didn't have a huge impact on me, unfortunately. Sure, it's got some good fights and explosions; Kuze (Pitt) poses some interesting questions; and you're constantly almost seeing Johansson nude, but there's not much meaning or a bigger picture of why we should care for the characters. Still, it's better than 'Lucy'.",Ghost in the Shell
133,jackmeat,"Visually stunning, story lacking, still a good film",7,9 April 2017,"My quick rating - 7,1/10. There will be two types of reviewers for this movie. Those die hard fans of the original anime, and those that have not seen the anime and watch this film stand alone. As someone who has seen the anime, and loved it, I am going to try and teeter between the two views as best as I can. I will just get something out of the way: When great Animes came out 20 or so years ago, such as this, and Akira to name the two that come to mind quickly, there was a general consensus that there was no way that a movie could be intricate enough to capture the vivid and detailed world that was created in these masterpieces. Special effects were not there....yet. Jump to now, where the strides in tech have made capturing these vivid worlds a possibility and this movie did so perfectly. The dark and decaying world shows bright and vivid, with all the contrast as it should. Even with the somewhat bizarre building size holographic billboards that seem out of place at times (as big as Godzilla strolling through central park for no reason) that are selling something? Maybe? Anyway, this movie is a marvel to look at, and is no doubt going to win Oscars for visuals. Unbelievable to look at. So if you hear, see it in a theater (i chose IMAX, and glad I did) there is truth to this. The REALLY big screen is needed to take it all in.So now the story. Quick sum up, the future has no issues with replacing body parts with enhanced robotic parts. Well, the story is the main character, Major (Scarlett Johansson) is the first to take the human brain and be put into a fully robotic body, enhanced to be a super soldier. Now if this sounds like Universal Soldier, I suppose there are some parallels to it, but they are nothing alike. This is actually a story about identity, which is an important word to remember when viewing this. All the things that make us human, and keeps us different from AI is a part of the struggle here. This is the part that I will step over to being a fan of the anime. Many of these themes that were alluded to and gave the viewer things to ponder are just kinda swept away from this Hollywood product. This movie had to be ""dummy'd down"" if you will to make it a bit more mainstream. I didn't see this as a problem per se, but I am sure some fans are slightly perturbed by some of the omissions that occur. No details since that would be spoiler territory.It would be difficult not to be in awe of the action sequences as well. They are so wonderfully shot and edited so they never lose your attention by moving to fast, and allow the audience to just take the sequences in. Just a really good job sine lately the massive cut-cut editing in action scenes leave you wondering what is going on. Not in this film.So, with some incredible things to look at, and a script that leaves some to be desired, the other element is the acting. Well, all that gets from me is adequate. Can't say much more. The emotions in Majors eyes are really what you are supposed to get the feelings from and this is done just fine really. Not distracting nor great. The other characters are fine, and Batou was probably the best when it comes to acting in the movie. And they did do a good job with the iconic eyes of Batou as well, for all the fans out there. All that said, is the movie perfect, and everything us fans wanted? Nope. Never was going to be no matter who made it. But Hollywood didn't destroy the classic either thankfully, and gave us all something to sit and allow our jaws to drop at, and listen to (yes, some of the original score from the anime is even in place for your listening pleasure). Definitely a good film worth watching that most likely will be taken out of context by both audiences I described since it is right in the middle of what it is and what it could have been. I left satisfied and that is good enough for me.",Ghost in the Shell
134,peterfmodel,Surprisingly Good,10,8 August 2017,"As a Ghost in the Shell fan I expected the worst and based on the initial reviews I was expecting to be proved correct, however after watching it by preconceived bias was blown away. It was a good movie, not as good as the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie, but that bar is so high few movies would qualify. Scarlett Johansson was almost perfect in the role, the only issues was she lacked the ""Dirty Harry"" confidence of the original movie. However in this movie she was only beginning her career, while in the 1995 movie she was an old timer who was ending her career, so that can be explained. The technique of having Aramaki speak Japanese worked, although he mumbled too much and I originally though he was speaking mandarin. I gave up trying to understand his Japanese and simply read the subtitles instead. When I saw Togusa for the first time, that fact he was Japanese confused me. For those who watch Japanese anime, almost everyone looks like a Caucasian, so I was use to that look. However once I realised why I was confused it all worked very well, as if I was watching an all-Japanese cast anime movie, such as Black Butler (which is also excellent). The only real issue was too much was being covering in the movie; it was too fast and lacked the feeling of the original 1995 movie as a result. You could easily resolve it by extending the movie and if I owned the rights that is what I would do, perhaps create two movies from the material. That way you could capture the slow motion and surreal scenes of the original movie, such as when Motoko rises up from the water. As for the controversy about race, we are not dealing with any type of objectivity. I simply ignored any of those comments as those who make them clearly lack an understanding of anime. Saying that it was good the movie was set in Japan and Aramaki reported to the prime minister, rather than the president. 優れた In summary, a good movie with excellent potential, which could have been done better and which could easily be reworked to remove the major issues outlined above.",Ghost in the Shell
135,mgd_m,No,4,16 June 2019,"I didn't read the GITS comics, but I'm familiar with the drawings. Scarlett Johansson looks awful, her hair and her grim look are more similar to Aeon Flux than they are to the original GITS. She has a short and strong build, that is very distant from the elegant perfection of the original.The movie is quite boring, and fails to deliver some kind of unique atmosphere. The plot is flat, the setting is nothing special. It's no different from an action flick set in the future. The existential themes are rather basic.I felt no empathy for the character, when at some point her life is in danger.If you want a better written and filmed story, watch Upgrade.Edit: I watched the anime from 1995. The movie has the same plot, with a couple of worsening changes and added characters. The ending in particular is a desplicable feel-good ending for the masses. Overall, it's a live-action remake with some subraction of value.",Ghost in the Shell

People complaining for the film not staying close to source material to not liking how certain cultural elements were reflected and so on.While I'll be first to say I know zero about the anime, culture, or anything else for the matter I simply watched this movie because it looked interesting. And boy was I right I enjoyed this film alot.From the non-stop action to the stunning visuals and great acting this movie was thrill ride. I also thought Scarlett in this was total babe and made my eyes hooked even more.The only reason why I diddn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 has to do with the extremely confusing beginning-middle I had zero clue what was going on for bit till finally the movie explained everything properly and made alot sense.Other then that I highly recommend this movie don't listen to negative reviews and watch for yourself.",Ghost in the Shell
137,ayoreinf,"Visionary, thought provoking, and well done all the way through",9,2 April 2017,"Since it seems to matter, I have to start with the statement that I did not see any of the manga or anime source material. But I do know that Masamune Shirow, the creator of that source material agreed with the changes made to his creation. Seeing the movie I think I know why he agreed to having Scarlett Johansson portraying his heroine. Namely: The issues raised in his movie are not Japanese but rather universal. The fact she doesn't look Japanese enhances the alienation of her character (and all the other non Japanese being part of the global corporation that doesn't really care about being Japanese). And there's at least one Japanese character, who insists on speaking nothing but Japanese all through the movie. Think about the significance of his role and you'll realize that the the Japanese soul of the film is still shining bright. On top of all that, Scarlett is superb. You can see how she's more than an action figure, you can see, her humane ghost coming through. It makes sense that her mother would recognize her in a completely new, made up, body. In fact, the fact she's not Japanese makes this point much stronger.All other aspects of this film are of the highest quality. CGI and artistic design are simply visionary. I would summarize it as Blade Runner on steroids. I have a feeling that's where Ridley Scott would've taken his classic masterpiece if he only could at the time. The actors don't all get to demonstrate their abilities, but besides Scarlett Johansson, one must also mention the great performance of Juliette Binoche, and Peter Ferdinando, as the perfect villain.The whole point of this movie, is the question: what being human is all about, and how destructible is humanity. Now how deep is the answer offered by the movie, is in this case up to each and every spectator, simply because we're not being spoon fed with the required conclusions.",Ghost in the Shell
138,CountJonnie,Beautiful and empty,6,3 May 2017,"Many CGI loaded movies end up being disappointments or void of anything else. That is not the case with Ghost in the Shell. Ghost in the Shell truly is CGI loaded, but not only for useless effects, but also to create background, atmosphere and character. Partially they succeeded and created one of the more beautiful backgrounds we have seen in a while, and also managed to create a character that is torn between being human and artificial.Unfortunately, they only did that with Scarlett Johansson. Obviously some other characters (a) gave terrible performances or (Binoche, Pitt) (b) were good but not given enough screen time or development (Pilou, Takeshi, and others). Especially the main villain, who was menacing UNTIL the reveal, took away the only bit of tension there ever was.This is not a rare thing and happens to movies who try to put too much story or too much characters into one movie. This should have been a longer movie, or a series. A world needs to be build and characters need to develop. Especially the last one didn't happen here. Still a 6 for the effects, Johansson and the amazing action design.",Ghost in the Shell
139,kaptenvideo-89875,All the good looks it's too niche for general audience,5,9 April 2017,"Based on media franchise of the same name, Ghost in the Shell"" is the first live-action movie of the seminal cyber epic about human enhanced into super soldier who clashes with dangerous criminals. In order to add some international star power, the main hero – originally Asian – has turned into sexy and nimble white girl (Scarlett Johansson), the choice surely liked by many and despised by some more hard-core fans. And adding some street cred, there is legendary director Takeshi Kitano supporting her. There are– or at least one can perceive – nods to all kinds of mind- bending sci-fi classics that have gone before, The Matrix"" and Assassin's Creed"" among others. The gravity-defying asskicking and futuristic environments sure look good, with all the gigantic holograms dominating the cityscape and everything. Sadly it does not really feel like a living breathing world – it's much more like a video game. So you may not remember it long after watching but it's competent if unoriginal vision of what futuristic looks like. What the fans of previous Ghost in the Shell"" incarnations – especially manga and anime – may lament about is the horribly simplified approach that the western movie makers has used. But if you don't know or care about the legacy, the first live-action movie may quench some thirst for futuristic action. The result is not bad, really. It's just not terribly involving either. It's not gonna become a megahit, because for all the good looks it's too niche for general audience and probably too shallow for manga or anime heads. Oh well. At least we get an idea about how the coming Blade Runner"" sequel and Marvel's Black Widow movie(s) may look like. There's a fully functional spiritual side to the story, and it's actually much more exciting to follow events this way. But all the spiritual stuff has been pushed to the background and is mentioned only in passing. So it can't effectively compensate for the shallowness of the main plot or sure-handed but emotionally distant style which never lets you close to the characters. The potential is all there, but the result will leave many a bit unsatisfied. Watched it in 3D. Didn't think the extra D added enough to justify its existence.",Ghost in the Shell
140,trublu215,It is beautiful to look at...that's about it.,4,29 March 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is arguably one of the most beloved anime films of all time. Approaching nearly 22 years old, the original film still holds up as, not only a great film, but a thought provoking one too. Fast forward to 2017, we're introduced to the CGI spectacle that many believed was going to be the first great live action adaptation especially when the first trailer was released. Instead of appeasing fans of the original, this film decides to clip its own nuts and wants to be seen on a broader spectrum. Throw in some heavily edited fight sequences, a PG-13 rating and Scarlett Johansson, we get 2017 Ghost in the Shell...and it is downright painful at times.The film is, more or less, a shot for shot remake at times and then other times it tries to do its own thing. Truthfully, Rupert Sanders' erratic direction and Jamie Moss' lackluster adapted script make this a very hard film for a fan to watch. While it may be easily looked over because of the wonderful use of CGI and cinematography, under the surface the film is superficial and very idiotic at times. Scarlett Johansson as Major is a major miscast (no pun intended). She is wooden and feels like she is sleepwalking through this role. While it is clear that after Lucy and The Avengers, Johansson is wanting to be an action hero icon. She is a tremendous actress in every way but it is hard to buy her as Major. Overall, this film is yet another remake that misses the mark. Walking out of my screening, I kept hearing the comparisons to the remake of RoboCop from a group of people. I must say, this was an accurate comparison and I couldn't have made a better comparison even if I tried. The film suffers from blatant studio meddling, a poor script, and a very erratic director, much like that remake. These are three things that are too hard to ignore. Hardcore fans of Ghost in the Shell will probably be massively disappointed by this blatant cash grab. The young teenagers might get a kick out of the action sequences and CGI but the adults will be left watching the original for their enjoyment.",Ghost in the Shell

But the mark, the base material, is as deep as a puddle.So the story, even at its best, wasn't going to be terrific. At least the action could have been, but it wasn't.The acting was wooden.

142,darkreignn,"2017 has been the year of amazing movies, and this is no exception",8,2 April 2017,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is yet another movie released in 2017 that met and exceeded my expectations. Visually stunning and immaculately directed, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a deep and absorbing science-fiction action film.First of all, I'd like to mention the action scenes in this film. Not one TRACE of shaky-cam is in this movie, and it's glorious. Nice, crystal clear, wide and steady shots will grace your eyes. I was so worried that the action in this movie would give me an epileptic seizure that would have me foaming at the mouth and crying blood, but instead of having a medical emergency I was having a borderline spiritual experience watching the action in this movie. It's very much shot like ""John Wick,"" in the fact that the camera is very steady throughout, showing a clear picture of every action taking place. And even though the film takes place in such a fantastical universe, the way the action is shot and framed makes it very guttural, almost primal. Sure, it's heavily stylized at points, but the movie never shies away from the violence that is being depicted. There are no attempts to hide anything, and I thought the action really blurred the lines between PG-13 and R, and it was magnificent. Trust me, action this well filmed is hard to come by, and I would recommend buying a ticket solely to show your support for well filmed action scenes.This film is also visually stunning. If someone told me that Nicolas Winding Refn and David Lynch had a baby, and that a resurrected Stanley Kubrick adopted that baby, and that baby was responsible for the cinematography in this film, I wouldn't even be surprised. My jaw hit the floor as soon as the movie started and it remained there for the entire run time. My eyes couldn't get enough of the visual feast that was happening on the screen. And my God, the visuals combined with the music is downright euphoric; I can only hope that Heaven will be a quarter as beautiful as this movie was, both in terms of aesthetics and sound. It reminded me a lot of ""Only God Forgives"" in this way. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is masterful in the visuals department, especially with its blend of CGI. The CGI was so good in this movie that there were times I honestly forgot I was watching CGI; it's brilliant, and if this movie does not get a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the Oscars I'm boycotting it forever. And of course Scarlett Johansson was amazing in this movie. She gave a very convincing performance, and a sympathetic one as well. You really start to feel for her as she tries to remember her past and figure out why certain things are happening to her. As the movie explores her life as a ghost in a shell and explores the fact that she cannot feel her own body, you'll really get a feeling for what kind of a special kind of Hell that must be for her. It's something that we take for granted everyday, but something that Major, Scarlet Johansson's character, cannot do.I was also so excited that Takeshi Kitano was in this movie. He's such a bad ass in everything he's ever been in, ever, and he did not disappoint. I kind of wish he had a bit more to do, but he had a few scenes that were so exciting and nail biting, and because of that I cannot complain too much.""Ghost in the Shell"" is yet another fantastic movie that was released in 2017. I don't know what it is about this year, but it seems like the studios are releasing their most entertaining movies back to back to back. If you enjoy cerebral science-fiction movies, then you should go see this film. If you enjoy watching action that had actual care involved in the filming process, then you should go see this film. If you enjoy Scarlett Johansson as an actress, then you should go see this film. If you enjoy being stimulated visually non-stop for an hour and forty-seven minutes, then you should go see this film. In fact, just go see this film if you enjoy watching movies in general, because I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Thanks for reading, and enjoy the movie; it's a Hell of a ride.",Ghost in the Shell
143,politic1983,Ghosts of the Past,6,22 April 2017,"There already is a live-action re-make of 'Ghost in the Shell': 'The Matrix'. I jest, of course, though there are many other versions of the 'Ghost in the Shell' franchise: the Masamune Shirow manga from the 1980s; the Mamoru Oshii anime films; the 'Stand Alone Complex' series; and the 'Arise' series. Rupert Sanders' 'live-action' version, therefore, is placing itself into an already crowded market place for guises of the characters developed in the late Eighties. In his interesting piece upon its release, Andrew Osmond discusses how the trailer was designed to tug on our nostalgia strings for the anime, seemingly recreating some of its most iconic scenes in a 'live-action' form. Though to say this incarnation is 'live-action' is something of a myth, with Johansson's face and voice added to an endless stream of CGI effects. Spending a large budget in recreating a Japanese anime for a Western audience, however, is fraught with danger: Those that are not particularly fans of anime will not be drawn to this against the endless stream of comic book franchise extensions already on offer; while fans of the franchise will no doubt find fault in an idea that has now perhaps had its day. To start, it is obviously visually quite impressive. Oshii's version was stunning to look at, and so this was a necessity. The use of huge holographic advertising across the cityscape create a similar image of a futuristic 'Hong Kong' as before, and the use of bird's eye view scene setting also works throughout. Though, perhaps, there is a little too much going on on screen, making it somewhat difficult to keep up with at times. The plot is where the greatest differences lie. 'The Major', known as Mira, is a refugee from a sunk ship. Her brain, saved, is placed in the body of a state-of-the-art cybernetic body, though the memory of her past is vague; mere flashes here and there. As part of cyber- terrorism squad, Section 9, her and her team follow the actions of Kuze, hacking individuals to take out members of the Hanka Robotics staff; staff that created The Major's body. With this connection, she takes a personal interest in the case, drawn to Kuze's accusations of the organisation that created her. This is a little more of a direct plot than the anime version, with its ending that draws few full conclusions; only asking more questions. Cutter, the head of Hanka, is a more conventional villain, less seen in the other incarnations, with the bad guys more misunderstood terrorists posing philosophical questions of the Major, which she is always willing to debate. Here, philosophical questions are posed, but in a somewhat different form, just as existential, but somewhat more simplistic - natural for a film aiming for a more universal appeal. As with the 1995 version, the focus is on a select few of Section 9: The Major, ever-faithful Batou and Aramaki. Johansson is perhaps a natural for the lead role (whitewash arguments aside), with Pilou Asbaek as you would expect of Batou and 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano, as Aramaki, in what appears good casting. Togusa, being wholly human, always an interesting element of the team, is given less showing here. A shame, as Chin Han is likable in the role. The rest of the team are afterthoughts, casting from all over the globe, giving the team a more global feel. Aramaki's dialogue in Japanese compared to everyone else's English, feels like an attempt to keep things a little Asian based on its roots, though is perhaps as much due to Kitano's language skills and may only fuel the fire of those questioning the casting. The Major's past and her trying to uncover more from her flashbacks drives her character, with the source of Batou's eyes revealed. We are definitely being introduced to the characters here, Section 9 seeming a more fledgling squad finding its feet. This feels like a prequel, therefore, whereas the 1995 anime throws you in at the deep end. The 1995 film had its flaws: its short running time missed out much character development, with somewhat budget saving dialogue scenes fairly static to accommodate the more impressive visual moments. The setting is less defined also, based on Hong Kong, though not particularly eluding to the exact location, as with the original manga. Ideas developed more in the Stand ALone Complex series. There is more in the way of narrative and character development here, natural with actors instead of animated characters, giving a more human feel. The main question, however, is: does this offer anything over the original manga, two Oshii films, two 'Stand Alone Complex' series and 'Arise' prequels? This is a (I was) twenty-eight years old franchise, drawing on inspiration from previous sources, namely Arthur Koestler's 'Ghost in the Machine' and 'Blade Runner'; as well as inspiring subsequent works itself. A fifth awakening, after the weaker 'Arise' stories had probably put a couple of nails in the coffin makes it poorly timed for those in the know.This review is perhaps a little preoccupied with Mamoru Oshii's 1995 version, though Sander's films haunted by the ghost of its past. Not enough elements from the manga and 'Stand Alone Complex', omitted by Oshii are added, taking three of the most famous scenes from Oshii and trying to shoehorn them into a new storyline. The Major's attempts to recall her past, finding only partial memories, serve as a metaphor for the self-aware referencing of the earlier work. While visually impressive and not a bad film, the lack of enough new elements will fail to win plaudits among established anime fans - those putting production points aside that have made the effort to watch it; and the appeal of an anime remake will unlikely draw enough universal appeal over the numerous superhero franchises on offer, with initial box office results perhaps proof of this.",Ghost in the Shell

It is really doubtful whether anything beside CGI actually happens. At moments one can catch some ""glitches"" of a story, but that's all. The topic on mixing human with artificial organisms has been many times before and better, even when it was unbearable to watch and/or stupid (Van Damme). One more proof that no cast or director or technicians or CGI creators, regardless of how good they might be, can carry out the essentially meaningless ""manga"" content in a movie and make it worth spectators' time.

What I want to say here, I watch this movie because I like anime and manga so much,(but not GITS anime) I've watch the anime version of the Ghost in the Shell and I only give it 2/10, because I really don't got it, I don't really understand what is going on. For this live action one, I'm completely understand what is going on, the way they tried to stay faithful to the adaptation and everything. But I think, its a total cliché, we've seen a lot of sci-fi movie like this, when an AI question its creation and origin, fight back and everything. You've seen them everywhere. If they just follow the anime story closely, it will be better. I know the atmosphere in the anime is dark, but this is too dark, even though its just a light story, the atmosphere make it looks heavy. And so the background of the so- called modern city that looks really weird with all the creepy big hologram.

146,asifahsankhan,"Wait, just the Shell? But what about the Ghost?",6,5 April 2017,"These are the sorts of consciousness-expanding questions that have animated the ""Ghost in the Shell"" franchise for more than two decades. The world of GITS is part futuristic action movie and part philosophy lecture, in which artfully constructed animated action sequences serve as vehicles for investigations into the nature of consciousness. It's a showcase for what top-notch animation can do — one that the new movie never quite manages to match.However, it might take a few months—or maybe even a few years—but eventually, Scarlett Johansson's Ghost in the Shell will have an afterlife. The live-action adaptation of the Japanese classic is a complete Cyber Bore, narrative-wise, but for those who gush over big- screen artistry, there's plenty to get lost in: the opulent, expansive CGI visuals; the gorgeous Clint Mansell/Lorne Balfe score, pulsing and plunging like a Tangerine Dream nightmare; even Johansson's stoically acrobatic performance, which proves once again why she's one of the most in-demand action-film stars in the world. It's one of those films destined to be salvaged by the web, where the movie's defenders will advocate for it via frame-grab sprees or the occasional sub-Reddit threads. Ghost will find its followers.In the here-and-now, though, Ghost in the Shell is an all- encompassing embarrassment, the kind of movie you might not want to admit you watched—and which, judging from the box office, not a lot of people bothered to see in the first place.

That crash came despite the fact that the latest version of Ghost—which is based on the long-running manga and anime series—was gifted with an estimated $110 million budget, a major star, a teen- baiting PG-13 rating, and a nearly 3,500-screen opening weekend. In what's been a notably healthy box-office year, Ghost should have shellacked the competition.But on the internet, Ghost has been a dud-in-the-making since at least January 2015, when Johansson's casting was first confirmed. The news set off a two-year-long preemptive outcry on the web, where online petitions and thoughtful Twitter threads addressed the film's whitewashing and cultural appropriation. That's been a point of contention with several works from the last year, including Doctor Strange, The Great Wall, and Netflix's Iron Fist, but Ghost in the Shell's transgressions were perhaps the most deeply felt: Here was a landmark piece of Japanese pop-culture—one whose what- does-it-mean-be-human? ideas and hacker-trash aesthetic had already been co-opted by US-produced films like The Matrix and AI—being re- imagined with a white American lead actress and an English director (Snow White and the Huntsman's Rupert Sanders). It didn't help that, a year before its release, rumours surfaced that the filmmakers had tested digital effects that would have allowed certain performers to ""shift their ethnicity"" so they could resemble Asian characters. By the time the film opened on Friday, it had shifted from ""problematic"" to full-on off-inducing: Wait, didn't we all agree this was a bad idea?The overall result is a movie that's all borrowed parts, with no depth or connection. The layers never quite come together to form something more. It wants to be a movie about the search for consciousness, but, unlike its source material, it doesn't have a soul.",Ghost in the Shell
147,FelipeCarrillo,"Eyes Wide Open, Deaf Ears",8,8 June 2017,"""Ghost in the Shell"" has live-action adaptation thanks to American feature film production and distribution studio, Paramount Pictures. The feature film is the second work by director Rupert Sanders, and the third Johansson's performance as the heroine, after her brilliant job in ""Lucy"" and vigorous saga Marvel's ""Avengers"". Even so the Japanese anime had already been materialized by Palme d'Or winner Mamoru Oshii on a couple of occasions and the final result is indeed admirable in every way, the first flesh and blood appearance (metaphorically speaking) of Motoko Kusanagi comes, a cyborg-human hybrid leader of an elite group and although she shows up clichés of the machine with own intelligence that saves humanity from other gloomy machines and sets a chain of ethical and philosophical aftermaths on her past and future, Sanders' work, too scrupulous to the panels of the reference source, feels like a progression of skills refreshing the unproductive creative day-to-day.At a glance, everyone infers which aspect takes all the praises. Visual effects and production design carry out fully what they were proposing, arousing a thorough immersion in that futuristic city of a reality that is not too far away, which drinks respectfully from sci-fi masterpieces as Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"". Transferring the majority of wonders of the cyberpunk book to live action was a total insanity, considering that they should overcome two major hindrances: The first one is the difficulty that surrounds manufacture of every notion of the world on which it is based, work elaborated with mastery by artistic directors, who spent whole months handcrafting many of the elements which are seen on screen, improving their meritorious work; and the second one is to free itself from American mania about maximizing even the dullest feature, losing the basic elements of the main culture. Although the artists uproot the most notorious traditions of the Eastern country, they convince of the tempestuous empowerment of science technologies in our daily life. If a cinematographic production was to be regarded a masterpiece by the glory of its pictures, Paramount's work would obtain the award without delay; it's a delectation to be carried away by the gorgeous skill of the filmmaker: the visual section. He showed his half-baked talent regularly in his directorial debut, now he ratifies his knowledge with sinister robotic geishas, a palette of nuanced colors which represent the scintillation of social darkness, choreographed fight moves and exciting action sequences that benefit from bullet time and magic sound distortions to achieve the desired impact, technological atmosphere isn't lost even in the most futile fragment, all here fits, this conformity has power and harmony, which demands to be contemplated on the big screen.Considering that the story has the signatures of three dissonant writers, clearly, the plot, based on the comic of Masamune Shirow, was going to be saturated with a complex of different proposals and looks, with resolutions don't maintain a common term. Although screenwriters trio were very respectful by extracting the vital skeleton of the manga and the films, they palliate metaphysical burden, perhaps it wasn't decided lightly, since they had to exhibit in a flexible, congenial and seductive way a work, which is the mother for many of the existential audiovisual productions of today (""Ex Machina"" ""Her"" or ""Westworld""), in other words, what's adapt an original idea? Modernize or preserve the name of an ontological sci- fi classic? This implies that the film doesn't get the same emotional and reflective blow as 1995 movie, opting to present minimal background in the prologue, thoughtful instants where Johansson possibly broods what and/or who is and that's the whole ideological implanted environment, one more incident in which Hollywood replaces depth narrative by weapons and flagrant impressions pleasing the eye , but not to the mind, of course, a less emphatic case, but in the end, one more case, and I don't blame them, because the real guilty of that awful trend is audience, who believe that cinema is a temporary amusement, something ""entertaining"", something transitory.As one of the contemporary films with more remuneration repercussions by controversial ""whitewashing"", we can determine (again) it's completely an unfounded affirmation. Perhaps the most vehement fans want the adaptation to be coupled with their demands and fantasies, but with the American film monster in the boss role, it was to be expected that a superstar plays the leading role. An interesting performance made by ""Under the Skin"" actress as Major, she's who allows the audience to follow the story, but to a certain extent, since Johansson's charming performance as a cyborg-woman doesn't get to break the chains of well-known resolutions.""Ghost in the Shell"" is wounded by nostalgia for the original movie, despite this, rating it as an independent product, is a worthy adaptation; it rebuilds some things around here, replicates identically another thing over there, however, absurdly, is another feature film that Hollywood makes fairly well. This story of origins would be the direct access to the profitable and vigorous franchise that Scarlett Johansson has been looking for and that Marvel has been unwilling to give her, but based on the grossing of the last few days, sadly, it's concluded that the American audience, one of the most fervent film consumers, has literally turned its back on it, and that isn't a good thing. The sexual burden is quietly watered down and the inherently philosophical ghost is quietly destroyed, Rupert Sanders executes a blockbuster that feels a little hollow, which concentrates on presenting magnificently to Major, establishing an enemy with moral grudges and an open ending. However, performances and technical production are high; they manage to introduce in our minds a message: the need for more ""Ghost in the Shell"". It's unlikely, but if they reconstruct the narrative flaws present in this one in an uncertain sequel, it would clearly be a masterpiece, but at the moment, at least in the visual thing, is already taking enlarge steps to it.",Ghost in the Shell
148,GomezAddams666,Ghost in the Shell definitely has a soul.,9,28 March 2017,"GHOST IN THE SHELL - SPOILER FREE REVIEWScarlett Johansson stars as Major, a human saved from a terrible crash, who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. Her soul or ""ghost"" has been placed into a cybernetic built body, which is also called the ""shell"" because her essence still lives inside that body. Going any further into the plot would land us in spoiler-ish territory and I would not want to do that, what I will say is that the manga and the Japanese 1995 anime movie will not be disappointed as it pays a huge respect to that particular story in ways I guarantee you will not see coming.What I can say is that director Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman) has delivered a stunningly beautiful movie, the visuals of the movie are like nothing there has ever been before when it comes to FX. the CGI scenery paints the image of a near-future Japan that looks astoundingly natural, there is too much that can be said about the visuals but this is a movie that has to be enjoyed in 3D to fully take in all its remarkable wonders.As for the story line it was pretty solid, it paints a very bleak future where technology seems much more important than humanity, and with the lack of human interaction these days it can almost be seen as a pretty scary omen.The performances were pretty outstanding, with amazing character development by the leading actress, Scarlett Johansson, and a pretty well built supporting cast that includes screen legend Juliette Binoche, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt and a very faithful performance by Pilou Asbæk as the iconic Batou from the Japanese manga.All in all I can easily say this is the most fun I have had in the theater so far this year, it would really shock me if the Academy does not recognize this movie's nearly perfect and beautiful visuals, as much as I would be in awe if fans do not see this movie three times at least in the theater, because I know I will.And I can't ignore the controversy surrounding the casting of an American actress as Major, or the fear some anime fans might have that this movie may turn out as a blasphemy to the source material. But Scarlett Johansson, Rupert Sanders and everyone involved in this movie put every controversy to rest as I assure you this movie pays respect to the Japanese manga. In fact, I rate it 9 out of 10!!!This version of Ghost In The Shell definitely has a lot of soul.",Ghost in the Shell
149,Eddie_weinbauer,Terminator it ain't,2,13 May 2017,"A confusing soulless movie. Scarlet walk around like she got a major stick up her ass,and sort of reminds me of those robot movies in the 80s were people talked and walked really stiffly ,pretending to be a robot.The story, is kind of hard to follow,because it's so incoherent.And the character so shallow, which makes it a bit hard to follow.Cause as soon as you start holding onto something,it turns out to be a CGI memory. But I get the impression she is some sort of agent.Couldn't quite understand for what, I grasped it had something to do with robot or implants.Think I will say, that this have to be scarlet's worst acting job to date..Even worse than ""under the skin""",Ghost in the Shell

151,Lewis_Heather787,Why has this been so harshly criticised?,8,2 April 2017,"Before the actual review of the film lets deal with a couple of issues to being with. Firstly I personally have no prior knowledge or passion for the original anime, so I don't know the source material at all, in that respect I'm a general audience member not a die hard fan. Secondly the casting controversy of Scarlett Johansson. Yes it is bad to see that once again Hollywood ""whitewashes"" a character in a film franchise, however I do see the reason for them doing it in this case. Unfortunately as much as it is horrible to say, I don't think that this film would be made in the first place without someone like Johansson. I can see the arguments on both sides on this films casting.Firstly the cinematography in this film is gorgeous, every shot and frame in this film is immaculate. Whether it be vibrant colourful shots of the city landscape or more dark underground places, the look of the film always look superb. The filmmakers have definitely gone out of their way to make the look of the film seem elegant and seamless, as if it could be in reality. The cinematography is also connected to the effects of the film and especially the look of the world. The city landscapes are spectacular and wonderful, it really makes you want it to be reality. It has obviously taken inspiration from other films such as Blade runner, however I feel its taken those elements of look and feel to the environment and lightened them up a little. The effects, look, feel and cinematography in the film all compliment each other so well sometimes it is truly breath taking, this film sets the standard high in this respect.Scarlett Johansson is great in the film and actually gives the film a strong female lead with a lot of complexities. Whether it be sadness or just pure confusion she pulls of the different emotions of the character really well and really makes it easy for the audience to connect with her. The more the film goes on the more you find out about her, the fact that she was injured so badly that her brain was removed from her body and put inside a robotic shell. Also the fact that she cant remember any of her passed really makes you want her to find out and you end up routing for her throughout her struggle. Personally I can see why they cast Johansson because she does bring her A game and gives a great performance that audiences can gravitate towards and care for, even though she is not actually human. The story of the film is basic at its heart, its about a revenge tale and who you thought the good guys were are actually the bad guys. Yes it is basic and yes you could see it happening but that still didn't make it not interesting or entertaining. From start to finish the story was compelling and had a great emotional disaster at the heart of it around all the action set pieces, it was a very nice contrast.The negatives of the film are mainly around the choice of villain, the first potential villain we get introduced to is interesting, dark and quite frightening. It makes from a really fascinating watch until you find out that he is not actually the villain, I don't think that is actually a spoiler as such. However I think that the actually overbearing villain of the film is quite weak and really stereotypical, not interesting or threatening in anyway which is a real let down, I feel if the villain was stronger it would have made the stakes that much higher for Major and our hero's. Unfortunately due to all the controversy surrounding this film and the surprisingly low scores and harsh criticism made by critics, this film will never get a sequel or further films which I personally would like to see. This world of Ghost in the Shell looks really interesting and it has the potential to be explored so much more, however for some reason that it cant see, this film is not connecting with people. 80% out of 100 a really good film from start to finish, great lead character from a great actor, fantastic cinematography and effects. The only area that I feel this film is let down this the villain of the film which is weak, however this is definitely a watch especially in the cinema for the breath taking visuals.",Ghost in the Shell
152,GraXXoR,"If there's a pattern in the reviews, it is this:",9,28 October 2017,"Weeaboos are not happy! They watch this expecting a clone of the 1995 Animation classic and instead got a slick, western flick (as in not Asian: not spaghetti) Sci Fi jaunt with an outstanding story, an excellent cast portraying very sympathetic characters, set to a wondrous mid-future backdrop.Production values are top notch and the visuals and soundscapes are very, very faithful to the aforementioned 1995 animation which is considered to be one of the finest science fiction epics (let alone Animation) and to think that all the nuance and subtlety of a culturally rich story aimed at an intelligent, Japanese audience could be faithfully reproduced as a US live action production would be unrealistic.Some people forget that the 1995 version itself was not the original and was panned by some as an accessible (read bastardised) simplification of the late 80's Manga serial.As such, this film stands on its own as a remarkable and engrossing story with most of the Japanese aspects transliterated into a US accessible format. Yet as a ""lifer"" in Japan and a massive fan of the 1995 version and original Manga (seen and read in Japanese) I have to say they did the best they could.Could they have got more Japanese in the cast? Yes. Was it important that they didn't? Maybe... Some even call it a whitewash...But what they did by making her a whitey is something they couldn't do in the original: They stripped her of her entire identity. Her shell was no longer even the same race as the original. Imagine the alienation looking in the mirror.Scarlet did a fantastic job in bringing that alienation to the screen.. Not only that, but from the side, her profile right to the tip of her nose was spitting image of Major in the Anime.And the key scenes of the movie (you'll know both of them when you see them) left me shivering!!!A very, very good translation of a Japanese tale into English - Just don't expect the original.If I have one regret, it is that the superlative traditional music of the end credits was not used during the beginning of the film as it had been in the animation.",Ghost in the Shell

It had enough plot and intrigue in it so my wife could be interested in it.I guess my only real complaint is that they did not use the haunting theme music from the original anime until the credits started to roll, they shouda been using that music in the body of the movie.I thought the main actress did the part spot on, the support actor was a little disappointing, but adequateI'm hoping for a sequel, that way I'll have two ghost in the shell movies i can understand",Ghost in the Shell

In my view as a huge fan of an animation movie of this, it was pretty good. It was severely criticized much though.
The story was also good as a kind of styles what was a good role setting and the worldview, not as a remake work.
Although a plot was different by the animation at all, it was showed everyone as easy as possible I think. But I didn't feel it was cheap,I was suprised by good job for explanation that such a difficult setting could be showed with one movie anyway.
A story went on well without leaving people who watched it for the first time. Probably, it's never going to work that way in the animation version.
Unfortunately, I don't think that it makes people who don't know the original excited particularly as one of Sci-Fi movies. I just hope that it leads more many people to have their interest in the animation and the original comic.By the way, please put Japanese subtitle on Mr.Aramaki!

158,ctowyi,A nice upgrade with no Major issues,6,31 March 2017,"Mamoru Oshii's cult-classic anime Ghost in the Shell (1995) holds a sacred spot in my heart. This together with Akira (1988) are the epitomes of cyber tech-porn, the crowned jewels of apocalyptic Japanese animation. The future world depicted in Ghost in the Shell is alluring, but sad. It is uber-violent on the surface, but a deep melancholy runs beneath that surface. Its themes of alienation and identity beat with a strong pulse. Coupled with a superb atmosphere, dense plot, kinetic action sequences, dizzying ideas, opaque characters, mystical spiritualism and an outstanding music score, the anime earns its place as a much beloved cult-classic. Do we even need an Americanized live action version?Thankfully, this Rupert Sanders film isn't just a simplistic money-grab exercise. There is meticulous care in recreating the futuristic world designed by Oshii and it is a nice move not to transpose the world to some Neo-Los Angeles or NYC. In that sense, the film honours the spirit of the anime. It didn't stop there - some of the iconic action scenes are replicated, almost shot for shot. The story is updated and feels entirely understandable now with a crystal clear resolution; it feels almost dumbed down especially with the heavy expositional second act. I don't know about you, but for me this updated story reminds me so much of Robocop, a cyber-policeman haunted by residual memories of his human past. Yes, this is one watchable movie filled with technical and visual wizardry, but it couldn't carry forth the sense of melancholy so evident in the original. Yes, Scarlett Johansson does cut a fine figure as Major Motoko and she channels an extension of her cypher alien character from Under the Skin (if the mention of this movie makes you cringe, consider it fair warning that you won't see empathetic pathos). Yes, the music borrows heavily from Kenji Kawai's evocative original (why touch an awesome original which is an identity itself). So why is there a remake if it is just content to languish behind the glossy sheen and not want to push the envelope further with a story feels so familiar. This feels deceptively like one giant homage to the original and I am sure it will make money by the truckloads. I had one worry playing on repeat in my head as I walked out of the cinema - am I ready to be bombarded by Hollywoodized versions of Akira, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Patlabor, Appleseed...... I don't want to ponder this scary thought anymore. Thankfully, I will always have the animes. That's it; I am so watching the Oshii classic again right now.",Ghost in the Shell
159,Padreviews,5.5/10 Empty shell sadly,5,30 March 2017,"I really wanted to like this , the combination of Bladerunner and Robocop with A Chinese financed American remake of a Japanese Manga classic - it should be amazing :) it should have been amazing - it wasn't - it started off really well but just went downhill once the wow factor had gone it may have reached 7/10 in 3D but in 2D it was just average . Make up and CGi was expectingly top notch though Scarlett's recreation of a manga wig made her nose look like the child catcher from Chitty Chitty bang bang minus the top hat . The cars looked strangely fake and square , not sure it that was purposeful . I found myself questioning the guns and cigarettes but that's typical of a dystopian future film recreation the bladerunner type of nuclear weather film noir . If you've seen the trailers the giant billboards look as amazing as you'd expect but these fade after a while and the story isn't really substantial enough to sustain the interest . I am willing to give it another try in 3D but looking at other reviews it seems I'm not the only one who was expecting more , this has been planned since Spielberg bought it 2008 but it doesn't match up to his fantastic track record in SciFi . Shame really .",Ghost in the Shell
160,gcsman,conventional dystopian action,4,18 March 2018,"There actually is a significant issue embedded under the surface of this action movie -- how far do we go in replacing body parts with cyber equivalents? Past some limit do you cease to be human? However, this is never really tackled with any depth because the ceaseless demands for brutal action scenes outweigh everything else. Opportunity missed, but maybe the filmmakers didn't have any other goals in mind but to put out the action and just hang it on an underlying hook that could have been much more.The main character Major (Scarlett Johanssen) is supposedly the first of a new breed, a 'human' whose only genuine original bio-part is her brain; all the rest of her body is cybernetic. And of course because she's supposed to be the first of a new class of military weapon (or something like that) she's got all kinds of enhanced powers like superstrength, optional invisibility, high pain threshold, and so forth. The first half of the movie is too conventional to be all that engaging: there's some conflict among shadowy corporate/criminal elements including Major's parent Hanka corporation. She stalks the streets of a grimly futuristic, gritty metropolis (think Blade Runner but with double the dirt and nastiness), with predictable photogenic fights in bars and on dark streets. As Major, Johanssen does her best and is good to look at. In action mode she affects a masculine style of walk, with long straight-ahead strides, straight arms swinging, a grim expression on her face. About halfway through, the plot finally starts to get a little bit interesting with her discovery of The Truth: she isn't actually the first of her kind but only one of a long line of previous failed ""experiments"" to produce cybernetic humans, at least one of which (whom?) is still around and acting as a deep-background operator. Add in her parallel discovery that her biological mother is still alive and available, and there's finally some human interest in what's going on. The body count of both friends and enemies rapidly goes up and, again, the wrapup of the plot is pretty predictable.Overall, it's worth a once-through viewing, and if anyone is planning a thesis on movies that have future-dystopia settings, Ghost in the Shell would be on a complete list of such things. However, Blade Runner 2049 (also from 2017) blows it out of the water.",Ghost in the Shell
161,comps-784-38265,"Superficial - looks good but not much substance, trailer is the best part",6,30 March 2017,"What I liked: futuristic Japan, Scarlett Johansson What I didn't like Pretty much everything else, the lack of any real plot, predictable ending, pretty mindless violence on the whole. Mz Johanssons character is supposed to be of a Japanese girl, unlucky enough to have been an unwilling brain donor for transplant. Why did they create a body of western Caucasian ? She was 'made' to act as a counter terrorism 'robocop' in futuristic Japan. A strange 'white wash' presumably just to accommodate Ms Johansson rather than a lesser known but more plausible Asian actress.Summary: I did wonder why the trailer showed Mz Johansson apparently naked. I realise that it is just to entice the unwary into the cinema by adding a little titillation. The plot certainly offers nothing in the way of titillation. Spoiler alert - you don't see anything, its a sort of plastic robo skin suit Whats puzzling, is why she strips off down to her skin suit, every time she has to dive off a building or kill someone ? I digress, the plot in summary In the future cybernetics have advanced so much that they can put a human brain into a manufactured (but lifelike) body. Our heroine is the first of these. Apparently her family were killed by terrorists and she so badly wounded, they could only save her brain. So they transplanted it into a manufactured robot body, which looks amazingly like Scarlett Johansson !She's becomes part of a counter terrorism unit (doesn't really explain much about this) to kill bad guys. Why a few westerners are in futuristic anti terror forces in Japan is also a bit of a puzzle. Shades of oriental female robocop.There is a big high tech corporation, (like in robocop). Some arch baddie is murdering top corporation scientists & management and extracting secret data about the corporation. The unit is sent to find out who it is and track them down. Turns out Mz Johansson wasn't the first guinea pig for a brain op, There were many others who did not survive. But one did and he's out for revenge. The corporation took his life and body away from him and then botched a brain transplant.She finds him, and discovers not only she wasn't the first there were some 98 killed for experimentation. Oh and her memories were implanted and fake.She discovers she was a runaway girl, they abducted as brain transplant fodder. She has a pretty boring meeting with her actual mother all though neither seems aware of the relationship. The other guinea pig causing all the trouble was her boyfriend. He was abducted with her and was an earlier brain transplant experiment gone wrong.The big corporation owner, realises Ms Johansson may be a problem (because she has discovered the truth) and sets out to have her 'eliminated'. Bit like in RobocopMz Johansson triumphs, the big corporation owner receives his just deserts, and that's it. She just strips off into her plastic naked suit anytime she needs to dive off a building etc. Basically this films a vehicle for Ms Johansson, acting like agent romanoff, (killing people) However, now in robocop mode and stripping down to her plastic suit 'naked' suit every so often to kill people. Looks good but is rather boring and unsatisfying. Watch once and never again. 6/10",Ghost in the Shell

Later one Geisha-bot tells The Major, ""Commit to the will of Hanka and be destroyed."" The Major is beginning to have glimpses of a former life and cannot figure things out. It isn't until later, the main terrorist Kuze (Michael Pitt) tells her what Hanka Robotics has done. You needed the above because this was quite confusing in the beginning and many of the dialogues went nowhere and we did see sub- titles when Aramaki talks to Cutter (Peter Ferdinando), who is the head of Hanka Robotics and wants The Major, his prize asset, to be kept safe. In his view all humanity will be like her to win wars. She is the perfect soldier. Much of the fighting is in darkened scenes with the camera speeded up so no one can actually tell what is going on and here all we are concerned with is that our girl, The Major, comes out on top and she does. So don't worry. Did I mention that The Major is very pretty? Well, she is. When we first see The Major in a fight, it looks like she is naked. Well, a robot doesn't really need clothes, does one? Anyway you can tell The Major is wearing a skin-like body suit. So no real nudity and yes, we are looking hard to be sure. (I bet ) I suppose in the book she is really naked. (Is there a book?)The setting is in Japan and one would think Japanese would be spoken, but we get it all in English except for when Aramaki talks and then we see sub-titles, but it's all good. Oh, they did make Johansson look somewhat oriental. Notables: Anamaria Marinca as Dr Dahlin who basically put The Major together and repairs her after fights; and Pilou Asbaek as Batou, The Major's partner. This guy is nothing but huge and did a good job as did everyone. A kind of funny thing happened. The Major needs information from a dead Geisha-bot and she decides to Deep Dive into the Geisha-bot's memories. Yes, quite scary but exciting, too, all in the dark, of course and while there in the Deep Dive she sees Kuze, the terrorist she needs to kill. Then something almost goes wrong and Dr. Dahlin pulls her out of the induced trance. It's kind of funny because if we need information we look for a memory chip. There is sort of a disconnect in her human name. We are told she is Mira, but when she looks at her tombstone it says her name is Motoko. Oh, in this future we still see people smoking and drinking beer. Some things never change. You will see hologram ads on the buildings in the city. Necessary? Probably not. This is a good Sci-fi story, but I felt some things were left out, but we did see The Major's mother and that was a good catch. I think we needed to see some of those glimpses of the former human life The Major had and her reactions to them. Hey, we like to see close-ups of Scarlett Johansson. See?

It's a tribute to the film that it takes quite a long time before the first minor inconsistencies arise. But the spirit of the original has been replaced with the spirit of a police procedural. The shell however is well executed - and suffers only from the inevitable feeling that this should be a series not a film.The Japanese original material was far more technical and much less emotional than this adaption - where you get the feeling that most of the characters are the usual Americans with mummy issues. Most of what is good is almost certainly dragged in from Beat Takeshi (who gives not a f*ck about Hollywood).In some ways this is both reasonably faithful and perfectly watchable. That it is a squeezed into the formal corset of a studio picture you already knew and can't seriously complain about. Watch, enjoy, forget, and keep the original on DVD.",Ghost in the Shell
165,quinimdb,Ghost in the Shell,3,7 April 2017,"The concept of the first ever human-robot hybrid is one that is ripe with philosophical questions, but within the first five minutes of ""Ghost in the Shell"", these complex grey moral questions are reduced to blunt black and white answers: ""She isn't just a robot"" says Dr. Ouelet, one of the people who created Major, ""She is a human, she has a soul"". ""She isn't just a robot to me"", says one of the company-men that she was created for, ""She's a weapon"".Of course, they try to force some more pseudo-philosophical nonsense into the film, but it is either contradicted or just doesn't make any sense in the first place, and any nuance or subtlety in the film is completely abandoned. For instance, being the first ever cyborg and having no memory of her past understandably isolates Major, making her question her own identity and her own humanity. In the beginning of the film, the implications of Major's inner struggle are there, yet the screenwriters still felt the need to shove it down your throat by literally having her say she feels so alone. The one line that accurately encapsulates the character of Major and her development throughout the film is ""You need to recognize your uniqueness as a virtue, and then you will be free"", since in the end of the film she embraces her condition and uses it to aid her cause. However, for whatever reason, the line ""What defines us is not our memories, but our actions"" has more emphasis placed on it, being said once in the beginning and once at the end. But if our actions are truly what define who we are, why was it so important that Major remembers her past?Even looking past these inconsistencies, the characters are incredibly underwritten, and Scarlett Johansenn's (possibly intentional but no less boring) wooden performance as her half human character doesn't make it any more engaging. While pretty well acted by Pilou Asbæk, Major's sidekick is nothing but a big hard-boiled pure muscle stereotype. The film clearly tries to imitate ""Blade Runner"" not just in its aesthetic, but in certain concepts and plot points, while simultaneously not at all understanding what made ""Blade Runner"" so good. One is an atmospheric and subtle exploration of what it means to be human, and one climaxes with a cheesy fight against a giant mechanized spider-thing while a bunch of stuff explodes and the ""good guys"" predictably come out on top.",Ghost in the Shell
166,compugor,Cold Future Fantasy Tragedy,5,16 December 2020,"Even Scarlett Johansenn doesn't warm up this effort as she plays a single expression deer-in-the-headlights character in a screenplay that seems to purposely mask the eye-candy factor in favor of making a loss of humanity statement. Pretty kewl action sequences with high-tech special effects, but besides being just weird, it's disappointing overall, especially to those with higher expectations.

167,torrascotia,Ghost in the Shell Exposed.,6,27 April 2019,"If you like a good laugh just read some of the hyper critical reviews of this movie. I am also a fan of the anime however unlike most of them who left a negative review I also like this movie. Hollywood made alot of effort and spent alot on this movie. It's loyal to the source material and it's obviously a joint US and Japanese production. Sadly there are people who really believe that they are smarter than everyone else because they watch anime with subtitles and who pretend to understand things which are actually deliberately opaque. This movie being in English actually exposes the fact that the source material simply isn't that great, it's just okay. It also fails that it simply doesn't make much sense. Having it stripped of the mysticism which comes with being in a foreign language lays bare the actual storyline which is simply not that groundbreaking or deep and that seems to be behind the fanboy rage. You see that cool anime film only they think they know about? Well now everyone does and because it's mainstream they no longer like it. This movie looks fantastic and is true to the anime so its as good a version of GITS live action there is ever likely to be. Ghost was only ever a 6 out 10 story possibly a five but this is far clearer than trying to read badly translated subtitles. Enjoy it for what it is and don't listen to the fanboys who are complaining about what they think it isn't. Funnily enough most of them aren't even Japanese.",Ghost in the Shell
168,destinylives52,Decent Re-Make But Not As Good As The Original,6,13 May 2017,"In this live action re-make of the classic 1995 anime, Scarlett Johansson plays a highly advanced cyborg who has a human brain (which contains her human essence, or ghost) that is placed into a tough, weapons grade body (the shell). She and her team of government agents are tasked with finding a hacker who is killing top executives of a robotics company.Through the crowded streets of Japan littered with giant, holographic advertisements, Johansson's perspective on who she is, what she is fighting for, and who the real enemy is will change the closer she gets to the truth about the hacker.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Ghost In The Shell"" (2017) is the scene when Johansson fights a Spider-Tank using inadequate weapons, forcing her to use her body to save another being that is similar to herself.This iteration of ""G.I.T.S."" dumbs down the complex story lines of the 1995 movie, making the 2017 version easier to understand but less satisfying. It's like driving a Dodge Viper ACR with the engine swapped out for one that belongs in a Toyota Camry to please those with inferior driving skills. ""G.I.T.S."" (2017) misses the whole point of a computer program becoming a sentient life form that seeks to evolve, and the arguments of what life is. As disappointed as I was, this version is somewhat entertaining, and it was fun to see many scenes that were virtually identical to the original movie.

172,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,6,9 April 2017,"Anime has made an impact in western culture since its first introduction in the late 80's, features like Akira, Ninja Scroll and the original Ghost in the Shell made a massive impact on audiences with its visual style, unique storytelling and brutal animated violence. Today, Ghost in the Shell has been adapted by the American filmmakers and does it live to expectations? In way I can say yes but it has its faults, but redeems itself in quality effects, production value and some worthy screen performances.The story is set in the way ahead future, in a time where both man and machine have combined to be a living organisms with enhanced abilities. Advanced cybernetic soldier Major (played by Scarlett Johansson) pursues terror plots and villains to keep the city safe from chaos and destruction. But when visions of her possible past seem to surface, she questions not only who she is, but who is the manipulator of this possible threat.Now I will advise that I haven't seen the original, I had plans to in hopes of finding what was there and wasn't but it's hard to get a copy of it in Australia. From what I watched, it felt like it tries to be faithful to the source material but white being it's own film, not wanting to affect the original's acclaimed status. The plot is straight forward to follow, but I did feel that the themes of the story weren't justified as much, you get a bit here and there but I wanted more and see how characters would have changed and even ask the audience what they would do in a world like that.Visual effects and the production value are really in high value here, with some state of the art CGI, practical make up and a electronic music score that suits to the anime. With visual effects wizards Weta Workshop and other artists credited, they pull off an amazing job that could lead to future award nominations. Acting is pretty much good, with ScarJo being her usual best in a role that's similar to 'Lucy'. She's fit, dazzling and gives whatever she can in her lead role.To wrap this up, GITS packs a wallop on the eye in terms of visual effects, cinematography and style, but it does miss a few steps in terms of the story themes. - 3/5 Check us out on facebook and Instagram- The Autistic Reviewers!",Ghost in the Shell
173,danielharden,A Major Injustice,7,8 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is a very successful Japanese multimedia franchise. It's world and characters have been immortalised in a multitude of manga's, films, video games and animated TV shows. Decades later, now comes the American live action take on the long established Japanese manga/anime. This can be seen as a risky movie, considering the distaste fans and critics alike have taken towards previous live action incarnations of popular anime's such as; 2009's Dragonball Evolution and 2010's The Last Airbender (To be honest who can blame them?). 2017's Ghost in the Shell is far better than any previous American, live action, manga adaptation and I believe its financial failure and large negative reception is quite unjust. Ghost In the Shell (2017) is an enjoyable psychological sci fi thriller with beautiful visuals and a good performance from its 'controversially' cast lead.Scarlett Johansson stars as the film's lead character, Major. Initially a controversial choice due to the fact that Johansson is a white woman being cast as a character who is originally Japanese. But, due to a positive reception from Asian audiences, and the fact that Major is a human brain inside a robotic body (A Ghost in a Shell if you will), the casting choice is a valid one. Johansson proves a great choice for this role, performing in a half robotic, half human kind of way that one would expect the character to behave as. Johansson does a decent job with this film and fans should be pleased.The Ghost in the Shell series features themes of identity, what it means to be human and what separates man from machine? In this film, these themes are dealt with rather well in my opinion, but probably could have done with a deeper investigation. This film feels as if it barely scratches the surface of its subject matter, but also this could have been the intention so that sequels can follow. The world of Ghost in the Shell is vast and the theme of identity is one which can be delved into much deeper, thus the need for sequels is apparent, as evidenced by the sea of source material this film had at its disposal. I believe this film set out to start a potential franchise and thus left room to grow, I don't excuse the films lack of depth entirely, but I understand that this film aimed to act as an introduction to a future series.As I stated, the world of Ghost in the Shell is vast, and here lies the films greatest strength, its visuals. The visual effects and cinematography in this film are phenomenal. Regardless of what peoples opinion on the quality of the films substance is, we can all agree the the films visual style is absolutely superb. The majority of the films budget must have gone towards this and probably explains why the films final climax feels rather anticlimactic, as if they ran out of money due to spending it all on those long establishing shots throughout the film.As a whole, I think that the Ghost in the Shell is an enjoyable psychological sci fi thriller that looks amazing, but could have benefited from delving deeper into its subject matter, and thus having more substance to what is a beautifully stylistic movie. I believe that negative comparisons of this to the original source material is a little unfair, as this is only one film being compared against multiple films, TV shows and manga's. Also this film is pretty much set up for disaster as many fans will be impossible to please. There is so much back catalogue to draw from that someone is always going to be disappointed that, for example, the filmmakers chose this films story over another. So to be honest, I'm surprised this film is as good as it is.",Ghost in the Shell

Scarlet does a good job as the cyborg and the other supporting cast is good too.This movie takes on big similarities but yet crucial differences than the 1995 movie, to the point where you can say they are related and similar in many ways, but ultimately different and lead in directions. Most say the 1995 anime is a much deeper & complex story, I think it's somewhat true, but IMHO not really any much better than the 2017 version. I guess you could say the 1995 version takes it a step further, but I actually liked the dynamics of the 2017 version a bit better. In either case I think both were good and unique in their own waysWhile Scarlet was obviously in really good shape for this (who knows if that her body or just a CGI replica) but it was good how even know it was in a sense her ""skin"" they didn't give her nipples and such as it would have turned it into a cheap flesh flick for sure. Even know the 1995 version did that, still it was an anime, so they can kind of get away with it vs. real life. Kind of like showing gratuitous alien blood is no problem, but human blood is a whole different ratings scale.For those who are loyal to the original version, they might find this a cheap knock off, I saw this first and then watched the 1995 version. In the end I liked them both although I liked the 2017 version better, great effect, and IMHO a bit more believable story, but then again I'm not huge on anime's either, so...",Ghost in the Shell

The Matrix films especially. That said, there is a feeling of being too generic at the same time. The film doesn't create anything new. More of a homage to some of those (much better) previous films.Scarlett Johansson isn't good in the film. She looks very attractive and eye pleasing on screen, but with no personality. She has no charisma. Any fashion model type with a pretty face could have done this role just as well. She has no presence in the film. You can try and excuse it by saying she is trying to act robotic, but no, that is just a lame excuse. She must bring something to the table, instead of being a non-presence. She can't carry a film, not going by this example, at any rate.I'm being very generous by giving it a 6, just because it has a few good action scenes, nice set design, and a few good one-liners said by some of the other characters.

The first minutes are gobsmackingly beautiful and captivating; pulling the viewer to a fascinating weird world, a dystopian reality of captivating extravagance much in the vein of the landmarks like Blade Runner and Total Recall. As soon as the first action scene comes to a close, the film starts falling apart slowly, never quite recuperating any of its initial bravado, shamelessly freefalling into a pool of clichés (the eye-roll-inducing-kind) that ultimately make you stop caring for the characters, the action or even the setting. Yes, even all the praiseworthy designs and atmosphere become tiresomely repetitive. As for the much publicised whitewashing of the central characters, I'm not one to embark into absurd politic discussions; for a source material that is not necessarily ethnic-centric, it's not the whitewashing that's worrying, but how blandly and cringing it is delivered.",Ghost in the Shell

182,joshbarton15,"Perfectly fine, just proves anime does it better",6,1 April 2017,"Marred by whitewashing controversy ever since Scarlett Johansson was cast in the lead role, Rupert Sanders' adaptation of the Japanese manga, Ghost in the Shell, has been released and has a lot to live up to with the 1995 anime version being one of the most influential anime of all time.In the near future, Major (Scarlett Johansson) is the first of her kind: a human who is cyber-enhanced, designed as the perfect soldier to stop the world's most dangerous criminals. When a new terrorist threat reaches a dangerous level, Major is the most qualified to put a stop to it however, the more she investigates, the more she uncovers about her past.Right off the bat, I've got to say that Ghost in the Shell is a truly visually stunning example of sci-fi, Rupert Sanders' film brought to life with some mightily impressive special effects and Jess Hall's cinematography, some of the sweeping shots of the city really wowing me. The score from Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe suits the visual style of the film to a tee and aids this adaptation in bringing the manga to life.As impressed with the visuals as I was, some of the action sequences such as the water fight or the spider tank finale, in comparison to the 1995 anime, don't have the same energy levels to them, which is probably because you could never capture the same vividness that exists in the animation of an anime. It does make me wonder how they'd even go about making a live-action adaptation of something like Akira.The story has been fleshed out some more and changes have been made for this adaptation, which led to film becoming a little weighed down for me. It's an interesting story but there are some serious pacing issues at times, making the film feel a lot longer than it actually is.Coming to the performances, Ghost in the Shell features a quietly impressive lead in Scarlett Johansson, whose emotional range perfectly reflects the progression of both the story and her character's journey. Her performance will most likely be overshadowed by the whitewashing controversy, which I'm sure will lead to some boycotting the film overall but she does give a good performance. Out of all the supporting cast, I'd have to say I enjoyed Pilou Asbæk's performance as Batou the most because, aside from Major, he's the coolest character in this film.I tend to avoid the politics of a film upon release and when looking back on it after. With that in mind, Ghost in the Shell is a perfectly fine adaptation that suffers a little with additional narrative yet serves as a real treat for the eyes and ears.",Ghost in the Shell

Until a friend posted the trailer of this movie on her Facebook. So, thank you, friend. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I was overwhelmed by the cinematography. The colors are so beautiful and so bright. And then I saw Scarlett as a cyborg, I couldn't wait any longer to watch the movie. Her expression and appearance was totally convincing. So cold and flat, like a poker face. Finally I could watch this movie last month. And well, I never thought this movie would be so ""slow"" and ""quiet"". So many technology and science terms I didn't familiar with. And suddenly there was a rumble in a restaurant which I didn't know what that was all about. The point is, I couldn't grasp the plot in one sitting. I think sci-fi is a puzzling genre for my brain, lol. Over all, I really adore the cinematography of this movie. Imagining the future would be exactly like what I've seen in this movie. The ads on the walls look so real and technology and science getting more advanced than today. Anyhow, I didn't get why the shape of cigarette doesn't get any change at all? It just looks the same as today. The foods and the utensils are no different. I think there should've been some differences to make the future reality of this movie much more convincing. Although it's a bit boring, because it made me sleep a little, the ending of this movie's so absorbing. My eyes got teary seeing Major try to save her friend from the past by sacrificing her own self. It was so touching. Maybe the anime version of this movie is more engaging.

In this movie, she wears a suit that comes as close to looking naked as is acceptable in a PG movie.The choice of actors is odd. For the main character, I think someone more athletic, taller and leaner would be a better choice. In some of the scenes when she is wearing the faux nude suit, Scalett Johansson looks kind of chubby. This may be due to the suit or some other reason. But obviously they chose not to fix it in post production.The choice of using Takeshi Kitano is also strange. He has wooden expression and could not even recite the dialogue in English.It looks like the outdoor scenes are shot in Hong Kong, which is odd consider this movie is more related to Japan than Hong Kong.As for the movie plot, it is not too hard to figure out.

This is a story of the first fully adapted cybernetic body with a human mind in a world where everything is moving in the direction of robotic modification.

It's directed by Rupert Sanders and stars Scarlett Johansson as the lead.First of all, I have to say that I was ready to love this movie maybe even more than the original (and that one, I loved). I went into it open-minded, as I do with a lot of movies. I don't nitpick just to sound smart. That's not how it used to be. Because people used to enjoy movies before. And the white-washing controversy was ridiculous. It's an American remake, duh! Did you expect Asian actors in a Western spin on the story? Seriously? I'm not being racist (I find racism disgusting, actually), I just don't understand why are so many people so bothered by white-washing. But anyways, I thought this looked sick. The visuals were amazing, but I was too quick to judge a book by its cover. Because, really, that's only a shell of this movie.I liked how they took creative liberties with the plot and made it something different while sticking to the spirit of the original (and even faithfully recreating some scenes), but it never really feels like being a part of it. You don't get into it, because this world is not explained well enough. And neither are the characters. They are just there, but you don't know them and it's hard to relate. The performances are not bad, but with bland characters, it's a bit forgettable. And so is the entire movie. So, that alone takes the soul away. And only a shell is left. A very pretty shell that is.

187,paulijcalderon,A surprisingly good character exploration,7,31 March 2017,"Pretty good, actually. It was better than I expected. I found the story to be neat. It wasn't just about the action or figuring out this case. Yes, it's set in a futuristic world and yes, it's full of beautiful visuals. But, what surprised me the most was that it evolved to something more than just an entertaining Blockbuster. There's a lot more exploration of what the Major character goes through compared to the original 1995 anime film. She has a personal quest that I actually cared for and it did get a little emotional. I never thought I would get that invested. So, that's something I have to give the movie props for.Of course the action can be underwhelming at parts, but it's still not bad. Maybe I just expected them to take action to a ""Matrix"" level of excitement. But, I can forgive that since, I do prefer a good emotional story rather than a hollow story with amazing action. It does spell out things for the audience at times. It's expected because it has to appeal to a wider audience. Although I think it could have gone without the slight Dumbing down way of explaining things.Performances are good. Scarlett was great as the Major. Sometimes when you get a really famous actor to play a part like this you can just end up seeing the actor instead of the character. This is one of those occasions were I didn't see Scarlett anymore, I saw the Major. I mean it, I was very positively surprised by this film. I was afraid it was one of those situations when a studio adapts something that's very popular to earn some money. But, I could tell the people behind the camera cared to make the best live-action adaption they could. It works as a stand-alone thing.

188,themovieparadise,It's a Fitting Title...,4,2 April 2017,"The title ""Ghost in the Shell"" is the perfect way to describe this movie. It has a fantastic looking exterior with a hollow interior. The film looks impeccable. All the production design is incredible looking. I don't know how much was adapted straight from the anime, and what is original to the movie, but it all looked fantastic. Everything from the costumes to the city shots of futuristic Japan was just incredible to watch. The problem with this movie is that, while the visuals are all fantastic, it's absolutely hollow on the inside. There is nothing below the surface for this movie. It doesn't have any real emotion, nor does it deliver on any kind of profound philosophical ideas. It's just boring and bland. Every now and then there are some cool action scenes, but they are so fleeting and scarce that they don't accommodate for the rest of the movie.",Ghost in the Shell
189,bernie-122,Speechless,3,3 April 2020,"I have been following Scarlett Johansson since she first appeared on the scene. Though she was a little robotic at first, it wasn't long before she got the hang of it. I became convinced that there couldn't be a truly bad movie as long as she was in it. This one came very close to proving me wrong. I suspect she might have done it in some spare time between real movies just to pick up some pocket change. I can't think of any other reason why she would agree to participate in this mess. Ok, I am at a little disadvantage here; I am not a fan of movies made from comic books. I think a film should present some form of intellectual challenge, else it tends to be a waste of time. Nor did I see the original, but I see from the reviews here that it wasn't really necessary. Maybe I'm just too old for this sort of thing. No... It really is crap.",Ghost in the Shell
190,mochteam,Incredible visuals but confusing & uninteresting plot,6,12 August 2017,"I've watched the anime just like everyone else growing up and I've seen all the anime movies for the series. Ghost in the Shell really isn't a series you just jump into it has a pretty complex story line in a complex world with complex characters. The anime itself takes a while to get into but how would it stand up as a movie?The movie was okay. It was confusing in the 1st part and started to come together in the second part but just knowing about the other interesting things that take place in the Ghost in the Shell universe it just seemed pretty boring. Section 9 is pretty much like a secret A-Team. The come in and handle the Governments dirty work. I kind of expected to see that plot come into play but it's about ""The Major"". The Major is a main character but Ghost in the Shell isn't about her. Matter of fact sometimes she's just there as a background character. Ghost in the Shell is about Section 9 working together to catch terrorists and foil plots their plots.The Major's character is intelligent,strong and a true mercenary. She doesn't show any weaknesses. She just gets the job done and done well. Watching the movie I felt like it broke way from her character in the Anime series and made her too human and fragile. What killed me though is that they gave her a background and revealed it and that is the main plot of the movie. In the Anime ""The Major"" is a complete mystery and that's what kind of makes her character. She has all these abilities but little is known about who she really is.That big change they made kind of made the movie feel less ""Ghost in the shell like"". Section 9 takes a back seat and even though the names are there you never really get to know any of the team the way you should. I think maybe if they made a sequel they would be able to focus more on section 9 like they should have but with the way this movie sunk at the box office I doubt there will be one.The so called white washing of characters is mainly just 1 character. ""The Major"" I don't think it was really fair for the movie to get bashed so much but Scarlett's wooden acting in any movie she plays in didn't help make her role believable.I think this is a movie that would do better as it gains sequels where more of the Ghost in the Shell stories is released. Kind of like the anime it takes a while to dive into and grow on you.",Ghost in the Shell
191,rdvljunk,"an insult, no more or less",2,17 January 2018,"I admit, I'm angry. If you dare to take a phylosophical animation masterpiece and turn it into a turd like this, you should be banned from movie making. An story about what is existance has been turned into a basic action pic with good against evil, and in the most horrible basic form. If you want to know what they did to the movie/story, take the scene in the boat of the two movies which is a clear representation of what is wrong with this 2017 movie...from a 3min discussion about what is it that makes us us, to a simple ""i trust you"".For those that say we can not compare them or ""you shouldn't expect the same thing"" I say this: that is total BS...it's like converting Tolstojs ""war and peace"" into a basic ladies romatic pulp novel and still call it Tolstojs ""war and peace"".
Hollywood has a basic mold: we need a good guy, we need a bad guy (if we want to make it shocking we create a bit of confusion about who's the real bad guy). Then we need a lot of shooting and explosions/fighting (preferably with some superpowers) with some last minute rescues, and as cherry on the pie one or two basic ""emotional"" moment, usually love scenes, a dying side kick or reunion with a lost family member/friend.
That is hollywood standard, 95% of the movies fit in this mold. I was in the theatre recently, having to watch all the trailers of coming movies and I noticed: they are all the sameGiTS 1995 was about existence and ethics, about technology impacting society. The chase for the puppet master was the storyline to which it was connected. Maybe it is too slow and contains too much philosophy for these days audiences and the public has been dumbed down too far to appreciate a bit of thinking. Hey, even a basic remake of mad max made it to the oscars...enough saidOh, get lost Hollywood, trying to make a buck by using past masterpieces and mold them into your standard meaningless molds, not being to come up with something creative yourself an extra point for the descent acting and good visuals.",Ghost in the Shell
192,mbhgkmsgg,Ghost in the Shell,6,19 March 2021,"For a movie that has an incredibly exciting and interesting premise, Ghost in the Shell feels surprisingly hollow. If it weren't for the fact that I'm a huge fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, I probably would've found this film to be even more devoid of meaning. While it is technically speaking great, and while it manages to capture the cyberpunk feel perfectly (at least as far as I'm concerned), the story and the characters feel utterly shallow.Now, I should note that this was my first touch into the Ghost in the Shell franchise. I have never read the manga or seen any of the animated films, so it is entirely possible that those versions offer the depth that I found myself searching for. In fact, having heard nothing but great things about the original animated film, that probably is the case.
Bringing the focus back to this particular film, I want to start with the good things, as I did feel like there were quite a few of them.
First of all, as I already mentioned, this film was technically speaking great. Although the dystopian cyber infused world did often feel a bit empty, the way it captured the gloomy neon-filled cityscape, more than made up for it. I have always been a fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, and everything that comes with it, and I certainly found myself often enamoured by what I was seeing on screen.
Another aspect that I quite appreciated, was how good everything looked. There are plenty of moments that are filled with 'futuristic' effects and beings, and everything looked great. For a film like Ghost in the Shell, it is, of course, crucial that that be the case, as the only way it will ever make any impact, is by making the viewer believe in the world that it is building.With all that being said, the unfortunate reality still remains, that this film just isn't particularly good. Its greatest downfall comes in its inability to leave an impact. The story, while seemingly filled with great ideas and questions that challenge us to think about humanity and its infatuation with technology, never quite manages to bring forth those ideas in an impactful manner. This could, again, be different in the manga or the animated film, but as far as this live-action version is concerned, I found myself yearning for more. What astonishes me is the relatively short run-time. Especially nowadays, when movies with a run-time of over two hours are commonplace, I would've thought that a film that clearly has so much to say, would've reached at least those two hours. In fact, I can't come up with any other reason as to why this is than the fact that the focus was so heavily on worldbuilding, that everything else was forgotten about. Indeed, despite its short run-time, there are plenty of scenes that add nothing else to the film, but something nice to look at. These moments, which could've been used for building up the characters and thus making the final moments that much more impactful, are, instead, used for what can only be described as eye-candy.More than anything, I'm disappointed by Ghost in the Shell. Going in, knowing nothing about the story or the world, I was intrigued from the very get-go. However, as I quickly realized, this film wasn't what it at first seemed to be. By throwing aside the deeper conversation about the themes that are relevant throughout, it managed to be nothing more than average. In fact, I assume that I liked this film more than I should have, simply because I cherished the world it built around its story.",Ghost in the Shell
193,boris_unanimate,Pretty decent,6,1 April 2017,"Having watched a gazillion adaptations that either failed or were mediocre, I was wondering where GITS would land. Well, it landed pretty well, but maybe not as well as most fans of the anime had hoped, or maybe it landed better than some people wished it would, because, you know, haters gonna hate.To be frank, I haven't ever watched the anime completely, mostly in parts when it was on TV when I was a kid, but I've known all about it from popular media. So this would probably disqualify me to judge a movie I haven't been the biggest fan of? Nope, just like never having read The Lord Of the Rings wouldn't disqualify anyone watching the films and thinking they're pretty amazing. If you like movies and sci-fi, you shouldn't have to be a full-fledged anime or GITS fan to appreciate this one.People who watched it with me said it was a verbatim copy of the anime, with certain scenes being identical to the original, and then some scenes were added because you can't make a 100 min movie with 80 minutes of anime. But still, if you didn't watch the original, you will not miss anything, because the movie is packed with action, car chases, cyborgs killing humans and other cyborgs, big guns, little guns, and more BIG guns - I don't wanna spoil it for you, but there will be a lot of guns.There are a few reasons you wouldn't want to watch this adaptation. One, you don't like anime. The other being the controversy about white washing this one, with Scarlett Johansson starring as the the main protagonist. I find it interesting that people complain about this, but almost never complained to all the non-Asian characters in anime, and there are a lot. How else do you explain blondes in animes? The whole white washing was rubbish brought forth by people who didn't even watch the final product but chose to voice the inner insecurities in the worst way possible.I suggest you see for yourself what it's about and either try to enjoy a pretty decent flick which does not hold back on action and good story telling, or you can watch it and then complain about all the things that annoyed you. I'm not a fan of Scarlett Johansson and I still enjoyed it (although I'd rather seen Karen Gillan in this role, but that's just me) because it had Takeshi frickin' Kitano in it, one of the most amazing Japanese actors ever.",Ghost in the Shell
194,residentgrigo,I give my consent to terminate this movie,3,7 April 2017,"US sci-fi films temporarily fell off a cliff in the 90s, with only great visuals as the saving grace. Judge Dredd or Demolition Man come to mind, especially as both are as badly cast and acted as GitS. Let's address the universally praised visuals first. The film technically looks nice but none of it will stick with you due to the exceptionally bland setting. Seriously, where is this film set? The best looking bits also ape the source material nearly 1 to 1. Van Sant's Psycho ""remake"" comes to mind... Well done VFX crew but your hard work was sadly wasted. I am also not sure if the films even has music, a hallmark of GitS, but you occasionally get to hear 10 second bits by a choir with no rhyme or reason. Sigh. On to the cast.Kitano mostly sits on a chair and looks sleepy, Asbæk completely gets Batou (my favorite anime character) wrong and I will come to Johansson later. Let's stick with Batou and only the 2 generic villains gets something to do too. The writer apparently though that the audience is too dumb to understand the concept of his iconic cybernetic eyes, so the film gives a bewildering origin story for them. That's how dumb and random the script is. It also includes the term ""lawless zone""! What this films doesn't have time for is to explain basic GitS terminology, while other elements are over explained to an unreasonable degree. The film also takes scenes and plot points from both anime films, and both TV seasons of SAC, despite the two having vastly different continuities. Act 1 and 2 are thus best described as GitS for the mentally impaired and squeamish, as the PG-13 proves about as unsuited as everyone expected. Many scenes even randomly stop and the film is badly edited too. To a degree that it becomes hard to make out what happens! On to act 3 and the protagonist.Johansson can act, just not in this film. She is less sleepy than Kitano but one of the strongest female characters in ALL of anime was reduced to a borderline incompetent combatant and most importantly a doe eyed idiot. All of this is ""technically"" supported by the predictable twist ending but it proves to be the worst bit of the film by FAR. Don't get me wrong. The first 100-ish minutes bored and irritated me but we are talking about a 4/10, not a 1/10. Yes, act 3 is THAT bad. Would you like it if a Batman film ended with the protagonist turning out to be a random teenager from the other side of the world? Something similar basically happens here. Motoko's military career and much more, a unifier for all GitS canons, just get taken away. WTF and the film flat out stops to ""excuse"" the (somewhat justified) whitewashing allegations by creating a vaguely racist black hole of bad ideas that can only appeal to someone who hates the source material or can't be bothered to think during a CG film. The only thing missing is romance sub-plot. No one in the film is capable of human emotions, so we dogged 2 bullets here. The films thus ends up being much worse than I ever expected and is best described as the ""new"" Fan4stic or Dragon Ball Evolution for comic films. Don't watch it if you ever cared about any of the anime versions and watch those instead if you never did! All 3 canons are great. This though ain't cyberpunk, it's cybertrash. The newly announced GitS anime (how convenient...) and hopefully Blade Runner 2 now need to ""save"" the cyberpunk sub-genre, while the promising Alita: Battle Angel will have to do the same for US / Life Action anime. Good luck Mr. Rodriguez!",Ghost in the Shell
195,Harhaluulo54,I decided I would like it before I saw it - and I did - but was it good?,5,4 May 2017,"Short answer: It was nothing special.Long answer:My Experience with GiTS franchise:I have seen every anime and read every manga related to GITS. I even saw about half of the stuff in both English and Japanese dubs. Most of the stuff were rather enjoyable experiences, but none were truly memorable nor did they give me new standards for quality. Except GITS SAC 2 which has a special place in my praise. Thus far my favorite TV related content goes in about this order: GITS SAC 2, GITS SAC 1, Arise, 1995 movie, THIS 2017 movie, SSS, 2, 2.0, 2015 movie, and lastly the re-cut content and alternative cuts.1995 movie and live action adaptation:It's no secret that the 1995 movie had a huge impact even on the western medium. Movies such as The Matrix were inspired and would've not been made without the impact GiTS had. Live action adaptation was obviously a huge cake to bite into.The director - Rubert Sanders - has only directed one other movie before this. Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). The execution and originality that movie offered were definitely not disappointing. However I do wish Luc Besson had directed GiTS instead. Which leads us to the next part.Maturity:We're in the PG-13 limbo. The rating itself is terrifying. For any GiTS fan that automatically implies out of character behavior, censorship, downgrading, lack of philosophy, politics and intelligence. Basically with this 2017 movie we are seeing a GiTS adaptation which is everything GiTS franchise isn't about. The nature of this live action adaptation is simply casual action while the 1995 movie was about existence and the layers of humanity. The Luc Besson movie, Lucy (2014) - also starred by ScaJo, is -despite being called a pseudo-intellectual movie - ultimately smarter, more mature and was closer to GiTS in nature than this 2017 GiTS movie is. Differences:While similar in visual execution, backdrop copying and retro behind the surface this movie is completely different. I would like to use the title itself as an example. The SHELL of this movie appears nearly identical to the one 1995 has, but the soul (GHOST) is nearly the opposite. ScaJo appears more human, ""girly"" and emotional than Major ever was. While in SAC 2 we got to see more about Major's past, this movie made her appear weak and lost despite being tough, badass and overpowered. The characterization is very typical Hollywood style and initially much worse. Yet at the same time the casting and style is very Japanese. It is a mix which works about as impressively as multicultural Europe. Being PG-13 this is the least mature GiTS series. The story and world seem shallow and just ""normal"" instead of the one in SAC and 1995 where you basically had to learn to hunt your meal while in 2017 you get spoon-fed with an airplane, just open your mouth!Conclusion:For those who don't watch anime: This is worth your while if you enjoy blockbuster action, but want to see something bit different. For GiTS fans: You should expect to be disappointed because that is the only way you might not be.",Ghost in the Shell
196,jaredd,Is the hate deserved?,7,12 June 2021,"Most of the hate seems to revolve around cultural appropriation and stealing from the original. Well sure, it's a modern remake of the original with the same name but for US audiences. I don't think it's realistic to expect something different!I don't see anyone complaining about Cowboy Bebop's ""cultural appropriation"" of western cowboys, so why is it a problem here? Well, the answer is too obvious to even say.With that out of the way, I do think the film had some problems. ScarJo just didn't seem to fit her role, in my opinion. Not enough of a dramatic actress and also not really a top action star. I think Lucy also suffered from the same issue. I did like her in The Island though!Beyond that I do think the story needed a bit of work. It didn't pull me in quite enough because I felt like I already knew what was going to happen. Possibly a byproduct of this being a remake? It really should have been an independent film. Go ahead and use Ghost in the Shell IP, but change it up.All in all, I did really enjoy this film well enough.",Ghost in the Shell

198,shide_85,New benchmark for effects though dropping the ball on depth in the storyline.,6,2 April 2017,"Strong 6Pre-word: This movie is not depicting one movie or series from the Ghost in the Shell enterprise. It draws from most of them in clear ways with clear ""classical"" scenes. There is likely to be of one of three reasons; The producers wants to make sequels - telling the writers to combine story lines.  The idea to make a complex movie in line with the original one (as most scenes are in line with that) was scrapped by producers thinking it would be to complicated for the audience, which meant a new unoriginal story.  The writers and director wanted to maximize the core audience by giving all of them ""a piece of the movie"".In short: Those watching the movie as a first contact with the enterprise and decide to take it further (watch the original after, which is the order i recommend) will most likely be happy they did so. For those not new there is a big risk of disappointment on the storyline even though the effects and actors almost completely measure up. The sound was OK, but could have been a lot better.Overall there was a great storyline (or rather several great story lines) to choose from and instead of picking one and following it someone made the choice to weave in multiple threads from the original movie, the second movie and both series*. So instead of making one of the complicated story lines come through well several were mashed together. As a result the storyline is the foremost let down and underwhelms you at most turns in the movie. The CGI, staging and effects can't weigh up for that even though they basically set the new benchmark for movies (moving beyond the last Star Trek). Also regarding the effects they overtake the symbolism and depth you still had in the movies (aka colordistinction is played down), don't get me wrong - it actually ads to the realistic side but it also detracts from the depth.In longer SPOILERS BELOW: Regarding the cinematography it is pretty much aced, there are some weaker spots but not many. You can also see where the inspiration of some of the elements comes from; Total Recall (2012) (the elevated roads foremost), Robocop (2014) (tanks, weaponry, parts of the new storyline) and Star trek: Beyond (2016) (cityscape - though taking it one level further as a finished product).Regarding the storyline: In defense of Rupert Sanders I do think it was in an attempt to give the followers more of the epic moments of the story, but by cherrypicking out (the right moments) without having the same storyline and editing in new elements into them it falls short and underwhelms me often. What i would have wanted was one of the movies or a series presented in one movie. Not several woven together, the feeling is not one of a complete movie but of several combined in a too short space. It's somewhat close, but by dropping the ball on the depth in the storyline this goes from what could have been a real classic sci-fi right in time to another Star Trek: Beyond (2016)where effects are there for the cause of the effects and the storyline comes second.CGI The cinematography is pretty much there. The creation of a ""new"" world works, the fascistic dystopian future feels real enough, and is on par with a movies such as Sleepy Hollow (2013) in creating a reliable world. But there are misstakes, one of the larger ones is missing making the inner symbolism from the original Ghost in the Shell where the outside (City) reflects the inner system (read; ghost or soul) laid clear with Motoko's cyborg body and thus cybernetic (software a la matrix) connection. In the original movie it was clearly marked out with the streets in bright orange and the cityscape becoming bluer and darker the higher you went. Here the reflection of the sky and Motoko's swimming (odd hobby for a cyborg) comes into play (whoever decided to ruin that shot with CGI, I'm not your fan - it could easily have been done in a real shot).SPECIFIC SPOILERS BELOW *There are parts of ""classical moments"" captured, as when the arms break, the Yakuza hotel, the fight with active camouflage and crossing a bridge to mention a few. There are also parts of ""classical moments"" that have been more or less ruined in this version (which entails several as the new storyline unfolds). Seeing as so many parts of the enterprise was now tied in (the depiction of Motoko's cyborg body differentiates between the movies/series) you could now make the argument of whitewashing legitimately. SPECIFIC SPOILERS ABOVEPro's  CGI and effects (some effects taking movies to a new level)  Budget  Possibly a trilogy in the worksCon's  Storyline (missing depth) by trying to weave several complicated threads together in too short space  Classical moments redone  Too harsh cut  Origa is missing  PG-13 - missing goreEnd notes: It's probable that it's wrapped this hastily because of a trilogy is in the works (the combination of storyline into one broader plot and the section 9's pre-shoot training camp, for relatively short time on screen together hints that) IF the first movie does sell well. It's ironical that by trying to tie the story lines together by combining several complicated story lines they maybe created the very thing that would make that project not happen (a first movie that makes less revenue than arguebly needed). On the other hand a lot of the rather complex details have been solved so I wouldn't rule one out just yet as it can probably be made a lot cheaper. One direct connection to reality is made about consent (whoever reads the EULA through?) and the five eyes - strong for a large movie like this.",Ghost in the Shell

Yes, the story doesn't have the complexity and philosophical questions that the original 1995 film possessed, but they gave a damn good try to live up to the original. The futuristic world is created with glorious result, the storyline changes made the protagonist much more compelling to watch and the music was pretty epic too.

200,Brevin_Campbell,Why do I feel so broken inside,5,2 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is undoubtedly the best American anime live action film. But that is the highest praise I can really give this film. As much as Ghost in the Shell tries to recreate its original source material it just can't live up to it. And saying that really breaks my heart cause I really wanted to love this film so much more. But it just is not what it needs to be and instead feels like a hollow shell with no ghost inside. To start off with the positives. You have heard it before, but visually this film deserves soo much love. I wouldn't even be shocked if it got a lot of technical awards at the the Oscars. Cause this film defiantly deserves that much. And the visually speaking it is very true to what Ghost in the Shell was. I got goosebumps whenever I saw a scene recreated from the original manga, films, or ovas. It made me quite giddy with happiness seeing them. The film has a visual flare to it that makes it so strong and even helps many of the scenes. Scarlett Johanson also despite all the controversy I do think still thinks embodies the role of the Major in a amazing way, I enjoyed her character quite a bit. She does go revert from having a stale performance for parts of the film which could be seen as Rupert Sanders not really understanding how to give a performance with nuance, but there are more scenes where I feel Scarlett really does come out as the major who desires to learn more about who she is. As for story to tell you the truth there were some parts of the story I actually really liked. No it wasn't as complex as the original, but the basic ideas where still there. I was really enjoying parts of the story a lot I just wished the went a bit further on some of the points laid out and tried to be a bit more complex.Towards the negatives of the film is the fact that as I said why the basic ideas are still there they never really expand upon them and try anything really different like the original did. Honestly Blade Runner, All of the Matrix films and many other sci fi films feel like they did a better job on the ideas that Ghost in the Shell (the original) created. The film just tries to be to safe. It doesn't go as deep on any of the ideas it presents. I won't say it feels Hollywood cause as i said the ideas are still there and the film isn't as action focused as it should be. Now people talk about the whitewashing of a Japanese character and before this film came out I was pretty OK with it and through the first half of this film I was OK with it, but this film does something at the end that makes me feel wrong and strange. There is a choice they make at the end that will undoubtedly be the deciding factor on if u like or hate this film. Overall as hard as Ghost in the Shell tries to honor its source material and be engaging it in the end falls short of what could have been something truly magnificent.",Ghost in the Shell
201,mwcrunner,"Boring, dull and stupid",2,1 April 2017,"What a crappy movie this is. Once again Scarlett Johansson has walked right into another crappy sci-fi action movie and it's even more ridiculous then Lucy. I also know this is based off of a mid- 90's anime film which is rated R for violence and nudity while this remake of it only has a PG-13 rating. I mean I understood the plot of this, but hardly. Besides nobody in the entire theater knew what was going on throughout the movie. We see Scarlett being created as a cyborg android that fights other robots and terrorists, but really had no memory of her origins and that she was created by an evil corporate business man bent on getting more fortune. That's also a resemblance to the guy who directed this. He had to have money. Also this was sort of like Robocop, only a bad version of it. Also they never explain what year this film takes place in future Tokyo, Japan. This film should've been scrapped and burned in a fire. I even fell asleep through some of it that it was so boring. There's not very much action to this pile of s... Scarlett needs to stop being in these pieces of crap and stick with being Black Widow in the Marvel movies.

Most of the time the Major didn't even know she was Japanese before they transferred her mind into the robot. She thought she was an American or a European, I don't remember... The change of Motoko's race was literally the only thing in this entire movie that was given a proper explanation. Within the context it worked. Everything else, though, just doesn't make even a shred of sense, and, apart from the music and the acting, there is nothing to speak of here. Seriously, the music is pretty nice, and the acting was also pretty nice, although it will probably not win any significant awards. Scarlett Johansson is excellent in her role, of course, and Takeshi Kitano also stands out.But that is it. The acting and the music cannot save this movie. Not when everything else is so bad.Let me start with the most disappointing thing. The production design is incredibly weak, actually, which is something I didn't expect. Sure, the movie is colorful and almost nice to look at, but it makes less sense than the design of Michael Bay's 'Transformers'. 'Ghost in the Shell' is, obviously, heavily influenced by 'Blade Runner', which I have no problem with, but it actually looks much, and I mean much worse. What is worse, from afar you see a big, bright, colorful city, but the design of the places where the action is happening is made with, apparently, the budget and the imagination of a ""Killjoys"" episode. (I like ""Killjoys"", don't get me wrong, but the entire show is probably cheaper than a day of filming of this movie.) The design is just not there, you just see ordinary streets, an ordinary bar, ordinary buildings... Every time they show the city from afar, you see these huge holograms, but the characters never interact with them. They never even go close to them. Also, do you really think the citizens would allow these huge glowing holograms to exist? To glow in their windows day and night? Because I don't think so. Pretty colors for the sake of pretty colors do not make good production design.Now, the script. This is where the real pain is. The script makes 'Transformers' look like 'The Prestige'. Seriously, it is incredibly dumb and, at the same time, incredibly pretentious. There is no humor, there is no lighthearted tone, everything is doom and gloom and, supposedly, ""deep"" messages that don't ring true, because they are, in fact, no deeper than a glass of bad wine. I am sorry, but if you're going to make a movie with a message about technology, go and learn something about technology, for F's sake. When you do not even know what the Internet is, how can I take your message seriously? Also, if you want to make a message movie, make sure you don't make it contradict itself at every step. When a character says he does not want to feed his dogs because he does not want to scare them, do not show him feeding a dog half an hour later. When your movie is centered around a character who is essentially a weapon, do not show me another character saying that a violent mind can be a problem. When you make a big deal of the fact that a character cannot enter a certain room and cannot do anything to stop whatever is going on in that room, do not show the same character shoot through the window of the same room and kill the only living person inside the room just a few seconds later. This is moronic, sorry. And I can go on with that, I just don't want to. And, I beg you, when a part of your message is that modern technology is bad, do not insert it into a massive blockbuster that cannot be made without modern technology. Does anyone fail to see the irony here?Anyway, I am going to stop here. This movie... I wanted it to be better, and I expected more. I am disappointed. Sorry.",Ghost in the Shell
206,texshelters,"In an attempt to be true to the anime series, Ghost in the Shell fails to be a decent film.",3,3 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell: pure anime, and that's the problemIn an effort to look like an anime story, ""Ghost in the Shell"" (GitS) ends up looking like a cartoon and not a live feature. From the beginning, the CGI looks, well, cheesy. It is terrible. 1982's ""Blade Runner"" had a better look than GitS. The best effects were when the filmmakers used real sets and enhanced them with CGI. Perhaps if you are 13, you won't mind. You might actually enjoy that it looks like a video game with out-of-date graphics. For older audiences, the cartoonish look stands out.So it looks bad, so what, you ask. The dialogue is also as bad as much of Japanese anime as well. I couldn't keep up with the terrible lines, writing in the dark of the theater. However, I am sure the writers had a book of clichés for the script, or perhaps they just borrowed from the anime series. The acting is terrible, even Johansson as Major. It's a terrible role, and I must admit, I have never seen her as a great actress, just a good action star. She has no chance to be good anything here with the terrible material she is given. There are two standouts: Takeshi Kitano who plays Aramaki, Major's boss and Michael Pitt who plays Kuze, the criminal Ghost/Shell. Pitt is creepy, endearing, sympathetic and dangerous. He and Kitano are the two winners in this fiasco. Did I mention the music. At least some bombs have great music, but here, the music is overwrought and unoriginal. It's as if they stole that from the anime series as well or were told, ""Hell, just throw something emotional in there, it's got Scarlett Johansson, no one will notice."" Well, when almost everything else in the film is below average, we will notice the terrible music. Rating: I want my money back. A half an hour in, I was cringing at the look and dialogue, the incoherent plot elements, and the lack of back story for the near future world. This might have been better as a TV series. And by the lack of an audience, word of mouth won't save this film. Peace, Tex Shelters",Ghost in the Shell
207,urthpainter,3D visual FEAST,8,4 April 2017,"First and for most, to the point, right off the bat - Ghost in the Shell is one beautiful 3D movie. And if you get to see it in an IMAX theater? Count yourself lucky.This movie should have been advertised as a cyberpunk, Bladerunner like experience, highlighting visuals, sound, music and effects. Instead they tried to sell it as a Scarlet action movie. A huge mistake.I can't think of a release in the last several years that opens itself up to so much potential negative critique. Casting? Check. Remake of classic that can never please some fans? Check. Obviously more, but that would get boring in a hurry... point is people can come at this movie from a lot of different angles, often with a lot of expectation built in.But for the few who can put expectation aside, or to whom the story and characters are brand new? This is a rock solid piece of entertainment bringing Asian cyberpunk to American audiences. It is full of incredible ideas including cybernetic enhancement, ghost hacking and more than one question aimed at reality itself.The visuals! Just spectacular! and it is worth watching the credits just to see all the houses, teams and names of people who worked on this movie. While GitS does feel sectional, with each scene being a different project - the visual style itself is very consistent and at times truly magical. I am very critical of CG effects, their overuse, and the muddy visual style that often is the result of a complete screen makeover.Not here. Like Dr. Strange the effects are clean, unique with proper lighting and contrast. The cityscape shots with crazy enormous animated holograms are especially nice. The visual details are everywhere - the way people look, their mods - constantly asking visual questions and providing something fascinating to look at. The effects are Brilliant. The sound and soundtrack? Perfect compliment to the visuals.I also think casting is amazing, including Scarlet. The casting is so good that we really don't get enough time with any of the characters except Major, and really, she's not a very interesting protagonist. This comes through in Scarlet's mostly wooden performance, which could be argued fits, but that does little to improve what is actually there.Story wise (and i hinted i wouldn't go here), I have to ask, ""if this was a carbon copy remake of the original anime, just live action, would it be a better movie?"" The answer is yes, it would be better. All the lifts from the anime worked beautifully, all the changes? Not improvements. The biggest change involving Major's origin story which is left beautifully vague in the anime, which I feel works much better regarding the overall chaos of the world in which they live. The dialog at times is very explanatory instead of simply serving story. The original anime is a challenging movie that needs to watch 2 or 3 times to catch the details. The same can not be said regarding the story of this version, which by comparison spoon feeds the information. But... imo the original GitS is a 10/10 masterpiece. Expecting another film on this level is a lot to ask for, and while not as good, this remake does justice to the franchise. Why?The visuals! My goodness! I actually want to pay for another 3D IMAX showing to soak it in again. So impressive, and it is really nice to see effect work that pushes way beyond the ordinary.Ghost in the Shell is exactly the type of movie that gets crushed at the box office, but finds a cult following later in its life. In this case, in the form of VR headsets that will present the 3D and effects when home versions are released. balanced toward sound, visuals and effects - but with such excellence... 8 out of 10!",Ghost in the Shell
208,itsactuallyamanda,"not as good as the original, but it is considered ""average""",7,24 April 2017,"Being a fan of anime and the Ghost In The Shell series, i was pretty excited to see the anime story come to life in this movie. I had thoughts that it was not going to be as good as the original but after seeing this, its not amazing but it gets an ""average"" from me. The CGI and special effects in this movie did make it feel like you were in the future-day Japan. I also never expected an high-class actor such as Scarlett Johansson to be in this anime movie but her acting was again, average. The positives of this movie is that the soundtrack in the movie and the makeup and costumes made this movie compare to the original Ghost In The Shell. if they added a little more to this movie, i would of given it a higher score but for now, i will give it an 7 but again this movie was not as good as the original but it is considered average.",Ghost in the Shell
209,greggman,Same as the original - Pretty but Bad,6,17 November 2020,"I never liked the original anime. I've watched it 3 times. Once when it came out, one like 10 years later to give it another chance. One more time before I watched this remake. Of course I loved the setting and the visuals but the story itself was meh.This remake is really no different. It's visually beautiful but ultimately a bad story. Anime fans will nitpick the differences but it doesn't matter. It feels exactly the same and is pretty but unsatisfying.Hyper PC people will complain about ScarJo being white completely ignoring the original creator giving his full blessing to the idea. She was fine in the role.Ultimately both the original and this are more about art then any story. Like many Japanese movies and anime it's lots of cool vignettes and poses but little substance. I'm not saying all Japanese movies or anime are like that but there is definitely a portion that fit that stereotype. Battle Angel Alita is another as is arguably even Akira.I'll still watch this again as like background while doing other things because I like looking at the scenery.",Ghost in the Shell
210,RoboRabbit89,A half way decent sci-fi thriller.,5,10 October 2017,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love Ghost in the shell, I became a fan I think back in 2004 when I saw Stand Alone Complex on Cartoon Network.Now I would dis-scribe myself as a ""Micro-fan"" because I've only seen the original 1995 version, It's 2004 sequel and the new 2016 movie, but a fan non the less.As for this 2017 live action take on the franchise I thought it was OK at best, I didn't come away for it hating it, on the contrary I think it's an average cyber thriller, it has some cool visuals and some decent action sequences but I did feel a little underwhelmed by the film as a whole. Mainly because this was made only
aimed for the fan base, and not for the mainstream audience. So I don't think
many people will be wowed or blown away by this. Besides it's forgettable, you
won't remember anything from it in a day or two.Rupert Sanders the director, I think since he came from a visual effects background, only cares about that stuff only, and not the characters. Which is a shame because I think the movie would have been much better if he did. (Now this is just pure speculation at this point). As for the guy who played Chief Aramacki, he was OK but he should of spoke in English because all of his scenes are awkward.Scarlet Johansson was pretty good as The Major, she was kind of cool and very sexy in her therm-optic camouflage suit which makes her look naked. I felt she was the best out of the cast, the actor who played Batou was OK but I felt he didn't bring much to the roll, he didn't make the character his own, I can tell stuck with the script.Overall I still liked it and would watch it again, It's just a forgettable little action movie. I do feel strongly that fans deserve a REAL Ghost in the Shell movie someday, but I at least felt that this was a nice try, even though it was a box office bomb.I give it a 5.1/10 not great but it's decent to watch on a rainy day.",Ghost in the Shell
211,RubyMouse,Great stylish fun,6,26 April 2017,"This is a beautiful looking film, re-creating the colouring and overall feel of the original. Johansson is far better than I expected and - even simplified - the story is intelligent enough in comparison to many current films. For me, it would be hard to give this a very poor review as it is so very derivative but while it looks the part, it doesn't really add anything new and actually feels a little dated with all it's 90s cyberpunk references.

212,keikoyoshikawa,Poor Imitation of the Originals,2,30 October 2019,"This Hollywood version pales in comparison to the anime series and movies. Borrowing heavily but loosely from the first anime movie and a bit from the second, this GITS lacks the narrative coherence and philosophical impact of the originals.Story: The writing is just bad, like it is made by a junior high school kid doing a poor job of cut-and-paste. What made the original GITS movies classics was not simply the subject matter - cyborgs and e-terrorism - but what that implies for those who are heavily modified. The Hollywood version completely fails to understand this and thus misses the mark by a wide margin. It is merely empty eye-candy.Visuals: The CGIs are cool, but sadly do not really add or advance the story or the experience. The most glaring examples include the opening scene, the running chase, and the end fight. The Hollywood versions are so poorly done that it makes you wonder why they even bothered. I heard that Mamoru Oshii, the director of the two original films, praised this movie. I think he may have been simply polite, because quite frankly the Hollywood versions are insultingly bad.Casting: It doesn't matter if non-Japanese actors were cast - after all, it is not at all clear in the original movies that the Major or Batou are Japanese, though in the manga and the series it is more obvious. Shamefully, the characters in the Hollywood version lack the subtlety to make them remotely interesting or at all sympathetic. They are just plain boring. Worse, the Hollywood Major and Batou are only superficially like the manga or anime versions.Had Hollywood made a completely new and different story, a lot of this might have been forgivable. But by trying to retell the same story but failing amateurishly to even understand what made the originals so loved by fans, at the end of the day this version is just another bad sci-fi movie.",Ghost in the Shell
213,dutchchocolatecake,top notch action sci fi,10,2 April 2017,"Let me just say for starters that this is a real review written by someone who actually watched the movie, and someone who has actually watched the original Ghost in the Shell movie several times before the live action movie came out, along with Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Solid State society. The live action movie delves even deeper into the story lines in the Ghost in the Shell franchise, and combines elements from all the stories to create a fantastic action sci-fi that is both intellectually and visually stunning.I'm typing this qualifier because the majority of the other reviews about this movie look like outrage reviews written by people who didn't even see the movie and are just abusing IMDb's review system to promote their own political viewpoints. They aren't interested in actually seeing the movie or giving a thoughtful review about it. They are only here to trash it and this is why IMDb took down the forums in the first place. I know my review will probably get a bunch of thumbs down because people only care if I agree with them rather than whether I wrote a good review or not.With that out of the way, the accusations of white washing are dubious at best. The Major in the anime was in a white looking cybernetic body even though she had a Japanese name. I base this opinion on the fact that in the original movie there are characters drawn specifically to look Asian and if the Major were Asian then she would be drawn that way. The creator of Ghost in the Shell has come forward to say that he was impressed by both Scarlett Johansson's casting and her acting abilities. If she's good enough for the creator of this movie then who is anyone else to keep arguing against her? The argument that a character having a Japanese name means that character is Asian is also questionable. I went to school with Asian Americans with white names either because they were adopted or because their families had fully assimilated into American culture. If I were to make a movie about one of them, should I cast a white person to play them simply because they have a white name? For those who haven't seen it or are discouraged from seeing it because of other people's bullying: I suggest that you don't let anyone else stop you from seeing this movie or enjoying it. I had concerns that it might not be good because there are elements of animation that just aren't translatable to live action. I am pleased to say that I was wrong and this movie took my breath away with both visuals and a story line that delves into who the Puppetmaster is and what his motivations are. After seeing this movie I am interested in finding the television series that goes along with the movies I already have. If a movie can make people interested in the source material then it's done it's job IMO.Scarlett Johansson made an excellent Major. I could tell she worked hard and studied the original movie closely to mirror the Major's mannerisms and behavior. As for the complaints that the movie didn't delve deep enough into philosophical things, I don't think the original movies did much of that either. Nothing was ever fully explained and the viewer was left to puzzle out their own answers. These are the kind of movies that you have to watch with your brain engaged rather than being passively entertained. The movies aren't meant to be a replacement for formal study of existential philosophy. They are meant to pose a hypothetical scenario with hypothetical reasons behind it and the viewer is supposed to draw their own conclusions.I do have a few complaints about this movie, but they are fairly trivial considering the movie as a whole. This review is getting long and I only have a thousand words so I won't go into my own complaints that aren't really relevant. Overall though this movie is worth putting money down to see and that's what matters.",Ghost in the Shell
214,tyson-hunsaker,True the source material and a great stand alone sci-fi action.,7,5 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell follows the original 1995 classic's premise and visual style as well as its Blade Runner(ish) tone. The story follows Scarlett Johanson's character ""Major"" as she and her team of other police officer-like characters hunt down a terrorist and learn some secrets to Major's back story as well. The film succeeded in bringing to life the thought-provoking themes of the original classic while still making it relevant to a modern audience and especially, an American audience. While it may not hit every note like the original did and may not be quite as soul searching and cold, the remake improves upon the original in many ways. First, this film takes a deeper dive into Major's past and crafts her character into a much more interesting and deeper protagonist. This was probably done to appeal to a wider audience than just the fans of the original. Second, all the characters in general feel much more personal and easier to get attached to; making watching the first half much more tolerable (as it is lots of visual exposition). Everyone does a fine job with the roles they're given including Scarlett Johanson as the Major. Visual effects are some of the best and most striking you've ever seen and the action sequences are a thrill to watch. Despite this remake being a simpler and ""dumbed down"" retelling of some highly thought- provoking material, Ghost in the Shell stands as an entertaining sci-fi action movie that's sure to please fans of the original and new audiences looking of a well-done fun action movie.

The visuals are fantastic, the effects are great, the atmosphere is beautiful and the music is very good. But in the central points of what made the original hauntingly beautiful, this one lacks: Instead of a delicate view at what it means to be human, this movie rather goes for a weak action plot. The screenplay does a mediocre Matrix impression. The dialogues are just blunt and miss the grace and sensibility of its 20 year old reference. I stopped caring after 30 minutes.As such the action scenes don't carry any weight and all the citations from the original anime come across as hollow and weightless.

And is on that masterpiece that this movie is based.All in all, this is a well made movie. We were a bit skeptic when it was announced that they were going to make this movie but after watching the first trailer it seemed that this was going to be a good movie, and indeed it is a terrific movie. The movie pays a good homage to the original manga. you feel its spirit all the time: in the characters, in the plot, in the music and above all in the visuals.What they have done in this movie is pretty simple: they have taken the best parts of the manga and anime, they put them in a cocktail shaker and this movie came out. So one that has no idea about the original story will simply be amazed of the story and all the action scenes that are shown in the movie, which they don't slow down for a moment. For us fans we are simply enjoying what we watched many time ago but now we enjoy watching it with real actors.No need to say that Scarlett Black Widow fits in this characters perfectly. We are used to watch her in these kind of movies and she is fantastic. Not only that, she behaves like the cyborg/machine that she is, something that she kind of already did in the movie ""Under the Skin"". The rest of the characters are well suited both in performance and in physical aspect.It's not easy adapting a manga into a single movie and it's less easy making a good movie about it. Here that is not the case as you will find a great entertaining movie that will leave you breathless in terms of visual effects and in terms of actions scenes, which are an exact copy of the original story.

219,dissident320,Visually captures the spirit of the anime while not understanding the story,5,7 July 2017,"I'm no expert on the source material but I have recently watched the first anime before I saw this. I'm glad I did because it gives a lot of examples on why this one doesn't work.Firstly, it immediately holds the viewer's hand. This reminded me of the Golden Compass movie which was a disaster. If you think your movie requires text at the beginning to explain what's going on, maybe you need to write a better movie. Even the characters are spewing so much expository dialogue to help anyone who's watching. Because apparently we're all idiots and show don't tell doesn't apply here.I have a lot of issues with how they're trying to tell the story. They re-purpose many scenes from the 1995 anime to varying results. The chase down of that guy in the water for the invisibility reveal? Works. Using the same spider tank but completely changing the purpose of that scene? Not so good. Having Kuzo be the puppet master but not the puppet master? Confusing and kind of crappy. Having a completely stock villain sticking his nose in Section 9 and trying to kill Major? Awful stuff.The casting I have less of an issue with. Scarlet is fine here, but I'm surprised how meek she portrayed Major. She has a lot of presence in the anime and speaks authoritatively. Obviously she's a powerful character when she fights but I didn't understand the juxtaposition. Pilou Asbæk is fine as Batou as well. He doesn't get much character development but does okay with what's he's given. Michael Pitt was also okay but I was extremely distracted by his character not quite being the puppet master but being a lot like him. If you're going to use characters from the anime/manga then use their own storyline, don't just put them in whatever role you feel like. It felt like lazy writing and didn't work at all for the final act.Lastly, the visuals were excellent. While this movie fails in most aspects it can't be faulted visually. It's some of the best I've seen this year. It also felt like a real city not just a CG backdrop which is no small feat these days.All in all, it's a functional movie but they didn't seem to really understand or want draw from the source material. They made a remix of stuff taken primarily the first anime and some from the sequel. I think they would have been better off making visual nods to them but forging their own original storyline. Because it ends up sitting in the middle of not quite being a live-action remake of the first movie but also not doing enough outside of that movie to really have its own personality.",Ghost in the Shell

I celebrate this movie for its own originality. It draws from the earlier anime and manga material but is its own story.

Many of the characters are familiar from the earlier movie. Some of the scenes are the same. Some adapted. Many all new.The story is the same but quite different at the same time. The imagery is unique to this movie. The question is the same in this movie as in the original (and in Bladerunner): What does it mean to be ""human""?

Nothing worse than a bad soundtrack.Virtually everybody in the future has some form of hardware/software body modification, ranging from the exquisite to the grotesque. If your wealthy and well connected, you can afford the finest. If your poor, there are plenty of slimy street dealers selling modifications much like the low-lives who sling crack and meth in our world today. I found the idea of it chilling and very believable.Next, the mock-ups of life in the big city reek of Blade Runner, but who cares? Multiple level boulevards snake around skyscrapers and 800 foot high holographic advertisements. I wonder if people in the future will simply ignore these monstrosities much like we do now if you are chronically viewing content on sites like YouTube.After her role in the highly underrated movie 'Lucy' from 2014, I felt this was Ms. Johansson's perfect revenge role for a come-back in a similar character. That being a helpless woman forced into impossible circumstances, but eventually sorts things out and opens up a glorious can of whoop-ass on the powers that be.I also found all the supporting characters well developed and interesting.

So I feel that I can judge the merit of this movie without overly relying on comparisons to its predecessor. Far too many times good movies get smashed simply because people watched them with the wrong set of expectations, but I don't think this one is such a movie. GHOST IN THE SHELL is genuinely boring and utterly ill-paced.The new GHOST IN THE SHELL takes the landmark animated movie and turns it into a live action flick, with Scarlett Johansson giving us a convincing performance as a cyborg longing for an understanding of herself and her place in a futuristic world. The plot meshes mystery thriller with a strong theme of corporate greed.While the ideas are just as interesting as they were in the original, the movie has some severe pacing issues. It starts out with a blast. The colorful neon vision of the future sucks you in right away. Within the first minutes, I caught myself thinking ""This is it!"" Prepare to have your jaw dropped on at least a few occasions. But then the movie slows down. And, oh gosh, does it slooooow dooooown!Sometimes too many things happen in quick succession, many times, however, not enough happens at all. For the most of it, the movie plods from one techno gibberish conversation to another with no clear progression of ideas and quite frankly, not a lot of depth. As the story proceeds, too many loose threads are just left hanging, with no integration and no pay-off that brings the different strands and characters together in a convincing way. A lot of the side characters next to our protagonist have massively underdeveloped personalities, and the villains do not convince. It's not quite clear why people do the things they do, which is disorienting and ultimately leads to disinterest.Moreover, movies that depend on a very unemotional main character have the problem that they often fail to arouse emotions in the audience. Of course, Scarlett Johansson is supposed to play a robotic character... but this is a story purportedly about her quest for meaning, so we want things to be at least a tad bit emotional! The main character's roboticness prevented me from having any strong feelings for anything that happened on the screen. This was perhaps a shortcoming of the original as well, but at least there the movie made up with a stronger focus on cyberpunk ideas and much more emphasis on world-building and atmosphere.Now, I am not going to talk about the utterly ridiculous white-washing that happened with the casting decisions—many others have complained about this, for the right reasons. But I believe that even besides these ideologically questionable production decisions, GHOST IN THE SHELL does not warrant a lot of attention. It is a piece that is stunningly beautiful but that is, ultimately, absurdly empty and pointless.",Ghost in the Shell
226,johnplocar,"I am probably biased, but I liked it more than the original 1995 anime...let the angry comments commence.",8,1 April 2017,"I just want to give a slight bit of background as to where I was coming from when I went into this movie before I say how I felt about it. I have only recently seen the original animated 1995 film; I haven't seen any of its numerous sequels or spin-off shows or read any of the mangas that were linked to its source material or anything like that. How I felt about the 1995 anime though is pretty lukewarm honestly. I thought it had interesting ideas and a relatively cool aesthetic, but was way too heavy on exposition dialog and had a very limited about of character development as well as humanity. For a film that is supposed to be delving into the questions of what makes us human to feel so lifeless, to me, is a major issue. Objectively speaking, it is a fine movie, but subjectively falls short of being anything that great.This movie is one of those rare cases where I found myself enjoying the remake far more than the original film that it is based on. This cut out a lot of the mind-numbing, on the nose, irritating dialog that padded out the anime and replaced it with some characters that I could get myself invested in and a story that I was actually interested in. It didn't spend large gaps of its run time so it could go on a lecture about what makes us human, instead it minimized that to play out more in its themes and implications. The characters have ten times more personality in this which was also a glaring problem from the anime for me. I liked a couple of these characters and wanted to see their personal arches. Scarlett Johansson, I think, does a pretty solid job as 'The Major'. I don't have nearly the problem with her in the role as much as everyone else in America seems to with the whole ""white-washing"" thing as of late. Admittedly I was concerned about that when the trailers for this movie did hit the internet, but while watching the film itself I was totally fine with her in this role as well as her performance. The story isn't a 100% faithful adaptation of the '95 movie, so I don't know if it borrowed anything from the rest of its original franchise. With that said, I liked this narrative a lot more as well. I thought it had a satisfying beginning, middle and end. It flowed fairly well and I was intrigued as to where it was going the whole way through. With a movie like this, it does run the risk of feeling extremely derivative of other sci-fi films that have explored these themes or world aesthetics before, but luckily that never happened for me. I did get hints of familiarity occasionally of other films such as ""Blade Runner"", ""RoboCop"", and ""Dark City""; however it never became too distracting so I was able to brush it off or even find myself to enjoy the experience more so. Beware thought that this film is a pretty slow burn; think less of this being a straight up action film, but rather a downtempo styled mystery with action beats every so often. The CGI, for 99% of this movie, is top notch and is absolutely gorgeous; even mind blowing in some instances with its cinematography. I thought this was one hell of a spectacle, I think the film was aware of how good it looked as well because there are plenty of establishing shots of the city. Which I did find to be a bit much, but it wasn't too bad. And the soundtrack was fantastic, really synthesizer heavy and I am a true sucker for a good synth score to a movie.All around I found this to be an enjoyable film, does it have its problems? Sure, character development for some of the leads could have been fleshed out much more. The pace of the film could have been tweaked to its benefit, whether that to be speeding up through certain story threads or slowing down in others. 'The Major' could have had more humanizing moments instead of feeling more robotic. For me though, I didn't mind this relatively minor gripes I had with it. Maybe that's because I see an improvement from its source so that may have blinded me some, but I still had a good time with this film. I liked it and am actually looking forward to exploring this universe more in hopefully future installments. If you're a fan of the original then I don't really know how you may end up feeling about this remake, for all I know fans will end up hating it and I will be in a very small boat about this topic. But if what I said interests you at all then I say go check it out. If not...""Boss Baby"" is probably playing down the hall, have at it.",Ghost in the Shell
227,fuelrodx,Not gonna write Scarlet off,4,23 November 2019,"I think there was a director problem here. The movie had potential, just that it was done without the script revisions and directorial revisions that were needed. It could have been done better. What I've seen Johannsen in she usually does well. Can't blame it all on the actress.",Ghost in the Shell
228,taryllsbaker,"Smart, Cool and Refreshingly Enjoyable.",8,2 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is directed by Rupert Sanders and stars Scarlett Johansson, Pilou Asbæk, Takeshi Kitano, Juliette Binoche, Michael Pitt, Chin Han, Danusia Samal and Peter Ferdinando.In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: A human saved from a terrible crash, who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals.There was controversy. There were expectations. For me, these expectations were high. The original 1995 Ghost in the Shell anime had layer upon layer of subliminal meaning in its vast imagery and storytelling. Its themes were explored deeply, and gained a cult following momentously. Rupert Sanders has delivered a visually outstanding instalment to the franchise. Although a soft reboot/reimagining of the original, GITS stands on its own.Even if some of the Ghost (or Soul) from the anime is lost, the Shell is incredibly vibrant. The cinematography is stunning, jam-packed with a colourful visual design and intricate sets, recreating the familiar feeling of the original material. Something that worried me going into this film was that it would avoid Major's drive to discover who/what she is, and turn it into an action-packed thrill ride with no meaning. However, to my delight, this did not happen. In fact, the story drifts from the original and twists our expectations. It's smart, cool and refreshingly enjoyable.Scarlett Johansson was cast with heated discussion amongst fans, but I believe she has done a wonderful job with this role. She clicks with this world perfectly, in my eyes. Pilou Asbæk as Batou is well-cast, also. Both work together nicely with great chemistry. Binoche, Kitano, Ferdinando and everyone else involved are so very natural in the setting. Some of the set pieces look and perform great, though surprisingly cut-down to ensure the story stays focused on Major.Clint Mansell & Lorne Balfe utilise snippets from Kenji Kawai's original theme as a respectful nod, then progress forward with a synth-heavy score that weaves so beautifully with the picture. Subtle but important. It's an impressive ambiance that fills the atmosphere presented in the film.Ghost in the Shell is not for everyone, but like the original, I do think everyone should try it. It's not going to rake in a huge amount of money in its theatrical run, but don't take that as a bad sign. The only thing I'd like to see is an uncut version; it feels like it was toned down for a wider audience. That said, I'm absolutely interested in seeing a sequel or two to further expand upon the story of Major & Batou. Verdict; Impressive visual effects, smart storytelling and interesting characters make Ghost in the Shell an energetic and entertaining experience.Ghost in the Shell, 8/10.",Ghost in the Shell

230,slimecity-38663,So many complainers here,7,21 June 2020,"I am a big fan of the original and the original sequel. Totally loved them. I htink this movie does them justice. Especially since I closely knew a couple of people working on the production of this film and they were complaining about how shambolic the director was. But the final result.....its great!It sticks to the original story and includes some really important aspects: the fight scene with the truck driver in the shallow water, the massive bid-plane flying over the narrow alleys in slow motion, the spider-tank....its all there.Puppet Master for some reason has a different name, but he is played really well by the male actor. The police chief is a bit lazy in his acting but it somehow works. The street scenes look great - dark and gritty - and I think some changes to the story made for this movie work in the story's favour.Cultural appropriation, etc etc, sure its an issue - but I live in NZ and we shamelessly sell Maori art and history as tourist trinkets every day - still, that wont stop it.Ignore the hate and watch this movie.",Ghost in the Shell
231,slicedbread117,Diving Into the Shallow End of the Pool,5,9 February 2018,"*This review is coming from a viewer who has not seen the original anime, it is solely based on the live-action film.*I'm an enormous fan of the science-fiction genre, the futuristic style, the technologically advanced atmosphere, etc., so Ghost in the Shell seemed right up my ally. There's some moments to be enjoyed, some story to explore and some great visuals, but by the time the credits were rolling, Ghost in the Shell showed it's as dull as it is pretty, devoid of any legitimate depth or feeling.The film immediately presents a simple, but intriguing futuristic premise, very Blade Runner-esque, which was a bonus for me despite the obvious similarities. As the movie progresses, the plot thickens slightly and remains faintly engaging, but never once did it pull me in to the point where I was dying to see the next scene, the next revelation. The plot twits were underwhelming and the pacing was sluggish. I found it difficult to become invested in the main narrative, despite the more enticing setting and atmosphere. This is largely due to the disconnect between the main plot and the film's set of characters, between the two of which never develop any kind of profundity, never resonating with the emotional side of the story.This is where the film suffers the most, the writing and portrayal of pretty much every character in the film. The characters are all lifeless and shallow, not an ounce of emotion was sparked during even the most serious, heartfelt scenes. This issue is twofold; one, the writing, which gives the characters corny and uninspired dialogue. And two, the acting. Every role, including lead actress Scarlett Johansson's Major, is nothing more than a cardboard cutout, bland as can be. There's no believe-ability in hardly any of the dialogue, the delivery of most lines are boring and unexciting. Ghost in the Shell tries to create characters to care about, but the execution was a complete misfire.What the film lacks heavily in writing, character development and acting chops, it somewhat makes up for with some cool action sequences and eye-popping visuals. The cinematography is quite wonderful, and the sci-fi setting paves way for equally wonderful atmospheric tones, centered around the futuristic style. Despite her less than admirable performance, Scarlett Johansson's Major is fun to watch during her big action scenes, and the supporting characters, notably Major's sidekick Batou, deliver on helping make the action scenes feel exciting. Anime to live-action adaptations are always a tough cookie to crack, and though I have not seen the original anime, I have a feeling there was a lot missing to this live-action version. Ghost in the Shell is a prime example that amazing visuals and some high-powered action scenes can't hide ugly writing, terrible characters and truly awful acting. The movie's title is, in the end, a perfect way to describe it; there may be a gorgeous looking shell on the outside, something to keep you distracted, but on the inside, it's nothing more than a ghost, hollowed out and baron, devoid of an identity or a soul, and this holds Ghost in the Shell back from being much more entertaining than it ended up.5/10",Ghost in the Shell
232,Akira-36,"Hollywood's take on Ghost in the Shell, that is more of a shell lacking its soul. Pretty to look at but weak on story and characterization",6,1 April 2017,"Just got back from watching Ghost in the Shell movie today. I love the original manga by Masamune Shirow and think that Mamori Oshii's anime version was good but quite a different beast. Basically, Oshii chose the latter chapters from the manga series and used them as a platform for his existential psycho-babble about the nature of memories, identity and soul (ghost) in a world where the line between humans and machines blur.Similarly, Rupert Sander's version is a also different beast although it pays tribute to a lot of sequences from the anime version including story arcs and characters from the Stand Alone Complex anime series.I find Sander's movie to be lacking depth, and both the screenplay and characterisation were poorly executed. All in all I think he missed a big chance to bring the GITS world into a cinematic live-action experience. I am unsure why he introduced four new female characters who took away much of the screen times from other Section 9 members: two of them were generic scientists with lackluster personalities and another character felt out of place from the rest of Section 9 team. The only one with any meaningful existence is the mother character. I feel that the addition of these four new characters didn't add much layers to the storyline, and in doing so, Sanders sacrificed opportunities for other Section 9's members to interact and develop their relationship with Major. I wonder if Sanders wanted to have a play with gender politics in this movie, otherwise I thought the action, VFX and production design were really good.It's also a shame Kenji Kawai's eerie and spiritual music were only used sparingly and the Tachikoma's design was rather too angular and coloured in industrial grey. Both my wife and I almost felt asleep a couple of times throughout the movie, and that is due to Sander's inconsistent direction and weak screenplay.Most of my scores go to Weta Workshop for their excellent works, and ScarJo's acting was actually decent although I feel she was playing a different incarnation of the character that I knew from the original materials. No doubt that she was always pleasant to look at, but nowhere near the mysterious and tough-as-metal Major Kusanagi from the anime nor manga.",Ghost in the Shell

It seems you do not understand it, nor tried to nor understood Ghost in thr Shell in general from the beginnings.It is clear even to the blind that the crew behind the movie tried their best to pay the omage to the classic yet they tried to create their own ghost in the shell, not just copy pasted the already existing thing.

235,Badmoviessuck,Stop calling her Scarjo it's cringe,5,13 November 2018,"I haven't watch the original Ghost in the shell anime and i will watch it as soon as possible and review it.
So this review will come from someone who has not watched the original source material.
This movie is mediocre and i don't get people who have watched the anime and give this movie above a 6/10 cause it has major flaws that we will get into.CHARACTERS
The characters are really one dimensional Major has no personality in this movie and is this really bland character they could have given her more depth in this movie and i will get into details about that later in this review.
Batou is also one dimensional, they tried to give him some personality by showing that he likes dogs but that isn't important at all to the rest of the movie.
The rest of the character barely are important except for Dr Ouelet who is kinda important but not really but she is one dimensional as well.MEANING
In this movie they are talking about machine and humans but it lacks depth and they just say a bunch of obvious and bland stuff like ""What makes us humans isn't the memory, it's the choices we make"" or ""A machine can't lead,
It can only follow orders, a machine can't imagine or care or intuit but as a human mind in a cybernetic frame Mira can do all those things, and more.""
Ik that the original 1995 movie Ghost in the shell was way deeper than this but for some reason they had to simplify everything so that the audience would understand cause they think that the audience is stupid but that just betrays the original source material.VISUALS
The visuals are amazing and this movie is beautiful to look at but that was just something small i wanted to talk about.VILLAINS
Bunch of wasted potential.
Kuze could have been a good villain if they gave him a good amount of screen time but he was wasted and even ignored so that they could use an even worse villain who was barely in the movie and his goal is to destroy Major cause she knows to much and that wont be good for Hanks.ACTION
It's bad.
The first time i saw an action scene in this movie it felt weird cause they used CGI on Major which was unnecessary.
But the action overall is bad and bland it doesn't do anything cool and new and it's just boring the final act was the worst it was just a huge boring Robot fight.VERDICT
They had one Job and they failed.
It should have been really easy to adapt a MOVIE everything is already there.
Character development is there, good story is there etc.
But for some reason they changed it up for the worse.
Skip this movie and watch the original 1995 movie it's way better.",Ghost in the Shell
236,therapeuticsuicide,DEEPEST FEARS FOR A BELOVED ANIME AND GENRE FULLY REALIZED.,3,14 March 2018,"The animated original is simply one of the finest pieces of visual presentation, original concept and storytelling that has ever graced the screen. This director, the producers, cast and studio of this film should all be utterly ashamed of disgracing what is widely acclaimed as nothing less than a masterwork with this flop of a misrepresentation. But the director has proved he is rubbish before, with a similarly spectacular (albeit lesser) failure in Snow White and the Huntsman. ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD TO DO WAS COPY AN ANIME FILM SCENE FOR SCENE ""A LA ZACK SNYDER/300"" AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED RAVING SUCCESS. This kind of outright debauchery is the sort of thing that makes me want to jump on the ageing bandwagon of bashing ""Hollywood"" and the ""corporate sellouts"". PLEASE GO WATCH THE ANIMATED ORIGINAL AND FORGET THIS PIECE OF CRAP EVER EXISTED. What angers me the most is that now we have to wait for the licensing rights to expire before anyone can make a proper redo of this beloved story. It's like the original Judge Dredd with Stallone, they had to wait years to redo it properly in Dredd, which, thankfully, ended up being well worth the wait. Here is a film I would KILL for the opportunity to helm! Here was an incredulous waste of an opportunity to include all manners of nuances down to the acting and thematic elements of a human mind occupying a synthetic body. All that was required was for the director to study his superiors in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Alex Garland's Ex Machina and attempt to encapsulate a comparable visual and narrative style by using that to mimick the original animated feature as closely as possible, down to the actor's eye and body movements and framing and camera angles. It strikes me that any amateur filmmaker should have been capable of this. I don't want to know who this flop of a director is related to to have merited such a budget or the right to this IP. You, good sir, are a disgrace to your craft. Sorry, but you simply must do better to ever be worth a damn.

It reminded me of the opening credits of WESTWORLD. But this movie's futuristic setting was so dull. Blade Runner's futuristic setting was dark, cold and atmospheric, whereas the setting in this one is disgustingly colorfully CG-ridden and awfully stale. Some movies pull the audience into the worlds they create, but this one just reminds me that I'm watching fake CG. There is no atmosphere at all. Movies like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element have depicted futuristic worlds in far more fascinating ways. This movie just pales. And truly, it is a shell, only without the ghost. It is soulless.I am not familiar with the original Japanese anime, so I had no preconceptions when watching the movie except that I knew the original anime inspired the classic Matrix trilogy. Therefore, my hatred towards the movie has nothing to do with discontent about the faithfulness of the adaptation.

240,Pierre_D,"""This is Major..."" fun, at the very least.",7,31 March 2017,"It was always going to be impossible for Sanders et. al to pay homage to the Ghost in the Shell property as it deserved. I won't touch on the controversy surrounding casting except to say that the movie would have been enhanced with someone closer to source, but Scarlett Johansson more than acquits herself in the role.Ghost in the Shell (henceforth GITS) acquits itself well as a cyberpunk foray, quite well as an action movie and loses pace and points as far as the plot and dialogue. We find Mira Killian (I missed the pun here, perhaps due to overfatigue) being reconstructed under the guidance of Juliette Binoche, empathetic and classy as always, in Hanka Corporation's labs. She's going to be ultimate killing machine, and her reconstruction reminds of Terminator, with steel fusing flesh. Johansson dialogues in a kind of sleepy monotone with a few inflections for sarcasm, humour and pathos along the way. The skintight bodysuit flatters her while simultaneously rending Major sexless in areas. (As an aside, the film might well pass the Bechtel test as Major has no relationship with any males and has her own goals she pursues.) As the story progresses, we find much to like about our heroine, but yearn to find out more about her though processes.Visually, GITS is gob-smacking. The cityscape reminds of Blade Runner and definitely has that great, gritty, cyberpunk feel that makes up for some rather choppy dialogue and plot pacing. The whole ""Am I the first? How real am I?"" is a little trite at this point, and Johansson pulled that off MUCH better in ""Her"", where she essentially a voice box. Favourites from the anime are here and do well to support Major. GITS's greatest flaw is in not offering Johasson, Asbaek and company some more depth. ""Beat"" Takeno is quite fine as the Section 9 head though.The film deals with the ""Motoko Kusanagi Issue"" in a bit of a weird, circuitous way that satisfies while leaving the door open in sequels for Johansson to adopt the name if she wishes. The scenes with her parent are fine, if a little uneasy because of the obvious racial overtones. The battle scenes are quite efficient, but the spider-tank one had deeper layers in the previous incarnations, which have gone missing here, sadly.Overall, see this as a good popcorn movie with dazzling visuals and an adequate performance from Ms. Johansson. Do not expect a faithful rendition of GTIS, but do look out for a fine transference of the ""swamp fight"" that could go down as an iconic sequence.7.5/10, mostly for the sights and sounds, losing a good two points for plot pacing and dialogue/script.",Ghost in the Shell

244,javi-y-se-acabo,Amazing remake from the original anime with a few different ideas,9,21 April 2017,"First of all, as I always say, if you haven't't watched the movie, you cannot have an opinion about it, and that is for all the people who decides not to watch it because of the bad critics this movie has received. Apart from that I would say this is one of the best adaptations in real image we could have get. It captures perfectly the feeling of the original anime. For start, I would say that this is not a direct remake because there are many ideas from the original anime kept here, but I think for making it for a bigger public, they introduced more action, a few changes in the script and a little of romance. Overall the script plays with the idea of the ethics of the robotics and androids, as the anime did, and talks about a not very far future full of cyborgs and with very little humanity. The acting was great, although a few supporting characters were a bit useless, but I think Scarlett did an amazing job as the Mayor, as some of the other main characters, like Bateau or the leader of the Section 9. Other thing that is amazing of this movie is the awesome visuals that are used throughout the movie. They really transport you to a future city of Japan and make you feel like you were there. All the cinematography and the visuals make the movie worth to be watched at a cinema. Also I have to mention the perfect score made by Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe, a masterpiece full of synths that help the action sequences, but also the emotive moments, to be even better (what a shame it's not going to be released). Overall I would recommend this movie to the real fans of the original anime, but also to any other person who wants a great movie with awesome visuals and a great story. 9/10Don't listen to the critics and get an opinion by yourself by watching this.",Ghost in the Shell

246,iNickR,"Laymen Will Love It, Nerds A Little Less So",6,3 February 2018,"Ghost in the Shell, in short, is a futuristic story about a young woman (Scarlett Johansson), saved from a horrible crash and then turned into a cyborg. She then becomes a lethal government killing machine, going after the world's worst criminals.Ghost in the Shell, what I think: I watched this Movie because of all the hype surrounding the cyberpunk Netflix thriller, Altered Carbon (2018). A lot of comparisons have been made between the two (and Blade Runner), but, although there are some similarities, they are quite different. Scar-Jo plays the protagonist, Major. All that she remembers about the accident is that she drowned while immigrating to the country as a refugee on a raft. Both Major's parents were killed, and her body was damaged beyond repair. Her brain was saved, though, and a cybernetic-body custom built around it. Major is essentially a ghost in a shell with very little knowledge of her past life. She's told she is one-of-a-kind.So Major transforms into an ass-kicker who can't feel pain, or fear, and uses this to her advantage to track down and arrest, or whatever, the worst-of-the-worst criminals no matter the human or financial cost. Life as a cyborg isn't as simple as you may think, especially when you're a potential golden goose for the company that built you. They have big plans for Major, and her team of partially-cyber-enhanced ass-kickers, but that platform seems to conflict with the government's own ideas.The CGI is what you should expect out of a big-budget sci-fi thriller - excellent. The action is good, the sound-mix is awesome, the script is so-so. I thought Scar-Jo's acting was meh - sort of, well, robotic. She's an amazing actor, but this role of Major isn't for her. She has this weird gait about her when she walks that's difficult to get used to, even with the understanding that's she's pretty much a robot - super advanced, notwithstanding. The Terminator, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, is less robotic when walking. For something as high-tech as Major's shell, her movements should be more fluid. But that's just the nerd in me.Two things you'll LIKE about Ghost in a Shell: 1) Like I said, the CGI is great and Sci-fi fans will like it because it's similar to that of Blade Runner (I still can't help but be in awe of CGI technology when it comes to these types of movies). 2) Scarlett Johansson's fight scenes are well choreographed, and she can kick-ass with the best of them (see her in The Avengers).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) The effort. This movie had so much potential. It doesn't live up to the hype. 2) The length. It's about 17 minutes longer than it should be.",Ghost in the Shell
247,waterman1976,"Enjoyable, but superficial",7,15 January 2021,"I haven't seen the original manga version, so I can't compare. But I know that GITS is a classic with an interesting storyline and a huge following. Seeing the huge amount of negative reviews here on IMDb, the producers must have done something wrong...But watching the movie without knowledge of the original, I must say that it's not bad. It's visually very attractive, Johansson is convincing together with the rest of the cast and the movie has a good pace. But the script lacks depth and is at some points too shallow and not convincing. I love the cyberpunk genre, but that's mostly due to the intrecate storylines and fhe depiction of a dark corperate led world. GITS misses this. But it's an enjoyable flick and in contrast to a lot of the negative remarks at Johanssons adress... I do think she's a good actress.",Ghost in the Shell
248,ericnottelling,very disappointed,4,8 April 2017,"I really wish they would have made this movie through an independent studio. First the casting is all wrong. It's not the whole white wash thing, it's the Scarlett Johansson as a scifi actor thing. It's like watching the female version of keano Reeves. She simply can't act. Putting Pilou Asbæk next to her was twice the punishment! The whole Hollywood type casting thing drags down movies.Second was the storyline and the writing. It was seriously lacking. A. you knew what was coming before it ever came. B. trying to hide the lack of good dialog behind action scenes only goes so far. This whole movie lacked any substantial dialog at all. They were throwing scenes in the movie that were frankly pointless because they couldn't write anything meaningful. Even the last battle scene was just lame. They wrote so poorly they even left cliff hangers in segments where there should have been action. I wouldn't spend a dime to go see this movie and I'm glad I watched it online because of that.110 million and this is the garbage they threw out. it wasn't even 1/2 as good as Lucy, not that Lucy was some epicly great movie. I can only hope the blade runner remake isn't this epicly bad.",Ghost in the Shell
249,jon-c-ison,Dark and visually stunning,8,12 September 2019,"A brilliant story built around some very interesting ideas exploring cybernetics, human nature and future society. The movie has emotional and philosophical substance, which it conveys quite subtly through storytelling and character development. It is visually stunning, combining dark and convincing locations and sets with unique special effects, to great effect. There are interesting characters that you care about, which are well acted. The action sequences are good and nicely balanced with other aspects. Not a masterpiece; the dystopian world and side characters could perhaps have been portrayed with more soul and depth, but it's a good story that's well told. I'm not familiar with the manga and anime on which it's based, so judge it on its own merits.",Ghost in the Shell
250,ReelLifeReviews,"Excellent setting, poor story",5,1 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell - I was looking forward to this movie ever since they started dropping those mini 10 second trailers this past fall. I was unfamiliar with the source material, but those had me immediately hooked. I began to temper my expectations once I saw the reviews come in, and ultimately got the mediocre film I was afraid it would be.One of my absolute favorite things about the sci-fi genre is the incredibly imaginative worlds that can be created. This movie comes through 100% in that regard. Beautiful cityscapes filled with holographic images set the establishing shots for 80's inspired interiors with a grungy, lived-in look. Think Blade Runner, but in daylight. I could seriously watch any movie set in a world like this. It just so happens it wasn't a very good one that I was watching.The plot is stale to say the least. A character has no memory of their past and is tasked on taking out a certain group, but comes to question who's side she should really be on. I think one or two of these come out every year. There are sporadic engaging moments, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Scarlett Johansson seemed somewhat bored throughout the movie, which didn't do it any favors.Ghost in the Shell ends up being a perfect title, but not for the reasons they were hoping for. A hollow and lifeless plot is encased within a fascinating world that I both want to be a part of, but hope I never come to see. The strength of that aesthetic pushed the score up higher than would otherwise be deserved.",Ghost in the Shell

252,i_ianchev,The Shell is better than the Ghost,7,31 March 2017,"The cinema is an incredible way of art, because it always relies on good storytelling first. And after that on visuals, sound, design, performance, etc. It is surely a mix of them all, but the essence is and will always be to relay an important set of messages through an impressive story. And this is the reason why improvisation will always be a milestone in creating good movies. Because repetitiveness is always going to go into oblivion.For example ""Ghost in the shell"" - the anime movie from 1995 will always be this cornerstone in the lives of many young before and now not so young people. It is an essential part of my life too. And I can't just pass on seeing what Rupert Sanders has done with these incredible set of characters, with this great set of ideas and story. You see, people get inspired by stories which tell them something new to them, which teach them something they don't know about themselves and about the surrounding world. And at the same time these valuable fiction pieces show that we've had this valuable information in ourselves all the time. We just had to dig deep and find it. To acknowledge it. To accept its existence and then to use it in our lives. To be better people, to live a happier and more fulfilling life. This is the kind of art piece the original ""Ghost in the shell"" is. At least to me. So it's important to stress out what a big task this director took.Now, I want to say that I truly believe that cinema is an eternal form of creation because it refreshes itself by inspiring the film community within. This anime is a beautiful example for this. I cannot give a better example for film inspired by GitS than ""The Matrix"". There we see a seamless transition of groundbreaking ideas from one form (mind) to another. This is the living tissue of cinema itself. Ideas about information flow, purpose of life in cybernetic society, gender identity and the future of the human soul flourish from anime to movie life the first breath of a new born baby! And this is exactly what I love.So seeing the new Scarlett Johansson's new movie was a test. An awaited test, but still a test. And it performed more or less as expected. The story was dummed down A LOT. I don't even want to speak about it. It was interesting to see the script writers discussing a fresh look into Motoko Kusanagi's origins, but this idea seemed not thought in details enough. The performances of the actors weren't bad. But the characters are part of the flawed story. So yeah - it wasn't a very good movie.But it was a decent one, because...they did hire some of the best design, music and graphic artists available on the market. And the atmosphere, sound, costumes, CG were GREAT! It sure looks expensive, but it is for a reason. I really enjoyed what WETA did in this movie. These people put up so much effort into interpreting and creating from the original content, that I want to recommend watching the movie if not for something else, than just for their work. It is worthy of appraisal. And let's not forget Hong Kong...the main landscape which inspired the original is seen in this movie as well. A future city it still is!So overall I would like to ask you all - do you prefer to have a shiny shell or a thoughtful ghost? I personally prefer to have both!",Ghost in the Shell
253,sonnygoten,"Not bad, but also not very good.",6,5 May 2017,"White washing controversies aside, it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the anime. The universal existential and philosophical questions posed by the anime on what it means to be human have been dumb-ed down to ideas of 'individuality' and 'memories' that are further reduced in their appeal by being explained in a very western (non-universal) inflection.The explanation itself is another problem. Rather than allowing the audience to decide on their own opinion, the movie insists on spoon- feeding us with preconceived answers. It's very patronizing BS.Lastly, I have problems with ScarJo's performance. Rather than making the Major her own character, the actress gave us a performance that's somewhere between MCU's Black Widow 2.0 and Lucy. It seems to me that ScarJo is not a very multifaceted actress and isn't equipped for the job of giving the Major its own personality.To conclude: this is not a 'bad' movie, I've certainly seen worse SF flicks. But it's not a 'good' movie either. It doesn't challenge me intellectually, nor does it touch me on an emotional level. It's a stone-cold cash grab flick (and even flopped on that front, if current reports are to believed). The only really good thing it has going for it are the quite prettily shot scenes, but that's not enough to save a movie.",Ghost in the Shell

The stupidity doesn't stop here, every time they call her ""Major"" it sounds like ""Mature"" for some weird reason.

I have DVDs of all the animations, and watched the first movie when it came out..*many years ag0*Its hard to make a live action version of a good anime/manga, and this is a pretty damn good effort. But apart from that, it is a good standalone science fiction movie.
The effects are amazing, The actors great, and the action scenes are very well done. It's got Beat Takashi in it...and Scarlet Johahnson is a great actor, and one of the best action actress, and generally a good drama actor as well.There is a lot of talk of whitewashing. Those who truly know Japanese animation, and the source material will know tow things (1) Tha Japanese do yellowwashing all the time (Asian actors playing white characters (2) The main character, Major Motoko, swaps into robotic bodies and she uses western bodies. This was said by the creator of Ghost in The Shell, the great Masamune Shirow, who approved of the movie.My main problem with it is the plot, and the ending isn't that great, but overall, it is an amazing piece of work, visually stunning.

But I can't say that I am satisfied with the final product.Lets start with the story. It feels messy and weird. This movie tries to get the themes about the relationship and difference between humans and machines, but it just feels shoe-horned in. There are some scenes that really just feel that were placed to make this film more philosophical, the original movie treated its themes in subtle ways throughout the movie for you to get the sense that is real.I must admit, I am not the greatest fan of anime, I do believe that the first one is amazing, but I am not a huge fan. This movie tried to recreate some popular shots of the original, but did so in a very choppy and ""edgy"" way.The action scenes are terrible, they went with the slow-mo kind of action like in 300, and it really didn't work. The weird editing didn't let you appreciate the stunt-work and took you out of the film. Also, some scenes are impossible to keep up with because of all the fast shots that don't let you see anything.The villain of this movie sucked, it is nothing compared to the puppet master of the original. At first, it seemed interesting, but then they went with the classical American twist and a very interesting villain was put to waste.Scarlett is fine as Major, actually the performances are fine and do what was needed from them.The CGI is also incorporated very good into the film, the city looks like the city of the original movie.

261,blazedounal,good movie,8,8 May 2017,"I have just seen the movie at an advanced screening. To me, this film was fantastic. I went in expecting to be disappointed and I came out grinning ear to ear. I laughed as I watched Aramaki be a down right bad ass. the film took some time to present the world itself without jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen time, but still delivered. A good movie.In the future, the clear majority of humans are augmented with cybernetics, enhancing various traits like vision, strength, and intelligence. Hanka Robotics, the world's leading developer of augmentative technology, establishes a secret project to develop a mechanical body, or ""shell"", that can integrate a human brain. a young woman who is the sole survivor of the cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is apparently damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer, Dr. Ouelet, Hanka CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. The team successfully thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a rogue mechanical geisha after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity, known only as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol and ""dives"" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. Using the information, she was able to gather, the two trace the hacker to a Yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The resulting explosion destroys Batou's eyes, and leaves Killian's body severely damaged.Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers, and realize that Dr. Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet, but it is unsuccessful. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers many humans mentally linked together as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured, and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian, otherwise known as 2571. He urges her to question her own memories before freeing her and escaping.Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits there were 98 test subjects before Killian but she was the only one to survive the process and that her memories are fake implanted ones. Cutter has decided that Killian is too much of a liability, and orders Ouelet to euthanize her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He subsequently informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated by any means necessary.Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, ran away from home a year ago and was arrested, before taking her own life while in custody. Unable to process her emotions, Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who intentionally allows Cutter to eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki each subdue Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet, and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka for use as test subjects. Cutter deploys a ""spider-tank"" to kill them, and Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing her left arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his ""ghost"" with Killian's before a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her identity as Motoko, reconnects with her mother before returning to work with Section 9.",Ghost in the Shell
262,lopresti-46927,"They got the setting right, but missed the mark with the story.",6,26 July 2017,"This ghost in the shell is actually more like a prequel to the show and movies. It had its good qualities and bad qualities. First let's start with what they did right. The atmosphere was exactly like old ghost in the shell movies and show. It was a dreary. near futuristic setting. They definitely hit it out of the park in this respect. Also some, but not all of the characters were cast very well. They cast Bato very well, but I was not as happy with the major's (Scarlett johanson) choice of casting. Their chief was also cast very well. Now here's where they messed up. The story is where it went wrong. The story itself wasn't terrible, but it was nothing like the spirit of ghost in the shell. A continuous theme of ghost in the shell is the question of what is humanity and identity, due to cybernetics and advanced AI's. And this film does not even attempt to do this. It would have been a fuller and better, as well as more dramatic, but it gets dumbed down to mere revenge scenario.",Ghost in the Shell
263,infoalwaysacritic,A New Beginning that is Visually Impressive,8,17 April 2017,"For anyone who has been subjected to the painful adaptations of anime to the realm of live action films, the prospect of bringing the Ghost in the Shell world to life sounds too good to be true and daunting, to say the least. Visually, Anime films tend to stretch reality to create larger-than-life characters, with outfits and events that translate to a cosplay reality that is, if not jarring, completely impractical and somewhat corny. This is part of its charm, but not only is Anime known for its distinct look, but also for methods of story-telling that do not fit the North American paradigm. The Ghost in the Shell movie from 1995 competes with Akira as the most widely received mature anime of its time and a story that is still relevant today. This new film doesn't try to be the same thing and succeeds in some areas while being greatly misunderstood in others.Focusing on the Major's origin story, those familiar with the GITS stories will immediately spot some deliberate inconsistencies, this film also follows the criminal actions of a major corporation and Section 9's attempt to capture a terrorist hacker. The Major has at least 2 other origin stories in the animes, so this is likely a choice by the producers to bring GITS to a new audience and by the end of the film the two plot lines converge while the Major's identity is brought in line with the Anime.Visually this film communicates volumes without saying a word. Rupert Sanders has specifically engaged craftspeople in Weta Workshop to produce as much as possible with real props. This attention to detail shows in the cyberpunk realism, imbued and enhanced by CG effects that produce an environment reminiscent of Blade Runner, Robocop and other classic sci-fi films. If no other reason to watch this, the visual quality of this film makes it worth seeing.With such a diverse cast available from the GITS source material, the producers decided to focus on only a handful of characters. Batou supports the Major while having a relationship much like detective partners. He cares about her, expressing concern for her well-being. He runs to her aid when he thinks she's in trouble, all while having a soft spot for dogs. The Major, on the other hand, is detached from the world, curious about humanity and struggles with her sense of identity. What does it mean to be human? Scarlett Johansson herself remarked in an interview that finishing the film was a relief to get back to being herself. Don't expect any academy awards for the acting, even if it is perfectly in line with the source material, right down to the way that the major moved.While the script isn't terrible, it isn't helped at all by the hefty reveals at the beginning of the film. No attempt is made to create mystery around who the villain is. You'll know from the start who it is that needs to come to justice. Instead, the Major's origin is imbued with a small mystery and enough twists take place to provoke an emotional response when things are revealed.It is also worth mentioning that this film makes a wild departure from expectations by including virtually no nudity, sexual content or foul language. This makes the film much more accessible than the first film, which contains a great deal of nudity and brutal violence.If your only exposure to the Ghost in the Shell is the anime classic from 1995, this new film will feel very different. The hallmarks of the GITS world as portrayed in the Stand Alone Complex shows and other films made in its wake follow a distinct format, one that Rupert Sanders sticks to. This is not an Avenger film that exalts superpowers, teamwork and western principles; Section 9 is an elite and aggressive anti-crime unit that will punitively kill anyone who engages them. They are in a word: vindictive. That is, to some, their appeal and in many ways this film delivers. At the same time, don't expect earth shattering or culture forming concepts to be discussed. There are some fundamental questions of identity and bare-bones philosophy but this film chooses instead to focus on the aesthetic of GITS and the development of the Major as a person. If they choose to do so, viewers who enjoy the new movie and wish to explore the original movie will be in for a surprise, and will likely be better served to explore the Stand Alone Complex or Arise series instead. Those who enjoyed the original film wil likely be disappointed if they did not also like the Stand Alone Complex.",Ghost in the Shell

I was afraid they were going to neuter this like they did with Aeon Flux. Don't worry, they didn't flux it up.The screenplay is the weakest part of the film. Scarlett Johansson is not really hot enough to play the Major; but her portrayal was acceptable.The reviewers who are panning this movie remind me of the dopes who talk about rap music like it is some great art form and really deep and profound. My criticism of the manga was that it got too philosophical and existential at times.Not everybody has seen GITS or SAC so I think that those who haven't will like it; and I expect at least a couple of sequels. However, the producers should probably hire some of the writers of GITS or SAC.Oh yeah; the people complaining about white washing this film obviously have not seen the source material.

265,ThatAnimeSnob,GITS is yet another failed western adaptation of an anime classic,4,31 August 2018,"It's not a complete and utter mess like Dragonball Evolution, but it still didn't get what was making the original so good. First and foremost, it never stood a chance in being praised for its visual presentation. The 90s version was a marvel of animation that didn't resemble any other movie of its time, while also looking far more detailed than any other animated sci-fi movie in general. The new version on the other hand, just looks okay. Not so much because they didn't work much on the visuals, but rather because you can find a hundred other movies just like it. It doesn't stand out as much, because nowadays we get lots of CGI-heavy movies. Something I do not blame it for, is having a different storyline. A good remake does not try to have the exact same plot and themes as the previous version. The 90s movie was not a faithful adaptation of the 80s manga. It was a beacon of the time it came out and was dealing with the issues of that decade in that part of the world. The 00s Stand Alone Complex tv-series is also its own version and has its own themes, relevant to the time it came out. Now imagine how less interesting it would be for the new movie to try copying any of that after a thousand other films were already inspired to do exactly that over the years. It would feel completely derivative and passable. Thus, having its own storyline is not a bad thing. The problem is, despite being different from any other in the franchise, the new storyline is still not special because it's also something that has been done a lot over the years. It took a far more mundane Hollywood action flick approach, where the heroine has a dark past that needs to be revealed, the corporations have evil representatives you can just shoot, and problems can be solved by just blowing them up. There is nothing deep or subtle in any of this. It can work for a movie such as the original Robocop, which has the exact same plot if you think about it, but even there it had to be presented as an ultraviolent satire of capitalism. The new Ghost in the Shell just wants you to take it seriously with nothing worthy of being called serious or special.The biggest disappointment is how it's not inspiring. It's not trying to expand to themes of philosophy and religion like the previous versions did. Motoko does not have an identity crisis based on who she wants to be, she simply has amnesia and wants to remember who she was all along. That is not the core motif of the story. The whitewashing of the protagonist is not the actual issue here, despite everyone making a big fuss about it at first. That could have served the narrative for a setting where race and gender are fluid. They can switch bodies and replace parts of them with cybernetic implants. What's the problem with having a Japanese person inside a Caucasian-looking body? The actual issue is the movie not exploring that concept, so it can have and in-story excuse for the whitewashing. The core theme behind the whole concept of Ghost in the Shell, was always an identity crisis. How much of you, is still you when you can change bodies or you can replace organs with machines. 
-The 80s manga gave emphasis on how the body can change with cybernatics to the point it becomes a sexual fetish, since the mangaka was that sort of guy. 
-The 90s movie switched the emphasis to transhumanism, and how mankind can move to a different state of being or how programs can gain conscience.
-The 00s series switched the focus to sociology, and how technology changes the way people can live in a world where technology keeps them in touch all the time.Now tell me what the recent movie explores regarding that. It's not like we don't have material for identity crisis in this decade, where everyone can be someone else by playing videogames, are liberals are constantly pushing gender fluidity in mass media and entertainment. This movie does no theme exploration regarding the identity crisis of our times, so it really comes off as a lazy excuse for having a white actress playing a Japanese character. It doesn't connect with people like the previous versions did, because over there Motoko was just another cyborg, while in this one she is one of a kind. If there are millions more like her, she is not special, the body switching and the race hopping feel like an everyday thing in that world. This doesn't show when you have a prototype, more advanced than any other, able to do stuff no other cyborg can do. And to put it bluntly, people didn't like the previous versions for the pew-pew and the bam-bam. It was never a type of story aimed for mainstream audiences that seeks thrill-rides. It's mesmerizing for its themes and atmosphere. It's not meant to be entertaining like a mindless action flick, or relatable for having fleshed out characters you can identify with. The 90s movie is very dry in this regard. But so was 2001 Space Odyssey, and Solaris, and the very first Star Trek movie. You don't watch those films to have fun while eating popcorn and laughing with your drunken buddies. You watch them as an existential journey, where you are supposed to ponder about stuff. The only thing you ponder while watching the 2017 version of Ghost in the Shell is ""how did they not get this?""",Ghost in the Shell
266,breckstewart,Sleek look into anime,9,30 July 2017,"I admit, I wasn't too keen on watching this because somehow, I thought it would be the typical sci-fi romp overloaded with special effects but without a heart. Yet I was pleasantly surprised to be hooked quickly and found even the end satisfying which is not that common for me. I understand there was some backlash with the casting of Scarlett Johansson in the lead instead of an Asian actress since the story is based on anime but I have to say she really owns the part and made me care which is always the bottom line. I loved the chemistry between her and Pilou Asbaek as Patou with strong performances as well by Juliette Binoche and Michael Pitt as Kuze among a very competent cast.Yes we've seen most of those plot lines in other movies before and yes the special effects are commonly well rendered these days with a ton of superhero movies setting the bar high yet, I was really surprised at just how much I enjoyed it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time while letting the suspension of disbelief work its magic. 9 stars from me and the only reason why this didn't get a 10 is because there were a couple of moments that I wish would have gone differently story wise but this is above average science fiction in my book.",Ghost in the Shell
267,theresamgill,"Still love Scarlett Johansson, but this isn't a great film",5,12 June 2018,"If I were to summarize my opinion of this movie to a hypothetical audience, I'd tell them that Ghost in the Shell essentially has 3 acts: a promising start, a flat middle act, and then a somewhat redemptive final act. If you've read any other reviews for this film, you know that the critics would flip flop what I said about the second and third acts. And critics are idiots, so that's why I'm here.*Before I go any further, I need to put in this sidenote. I won't be addressing the controversy of this film about whitewashing for 3 reasons. 1) It's a claim made my idiots that made up their minds about the film well before it ever reached theaters. B) It's actually a really easy claim to refute and prove wrong. And 4) I'm simply here to discuss the merits of this film and give my recommendation on whether you should watch it or not or hopefully provide a different way of seeing the movie if you already watched it.* As I said from the beginning, this movie has a strong start. There's a bit of reading at the beginning to introduce cybernetics-basically telling you to be prepared for cyborgs; after that, however, it jumps right into this futuristic world without trying to explain things too much. It wants the audience to accept what's happening and learn as the movie goes along. It's a smart approach that really elevates this film. What obviously also stands out are the visuals. But it's not just that you get a shot of the futuristic Japan and all the digital billboards and upgraded technologies that gives this movie its impressive visuals, it's the fact that they make sense. When Section 9 (all you really need to know is that Scarlett Johansson is a really powerful cyborg with a human brain and she's working for a company that built her, and her and her coworkers are part of Section 9) analyzes a crime scene using virtual red laser technology, it feels like an approach that is both convenient and useful-something that isn't always seen by the overuse of holograms in other films. Throughout the movie, ScarJo experiences what are called glitches when going through the real world because it's like repressed memories from her life as a human coming to the forefront. I'll discuss the merits of the plot later, but I added it in here because the glitches are a clever way to have shots of the real world and incorporate visuals directly into it, and they are one of the more intriguing mysteries of the film. The biggest issue of Ghost in the Shell is how one-note it gets. The digitalness of everything is really cool at first, but it loses a little appeal after awhile. What ends up being criminal in this film is the score and background noise. It's the same droning sound the entire time, and it takes its toll on you. And in the middle is where a lot of exposition is given with a ""twist"" as to whom the actual villain is. The thing about it is that lots of the characters are essentially cyborgs, so there isn't a whole lot of inflection in their voices. When you pair cyborg voices with the annoying score, it creates a muddled middle where you should paying the most attention but instead are at your most distracted. The third act is able to pick itself back up a bit. I'll talk about movie comparisons later, but this is really where the movie tries to find its most humanity and philosophy. Although it doesn't stand up to the deep thinking of other films, it's still more refreshing from all the exposition and subpar story development from the middle act. Oh, and don't expect the most tension or action from the climax; the action is there, but it's just a by-the-numbers climax scene. Inevitably, this film is going to draw comparisons to Blade Runner-emphasis is on the humanity behind the cyborgs and not the action itself. The difference is that while Blade Runner cleverly toys with morality and what it means to be human; Ghost in the Shell feels more like an empty shell than anything else. The ideas are presented, but it gets lost through the high budget effects. There's nothing wrong with having a large budget, but if characters aren't properly developed, it nulls any meaning. This issue is more apparent in this film due to the poor writing. In particular, a couple one-liners are thrown around that are groan worthy (""I wasn't built to dance!""). Overall, the ScarJo main character Major is fine, and I have no issue with her human's background story that is gradually revealed; my problem comes with both the supposed and actual villain. Neither of these characters are well-written, and they both have motivations and arcs anybody who has seen a movie can guess right from the start. The worst offense Ghost in the Shell makes is one that will probably be overlooked by most. It succeeds on many levels of creating an interesting world; however, this world is populated by dull characters. There isn't a distinction made on why we should pay attention to who is a cyborg, who has cybernetics, and who is purely human. It doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, so why should we care? And the answer is that we don't really care, and we won't be very compelled to hold any discussion of this film after watching it. This movie isn't a bad watch-in fact I kinda liked it-but there are so many obvious mistakes that could've easily been fixed that makes me upset by the final product. Oh, and to end on a properly irrelevant matter, if you're like me (which you most likely aren't), then you would've noticed that the Asian guy from The Dark Knight that's all like ""As I said, I'm good with numbers"" makes an appearance in this film.",Ghost in the Shell

Very good.,7,15 April 2018,"The film plays like a six, in that the story line is good but maybe not top-notch, but the ending is spectacular, and by spectacular I mean better than your average excellent film out there.So this is a seven to me, and recommended to all my friends and family.",Ghost in the Shell
269,jflizard,Not as bad as some say,7,11 June 2021,"As an action and visual effects I liked this movie a lot - some may say there's an original movie which is much better (still have to see it ), but looking at this without knowing much about that one is probably the best way to make a fair judgment. I know Ghost in a Shell goes way back in time , and it's a cult amongst anime fans, but let's just give it a break and look at the movie itself : not bad acting, not bad sound, not bad effects and a story which is also not bad at all... So all and all I have been entertained for the whole duration and never had an impulse of getting off of my chair and do something else . Seen much worse films and honestly , this is not bad at all (sorry for the die hard fans, but I'm being as fair as possible on this one based on how an unattached person to the original can be )",Ghost in the Shell
270,snowboarderbo,Excellent translation to live action,8,31 March 2017,"Saw it.I give it 8/10 stars. I thought it was very faithful to the original film. I thought the biggest problem it has is the overly obvious and ham-fisted dialogue at the beginning letting us know what themes are going to be explored. It's a problem with the original too, tho, so not unexpected. I thought Scarlett Johannson was okay in the role, but just okay. I didn't realize she was so tiny before this. I thought Pilou Asbæk did a great job as Batou, as did Takeshi Kitano as Aramaki. The rest of the cast was adequate.The bad spot in the film was the terrible CGI work done during the spider tank battle, specifically the part where Major runs up falling concrete slabs. The sequence shows us the superhuman effort only she is capable of making, but the CGI is terribly done: it looks like a bad video game sequence and is reminiscent of the terrible work done in both The Matrix Reloaded and Blade 2. It's necessary footage but I'm sure the director will regret to the end of his days paying the people who did the work and having to include it in his final cut.Other than that, I thought this was a solid translation of the subject matter. They nailed the look perfectly and I thought the story was told well enough that it may interest people who don't know much other than ""Scarlett Johannson movie"" that they will see more worth in the viewing and find things to talk about and so return to it again. I don't think there's much for a fan to be disappointed in with this live action movie; I know I'm not.",Ghost in the Shell

274,gelmcchristop,A respectable installment to the sci fi genre,9,25 June 2021,"Ghost in the Shell is evidently not the perfect movie for the average film enjoyer. The script, though intriguing and well-paced, feels incomplete, as if only the baseline was written and the rest was just filled up with a bunch of cliche garbage. The characters and their motives are particularly hollow, while some dialogue lines are strikingly lacking in subtext, unveiling the mystery the audience has been exploring for so long in a dissatisfying and simplistic manner.However, what it may lack in these particular fields it makes up for in its more technical aspects. The directing is not only consistent, but also original, deviating from the well-known and beloved western style, and embracing a more energy-based, Japanese approach. The cinematography, despite barely utilizing color schemes, works excellent combined with the meticulous concept art. The sound (effects) and editing are solid as well. But where the movie really shines is, you guessed it right, the visual effects. From the intricate tiny face implants to the highly complex damage effects or the vast procedurally generated cities, it manages to remain consistently top-notch, both technically and visually.",Ghost in the Shell
275,SharkByteAudioProductions,Absolutely stunning visuals and music - Ghost in The Shell is enjoyable even if it misses the point (revised),7,13 July 2019,"As a fan of the original Anime, Ghost in The Shell (1995) is an intelligent and influential piece of cyberpunk fiction that was too short and featured way too much political jargo. This live action adaptation expands the run time and trims majority of the original's needless political dialogue but it sadly misses 'the point' of the original anime.Upon initially watching this film, I felt it deserved around an 8/10 as the cinematography, music and overall production of the movie is really high and it's great from this prospective. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job as Major (despite not being Asian and the backlash she received from the role) and the rest of the acting is pretty good here and the action is solid as well; solid translation to live action in these departments.In terms of plot, however, upon reflection I felt Ghost in The Shell suffers in that it re-writes core elements of the original story which doesn't come together as well in my opinion - some of the character expansion featured is appreciated but some of the film really doesn't adapt some of the stronger philosophical elements of the original and this was a large part of its popularity. The original anime had some deep, subtle moments and it feels as if this was thrown away for a more personal story but it doesn't feel satisfying. The final act should've followed the original material much closer.In my opinion, watch the original for a better story adaptation but do give this live action version a watch even just for the music and visuals as they are really good!",Ghost in the Shell

277,Hassan_Scarborough,Not bad but not the same as the original,5,14 April 2017,"The film does take a lot of elements from the 1995 anime film. The film is almost structured the same.I gave this a solid 5 out of 10 because it isn't that bad a film and in terms of Scarlett Johansson's casting, It wasn't that bad. In the original manga film Major has blue eyes.So either give a Japanese actress blue contact lenses(Which to me is just as bad) or cast an actress with blue eyes. .Scarlett's casting didn't bother me at all. It was her performance. The Major wasn't one to smile or get overly emotional. There were times Scarlett gave slight smiles and went crazy to the point of tears. Then she seemed tight and stiff as if to emulate a robot the same way Peter Weller did as Robocop. She seemed almost confused at times.Her casting may not have been bad, along with Batou, but the rest of the film's cast was outright bizarre. Whitewashing is the least of this strangely cast film. Not sure if Ng Chin Han is even Japanese.Juliette Binoche and Michael Pitt are prime examples of Whitewashing because they simply were poorly cast and skin color had to have played a part in their casting. Peter Ferdinando's casting as Cutter wasn't bad but this film might as well have been called White Power.Danusia Samal has a bit part and although I personally loved watching Adwoa Aboah as a sexy prostitute entertaining Scarlett's Major Motoko, she was still a bit player and a prostitute. That's not a representation of progress in diversity. Have her as a girlfriend at least or become one. I mean, it's not like the film is staying cannon to the original.The irony of the Whitewashing controversy is that the original anime film featured a White female character. Blonde hair and blue eyes and what happens to this character is what pushes the subject of a ""Ghost"" within the cyborgs.So a White woman was going to be featured regardless.Don't get me wrong. Mrs. Johansson's performance isn't terrible. She's still a delight to watch, problem is it was off from the anime version.No the major problem are the deviations from that film and the manga series in general. It's not the same as deviating from an American comic book. The comic book companies deviate within the source material itself. And there are different versions of every character created by each American company in existence.Manga is different and most Japanimation brings in a different audience. So more people may have seen the 1995 film or even Arise, than have read the books.Another key element is that most anime is straight forward. What you see, is what you get. So there is very little that can be changed.And in all fairness, it's not like the original manga or film or anime series is all that diverse, but the casting was still bizarre.The film simply does not capture the essence of the manga or 1995 film or even the series Arise, which means it doesn't capture the essence of the key characters.Die-hard fans need to avoid this film. They will be disappointed. Casual fans might actually enjoy watching this. The film isn't bad. It's just a ""shell"" of the original.",Ghost in the Shell
278,johntk1566,Slightly shallow but enjoyable,7,5 April 2019,"I'm a massive fan of the source material; manga, film and tv series. They did a really great job with capturing the visuals in this, along with some of the core concepts. However, they lost some of the soul in the Hollywood bleaching process.I'm not talking about the white-washing of the cast, either. Scarlet Johansson is just fine in the role, and I hope that in the future, race will matter as little as it does in this setting. What they lost was some of the grit and emptiness that gave the original anime its essence. The Major is far more vulnerable and human in this film, which made it lose the important question which partially drove the original: is her ghost just another program?If you're a cyberpunk fan, this is a great film to enjoy, even with some of its shallowness. The visuals are great and they did a great job creating an original spin off the core material, without insulting the origin.One nerdy complain: I'm a huge fan of Batou. Why did they add extra skin around his eye implants???!!!",Ghost in the Shell
279,michaellaing71,A good Blockbuster film which needs to be watched as its own film,7,3 April 2017,"I have been a big fan of the Ghost in the Shell films and Stand Alone Complex series for many years,so when I first heard that Hollywood was adapting Ghost in the Shell and that they had cast Scarlett Johansson in the lead role, I was rather worried but the first trailer was OK so I thought I would give it a chance.Of course reading the reviews wasn't particularly but the one thing that I did notice was that the vast majority of reviewers seemed to be comparing the original and also to films like the Matrix, Robocop and Bladerunner instead of reviewing the film on its own.Yes it shares some of the themes of the above films and it isn't as good an any of them (including the original GITS or Stand Alone Complex) but this doesn't mean it is a bad film and comparing it to a myriad of other Hollywood blockbusters it is pretty good.The script isn't bad (though I did have some issues with the final act) and the directing is generally good, with good pacing and the editing was is generally decent. There was a couple of times where the film didn't quite make sense but it wasn't a big issue, just a little silly.The film doesn't follow the themes of the original and the twist in the film was so obvious that I worked it out before I saw the film.The acting is fine but a lot of the Section 9 actors don't get much too do, which is a pity and you don't get much of the team dynamic that you get in the original or Stand Alone Complex.Another area I heard complaints before involved the score but I thought Clint Mansell did a pretty good job and I really enjoyed it, whilst it never felt like it was over powering the film.So overall I enjoyed the film. It isn't going to be the best film of the year but it isn't bad and I suspect it will be one of the better blockbuster of the year (it is certainly better then most the last few years).",Ghost in the Shell
280,nmn34,Who Could Possibly Live in This Hallucinogenic Hell?,4,1 April 2017,"I have to get this out of the way, shame on the cast members that were saying that Scarlett Johanson was not trying to portray a Japanese character. I am not one to criticize a film for a supposed lack of diversity and I certainly did not take consideration of it in my scoring but they are pretty specific that the Major is Japanese. There is no mistaking that the makeup department went to great lengths to make her look Asian.The movie doesn't really need the controversy to drag it down however. It does that just fine on its own. And the main flaw can be summed up in one question and answer exercise: Would you put your brain in a robot body? If your answer was anything other than ""Hell yeah,"" you probably had no business writing this script.Fans of the franchise aren't all that interested in the introspective ideas about an artificial body's impact it has on an individuals humanity. And frankly, we have plenty of movies to sate the people that do. Now the geopolitical politics of such a world, now that is a whole new world to explore. Unfortunately, Ghost in the Shell delve more in the latter than the former. This rendition fails to deliver on the one key character the series is known for, the world. They scrap the twist and turns that the manga, movies, and series is known for, where through hard work the team of Section 9 peel back the layers of corruption to find an even greater evil then the terrorists they're tracking, instead they focus on a very linear story of self discovery as the Major learns about her past. Its hard to feel bad for somebody that is quantifiably awesome. A past that is stupidly convoluted by a villain that is just generically evil. The Major was made a weapon to combat terrorism after her parents were killed by terrorists. Only, they weren't and there was no prior indication that there were terrorists to combat until the company started making them. They created her to resolve their war with Kuze who they created to make her.Batou is hinted as having a troubled past in one second of throwaway dialogue and he is the luckiest of them to get that much. Ishikawa gets no backstory and the others get maybe one line of dialogue to share between them. I had to look up Ladriya in spite the fact that she was the third most regular member of the regular team because I am almost positive they never referred to her by name. Aramaki suffers the most however as he is uncharacteristically submissive through most the movie. In the series he is the guy that gets the official story but here his role is to be talked down to by Cutter and give vague threats of retribution. In the end he gets some action but it culminates in him killing a man in cold blood. The crimes of the Hanko Corporation go unanswered and are pretty much covered up, leaving Section 9's work unresolved. And I hate to say this, but I think I would have preferred if Aramaki was played by an English speaking actor. Not so much that for the language barrier but rather because it only highlighted that only one person in all of what I assume to be Japan spoke Japanese. I wasn't looking for an entire movie based around their adventures, but at least some reason why they are allowed to be in the same room as the Major would have been nice.The scenery proves another weak point for the movie. Instead of an interesting and compelling city backdrop that conveys a variety of insight in such matters as the city's health, they just threw as much crap on screen as they could. Flying koi, giant heads, geisha, anything they could blow up to the size of a small skyscraper gets a hologram that eats up most of the sky line. I can only believe that everyone living in this city wakes up in an existential nightmare when they look out their window in the morning to see a massive eye peering back at them. And for what reason do these things exist? They have no text and are too nondescript to be advertisements. But what is worse, they actively ruin some important scenes in the movie. There were times where important events were going on in the foreground but I was too distracted by a giant soccer player doing knee lifts in the background to pay attention.The dialogue is Suicide Squad bad, perhaps even worse as it isn't even delivered well. Cutter in particular constantly reiterates his vaguely evil plan of using the Major as a weapon. There is not a single scene involving him where he isn't just jumping up and down screaming to the choir that he is the real villain of this story. The Major is also guilty of some of the worst dialogue. While I can't recall the terrible ""They created me but they can't control me"" line from the trailers being said, there is one repeated line that gets old fast, ""I give consent."" It is repeated multiple times but never once is it necessary, she is the person that is initiating the actions in the first place. Her consent is implied already.I will say that there are some decent qualities to the movie. The characters look great, I thought Batou not being played by Ron Perlman would be a hard sell but Pilou Asbæk definitely managed to pull it off. Johanson looked like the Major, even with the controversy, and I have to give them credit for their good work. Their recreation of some of the scenes from the '97 movie were alright as well. I just wish they did a better job recreating the story better.",Ghost in the Shell

The fact that money was spent to make a movie that was so BORING and emotionless was it's worst crime. Like, what even was the point?? Let's make it 'cause we can??
Also, if they wanted to cast a white woman, for whatever reason, cast one that can act... that can carry the story.
Yea, yea.. she's a robot - but she's the most advanced robot, isn't she? So, why is she trudging around like her limbs are operated by gears and pulleys?I cared about Batou's eyes and the introduction of that robo-geisha was SICK!
And certain scenes were good, on their own, as individual scenes, but where did it go?? Nowhere.4 stars might seem high for a movie that put me to sleep twice (it took me three days to watch) but those are strictly for the visuals.

282,orlando-somera,Somehow I never get tired of Scarlett as a badass,9,2 April 2017,"This very entertaining movie is probably too artsy for most, but maybe not, there's plenty of violence. And its visual tastes are extremely refined and yet easily enjoyed. The plot is a simple one, the Major comes to doubt her origin story, that a company called Hanka saved her from death but had to put her brain into an outwardly soft, but quite capable robotic body, in order to do it.If you've ever dipped into manga, you will recognize the feel of this movie. That it manages to duplicate and improve on a 1990's era comic is no small achievement. It's quite clever about it. So is Scarlett Johansson. It's surprising how effective she is, even after Lucy and the Avenger's movies. It's good to spend some time with her as she brings the story to life.The idea that it would have been better with a Japanese in the lead role is hard to see. The story would have seemed a bit less relevant without Scarlett and that seems unnecessary.

Ghost in the Shell franchise is one of my most favorite anime franchises of all time and one of the most adult. Waking up on midnights during SNL sketches to see what was a sexy Law and Order cartoon was glorious. So a movie with live actors would make sense right? Yeah right.PLOT
Ghost in the Shell 2017 is misconstrued as possible. It takes several beats from different Anime franchises and makes nonsense. Sure the themes are there and the goal which is the same as usual. There is an evil hacker. He is unknown and made by the corporation. Now team of elite cyborgs must track him down to a conspiracy. Major Marry Killan a cop gone cyborg now must trace the evil with Batou a funny tough cyborg cop.There is a dumb plot twist at the end and you won't like it.ACTORS
This is where it is dumb. Don't expect Lucy Liu to play a Japanese woman. NOPE! It's ScarJo herself. Why is everyone else Japanese except her and speaking Japanese? The only reason why they chose her is because she's hot and can fight and marketable. He looks shorter than 1995 Motoko and can't act sad and with drawn yet stoic like in the anime but more bored than anything. As if she know she should not be here. So it only felt off with about how everything is. Beat Tekaishi plays Leader of Section 9 Apeface Amuraki. Togusa is barely noticeable.Why is Elvis the dog there? Why is the doctor from GITS 2 Innocence there? Why does this all disconnect?SPECIAL EFFECTS
Mostly good mostly bad. Mostly oversaturated. Sorry but there are too many holograms put here unironically. The fights are mostly good. But everything in this movie feels like it's just made by polygons and computers. Not a good look. Don't expect any full nudity. There is little blood and it's all PG-13.OVERALL

285,silverkelt,"Marginally entertaining, failed in its second half.",7,14 August 2017,"While entertaining and fun and even appealing in its first 60 or so mins of the movie, it seems to bog down as discoveries are made , it feels like a political spy thriller more then a action sci fi movie in its end. Its parts are good, but not great, it could've been better, however it is fairly solid and worth a re-watch now and then. Even though the CGI effects are solid, they could've delved so much further into concepts of cyber with cyber worlds.. they seem to miss that mark a bit. Considering the tepid and dismal movies pawned out every year to the viewing public, I would say this more or less achieved better then average status. Overall? Worth the watch.",Ghost in the Shell
286,ajrcvr,Poor attempt to present a masterpiece story,3,5 April 2017,"Not only does the story not follow the original, but the attempt at presenting Motuku Kosanagi is even poorer. Forget that ScarJo in as far from anything Asian as you can get, or that she is beautiful and a decent actress; she is simply wrong for the part. That the producers/directors couldn't see this pretty much tells the whole story. Why is she wrong? I'll illustrate. Say you want to make Robin Hood. You need a good actor, popular, one that do great action and draw in crowds. You select Jackie Chan or Jet Li, both popular, excellent actors, action people, good looking, well able to do the job. Unless it is a comic film, no one would take it seriously. That's what they did with GITS & ScarJo. Beyond that, their other errors are even worse, since whatever they did to the presentation of ScarJo doesn't make her as interesting or visually sexy and powerful a figure as the animated versions of her previously; they actually made her less sexy! Which is hard to do with a beauty like her. You don't quite get that Major Kusanagi is a real person, a mind and a soul in a robotic shell, but still a person, which provides the essential duality of her character. It's like asking Shemp Moe and Larry to play the Three Musketeers - won't work as anything serious, which GITS is. Very! The story itself is a substantially different story than Masamune originally wrote, which I suppose would be okay if it were anything near as good, which it isn't. They lost, or totally ignored, the whole Asian-Japanese influence throughout the entire movie - it has a different feel entirely, and it is an essentially dumbed down version of the questions that the original story asks. They had a chance to present a popular Japanese story, revered around the world for almost 30 years, and then made something different which is only a shadow of the original. They'd have been much better off making another anime, in 3D cgi, and sticking closer to the story and Asian feel that was in the original.",Ghost in the Shell
287,StrayFeral,"Amazing remake, but not worth the IMAX ticket price",10,31 March 2017,"This is review for the IMAX version of Ghost in the Shell.I just saw ""Ghost in the Shell"" at the local IMAX theater. I expected stunning 3D cinematics and so on and so on. Basically the bar was set way too high, as this is one of the two super-cult mangas of the 90s (the first one being ""Akira"" 1988).Well, in short - the movie is great! Worth every cent seeing it on a big screen.Now in detail - I probably had to first see again the original, so I could compare them, but I didn't. Maybe for good, as I watched the movie without way too much expectations and honestly enjoyed it. Stunning visuals - yes, great music - yes, great play - yes, Takeshi Kitano - YES, YES, YESSS!! (Who does not love Beat Takeshi?? :) Yes - and Scarlett Johansson. Well, she's great too, but can't beat the Beat ;)The only two things I do remember from the original are the first scene and the last scene, and these two do match, as of my memories. The other thing is the music - the hypnotic vocal theme. The music of the current version is great, but no match. It's just different. However, they included the original theme as well, just it's in the end credits.The only problem with this movie is the IMAX version - honestly, it does not worth the price of the IMAX ticket. Just there is nothing really worth seeing in the IMAX version! Yes of course - great picture quality, but hey I go to IMAX for stunning 3D visuals, not just great picture quality and ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 version is simply not enough 3D-enhanced for IMAX, so don't bother yourself going in there, unless you are just a fan of IMAX. In the last 5 years there was just one movie not created for IMAX, but really stunningly 3D-enhanced for IMAX and that was ""Dr.Strange"" 2016. No other movie IMAX version really got me so much, as ""Dr.Strange"" for IMAX. ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 looks great on IMAX, but not so great to worth the money for. At least my opinion.Oh and one more thing I didn't liked - no post-credits scene. Not that the original had one I remember of, but just letting you know there is nothing to wait the end of the credits for, unless you are one of these fans who wants to read the small notes.Good thing is - they mentioned that the soundtrack is going to get released, so check it out! It is not as stunning as Daft Punk's music for the second ""Tron"", neither ""Stranger Things"", but still it's great. I would give it like 8/10.So final words - go see it! But in case you can't see it on IMAX - don't be sorry.",Ghost in the Shell

Action should thrill and excite, horror should frighten, drama should make you both weep and laugh, etc.For an action movie to excite, you need tension. Who cares to watch an NBA team play some primary school kids? No-one. No tension. And that's the problem with this movie. At no point in this movie did you feel that Scarlett's character was in danger. All I was watching was an NBA player doing slam dunks over some school kids. Sure the slam dunk looked cool, but it wasn't a ""match"" it was a demonstration.I would highly recommend people go watch the Appleseed movie series. It is EXACTLY what GITS should have looked like: hyperkinetic action with some overwhelming odds for good measure. We have to feel that Scarlett is up against such competition that we are on the edge of our seats.And the comparison between Appleseed and GITS is apt, because the opening scene of the first Appleseed movie is what the ending scene of GITS should have looked like. Both involved tanks, but in Appleseed it was thrilling and tense, and in GITS it was YAWN.",Ghost in the Shell
291,mclong2009,Very good Sci-fi,9,6 April 2017,"Not being acquainted with the anime story, I enjoyed ""Ghost in the Shell"" and I liked the way the plot unfolded. The scenery was amazing- -I was wishing they had filmed more of the scenes at night. The daytime scenery was OK, but like Las Vegas it seemed drab compared to the night time cinematography. The futuristic world that 'Ghost in the Shell' creates is the most advanced science fiction I've ever witnessed--you never knew the robots from the ""enhanced"" humans and just regular, normal characters seemed to in the minority. By now it would be hard to recognize Scarlet Johanson playing some other character than a sci-fi super hero or advanced, experimental being.",Ghost in the Shell
292,lazyaceuk,Empty shell,5,25 November 2019,"As the final credits rolled part of me thought ""I'm not the demographic for this film which is why it failed to engage me."" Checking the 12A/PG-13 that thought seemed reasonable. Then, checking the film's box office I'm guessing the film makers didn't have a clear demographic for their product.Visually the film was interesting. However, the story was banal and could have been delivered in 43 minutes if this had been a standard network show episode. The long journey towards the final reveal that explained away the shadow/ghost images that continued to fuel Scarlett Johansson's restless existence exploded like an indoor firework that had been immersed in a bucket of water for a month.I am a huge sci-fi fan and this is possibly why my mind drifted onto other films that the film makers had obviously chosen to pay homage to as they attempted to create originality. In 1982 Ridley Scott painted a very dystopian vision of the future with internal sets and matte backgrounds and yet the clammy feel of that lower budget world had more realism than the algorithms in play here. Similarly, in Bladerunner, Harrison Ford's character had heart which enabled his audience to empathise with his out of date cop methods.Johansson's performance is dire. You have no empathy for her, her character or her latterly revealed true character. Even the bad guys are thinly drawn and underwhelming which just leaves you shrugging your shoulders as they are either maimed or shuffle off to be re-booted, if appropriate.There are two highlights in this film. The first is Pilou Asbaek's hair and the second, and best, is the performance of Takeshi Kitano who utters wise council in amongst the chaos.As Pilou's character says ""...what's the difference, fantasy, reality, dreams, memories. It's all the same, just noise."" This reality is...........just noise.",Ghost in the Shell

Opposite to some SCIFI sagas (recent Star Trek movies for example), there is respect with the source material.This movie takes the great scenes of the original movie and makes them the ""live"", and successfully. There are great CGI scenes but not too excessive. And also the story is different than the anime. So no remake here.Scarlet Johansson plays the title character perfectly and the other supportive actors and actresses are excellent too. I hope there will be U.S. sequels !So yes, go watch it.

294,rs403404,Empty Shell,4,8 April 2017,"Remaking a classic is difficult to pull off right. Recently, ""Beauty and the Beast"" came very close in many ways to the original. Now we have another animation classic being remade into live-action. ""Ghost in the Shell"" has a real chance at being something unique, compelling, and memorable The original is an anime and, therefore, Japanese; thus, made for that audience. Therefore, this American version might have a new perspective to offer.Sadly, this new perspective turns out to be a dumbed down one. ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 flounders in its inability to understand the source material. In the world of ""Ghost in the Shell"" (any version), technology has reached a point where any human body part can be upgraded. The resultant population lives in varying degrees with cybernetics. People who are fully human still exist, but they are a rarity.In their essence, the setups of the two movies parallel closely. How they follow up on that is quite different. The original focused on asking questions. The remake seems to feel the need to answer those questions for the audience. The main protagonist in the films is the Major (here portrayed by Scarlett Johansson) who is just a brain in a fully robotic body. Because of this, she questions whether or not she's still human. In the original while the Major is the main character, her partner Batou is the heart of the movie. It is his unwavering confidence in the Major's humanity despite her soul rending doubts that provides the audience's perspective. Thus, the audience senses that the Major is good and empathize with Batou's belief in her.In the remake, Batou exists because he was written in the original, his perspective fades into the background noise. Instead, the Major seems to be the heart of the piece. She clearly has emotions and concerns and is desperately wanting to cling to her soul or ghost so she can be human. Problem is, by handling it this way, there is no question for the audience to weigh. Clearly, she still is human; even if she doubts it, the audience does not. Another issue this presents is that it forces Johansson to play a role that requires showing emotion while being as emotionless as possible. It's a tricky balancing act that she handles fine, but the end result is a movie whose heart is as emotionless as possible.Kudos to the filmmakers for how well the movie maintains the aesthetic of the anime classic. Nevertheless, it fails to understand what was at the heart of that movie and what made it a classic. Perhaps the simpler title ""Empty Shell"" would fit the remake better.",Ghost in the Shell
295,darryl-42069,At last... Hollywood did what's should have been done a long time ago,8,1 April 2017,"For someone who didn't grew up or watch the original GitS, I don't understand a thing about this whitewashing thing (HOWEVER, I do have some research about GitS, so whoever wanna down vote this for no reason [*cough*salty haters*cough*], think again). I do read a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but I don't believe it since I've been interested in this movie since the first trailer dropped.Turns out it's better than what people say. The story is unique. I actually enjoyed the story even though I believe it is not a fully recreation of the original movie. What makes the story so unique is the theme: The movie makes focus of what it feels for a cyborg to have emotions. About identity and individuality. These themes are what GitS for me is special. Another thing that that makes GitS unique is that it blurs the line between good and evil. You don't know is he a good guy or is he a bad guy. This movie do blurs the line a bit, but not much (It does blur a bit more in the climax). It shows that even though they can't recreate exactly like the anime, but it shows that they actually care and don't want to fall down the exact hole that Dragonball Evolution did.The characters and the acting are on point. Scarlett Johansson as the Major/Motoko Kusanagi/Mira Killian is great. Sure, she still played the kinda same character in Lucy, but I believe she did a good job as a emotionless cyborg. Beat Takeshi is awesome as Chief Amaraki. The guy who played Batou is great as well. Too bad Rila Fukushima who played Yukio in The Wolverine had a very small role in GitS.The action scenes were great and some of them are recreations of the original (Trust me, I've seen comparisons. It matches so well). The final action scene is climatic and very well shot. The last scene in the movie is perfection and builds up the next installment, should this movie succeeds. The music is eargasmic! The composer deserved a two thumbs up for creating such a amazing soundtrack. They even add the original GitS theme in the end (I know it because I've seen the movie's shelling sequence, with this EXACT song. Thanks IGN!). Fans of the original definitely will be pleased by this.Now let's talk the real ""problem"" for this movie. Seriously, whats the big deal about this whitewashing bullshit? I've read articles and wiki pages about GitS. It tells what I thought it would be: that the ""Ghost"" is Motoko (Japanese), but the ""Shell"" has undefined race. So what if a Japanese inside a American body (Shell), her actually self is still Japanese (Heck even Mamoru Oshii said the exact thing). These so-called ""GitS"" fan clearly don't understand a damn thing about this. Just because it's from Japan doesn't mean it must be played by a Japanese. Why these people question/complain about a CYBORG'S race??? Oh and one more thing, for so- called ""GitS"" fan who's looking for nipples in this movie, just give up, they won't be in it anyway.Overall, the movie is enjoyable from start to finish. It may bore some average movie goer, but if you pay attention enough, you will definitely enjoy this movie. Congratulations Rupert Sanders, you managed to made the most faithful anime adaptation ever made. Your hard work has finally paid off.It save to say that they have found the correct ""Ghost"", and made a great ""Shell"".

297,johnnyrj,A decent take on brilliant anime.,8,7 July 2017,"Going in expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised by what they managed to deliver. First and foremost, Ghost in the Shell was the anime movie that changed everything for me. I had 0 interest in anime shorts or movies until someone insisted I check out GITS and that was pretty much the beginning of the end for me. GITS blew me away completely and changed my perspective forever. There is an unparalleled depth to Ghost in the Shell that you just don't find anywhere else in anime even to this day. It remains one of the all- time great anime movies because the direction is brilliant, the acting (Japanese) is absolutely perfect, and the story is just plain epic.Ghost in the Shell 2017 did not fail to deliver. I wasn't actually expecting them to nail every single thing that made the anime so great, but I was expecting them to adapt things as well as they could and they didn't disappoint. It's not the greatest movie ever, it's not the greatest acting ever, and it's probably not going to win an Oscar for anything, ever, but it's an enjoyable adaptation of a great anime movie. Scarlett must have studied Major's facial expressions pretty carefully because she nails those nicely. They also did a pretty brilliant job with all the electronics and high tech gear. Overall a good adaptation of a great anime movie.",Ghost in the Shell
298,sunheadbowed,Not so great.,4,17 August 2017,"Oh dear, Hollywood continues to be useless. 'Ghost in the Shell' has all of the psychological and intellectual depth of a fresh pool of urine emptied from a dwarf's bladder. The film is set in Tokyo, yet almost everyone is an American Caucasian, which is hilarious and easily the most entertaining aspect of the film (no country knows how to insult other countries like America does). 'The Matrix' was an unofficial live action adaptation of the 1995 original anime feature, and it was a really creative, clever and innovative film (everything that this film is not), so why was this remake even necessary? The reason why, of course, is because they are completely out of ideas in America yet they want to continue making billions of dollars regardless, so they butcher both the creative films of the past and those of other countries.If there is anything positive I can say about the film's existence, it's that it may inspire people to check out the great original -- but even that is dated in 2017, post-Matrix, and wouldn't have the same impact of seeing it in the era of premillennial anxiety that was the 1990s when everyone was terrified of technological advancement (now we all just submit to it like hostages, we don't care). Maybe, however, it has came all the way around again and in this era, which is a different world, people will interpret the film in a new way, recognising how technology makes them feel cold and isolated, less than human. Also there were some visually impressive shots (all taken from the anime, of course, why bother with any originality).The title is an ironic metaphor for Hollywood itself -- Hollywood is a cold, capitalistic machine that once had a soul (albeit a very indulgent and self-absorbed one, yet it had a trace of self-awareness to it), and now all it has left is a deceased ghost memory stumbling around inside its metal prison, running out of ideas.

302,PogoNeo,Ghost In The PG-13,6,11 September 2017,"First of all, the info for the fans of the originals: the story was completely remade but it retains many ideas / scenes from the anime movies and series. So if there is such category as a full scale remake, than this is itUnfortunately the biggest problem with this adaptation is that this motion picture has way too much of popcorn-like obvious CGI. Most shots of the epic city and some of the action sequences are kind of disjointed as they look artificially cheap and at the same time they ring a plastic bell instead of evoking a deep dystopic feeling. This Hollywood version of GITS was released 25 years after ""Blade Runner"" and 18 years after ""The Matrix""- and yet it comes (not all the time) as if the film industry technology was still not able to pull off such s-f endeavor. When watching, it can be often told what was a set, what was a location and what was a green screen. And what is more, this also goes for the fight scenes in regards to movement. So mix that with a lot of shoots of Disney-cyber-land and you will get an adequate picture of this motion pictureAlso unfortunately, this review could be entitled ""Ghost In The Cliché"", because it has many of them. With the most annoying being the positive / neutral character smoking a cigarette- for which Hollywood imposes of course the capital punishment; and so you know right away the onscreen fate of that personThe third issue would be that there is way more action than character development. We know very little about the other Section 9 characters, to which belongs the main protagonist. And if there would be more thrill driven scenes instead of just shooting guns and melee combats, then that would also benefit this adaptationAs for the philosophical issues within that futuristic world, there are just slightly touched upon. For example there is this scene of main female character (the Major) getting all emotional with a woman on a street. But the viewers have to guess that it is a prostitute and also have to imagine, that after the short talk and after the feeling of her skin, there was at least an attempt from a cyborg (the Major) of having a sexual intercourse with a human professional (to experience what it means to be human). And what is even worst, they did shot a kiss scene between them but it was not included in the final cut. But at least there is this one great scene of diving into a machine for hacking purposes, which was made in an excellent surreal form (so the hacking is visualized, but in a completely different artistic way than in the anime features and series)So the question is: what happened to this yet another adaptation of that (adult themed) manga? And the answer is: PG-13.

The story isn't engaging, the dialogue is bad and poorly delivered, the action isn't exciting, the art design is bland and so is the soundtrack.1995's Ghost in the Shell has a very hypnotic, slow paced rhythm much like Blade Runner, but this live action version just feels so generic despite the fact that they try to recall some aspects of the anime films and TV shows.The whole thing just looks and feels cheap, like a soulless copy of its former self.

308,manisimmati,A Worthy Remake of the 1995 Anime Classic,8,8 July 2017,"Who is Mira Killian? Some call her a machine, others call her a weapon. A few years ago, she almost died because of a serious accident. The shady corporation Hanka Robotics extracted her brain and planted it into a synthetic body – an empty vessel. Now Mira fights cyber crime for the Japanese government. A mysterious Hacker by the nickname of Kuze seems to be the key to Mira's past. A frantic chase through dystopian Tokyo ensues. But does Mira really want to know who she actually is?Mamoru Oshii's ""Ghost in the Shell"" from 1995 is an anime and sci-fi classic: It is visionary, artistic, exciting and meaningful. The prospect of Hollywood remaking such a masterpiece is bound to raise some eyebrows. I was sceptical myself. But Rupert Sanders' 2017 version of ""Ghost in the Shell"" pleasantly surprised me. Of course, if you think of the original as the Holy Grail, you might as well not bother with this new movie; you're going to dislike it no matter what. But if you watch it with an open mind, you will soon realize that it's not as horrible as it's made out to be. In fact, it's a pretty great movie.Oshii's anime is deep and philosophical. Sanders' real life version is not. Which is fine by me, because Sanders succeeds in giving the source material (that is, Masamune Shirow's manga series) another emphasis: an emotional one. It is all about the feelings of the protagonist Mira. Oshii's ""Ghost in the Shell"" might be a masterpiece, but there's no denying that its protagonist Major is more a shell than a ghost. In the original, Major ceases to be a person – she dissolves. In the remake, it's the exact opposite: Mira gradually becomes a person. That's a great twist to refresh the story we already know and love. I for one was spellbound by Mira's quest for identity.This movie has some obvious flaws. The script is wise enough to stay away from the musings of the original. But the few times it tries to be philosophical, it is painfully trivial instead. The villain is a paper cut-out. The visuals are impressive, but sometimes they're a bit too shiny for their own good. But other than that, there's much to enjoy. They recreated many iconic scenes from the original, which is great fan service – for the most part, anyway. (Remaking the stunning opening credits from the original is a hopeless task.) Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Mira Killian – a real action star. Speaking of action, the fight scenes in this movie are as spectacular as they're stylish. Here and there, Sanders is able to give the imagery an artistic touch I wasn't expecting at all. Plus, there's Takeshi Kitano being a total badass. Yay!""Ghost in the Shell 2017"" provides interesting, thrilling and emotionally charged sci-fi action. It might not be the most original movie ever, but it is an admirable effort to do the original justice.",Ghost in the Shell
309,Hellsinger,There is a hypersensitive fanbase,9,4 July 2019,"As someone who watches a lot of movies and anime, I am aware that things like GitS have a large cult following. Another famous example is perhaps Berserk, where the hardcore fans grin at the most recent releases because it's too CGI for their taste and that may be true to some extent, however the reality is this is what we get so in short get over it.I, like many, thought this would be a failure of a movie. No, not because of the cast, not necessarily because of the script but because generally adaptations from animes and video games fare poorly.Before I briefly comment on the film, I feel I need to comment on the anime itself. GitS Season 1 is one of those animes in two halves. The first half, pretty empty, devoid of any serious story and it only starts with the Laughing Man saga. So again, I know there are hardcore fans out there who value each millisecond but not me. Laughing Man saga is very good, the rest not so much. GitS Season 2 is extremely boring, slow and feels almost like a poor rehash of the first season. It's the same deal with the movies, Innocence being way too heavy on philosophical quotes. Interesting to an extent but really designed for the cult followers I feel.So with that in mind, that the anime is NOT that great, compared to the ones I think are, like Wolf's Rain, Last Exile, Soul Eater etc... let's address the film. I enjoyed the visual aspect, the story how Batou lost his eyes and so forth. In fact the only part I really disliked was with the Japanese actress who plays Makoto's mother. I live in Japan and the acting pool here is very poor. She's the best they could pick probably, that says a lot in itself.In conclusion, unless you're a hardcore cult follower who basically wants every single scene shot frame for frame then give it a watch.",Ghost in the Shell

311,antialias11,"Not perfect - but not bad, either - SPOILER FREE",7,2 April 2017,"In a few words: definitely watchable - even for someone like me who owns all the movies and series DVDs and has been a huge fan of the anime created for GITS (if not so much the manga). In a few more words: The bad: That the philosophy would get dumbed down isn't surprising. But there's still boatloads more in here than in, say, the Matrix (and people praised THAT for this aspect), so we shouldn't be overly harsh. Johannson's acting is what it always is - shaky at best. For me she doesn't fit the role - neither her overly emotional approach, nor physically. No, I don't care she's not Asian. None of the characters in the anime - save for Aramaki and maybe Saito - look Asian, either. The story of GITS, for me, has always been about stone cold professionals on the edge of their respective fields - with all the sacrifices that are made in order to stay on top taken to an extreme. She does not portray this believably (much like she fails to do so in her other 'superhuman' roles like in the Avengers franchise). She's the pretty-face A-lister du jour in Hollywood that puts bums in seats and that's the long and short of why she's in the movie. The dialogue could have been better but it serves well enough as an introduction for people new to GITS. Surprisingly the worst performance comes from Juliet Binoche.The good: The techno environment is captured perfectly. Many scenes (down to some 'filler' atmospheric shots) have been lovingly taken from the anime movies/series and recreated in detail. It's only one of two movies where I'd say the 3D actually adds to the feel of it (the other being ""Tron: Legacy""). The music is great without intruding. Pathos is, thankfully avoided. The cast of section 9 - especially Batou and aramaki - work for me very well. The performances of the villains are nothing to write home about, though.The very good: This feels like a solid base for a franchise. There's a chance here to expand into the philosophical aspects and give the other members of Section 9 more definition in further movies as well as expanding on the hacking and ""standalone complex"" aspects. Doing all that in the first movie in depth would have felt rushed/forced to say the least. Will definitely buy once the DVD comes out. Maybe even rewatch in the theater to catch some more detail.",Ghost in the Shell

Some of the scenes (eg, the water fight) were perfectly replicated from the original.There were a couple points in the story where i was worried it was getting boring, but thankfully there weren't many and it wasn't too much of a detriment to the film as a whole.Overall, a solid tribute to the original with a bit of a tweaked story.Well deserved 7/10",Ghost in the Shell

It was absolutely beautiful in its settings and character designs. No one can deny that it is visually on par with or exceeds the best Hollywood has put out. I found the adaptation stalling in places. Where the filmmaker seemed to expect drama to build it seemed, to me, that it stalled. Some of the fight scenes with the Major were amazing. I just wish the story was more compelling in its translation. The lesson should be that if Hollywood would just adapt the source material without trying to make it all things to all people the movie would find its audience. By watering down the story, it just makes it meh to the uninitiated and alienates the long time fans.",Ghost in the Shell

I often agree with the criticism, but in relation to this iteration of Ghost In The Shell could not disagree more.The narrative is not as technically dense and philosophical as the original and diverges in some points. Notably the most emblematic scenes were masterfully re-created. The actor performances range from reasonable to decent, and the cinematography and visual architecture are breathtaking. Students of visual arts, graphic design, science fiction aficionados and alternative cinema lovers; trust me, this version of Ghost in The Shell is mandatory.Ghost in The Shell is not the original masterpiece, and has the disadvantage that the main theme is no longer a novelty. But it is a decent movie with exotic and wonderful visuals, endowed with a cyberpunk atmosphere that will not leave the lovers of the genre indifferent .. It is an action thriller painted with surreal neon tones. If you like science fiction and are fed up with the Marvel and Star Wars formula, take a look at this movie, maybe it's what you're looking for.",Ghost in the Shell

I don't understand why it's getting such bad reviews. Yes they cast Scarlett Johansson as The Major rather than an 'asian' actress, but she is very good in the role, and obviously brings a lot of potential box office, but ignoring that, I thought it was really good.I have also only seen the animation once and that was the year it came out so there was no comparison for me. It's the closest thing to BladeRunner we have ever had since BladeRunner, and some of the scenes I felt could just be cut into a future SuperMega cut of Ghosts in the Bladerunner Shell. (I'm pretty sure I could cut them together and make a single story - maybe one wet weekend I will).It looks fantastic and the world they have created is believable and not too far in the future I imagine (except for the killer robot bits). But as with all CGI heavy movies, as I left the cinema I felt like I had been overwhelmed with images and that I would have difficulty singling our individual scenes that looked amazing.All the city scapes are brilliant, the fights are brilliant the chase through the city on foot looks great the big helicopter thing is awesome (and will probably appear in the next James Cameron film) but the scenes that were the best in the film for me were, The Major and her Mum. The Major on the boat with the blonde bloke, Old dude and the baddies with the old fashioned gun. Once again the best bits are all the character developing stuff where I actually get emotionally attached to the film.If you like sci-fi go and see it. If you don't like sci-fi then don't.I liked it.

I know one example where I liked the remake more then the original: ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"". On the other side, I could not finish movies like the remakes of ""Let the right one in"", ""Oldboy"" or ""The Experiment"". I'm also not into the recent life-action adaptations of Disney movies like ""The Jungle Book"", ""Cinderella"" or ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Not that they are bad movies, they just add nothing new and therefore I kinda watched them unemotional.But let's get to ""Ghost in the Shell"". Maybe I'm lucky by not having the original in mind, but i kinda liked the movie. The world was depicted very well. I liked all the characters and their motivations. I enjoyed the action-sequences and the plot. Probably the biggest flaw in my opinion was the little underwhelming finale of the movie. The movie has a run-time of approx. 150 minutes, but it didn't feel that long. So I was kinda surprised of the ending. I would have liked a more meaningful ending.So to say praises to the director and art director, I really loved every little visual detail.

319,Alondro,Just the shell...,3,31 March 2017,"It gets a 3 only for SOME of the visual effects... as others have noted, some scenes don't work and appear more unreal than the old 2D animated film.As for the most important part: the story... where did it go? The writers of this screenplay had the greatest advantage possible: A PERFECT, ACCLAIMED ORIGINAL. It was a story which addressed very complex subjects of mind versus machine: at what point does a mind become a computer, at what point does a program become a mind? And is there truly a difference at all once something becomes aware of itself.That's not present here. It's a stolen identity/conspiracy plot you've seen over and over, and done better. Apparently they threw the whole original story out and inserted this hackneyed plot which felt like an awkward mix of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" themes, with all the heart and soul torn out and left hollow.There is no ghost in this shell. It's just a thin, flashy facade over a contrived, tired jumble of plot points... perhaps an unintentional irony to the CGI facade over the crumbling buildings in the movie.On the themes of Hollow-wood cashing in on lazy nostalgia grabs (Power Rangers last week as another example), this leads me to suspect the heavy tone and themes of ""Blade Runner"" too will be deconstructed and dismembered in the remake, until only another empty shell remains.At least in this case, for certain, the advances in computer science have lessened the humanity in the film.",Ghost in the Shell

Not of the franchise, I wasn't that involved, but I really did love the films. So, this film was visually stunning, -stunning- I can't stress that enough. And I'm not talking about fancy CGI here, this was an amazing piece of art. You could watch it even without a script and it would make sense! Also, amazing soundtrack -of course- and a true nod to the original (aesthetically).The only difference I found in the script (in general, not the plot), was that this film was a character driven story. All the philosophical stuff stemmed from the protagonist's experiences. It's a good way to keep an audience interested, it's the go to of Hollywood and it is something I expected and honestly, really didn't mind. Major has an interesting story to tell. Plus I went into the cinema and expected to see something that could stand on its own feet and not just recreate the anime. What's the fun in that? Plus, guys, this is Hollywood, if they took the ""lets talk about human nature"" way, we'd be simply telling them not to play with things they don't understand. This is the kind of film that Hollywood makes, and this particular film is actually a good example of that kind of film. I didn't give it a 10 because that's kept for real masterpieces and this film just misses that special something. As if it reached the edge of what was achievable but in the end, didn't take the leap. Still a great film though.As for the casting, I think they were all wonderful. Scarlett too, she did a great job making her movements robotic, everything she did was calculated and her stillness in some shots was really eerie but her eyes were so freaking expressive, as if all that was left of her humanity was hiding there, well done Scarlett.Speaking of whom, I feel I need to address this subject. Is there whitewashing happening in Hollywood. Duh, of course there is. Is it normal to want an Asian actress to be cast in a film taking place in an Asian environment? Sure is. Is it a stretch to say that Scarlett freaking Johansson was cast in a role because she was white? Eeeeh, it kind of is. I mean, she's not some random white girl, she's the highest grossing actress of all time, the A list of Hollywood's A list, who wouldn't cast her? And for a film that would be criticized by fans anyway because ""it's a Hollywood production of a Japanese title again"" why not bring in the big guns to attract the general populace? I'm not going to go into the ""Major is a cyborg so she can be of any background because she doesn't have one"" debate, because I think it didn't play a part in the casting decision, it was clearly a marketing choice to cast someone who is already famous and popular. Plus Johansson is THE action girl these days, I mean, who else would Hollywood cast?",Ghost in the Shell

Though I've never heard of the anime and manga before this movie came out, I will definitely be checking it out now. The visuals are stunning (except the awkward ones scattered here and there throughout the film). All in all, I highly recommend this movie.

And, while the story is somewhat predictable, it's packaged so well!Scarlett Johansson plays a young woman whose brain has been placed in a mechanical body, or ""shell"", and is having a bit of an existential crisis while serving in an anti-terrorism quasi military unit. Taheshi Kitano, Pilou Asbaek and Juliette Binoche are excellent as her boss, partner and doctor, while Michael Pitt shines as, uh, well, that would be giving it away.The film continues to face some controversy because – while it was based on a Japanese manga, financed by Chinese companies and essentially set in Hong Kong – it featured Western actors in three of the key lead roles.This movie may be a bit of an acquired taste, but if you like Blade Runner, see it now.

324,ajping,More shell than ghost,6,27 July 2017,"This is not a bad movie, but considering the rich possibilities the milieu offers, it is incredibly disappointing. First, the claims that the movie was whitewashed are true, but not for the reasons called out by popular media. Johansson is actually a good casting choice for the lead, as is the man playing her sidekick, Batou. But it's shocking how many extras and other actors are not Asian considering the location of the film - Tokyo. I mean, you couldn't find an Asian actor to play one of the scientists or the villain? The movie might as well be set in Sydney or Melbourne. The movie could have overcome this glaring problem with better direction or writing. But sadly, most of the performances lack any spark. Takeshi is on life-support and even Batou, despite an impressive attempt, comes off a little flat. The real disappointment is Johansson, though. She could have owned this role but she just doesn't turn it on. The Major should be played with more emotion. As Mamoi Kaori explains, she's fearless and wild. We don't get that vibe from Scarlet.

The story is totally bastardised. Granted, the original GITS plot borders on impenetrable at times, but they've taken out all the intrigue, mystery and complicated ideas, only to replace them with a standard action plot you can find anywhere. They also weirdly mix in some minor elements of the 2nd GITS anime. They showcase a lot of the iconic scenes from the original but that's about it really. Why even bother calling this GITS? O wait, money, that's why. The result is quite frankly a soulless (ghost-less?) exercise in style over substance. Don't get me wrong, I love a bit of gorgeous stylish eye candy but there wasn't enough originality even in that regard. Good points: Scarlett Johansson and particularly Juliet Binoche are very watchable actors. Though Johansson sometimes was too robotic/emotionless at times - she was still supposed to be human right? The Yakuza bar scene is tension filled and original to this version (even though ultimately pointless). The only other interesting change they made concerns the Major's back story, who she was before she was made into a cyborg. It's unexpected, affecting and emotional. The music isn't half bad. Overall, it really should have been edgier, artier and taken more risks. They should have tried to stick to the original plot - extending it and clarifying the vagueness. Instead they took out vast chunks of difficult material in order to appeal to a mass audience. Disappointing.",Ghost in the Shell

328,zadok-332-444684,A worthy American remake,7,9 April 2017,"Yet another classic redone. A good remake should never aim to ""replace"" the original and GitS thankfully doesn't. Theatre lives by this tradition for centuries. How to get it right? In theatre modern interpretations often look for the substance, the core of a play, and apply it to the present realities. In consequence even clear cut plots get more and more abstracted. Ghost in the Shell does it the other way around: the rather philosophical original, partly hard to digest not least for western viewers drama wise, gets an ""emotional upgrade"" in a more personalized and thus more relatable plot. To put it bluntly: the different forces at work all have a face representing them. At least as far as western film language goes it does work as an improvement as a cinema experience and renders it more accessible, more pointed. It is however sacrificing abstraction as it is precisely the absence of the person in favor of the ghost (one could say ""soul"") the original deals with. Mind ""person"" originally means ""mask"", as in the (role defining) masks ancient actors used. Thus it is an image related term that does *not* refer to the abstracted substance ""ghost"" or ""soul"" refers to. That said it has not become a mindless SciFi-flic but remains a journey into a future dealing with the modern version of the ancient body/soul problem.It is to be praised if a film manages to be genuinely different than the original while still interpreting or commenting the same original point. Now one could argue whether or not it actually is the original point it is honouring. It certainly convinced me that its makers made an honest attempt at doing so - and that's all we can possibly ask for. Thus I applaud a well done interpretation, which is of course perceivably different and I dare say ""rather American"". Nothing wrong with that, as it is an American film.Although I'd have liked to hear more of the original score referenced I loved some very literal references, scenes from the original redone. These are used skillfully and weave into the plot in a good way: Although the images are ""the same"" they do play a different role in the plot. That's a great way to honour one's predecessors! The cast, the drama, the plot and characters: it all works out. Specifically Juliette Binoche and Takechi Kitano play brilliant supportive roles, which goes a long way.All in all I had a great time watching it and can only recommend checking out this film - whether or not you loved the original.",Ghost in the Shell

330,alex-klein2424,An Empty Shell,5,13 June 2017,"There came a time in this movie when I started thinking back to the previews and really wanting to watch them instead of this. I turned to my brother and thought I saw he was asleep but apparently he wasn't and turns out he really liked this movie so as with any review take this with a grain of salt.Me on the other hand, I wish I had taken this with a grain of something else. I was not impressed by this movie. I will start by saying I have not seen the anime movie this was based on but I know it was better. When the news broke that Scar Jo was playing the Asian female lead I rolled my eyes. Another chance for Hollywood to embrace diversity and also stay true to source material but they crumbled again to the whims of what I am assuming were some old movie executives who said ""Scar Jo Sells BABY"". Well only time will tell if that is true but I already have a feeling my sentiments are being shared by others.In the movie she plays a robot with a human brain who is a cop or some type of fighting weapon. The story is not fleshed out very well and you can never tell if this is the government or a different organization. It obviously takes place in the future, were everyone is turning into robots so I guess there is some relevancy there as well. She is surrounded by a cast that includes the wonderful French actress Juliette Binoche, another Danish actor, and everyone else is Asian. The entire city is mostly Asian so it is very strange that Scar Jo isn't. Even stranger is a scene towards the end of the movie where we find out she probably was Asian and just feels annoying.The story is a very typical story and while there are bunch of lofty ideas that were very interesting, it seemed like they were not meant to be talked about as more than a throw away line here or there about what is real and what is fake and what it means to be human. This movie could have been really good but I just did not enjoy it. It tried to be a thinker but ended up being a stinker. I did enjoy Scar Jo's boss, I don't remember his name but he spoke in Japanese the entire time and no one else did, which seemed strange but again, the Shell is cooked by this point.If you like movies with Scar Jo or adaptions of anime then this is your ticket to paradise. If you don't like movies where you are confused about the casting, or things just seem a little off, then maybe skip this one for a home viewing.

Its world visually reminds me of Blade Runner, and a little bit of Firefly. The plot and main character are basically Robocop, if Robocop had been built from the brain of... SPOILER... an executed dissident. The philosophy or spirituality is baked into the premise of a human brain in a robot body, so although it's in the title, the questions of what makes a person don't hit the audience over the head quite as much as the spiritual questions do in The Matrix or Dr. Strange. I loved how they blended seamlessly into the plot. The complicated plot was fairly easy to follow once it got going, but there were a few moments of confusion, especially in the beginning, when I was a little lost because I had not read the manga. There were a number of quiet scenes, some of which helped me understand the plot or characters, some of which were just places where I mentally started writing my review because there wasn't anything going on, so that's why I gave this a 9 instead of a 10. The internet buzz leading up to this movie mostly focused on the casting decision to put a white actress in the role of Major. Actual Japanese people from Japan were not the ones complaining, though; it seemed to be white Americans doing the complaining, so, I didn't let that deter me from seeing the movie in the theater. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to American keyboard warriors' attempt to torpedo this Japanese-approved movie for not being Japanese enough. Major's body is a robot. She's rebuilt several times in the movie after being damaged. Her arm has wires under the skin like the Terminator. Her face comes apart exactly the same way the faces of the more mechanical appearing geishas do in this movie. Her body's appearance is arbitrary, created by a robot engineer, and designed to match her implanted memories of being a ""refugee"" rather than her real memories. The scene where she finds out her brain came from a Japanese person and she... SPOILER... meets her real Japanese family would have had a lot less impact if she hadn't been wearing a body that totally didn't match her original body.

After seeing her in a number of movies, I have finally figured it out - she is Keanu Reeves with tits - no discernable acting ability, but marketable to adolescent fanboys. At least Keanu takes parts that fit his personality (or lack of same).Added to the disaster of the 'star' are the lack of a coherent plot, insipid dialogue, marginal CGI, truly stupid vehicles, and mostly wooden performances by the rest of the cast. Beyond the title and the water fight scene, there wasn't much to link it to the 1995 version. I am glad I waited for this to come up on cable - if I had paid to see it in a theater, I would be seriously pissed.

All the media about Johannsen not being right for the part and it should of been a Japanese actress was way off the mark, I've never seen the original version so didn't know the story and the fact that the film answers this critical point itself was enough for me on that subject. Ghost In The Shell was totally immersive, visually stunning and beautifully produced. The rendition in scene was incredible and a feast for the eyes. The story was strongly relayed even for a novice to it as I was. A great film that will become my new 'Dredd' and will definitely be watched over and over again when it's released on BluRay.",Ghost in the Shell
335,nadeeshantennage,Another typicality for movies based on Animes.,6,26 April 2018,"For someone who is not familiar with the Anime I must admit that I was quite entertained by the film which I know will be an unpopular opinion.
'Ghost in the shell' is about a human enhanced to be a cyborg supersoldier 'Major' played by gorgeous Scarlett Johansson and her self doubts of the reality induced in her mind and along the way of discovering her reality comes upon a lot of unsavoury secrets which results in the minimal number of plot twists observed in the film.
The biggest issue with the film can be observed to be the inconsistency of the plot and sub plot points and sequences which lack momentum which can almost put you to sleep with boredom.
But on a positive light the film is benefited by a couple of good performances.
Specially Scarlett Johansson and Juliette Binoche who plays Dr.Ouelet manages to induce a bit of emotion to the storytelling and uplifts the quality of the flow.
The other downside of the film are some action sequences which were not executed well.
Specially some stunts performed by Scarlett were painful to watch because of how badly they have been executed.
Visual effects had their own flaws too.
Ultimately, this film managed to entertain me that I really could look over its poor script, predictability and lousy visuals because the film managed to gain back the lost momentum leading up to the climax and gives a satisfactory ending to its own flawed story.",Ghost in the Shell

What it is.... is a cinematic love letter to the franchise as a whole. It uses the basic plot structure of the 95 film, but introduces elements and plot threads from the series ""stand alone complex"" as well as story elements from ""Ghost in the shell 2: Innocence"". It plays out as a 'best of' kind of film, and I sure loved it. Johanssen is pretty decent in the role, but who really shines are Pilou Asbaek as Batou, and Takeshi Kitano as Aramaki. The filmmakers really nailed the world,the atmosphere, and the characters. My only real complaint is that I wished Togusa had some more screen time, especially since when he was on screen he was perfect, but I was extremely satisfied with the film as a whole.",Ghost in the Shell

I didn't get itwas it trying to be different? It was predictablywas it trying to get new people into this material? Well, it lost me. I simply didn't get itIt has gorgeous visuals I give it that but the story feels very flatOne thing that bother me was the boss talking in Japanese and everyone else in English, why? It felt weird. I get it is ""the future"" but if they are in the same city shouldn't they speak the same language. I don't know maybe it's just me.And WTF with the whitewashing, I mean if you already cast a white actress why would you point out that the ""ghost"" is actually Asian, does that mean that the best and most beautiful ""shells"" are white? because that's what it seems they're implying. I mean Scarlett Johansson did a great job with the part, but that detail f**k me upIn general it is a visually beautiful but so-so movie that lacks a little something more.

Sure, Ghost in the Shell is not a masterpiece, the first two acts are pretty slow, and the movie uses way too much expositional dialogue to explain things to the viewer. But there is also a lot to appreciate about this film, and I would be disappointed, if they decided not to do a sequel. First of all, this movie looks fantastic, the special effects are impressive, and through the film you really get a feel of the world they introduce. Also, the performances are all very solid, not only ScarJo, but the supporting cast as well. My favourite was the old Japanese man (if you saw the movie, you know who), who was a total badass. The action sequences were all very well shot and exciting. But the movie's biggest achievement is that by the third act I really cared for the characters, so during the final action sequence I was sitting on the edge of my seat, and rooted for the heroes to prevail. If you like good sci-fi and action, I recommend it.6/10",Ghost in the Shell

It was great to see that world come to life, with everything from thermoptic camouflage to the iconic slow fly-over of large aircraft.I expected this to be as ""The Last Airbender"" as compared to the animated series, but instead, I saw a movie that I would compare more with the ""The Matrix"".",Ghost in the Shell
341,johngraham1964,Awful,1,5 August 2017,"Awful.Sums it up really.OK the CGI city was alright but it was overly-populated with random floating fish and other things. And as we floated through it too I was expecting any second to be engulfed in a lush electronic Vangelis score. No such luck! Yes I was having a Blade Runner moment. Because that was what the whole thing reminded me of - in spades. But bad Blade Runner.The story was a mess. Almost impossible to follow at times and inexplicably populated throughout by Asian actors and Scarlett Johanssen. Or do I mean by actors and an Asian Scarlett Johanssen? No wonder Asian actors accused the filmmakers of whitewashing, by casting the admittedly excellent white actor as an Asian character. With a bit of eye make up.OK Hollywood - if you're going to do that then don't. Rewrite it and make everyone American and make it a future American city (not future Japan). Or do the right thing and cast an Asian as the lead. It is not true that there aren't great Asian female actors. Try harder to find one next time! I do wonder what reaction (and backlash) there would have been had Ms Johanssen been cast as a black character and had brown makeup applied all over! I'm sure they wouldn't dare - but because the character is Asian they didn't care.Putting that aside Ms Johanssen does her best with a lacklustre script. But put the best actors into a bad script and they will falter and so will the film (see Star Wars I, II & III). And, of course, you just can't generate sympathy for her character.The film is considered to be a financial flop. I'm not surprised.

347,eliza_gaskell,Watched it without any expectations,9,12 March 2018,"Having seen the original anime movie years ago and watching this movie, starring Scarlet Johanson, I found them both to be on same level, with the live action marginally better. I do applaud the movie director Rupert Sanders and the writers Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger, for having the balls to remake a anime into live action. A Ghost in the Shell is based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow and it is not just any anime but one of the holy grails of anime. And thank God, it is as good as it is. Any anime/Manga film brought to life by an American production is scary. Translating Japanese philosophy to Western ideals on the big screen has been littered with awful, vomit pucking horrors-just the mere mention of the live action abomination Dragonball Z still is a shuddering thought.The 2017 live action films Ghost In The Shell stars Scarlett Johansson, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt, Pilou Asbæk, Chin Han and Juliette Binoche,set in a near future when the line between humans and robots is blurring, the plot follows the Major (Johansson), a cyborg supersoldier who investigates her past.Now the The Good
** Visual: Visually this movie is stunning. Each frame of film is filled with visual delights that reminded me of the original film. 
** Costume: Costume design is almost as good as the Fifth Element. Very textual but mixed with edgy cyber-punk.
** Lighting: It is top notch lighting. from the opening shot to the street life and dark underworld
** Cinematography: Who ever is in charge of Cinematography should be awarded an oscar or at least a million dollars. This film has most spectacular cinematography to date, near duplicating Masamune Shirow original world of Ghost in the Shell.
** Production design: breathtaking comes to mind
** Sound Design: thumbs up!!!! listen to the creative mecca of sound poured thought the movie.
** Music: I really don't know if the original score is better or the live action score is above. But it does fit in this universe of Masamune Shirow. Upon watching the film a second time, I loved this score!!!
** Special Effects: Two words - BLOODY MAGNIFICENT!!!!
** Takeshi Kitano: legendary Japanese actor/director : can it get any better. Watch Hana-bai to appreciate his talent. Loved how he was the only character that spoke Japanese while other spoke English. Now the The Okay
** Scarlet Johansson: I couldn't give two rats if Major was an asian actress or not. Scarlet Johansson did what she could with the script. Many have trashed her performance and found her portrayal of Major dull and soulless. I, on the other hand, enjoyed her performance to some degree. There is a real sense of conflict and internal struggle when she notices thing in her past that are affecting the present. Overall I would rather Scarlet Johansson's Major any day over the Disney's Know-it-all Daisy Ridley portrayal of ""Rei"". 
** The Tone: Unlike many other films the tone of the film does not shift and remains the same. It not a good thing nor is it a bad thing. It would of been jarring if there was an overly sense of humour thorough the film like Guardians of the Galaxy.
** The Story: Very much like the original it was very linear and did not have any expected plot twists
** Pacing: I admit I did get a bit bored in the second act for about 10 minutes. I cannot pin point why. I can only put it to pacing.Now the Bad
** The Villain: very one dimensional character. Basically like any other corporate guy with a big ego and a hidden agenda. The secondary villain isn't all that omnipotent and god-like; more of a passing thought really.
** It's too clean!!!! It lacked the grittiness, slums and grime of the original film. It was just too clean with no garbage, rats running around, alley cats and dirt. It had a look of cleanliness (very much like Star Trek). I get it is not like the original animated movie,, but I found it a tad too sterile and not at all solid, down-to-earth and textual. Unlike many of the critics or reviewers, I did not delve too deeply into this film. I watched it with out any expectations. My best advise is to watch it. If you like then you like it. If you don't , then you don't. Have an open mind and have no expectations.",Ghost in the Shell

The movie felt like it was just pieced together and thrown on screen. It lacked the tonality you had from ghost in the shell. I was constantly being taken out of the film. Scarlett Johansson didn't express the same deep thought or the questioning nature the Major has in the anime.The plot of the film was the biggest insult of all. REAL FANS know that the ghost in the shell always has a engaging and enthralling story line.

Like many movies of this type, I think it will develop a cult following.

351,skylerisaac,Brilliant In Every Way,10,7 April 2017,"I figured that Ghost In The Shell was going to be good, but I never expected it to be THIS good. I'd like to begin by addressing those people who are upset about the casting of Scarlett Johansson. First off, calm the hell down. Johansson is perfect in the role, and helps bring a real emotional heft to the story. Second, if you actually take the time to WATCH the film instead of being an overly-sensitive and judgmental toolbox, you'll find that the franchise's Asian roots are far from ignored. In fact, they're celebrated. Scarlett Johansson is magnificent as the Major. Every one of her line readings is spot on and dripping with emotion. As a side note, I don't believe she's ever looked as beautiful as she does in this film. The supporting cast is just as good, but famed Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano steals the show as Daisuke Aramaki. All of his scenes in the third act were greeted with cheers and applause at the screening I attended. I was very glad to see Kitano in a big budget American film, portraying the type of character that he usually does: Calm, violent and awesome. The film's visuals and cinematography are two more pieces of brilliance. Director Rupert Sanders only previous directorial credit, Snow White And The Huntsman, looked good. But Ghost In The Shell is the movie that solidifies him as a truly visionary filmmaker. I've never been overly fond of 3D in film, but it's used to stunning effect here. I also have to take a moment and praise the writing. The films themes tackle poignant issues of self identity and what it means to be human. Yes, such issues have been done before, but I've never seen then addressed as well as they are here. All in all, Ghost In The Shell is nothing short of cinematic magnificence. If you don't see this one, you'll regret it. 10/10",Ghost in the Shell
352,nbutcher-69458,Completely wasted opportunity,6,17 March 2018,"Having seen the original animation, this live-action re-write does the original no justice whatsoever. Whoever thought it would have been a good idea to mess with the original plot, dumb it down, and essentially re-write it ought to have been slapped. As a result, the film maintains a cartoony comic-book vibe with plenty of action - but very little as to what's happening on screen and we should even care about it. Without the dark and philosophical undertones of the original, the end result is visually arresting, yet ultimately confusing and dull to watch. How someone could deliberately make a million-dollar mess-up given the great source material just boggles my mind.",Ghost in the Shell

One clearly sees where most of the attention (and money) went into - the visuals are amazing.It's got Takeshi Kitano in it - hence 7 out of 10 from me (there is no bad Kitano film!).Scarlett Johansson is a looker. Can't say she's the best actress for this role, but she did deliver.The PG-13 hurt the film however, as the (anime) original is bloody and violent, this feels very watered down. When people get shot and there just is not a drop of blood I can't help but think, there is something missing!If one can look past this issue, then this is at least entertaining.",Ghost in the Shell
354,yokoyakamori,A beautifully made movie with the worst writing ever.,5,8 September 2017,"I was skeptical of seeing this movie after having already seen the 1995 animated version by Mamoru Oshii, but some of my friends wanted me to come and see it with them, so I just went along with it.After finishing the movie, my friends enjoyed it, but I was just disappointed beyond all belief. The reason is because this movie had everything that could have made it a great adaptation. The visuals are phenomenal, the actors/actresses were spot on, and the action scenes was enjoyable to watch, so why don't I like it? Well, it is because the writing is utter garbage.One thing I noticed was that the main antagonist of the film wasn't The Puppet Master, but Kuze, from SAC: 2nd Gig. Kuze, however, has remnants of the Puppet Master, which confused me. I ended up finding out that the Kuze in this film was the combination of three well-established antagonists in the GiTS franchise molded into one (The Puppet Master, The Laughing Man, and Hideo Kuze). I am not sure whose bright idea it was to mesh these three characters together into one, but his did nothing but create an inconsistent antagonist that felt empty when given nothing more than some bland revenge story to go by. Even the major's story was pretty bad, given nothing to latch onto and hope she succeeds in her journey. Her issue was that we are given no time to understand or sympathize with her and are only told her story instead of shown.Another thing that bothered me was how forced and clunky the line delivery is for most of the movie. Hollywood starts to anger me off when it thinks its audience are a bunch of idiots who believe they must be spoon-fed every line of dialogue/exposition because they believe we aren't smart enough to understand complex ideas/themes. It is painful as all hell to have to be told everything about this movie without leaving things up to our interpretation, which was something I enjoyed in the 1995 version of GiTS. The complexity of the themes had been watered down so heavily by the bad writing that it is literally just shapes and colors.For the positives: The visuals were gorgeous, the actor/actresses performed and understood the characters very well, and the action scenes served to make the movie thrilling to watch.Overall, Hollywood needs to work on writing better scripts. They can make movies look good, but they don't give them any substance. I wanted to like this movie, knowing how much work was put into it just by watching it, it honestly shouldn't have been as bad as it was. But having incompatible ideas from previous work of the franchise, Kuze being a mesh of three already known antagonists from other GiTS stories, artificial and clunky delivery of dialogue/exposition, and the overall generic and predictable plot that Hollywood always churns up, this movie just couldn't reach its full potential.",Ghost in the Shell
355,stomach17,Cybernetic agents fight super hackers in cyberpunk classic remake,9,31 March 2017,"There are a lot of purists out there. I am sure a lot of people who worship the first film will not like this film no matter what. Many wont know the story-line was composed from mixing the original movie with Stand Alone Complex 2 with its villain Kuzo, who has connection with Motoko's origin. It also pays homage to the second movie Inocence, with it killer Geisha Robots in the beginning. Those who hate the movie because Major is not played by an Asian woman need to get a life. While I agree Hollywood should not be afraid to use Asian lead actors, I thought Scarlett Johannsen played the role just fine. Actually the original Major Motoko in the anime classic is pretty wooden at times, I rather enjoyed the humanity in this portrayal. Likewise, while the script diverges from the original puppet-master villain, I don't have a problem with that. The original film, while a total 10 star classic is really quite confusing regarding the villain and what happens at the end. I think mixing Kuzo with the puppet-master was a good move creating a tighter story. Batou is played perfectly as far as I am concerned. Nice to see. Togusa, Saito are in the film without major roles. Aramaki, played by Beat Takeshi got on my nerves a bit to start with, but seemed to work better later when he started kicking ass. The Spider tank was disappointing as a giant lumbering machine rather than the ""J-Pop"" cute toys that they are normally in the series. The visual landscape of Neo-Tokyo was splendid to look at and borrowed a bit from the Akira film. I could go on. But why? I really enjoyed this film and I thought it was a fine homage to the original. 9 stars",Ghost in the Shell

I was intrigued mainly by the special effects and they didn't disappoint (though a bit different then I imagined). The story is one that is timeless, relatable to anyone. Finding meaning in ones life, and discovering what it is to be alive is understated in our day to day lives, and this film I think does a great job nailing that main point into you, and for that it's good. It did its job to make me sad, and to guide me through my quest as an individual, supported with amazing visuals and a meh plot.

358,stephen-abraham,Pretty good - maybe the best live-action anime remake,8,26 April 2017,"After all the negative press and as a passionate fan of the films and OVA's I nearly didn't see this film. After ""Speed Racer"" and ""The Last Airbender"" I didn't want something I loved to be ruined by Hollywood. IMHO Ghost in the Shell is perhaps the best live-action remake of an anime. Here's why... Spoilers ahead so be warned!What to love: For fans there are so many nods to the films and OVA's: Batou's eyes and love of dogs, Togusa's gun (not a Mateba, but the modern version - a Chiappa Rhino), the tank scene, the water fight, the naked dive - its all there. The plot melds the original film with the SAC's second season protagonist Kuze - but makes something new thats not too bad. This is a very vulnerable Major - not the superhuman hacker of the OVAs, more the Major of the first film questioning her identity. The physical effects, props, sets - they are all superb. I thought this would be just a CGI fake world but I was wrong. WETA and the directors made this feel realistic. The final nod to Motoku's Japanese heritage. That was clever! Aramaki only speaks in Japanese - that was cool too and he kicks ass! The Major's and Batou's relationship. Nicely handled. I like the way they handled The Major's nudity. It was actually pretty good. I didn't feel embarrassed looking at her. I felt like a lecher watching the original film! The action wasn't too ridiculous or overdone. It was part of the storyWhats a bit meh: Togusa doesn't have a mullet! Thats a crime! The rest of Section 9 characters are not fleshed out at all. Just cardboard cutouts. The plot was a bit dumbed downFinal thoughts: A good at times great film. A faithful live-action reimagining of the anime. I came away needing to talk about the future of humanity and machine. That is the sign of good sci-fi: that it makes you think. Can't wait to see this again! I would love to see a sequel where the rest of section 9 are given more air-time.",Ghost in the Shell

I really enjoyed being in this world and with the main two characters. However the film suffers from story issues and plot holes which unfortunately were always going to be dumbed down for a lower rating compared with its original source material. The problems are more in the second half of the film and it feels anti climatic in the end. The film always had the problem of being tied to its source material when in some instances it would of been better for it to veer away from it to suit live action. There are good performances by the two leads and I was engaged in their relationship together as a partnership. it would be good to see a future film with them exploring a different story line in this universe, but depending on the commercial success of this film that may never happen.I recommend this film to science fiction and action film fans, there are however films with similar themes that are much better such as Blade Runner (1982), Robocop (1987), and Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991)",Ghost in the Shell

It's amazing we can bring this level of computer generated special effects to the big screen and blend it so well with human actors -- not to mention the quality prosthetic work.The story is similar to the source work, and the acting is well done. I felt like the pacing was off for the movie, and it didn't really bring anything new to the story. It's great for those that prefer live action to anime -- and a great introduction of the anime story to the masses, but ultimately not a memorable movie in and of itself as it will always be overshadowed by its source material. Visually entertaining, thought provoking, but something was just missing... I'm not sure what would have made it better, though. perhaps a lighter tone? Maybe more character development?I'd rank this as better than ""Lucy"" and way better than ""Aeon Flux"" or ""Ultraviolet""... but... not as good as the first Matrix movie -- which is really the level this should have been able to attain or surpass.

After seeing some of the work that Weta had done on the robotics for the film (on YouTube), I thought that maybe they WERE going to do something interesting ....I was wrong.The good: They did a pretty good job of capturing the gritty, oppressive, megalopolis of the original Anime. There were a FEW scenes that were faithful to the original. The FX work was good if not great, and nothing stood out as being sub-par. In the realm of the latest spate of super-hero movies, it holds it's own in regards to the technical.The not-so-good: If you are an Anime fan and a fan of the complexity and pacing of the original story and the amazing design and story-telling that went with it, you will be *sorely* disappointed. Sorely. Disappointed. Lots of reviews are apologizing for this, but to me, it's unforgivable ... but also very Hollywood in that if you give Hollywood a great story, they will pack it with propaganda and hack out the best parts with a rusty spoon. Other reviewers try to excuse it by claiming ""It's it's own movie"" - and I say, ""Then the should have titled it differently."" The story is a poorly written cliché-fest apparently pandering to the ""simplistic"" Western Mind ... whatever that means. The most interesting aspects of the characters were written out, and replaced with characters you've seen a hundred times. They even managed to infuse a Sappho undertone for the Major - and re-wrote the final act to make the Feminists happy - what a shock! /sarc.If you must see it, wait for the dollar theater - or rent it and watch it with some friends when it's available. After suffering this, I went back and watched the original ... and it just drove the point home how bad this Hollywood version is. 3 Stars for the technical aspects.",Ghost in the Shell
364,wildwesth,"Pretty good, and worth watching, just not a classic like the anime",7,5 August 2017,"SPOILER ALERT... Scarlet Johansson, Juliette Binoche and company do a nice job bringing the story to life. Special effects were great. My complaint is the cinematography and direction. First, any good cinematographer knows that if you put too much crap in one moving shot the entire scene becomes two dimensional, blurry and distant regardless of how sharp the images are. Second, you put pauses into a film for reflection, and to allow the viewer to enter the film themselves, and to befriend the characters. You put in small moments of humanity. You build a pace and momentum and real moments. This film had zero. Third, treat the camera also as a character in the film, not a flying spy cam. That's how great films pull audiences in as participants, like the original, like Blade Runner, like Star Wars. Fourth, those huge giant size holograms of people made the city look tiny instead of immense, like people were standing in the midst of a cluttered toy model city. You shrank the city that was supposed to be immense, oppressive, but humane into a tiny trash filled dump site. What were you guys thinking? These were fatal cinematic choices. Next, use of color to highlight the city was entirely absent. Where are the brightly colored advertising posters? Where was all the Japanese writing on holographic billboards? So many missing elements. Where was the cool high tech dashboard on the car? Even the shelling sequence at the beginning was visually dull and gray. The tech was fantastic. Cinematography and lighting zip. Missing, missing. And lighting? Where was the dark and light high contrast film noir of the original? Where were the stark and painful lighting contrasts between inside and outside? Between character and background?Absent. Dull. The characters and background all blended together destroying any hope of dramatic contrast. Where was the darkness of night during the day? The deep shadows, and the light of understanding piercing through the night? Lighting of the battle tank sequence was a mess and a blur. Why does a Dutch masters painting have greater depth, contrast and seem three dimensional and lifelike compared to a photograph? The cinematographers missed that class.

Of course, if you compare the movie to the original Anime, it's hard to deny that it's just a vague shadow of the original source and idea. But if you see it as it's own movie you will be entertained with stunning visuals and nice action, so it deserves at least 6 points for ""effort"". Now to the downside of the movie if you want to actually compare it. It feels like the children's book version of the Anime. EVERYTHING has to be explained, nothing keeps unsaid for your own imagination. Ghost in the Shell was about the question what makes us human, what is life. But not in this way this movies tries to tell us. If life can give birth itself out of data, how can we define it? This movie sadly skips this part and the main question is ""who was I before I became a robot?"". Dear film makes, no one cares! It misses all the depth what made the original so special. The slow scenes to think, to create atmosphere... Like so many others already said; it's more of a reboot of RoboCop than it's of Ghost in the Shell.",Ghost in the Shell

Going through all the critiques, I really couldn't figure out what does the Anime movie - a fine film, no doubt - has that makes this one seem so bad to so many people apart from the fact that they might be GITS fans. The ""philosophical"" aspects that many associate with the 1995 movie are present too in this movie, but in a subtler way. The main character may not put them in words all the time, but one can sense them through the acting, which is more difficult to do with animated films for the simple fact that the ""actors"" are drawings. The new movie relies also on additional situations that do not exist in the original film but have to do with human relationships, which in my opinion helps in clarifying the main character's behavior and musings. It would be better not to think of this movie as a remake, but as an alternate story, or even maybe as a source of additional information for the original movie's plot. Yes, there is more action and the pace is much faster. The city's atmosphere is wonderfully digitally created, which of course brings to mind Blade Runner, and which, by the way, had a lot of bad critiques too when it came out. Is this movie original?

I couldn't think of any real criticisms. I have honestly never seen a more under-rated film in my life. This is a solid movie. I honestly don't see any glaring flaws in this film. It didn't even remind me of Lucy and vaguely familiar characters that Scarlet has played. It had it's own identity throughout the entire film.It lived up to all of my expectations and stayed there throughout. The poorly translated Japanese philosophical conversations from the original aren't present, their meaning, significance unlike the original, are not over stated in the film, the movie is thought provoking but doesn't spell everything out for you. But, if you're not retarded and can think on your own...it's more or less all implied. For any one capable of actual intelligent, independent thought, it should all be mostly inferred to them. There was no need to complicate inherently very simple concepts that were originally made to seem more complex than they actually were. If you watched the original, and are capable of deeper thought, you probably saw through the fluff...The original is weighed down by pseudo intellectual babble, which tries to make the subject matter appear deeper than it actually is. ""Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.""E. F. SchumacherThere's a lot of fluff in the original anime, pseudo intellectual dialogues that are poorly translated into English to appease the pretentious anime watcher.

Neither was the Hollywood adaptation, but it was thought provoking...and if you were actually paying attention, it explored the same ideas as the original anime, some times without even saying a word. As a film, the casting was near perfect. I loved the entire cast, and each cast member were on their A game. The characters were all believable in their roles. The visuals were stunning! The story was compelling, thought provoking and evenly paced. Everything the original anime set out to explore, make you phantom, so does the Hollywood film, given you are capable of thinking...and don't need any one to hold your hand. The action was also perfect, very evenly paced. I can't think of anything this film got wrong, did too much of, or did too little of. This is the most under-rated film I've seen in a long while, that was no doubt attacked for a ""white wash conspiracy"" created on false pretenses...

All the things that made the 1995 film memorable, like the thought provoking philosophies and slow pace that made it deep and challenging, are lost in order to have a more entertaining and easy to understand blockbuster experience. They even added the common ""American corporate"" type villain to give the audience a more defined antagonist. And though the film does mirror key scenes from the original (such as the diving scene or the water fight), they end up rushing over them anyways, once again losing important information to the hands of nostalgia.

And now here's the live-action remake.In an era of lukewarm remakes and reboots, here's a movie from someone who not just understood the original anime, not just made by a fan or admirer: It breathes 'Ghost in the Shell'. Actually, to call it a remake is insulting. What can I say, it was perfect (and if you don't already know, movie ratings represent the average opinion of a bunch of kids).The plot is somehow a mix of the two anime films, centering around anti-crime investigation team Section 9, lead by the fearless Major. They are entangled by a mysterious omnipotent hacker, who holds a grudge against the industry of Cybernetics. But then the Major begins to remember her past.The story doesn't quite have the cold perfection of the original anime, instead it manages to add an emotional dimension, that wasn't there before. It's like the animation was brought to life (I know it sounds tasteless).I thought no matter what, the ending couldn't be as epic as the anime. But I wasn't quite right, well, see for yourself.

The production values, sets, costumes, CGI was amazing. The visuals really are superb, and it's worth seeing for those alone. The move looks a lot like in updated blade runner, but enough of that dark futuristic corporate look that is in the GITS series. WETA are probably one of the few companies that can pull this off, including all manner of physical effects, and CGI. Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbæk do an excellent job, and Asbaek portrays Batou exactly as I would imagine him. Kitano is more like his action movie roles, but... this is a good thing. Johanson portrays the Major perhaps with more humanity than the anime, but that's her interpretation. For the movie, it works well.The movie stays generally faithful to the anime, and some of the scenes are almost exactly replicated. The storyline is different. Overall the storyline is perhaps the weakest point, but still has some surprises.One comment, Rila Fukushima is advertised as being int he movie, but nowhere to be seen... oddly.

If someone is going to release a CGI reliant movie, then the CGI should be top notch. There are times when Scarlett's body was clearly CGI and at those times, it looks like someone else's body entirely and sometimes it doesn't even look realistic.

382,Hereticked,"All Shell, No Ghost",6,6 April 2017,"On the one hand, Ghost in the Shell isn't a disaster. Given the history of video game and anime movie adaptations, that's a considerable accomplishment. At the very least, it drew a faithful real-life portrait of the cyberpunk world of Ghost in the Shell and hit most of the iconic action beats of the original animated film. On the other hand, it tossed most of the important themes and potent atmosphere (the things that make GitS great) out the window in pursuit of a simplified, easily digestible plot. The dialogue lacked any nuance and the best modern CG and special effects don't look as good or feel as compelling as the hand drawn animation of 22 years ago.The movie is at its best in the action scenes where thermoptic camouflage comes to life and when the creepy geisha bots and other maliciously hacked technology instill the cold blooded potential of transhumanism in our psyche. Also good are the quieter moments when Batou feeds the neighborhood dogs (including a basset hound, of course) and the Major quietly explores the world, searching for her place in it. The movie loses its way when the driving force of the plot becomes the scandal behind how the Major was created (instead of the much more important philosophical question about what her existence means) and the villain emerges as the most typical of bad guy clichés.There's also some glaring hypocrisy in the ending (spoiler) since our heroic characters have been going on about justice and not killing people, and in the climax, they summarily execute the villain instead of bringing him to justice. The Major, in fact, explicitly calls for this, even though she was the most vocal opponent of unjust killing and human rights abuse throughout the film. Character motivation? Consistency? Feh. You can certainly argue that the villain deserved to die, but ordering an execution of someone who's surrendered makes every word the Major spoke earlier feel completely hollow.Despite its flaws, I felt engaged. It was well paced, the casting was solid and the acting was serviceable. It was competently filmed, if not dazzling in its angles. I never once looked at my watch (always a good sign) and there were moments, such as Batou losing his human eyes to cybernetic eyes, that offered something different from the animated films and were genuinely cool to see in live action.It's definitely worth a watch, but I wouldn't rush to the theater to see it. This movie feels like it was tailor made for streaming services to cure your boredom on a rainy afternoon or quiet evening. If you're a GitS fan, you'll almost definitely enjoy it more if you approach this adaptation with low expectations. As a film, it's only slightly better than mediocre, and yet, I was prepared for so much worse. So, while it's a back-handed compliment, I feel like this is the best GitS adaptation that could have been made by the creatively bankrupt Hollywood of 2017.

Every single line is just declamatory, like each actor is reading from the outline for a script rather than dialog meant for any specific character.

This must be one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in recent years. From a technical standpoint there is not a flaw in all of 107 minutes (except one tiny scene where Major jumps up a crumbling structure during a final showdown, which looks like amateur CGI homework). I didn't even mind the somewhat flat, trope-ridden plot, because the action kept me entertained enough. I did, however, have two issues with Ghost in the Shell that still annoy me.1. I understand that Scarlett Johansson is supposed to portray cybernetic hybrid, but she was dead-faced the entire time. Even the completely robotic geishas in the film moved more natural and emoted more than her. The way she walked and stuck out her neck was just odd. And that dead stare! Major has a human brain, and therefore she is capable of the same emotions as you and me. Why did Johansson choose to take her character into that boring territory is beyond me. It's hard to watch. I would have written it off as an odd stylistic decision on the part of director or the actress, but she does this every time she has to play a tough heroine (ie. Black Widow, Lucy). Someone tell Scarlett that she comes off as bored and awkward, not tough.2. My other gripe is the PG-13 rating. Honestly, I felt like the writers and the director wished to make a more mature film, but the studio forced them to change it. There are multiple scenes that feel like they were designed to be R-rated, but were cut up and edited to appeal to a wider audience. There are hints all over the place that make you wish the movie would just stop playing coy and go further. I'm hoping there will be a director's cut released in the future that would breach into a darker territory. The Ghost is a fine action flick, well worth watching on a big screen.

An atmosphere of this computerized robotized future world where people are very similar to robots and robots similar to people.Now if you look at this new film as an old GITS fan - it does not add anything new to the story, but it keeps the main elements intact with quite a deep precision. I think pretty much every key scene of the original anime film was added to the new film, the story had some differences however, but overall feeling stayed the same. Scarlet is a perfect actress for this role, the funny thing is though it is not a role or character which required to show deep emotions... The only scene that disappointed me was the spider tank battle, it simply lacked the dynamics that the original anime had...Overall it's a nice sci-fi action film with neat looking cyberpunk environments, even in 1997 it wasn't revolutionary ideas wise, but the sci-fi elements felt much fresher back then, if you go to watch it as a GITS fan you will be OK with it, if you go to watch it as someone new to GIST universe, well that's a decent introduction...",Ghost in the Shell
393,jackransom-69832,Ghost In The Shell (2017),8,1 April 2017,Saw this yesterday been looking forward to it for ages. Very good remake/reboot (which is uncommon haha) cool characters and costume/weapon design and action scenes also defo some of the best visuals I've seen in a movie for sure. only real issue is that it should've been a 15 to make the action scenes more bloody and entertaining and go with more of the darker themes of the original... Also can't go wrong with Scarlett Johansson as Major haha,Ghost in the Shell
394,cassielPrice,"Interesting on Advertisements, Nonsense in fact",1,18 July 2017,"The only reason i watched the movie was Scarlett Johansson. I like her acts and she's my favorite actress, but this movie made me disappointed. If Scarlett wasn't in this movie then what would it mean exactly? A dead amateur scenario which pathetically struggles to attract audiences of Sci-Fi movies. The story line was simple and monotonous there was nothing exciting and thriller as it is mentioned in the gener list. Next time when you want to write a story put time on it and think of what you write Mr writer. I totally have wasted 107 min of my time. The only positive point in this movie was Scarlett, no interesting story, no interesting city design it was all ambiguous and over exaggeration. I think 1 star is far a lot for this movie.",Ghost in the Shell
395,raa-55017,Solid; Not deserving hate,7,12 June 2017,"Ghost in the Shell (2017) is based off the classic 1995 Ghost in the Shell anime that is considered one of the best anime films ever created. This movie takes place in the far future and revolves around Major, a cybernetic being with a human brain who is the first of her kind. She is used as a weapon to stop dangerous criminals, and when a hostile hacker begins taking control of people's minds, Major goes on a journey to discover more about herself and her surroundings.Many people are hating on this film because they are disappointed in the fact that it doesn't fit every aspect of the original 1995 film into the run time. Having never seen the anime, I don't have a connection to the original like others do. This film works on it's own. Without comparing this Ghost in the Shell with the first one, it is a competent film. In my opinion, many critics have depended on the anime too much and let it cloud their vision of the film as a whole.The visuals are fantastic. Not a shot goes by that doesn't look great. All the special effects are really well done, incorporate brilliantly with in-camera work. The music is also great. The original 1995 score was replaced, which also had people running around in a tizzy. However, for me, I thought the soundtrack is one of the best of 2017 so far.The characters, especially Major played by Scarlet Johansson, are pretty well-written. You get to know and feel for Major very well throughout the film as she goes through many series of self discovery. The plot flows pretty nicely as well, although the main flaw also comes here.The main flaw of this movie was the pacing. It begins very fluidly and doesn't leave you bored; however there's a good twenty minute stretch towards the middle that could have been written differently to make it less of a drag. A few sub plots are introduced that really aren't necessary, and the final battle went for a more CGI, action type where I would have preferred a silent, psychological climax.Despite it's flaws, Ghost in the Shell is a solid film that was an overall entertaining watch.",Ghost in the Shell
396,jorbc,A nice effort.,7,18 September 2021,"Those who had already watched the original Japanese anime will enjoy this adaptation. Scarlett Johansson lives up to expectations, and the movie holds our interest all through. The visuals are appealing, the plot is great, the acting deserves credit and the soundtrack is just amazing (same soundtrack as the original series). Of course not all reviews share my enthusiasm, but overall most people will love this movie.",Ghost in the Shell
397,david2112,from a massive fan of gitsac the anime (seasons 1 and 2) this was a decent Hollywood adaption,8,13 July 2017,It wasn't perfect by any means but the director did manage to retain much of the feel of ghost in the shell even if it was a bit too dumbed down for anime fans.In a few years hopefully there will be enough DVD sales that a sequel might be possible.In time this will be a classic. As long as ghost in the shell keeps going im fine with just about any adaption.Its as good as the recent arise reboot. Just different.,Ghost in the Shell
398,nimkal,Fantastically made movie shadowed by a bunch of butt-hurt Japanese,10,11 April 2021,"The movie is actually one of the best movies made and instead of appreciating it for what it is, there are tons of people acting butt-hurt for the fact that it was not lead by Japanese actors only. Going as far as calling it ""Japanese terrorism"" and having the audacity to bring politics into this. Like give me a break. Next time maybe you can all fundraise a couple hundred million and let Japan make the movie themselves. Seriously ridiculous.On another note, this movie was seriously superb! From the cinematography, to the music, and also the acting. The story was actually touching and made you think. Loved it. The people who expected hundreds of hours of anime to be fit into a 1.5 hour movie are simply childish and unrealistic. Ignore them and watch the movie for yourself. Most definitely one of my favorite movies and I will keep coming back to it. In fact my dream is for a Ghost in the Shell 2 to be made.",Ghost in the Shell
399,dougal79,One of the best endings ever - ruined in remake,6,31 March 2017,"Leaving aside the accusations of ""white washing"" everyone agrees this film is visually stunning, and it is there's a certain depth to the images the original didn't have. At some points it felt like the skyscrapers had skyscrapers on them! This is where the majority of the 6stars go.But there seems to be loads of other sci-fi influences chucked in there too. In the original 1995 film I don't remember any of these holographic overlays on the dystopian cityscape. Maybe they featured in the GitS TV series but for me it had much more Blade Runner DNA in it. The whole film felt a lot more Neo Noir than the original ever did. One scene (entrance to the Hanka building) felt like it was straight out of Robocop. Another had all of these swishing lights and very similar noise to a light sabre. Were they all influences on Masamune Shirow or just chucked in for a bit of Hollywood ""depth""?Where the film really let itself down was that it fundamentally rewrote the film. In the original it is cyborg and human vs AI. In this version it's cyborg & human vs cyborg. This diminishes the whole philosophical content and distorts the context. May be I'm being pedantic but the movie is weakened when you change the story line, from an AI who wants to experience mortality and procreation to one of a Cyborg love interest.My final gripe is the ending. In the original it is one of the most interesting and thought provoking scenes. The remake features most of it but misses out on the best part of the scene; the Spider Tank shooting up the dinosaur fossils and a stone masonry tree of life. Stopping just shot of the highest branch (Hominis). It's this lack of richness where the film lets itself down. Of course a lot of the changes will be so that they can Make a trilogy out of the universe and do a spin off trilogy for Badou too. #ihatemycynicism still worthy of a watch I guess but don't build up your expectations.",Ghost in the Shell
400,roska-posti,Attacked by anime fans - better than the anime I saw,8,12 March 2020,"I read about 100 reviews (easy, they were mostly very short), almost all were written by a fan of the anime movie series, and gave this from 1 to 3 stars. I wonder what would be the rating without angry fans. I for one liked the movie a lot.
I had seen ""Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence"" before watching this movie. I found that one failed, it didn't resonate with me at all, but watched to the end because my friend told me to see it. Compared to that, I found this movie vastly more watchable.
The movie certainly isn't boring. It has a lot of action scenes and an interesting plot: At least for people who don't know the story in advance, this offers lies, betrayal, an unexpected main plot twist and sacrifice. And must say, Tokyo police seems to be quite a vigilante gang in this sci-fi vision.
Special effects weren't top notch, but I liked how the futuristic Tokyo was imagined. There's some Blade Runner influence, but without the destroyed dystopian world bleakness.
Did I have problems Scarlett playing a Japanese cyborg? English spoken language is much bigger immersion breaker to me. Japan is now ethnically very homogenous, but it is getting more international and this is sci-fi. Not a reason big enough to hate the movie for me.",Ghost in the Shell
401,msmith-56,Solid Amalgam of Classic Sci-fi and Action Films,9,30 March 2017,"Take some Blade Runner, throw in some Matrix, 5th Element, and top it off with the Bourne Identity. Of course, there is at least $120 million in CGI F/X, too. Wrap that all around Scarlett Johansson, and you have a pretty sure bet.The acting was excellent, and the plot line works, partly because it is tried and true. The only flaw, in my opinion, was the driving of cars. They have robots that can do just about anything humans can do, but they do not have a car driving itself. I do not know if that is a spoiler, but it seemed like it spoiled the movie just a bit for me.The city skyline really looked like a future Hong Kong, and there was an occasional grittiness that offset the CGI nature of the spectacular cityscapes. Most of all, I thought the casting was spot on, even though Ms. Johansson could have been played by an Asian actor. Matt Damon ran into this with The Great Wall, but I think that only die hard Shirow fans will be disappointed, as the mix of nationalities was purposeful to the Ghost plot.Ms. Johansson may make a Bourne-like series out of this. I recommend paying $12 in the theater, as it does well on the big screen. However, I found that the 3D added absolutely no value, and I was sitting dead center and in the back.

405,sbierly,"Great film, much better than IMDB reviews lead you to believe",8,10 April 2021,"Sometimes it's nice to have low expectations going into a film, given the IMDB rating. The critical people on here probably give 8's or higher to the dull repetitious drip of pulp films released by Marvel, and I'd say this movie bests most of those.Admittedly, I was initially onboard solely based on Scarlett Johansson :) In the early moments of the film, I thought these expectations were warranted, but then...something happened that's hard to pinpoint. I began to see the brilliance and charm of a comic (manga) transformed into cinema (and this isn't always so charming), and the sci-fi brilliance of a story that was hatched in manga form in the 1980's. Ok, both the story and this film had obvious inspiration from the story, cinematography, and music of Blade Runner--but I found that to be very cool. Even as I watched I was a bit surprised by the surplus of caucasian actors in a Japanese story, and now that I read criticism of that I think it is somewhat deserved--but not entirely, Scarlett was amazing and it contributed to the story line. And that's certainly no reason to snub the film.Bottom line, I was extremely impressed by this film for what it was, and in an era that worships the endless drivel of superheroes, this story is a fresh take on the actual imminent arrival of AI, genetic engineering, viable advanced robotics technologies, and human transformation in our world (don't hold your breath on men with hammers from space...).",Ghost in the Shell
406,Randomizer2600,"Impressive future world, with no dialogue.",4,10 September 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is a movie with an inspired version of the future. The atmosphere of the city is reminiscent of Blade Runner. If you are into Sci-Fi, then you won't see any technology that is new, but it is all put together well. That is all this movie has. It is like a play with a great set, but nothing else. Characters are flat, and the dialogue is the style where a character speaks a cryptic sentence, then another character says a sentence that doesn't have anything to do with the first sentence. None of the characters have any warmth, emotion or personality. The action scenes were okay, but is that enough to thrill anyone when you don't care who lives or dies? No, that's why this movie didn't do well in the theaters.",Ghost in the Shell

Technology vs The Human Spirit, there's nothing new in these themes, and there doesn't need to be. The theme of Ghost In The Shell is a universal one, and it was executed with great eloquence.The Key Elements:
* Interesting, well portrayed characters
* Great visuals
* Very well choreographed action scenes
* Humour (I think many negative reviewers missed this)
* Good, but unobtrusive soundtrack
* A moving human element that doesn't become self-indulgentI shall definitely watch this film again ... and won't be at all surprised if it eventually becomes a cult classic.Happy viewing :-)",Ghost in the Shell

409,robert-b-norby,"Nice visuals, but very lacking in the storytelling department.",4,23 September 2017,"(If you are not familiar with the original material - like me:)As any movie with a futuristic reality, the way such a reality is presented to you means a lot. This movie presents almost nothing, which makes it all quite dull in a sense. I won't spoil anything you can't read in the plot description, but if you are going to watch this, know this: In the first 2 minutes of this film, you will learn the following -A woman damaged her body, they saved her by putting her brain into a robot. She's first of her kind; strong, fast and can use a gun. Skyline photos of Tokyo shows hologram commercials and flying cars (I think), and that's all you get.That's literally all you get of an introduction to the reality of which this films take place, including the main character (Johansen) and her (complete lack of) story or personality. She plays an expressionless half-robot person that has some thoughts of her own but mainly does what her company tells her to do. Her face doesn't seem like she cares much, and since she doesn't, I don't.Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. The movie is visually very pretty, and there are a few good characters along the way, but I unfortunately found myself not caring one bit for anyone, or their ""missions"". Everything I saw, everything the characters said, and everything the characters were fighting for, meant nothing to me watching it. This - as mentioned - is for me largely because the main characters gets no pre-story, and not much character development throughout the movie either (she is basically a robot, so I guess it makes sense she doesn't change much.) The bad guy is the type that nobody really sees or knows who is until the end (another person we won't feel anything for or against, until perhaps the end), and a reality I am not properly introduced to (so I have no idea whether or not what I am seeing is ""unusual"" or ""groundbreaking"", ""normal"" or whatever). It's all just running, jumping, hitting, small talk, guns shooting, guy speaks Japanese, bad guy, finish.This movie could have been so much better if they added 7 minutes in the beginning, showing us Mira (Scarlet Johansen) before she damaged her body and became mechanical. They could perhaps have made the good guys or the bad guys connected to the government or politics, and easily slipped in some society-defining information to the viewer. Don't we all love to dive into a new world or a futuristic society? Won't get much of a dive here. Instead, the two major parties involved in this movie is Mira and the unique, and borderlining criminal private company that made her (and thus a horrible representation of this reality/society), and a rogue criminal belonging to .. nobody. Put in a futuristic Tokyo you won't learn anything about. This movie is clearly made for the fans of the original stuff (just watch them downvote this review as they disregard all their integrity by NOT acknowledging the movie sucks, even thought THEY liked it. And even though I specified this review being from a non-fan perspective). The movie is an insult to those that are not fans. If not an insult, then just pure failure from the director who neglects so many storytelling aspects that today counts as ""basic"" in order to lay the ground work for a decent movie.I gave it 4 stars for having some OK/cool supporting characters and pretty visuals but (nothing extraordinary), and you'll miss absolutely nothing by never putting this on.",Ghost in the Shell

The futuristic city design is marvelous, and the movie succeeds in bringing to life - and (arguably) in some cases even improving upon - the stunning visuals of the original anime and manga.I don't usually have a problem enjoying a mediocre movie for its visuals alone, but this one left me completely cold. Rarely have I seen a movie this lifeless, bloodless, sexless, and soulless. There isn't a single human moment in it. No character for whom I felt anything. Despite the presence of Juliette Binoche, who is one of my favorite actors, and Scarlett Johansson, who has been great in similar roles, there is no good acting in it.

416,stoob0t,Passable live action remake but missing the magic,6,8 April 2021,"The original Ghost in the Shell surpasses this live action remake in every way possible.While this version is visually impressive, and they have done a fantastic job of recreating the look of the 1995 original, it feels like this comes at the expense of character depth.In the original the characters feel full, convincing and real, but that hasn't been brought across to the remake. Characters here feel paper thin, which makes it hard to care about them or their choices. The relationship between Major and Batou feels insincere in this version. The script overall feels largely flat and weak.The greatest failing is that despite the extra ~24 mins runtime over the original, the story and dialogue has been over simplified in some areas, and dedicates time to expanding on aspects of the original which worked well previously by remaining ambiguous. The result is that the producers seem to feel compelled to dedicate the majority of screen time to Major/Mira, while taking out more interesting elements of the original to make space.The simplest example is the garbage truck driver: in the 1995 version, he gets a fair amount of establishing screen time, and his actions are integral to the plot advancement, so that when the tragedy of his character arc is revealed, you genuinely feel pity for him. In the remake, he is added in as a bit of fan service so that some key shots from the original can be replicated. You feel nothing for him.Despite its flaws and despite comparing poorly to the original material, this isn't a terrible film. The visuals and action are impressive. The story is an interesting re-imagining, although nowhere near as deep.The result is a film that you can watch with a beer while you mess around on your phone, which adequately passes the time.

417,rubenbaeza84,Why are people defending this movie again?,4,26 January 2018,"I'm a huge fan of the original Ghost in the shell, so when I heard about an adaptation I feared the worst. Sadly it came true when I read that Scarlett Johansson was going to be cast as ""the Major"". I took offense to it because I knew why they made that decision; it's a no-brainer on their part to put an A-list star in a movie vehicle that has a smaller fan base than the Marvel properties. Do I think the casting was a case of whitewashing? I do because Scarlett is the kind of actress that should not have any trouble looking for work, considering her popularity. There are also plenty of white superheroes out in the movie market right now so I don't see why using a person of different race would be objective? Wolverine is still white and so is batman and wonder woman, there was no need to change Motokos nationality as far as I'm concerned. I decided to watch the movie so I could put in my two cents and this is what happened:It's not a good movie by any means. I had to pause it every time they had dialogue because it was so stale and just filled with expedition that the character depth seemed forced and just there so someone could talk to Scarlett. The plot is pretty much derivative of Robocop and Total Recall, and I kept wondering when the plot twist came when it turned out she was Schwarzenegger all along. Don't get me started on the CGI effects. I felt like I was watching a 90's film back when they were barely having a grasp on how to use it properly. The one scene that made me cringe the most is when she visited her mother which made no lick of sense to me. Why would a woman let a stranger in her home if she's never seen her before? It's not like the character called her to let her know she was coming over. I wanted to laugh when she said, ""you remind me of my daughter by the way you look at me"", I'm sorry it seemed like a cruel inside joke to me about Asian facial features. I personally feel that this movie was not worth arguing over or defending because of how mediocre it turned out. Scarlett needs to have a talk with her agent when picking better roles because this movie is an insult to anime, cyberpunk and all kinds of movies in general. I keep wondering why people keep defending the movie as if it's some kind of masterpiece when it was just a filtered version of the original. The original was profound and masterful in its storytelling, this film is just a paint-by-numbers action movie and this series deserves better.",Ghost in the Shell

Unsure if this was art, action, syfy, thriller. The jumps between action scenes to badly crafted ""pigeon flights"" made it very difficult to watch and a clearer direction would have helped.Casting - Really poor. Channel 4's ""Humans"" offered a more watchable performance. Very difficult to like anyone in this other than the Japanese cast. Action - This was a poor mans Matrix.Visual - While stunning it was over played and complicated. Compared to Colin Farrell's ""Total Recall"" it was a very weak showing. Keep it Simple!Music - Outstanding, I will be downloading the Soundtrack ASAP. However, in line with the Direction all the music was played at the wrong time and wrong scenes. Ground Breaking - I was hoping to put this in the genre of Blade Runner. Sadly I don't think this will go down in history for anything other than a hashed out movie.

Scarlett Johansson gave a good performance as The Major and Michael Pitt, Juliette, Binoche, Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbaek all gave good supporting performances. Scarlett Johansson was well cast as The Major. The film had a good story. It reminded me of Blade Runner, The Matrix and Aeon Flux. It was like all 3 movies were rolled into one. The action sequences were not awesome and the film was slow. I believe it was more story, than action. The film deserves an Oscar nomination for it's visual effects. Weta Workshop did an outstanding job and the visual effects and the computer animation were outstanding. The Major's bodysuit, the Thermosuit, I have never seen anything like that before and the sets were amazing. I believe Blade Runner was a major influence behind the film.

I knew nothing about the subject before I watched the movie so it was all new to me. I liked the way the main character developed (a bit like Robocop) and thought the supporting cast good. Do not get me wrong: the film is not great, but I was entertained and did not have to fast forward at all (always a bad sign) and I rewound quite a few bits to watch again (always a good sign).

422,limpfan106,Actually pretty close to the anime.,8,14 July 2017,"I don't think this movie is white washed. In the anime a lot of characters are white. Also, people seem to fail to consider that a ""shell"" wouldn't have an ethnicity.I watched some of the movies on Netflix recently and this movie is pretty true to those. People say the main character doesn't have a lot of personality, and perhaps they're right, but that's true in the anime as well. The personality comes from the other characters and how they interact with her. Granted it doesn't explore character personality as much as it could but its not a short movie and I think it crammed in a lot. This movie does offer some new ideas and can make you wonder what life would be like if/when manufacturing ever got so good that we could manufacture body parts or entire bodies for ourselves. That said, this is definitely a sci-fi action movie. If you've actually watched some of the anime recently, I don't think you will find this to be that far off. It has the same strengths and weaknesses.Long story short, this movie has a decent plot with solid action and amazing visuals.",Ghost in the Shell

I knew about the disappointment people had to it, and some of it's specific criticism.I loved the characters in this movie, the setting and the story. I would love to see a sequel with the same actors. Loved Pilou Askbæk as Batou - P E R F E C T.I had a bit of a bad feeling when it came to Scarlett playing what originally was a Japanese character. However, without spoiling anything, it made cold, cruel and a bit sadistic sense later in the movie. I think the backlash must have come from the fans of the original. It can be hard watching something you felt was perfect being remade. It just can't ever beat that feeling. I have seen the originals, but I never got that attached to them.If you are a die hard fan of the originals, lower your expectations! If you love scifi action with an existential deeper plot, this is for you. If you like action, but don't really care for scifi you might find it boring.

427,John-Jacobson,An affectionate remake,9,6 April 2017,"It can't be said that this affectionate remake wasn't faithful to the original vision. Every incredible idea from the 1995 film was included: The milky flakes that float off The Major's newborn body; her balletic backward free-fall into the the neon metropolis; her escape into the solace of the sea; the zillion-fingered typist; and who could forget the briefcases that break open beautifully to reveal machine guns? Even the terrible ideas were included, such as the god-awful hairstyles of Han and The Major, and that lame Spider Tank. Not one to rest on the laurels of the original, the re-makers of Ghost In The Shell took ideas from the source and supercharged them. The opening action scene became far richer in ideas and philosophical scope than the 1995 version - a spectacular set-piece that featured a mutiny of abominable geisha. The Major's roughly approximated CZ100 handgun from '95 was re-imagined as an elegant therm-optic Glock comprised of white and transparent pieces. Batou's generic wedge shaped coupe from the anime was brought to life in the remake as a Mad Max-ed-out Lotus Espirit that makes beautiful noise as it drifts around the concrete jungle (look closely for the machine guns implanted inside the doors as they swing open). The film's most triumphant upgrade is the reinvention of Section-9 chief, Aramaki. The anime Aramaki was your typical highly-strung old boss who talks too much. He was replaced and rebooted by the laconic and iconic 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano - the DeNiro of Japanese cinema . The old fox spoke only in Japanese. The Major disobeys her section chief and from that moment on we begin to piece together an idea of what it is to be human. The Major's only human part of her body is her brain. So is she as human as the rest of us? We know that memories are unreliable or implanted (Blade Runner). The original Ghost In The Shell posited that humans are defined by our ability to reproduce, die, and spawn diversified offspring. Well, any organism can do that. This new film concludes that we are human because of the things that we do. We see the reinvented Batou bring bones to stray dogs he has adopted, then he asks The Major to feed his friends because he doesn't want to frighten them with his new robot eyes. We watch as a couple are divided and restrained on two separate beds, their fingertips touch before they are taken away to be harvested. We watch The Major pay money to gingerly touch the face of a prostitute. She asks, ""Are you real? ...what does it feel like?"" We see a lonely and forlorn woman who may have been The Major's mother plead to her, ""You will come back to visit?"". The Major recognizes her own deep loneliness until she finds another kindred Spirit in a prototype that came before her - Kuze . He encourages her to give up the meds her handlers have prescribed and actually FEEL things - no matter how raw. None of these ideas were even whispered in the '95 version of Ghost In The Shell. Nevertheless, the most original theme in 2017 remake was that of consent. Throughout the film The Major would give her consent to have something done to her, only to find out that her consent was never required, a token gesture, that allowed her the perception that she has rights like everyone else. This is a question too large to be answered in the 107 minutes of this film.",Ghost in the Shell
428,linearattack,"Great art, not as a movie.",7,10 July 2017,"This film is really good aesthetically, but the script and dialogue is thin, like I found ""who are you, what do you want"" is pretty annoying. As an adaptation its not really bad but they left a lot of philosophical things in the original movie which eventually made the anime great. The story (although different than the original) is still great, but not explored widely, just swallow.At least, they are doing great in art which portraying cyberpunk environment really nice. They just need to let the audience feel the environment just like the original do, when they insert a minute or more for audience to look around the city, what is really going on in this dystopian world, which we as the audience interpreted it ourselves and made the city have souls which we can relate.",Ghost in the Shell
429,schrifthsteller,About almost irrelevant noise,8,26 April 2017,"OK, can there be an uncontrollable ghost inhabiting the brain of a otherwise totally synthetic cyborg? Is there space for any anima? I don't no. In GHOST IN THE SHELL there is. What I was more interested in is whether there can be something like a hard to grasp anima within a totally digital 3D sci-fi IMAX production full of neon lights, holograms and bodies materializing and dematerializing in a landscape so obviously made out of ones and zeros? I need that anima to feel any empathy. And I need to feel empathy to lose and find myself within the cinematic world, to have the essential experience of catharsis. It did work for me, despite all the technical fuzz on the surface which is, in this case, the right, adequate form for its underlying, spiritual theme. It did work because of the story and its climatic composition, speeding up to an orgasmic high near the ending and it worked because of the magnificent performance throughout the cast. As long as the story and the actors manage to keep your emotions flowing, the rest becomes a not that important mask. It becomes almost irrelevant noise.",Ghost in the Shell

432,krogchoi-69376,McDonald's version of Sushi,4,29 March 2017,"If I had to do an analogy, I'd say this movie is to the original whatwould happen if Mc Donalds tried to make sushi.Story wise, the movie is both a dumbed down version and has major plot changes (it's about the same magnitude of difference as between the book ""I am legend"" and the ending of the movie that shares the same name. If you know what I mean, and are a fan of GITS, I just crushed your hopes hard). Also visually, when I thought about GITS (1995 version, which I loved), I picture something aesthetically pleasing and beautiful. For the live action movie, aside from the restaurant scene, which looked great, I didn't like the visuals much, felt kinda cheap (esp. the city). You can tell the director tried a bit, but all in all, it's lacking a soul. On a side note : The guy playing Batou was a good cast for the role , he got the job done.PS : And what was this BS with Kitano's dialogues ?!? Either have his dialogues in full Japanese, or in full English, but what they did here screams ""Takeshi did not want to speak English, and the cast didn't want to learn 3 words of Japanese"", it just felt plain awkward.",Ghost in the Shell
433,dashx-84958,"Majors Awkward ""skin suit"" and Predictable story-line.",6,4 May 2017,"While the overall aesthetic was very interesting, certain elements of Major costume seemed awkward. We are led to believe in the opening scenes that she is naked; but her missing human anatomy leaves us feeling awkward, confused, and distracted the remainder of the film. In some scenes Major removes her jacket to show her skin or suit giving off the impression she is nude but on inspection appears to be a wet-suit patched together. The design choice was very distracting, as I am wondering if I should look away, or if it is okay to look at. The off flesh colored neckline, breaks the immersion for me as I realize it's a costume and left wondering if it was a censorship choice when compared to watching the animated version of Ghost in the Shell. It's difficult to tell when she is and isn't wearing wearing clothes in the film. The same skin-suit appears as a wet-suit and has changed color in her swimming scene, I wondered why would she put on a wet-suit for one scene but appear to be naked in the others. I still wonder if her ""skin changed color or if it was a suit. The scene could have been more intimate and dramatic if we could tell when she was naked and when she wasn't. Either way he still threw her a towel as if she was. I loved the multiple spoken languages throughout the film, but wished major could speak more than just English, surely she would know how? Overall the story felt very Predictable, and very similar in story to ""Logan"" that came out this year. I wish the film in general had more suspense, and was more intellectual. A few scenes left me disconnected and instead of being lost in the story, I was made to realize it was a film, and was left thinking ""this scene should be cut or re-shot"" It doesn't fit. Major's costume constantly broke the 4th wall unintentionally. Overall it was pleasant and enjoyable and it appears to be set up for a sequel. I wonder if we will see an edited version or a directors cut, I almost feel even if they took the film back into editing and implemented CGI Nipples it would help create the missing emotions, intimacy and allure and provide a better understanding of certain scenes. The original animated series had a very different feel when comparing the two, and the most obvious difference is the censorship.",Ghost in the Shell
434,JediMichaelCera,Edgy Cheese,3,18 April 2017,"I was lead to believe this film was doing poorly at the box office due to white washing, I was mislead. The dialogue was so cheesy & cringeworthy that I can understand why they would admit to white washing being the fault, rather than owning up to the fact that the dialogue is something that sounds similar to something an angsty teenager would come up with. There was a cliché in every other sentence. ""It's what I was built for."" ""I don't see her as machine, I see her as a weapon."" ""Maybe next time you can build me better."". At the end of the film the CEO of the Hanka company was killed & I was half expecting his shooter to say ""You're fired."" it was that bad.The characters weren't engaging or fun at all like they were in the original film/anime. All of them being far too serious & edgy to actually come across as likable.The film had a few homages to the original anime that were nice but some things were just poorly re-hashed.The main story is quite different to that of the original film which I understand & never usually mind. But this whole new story seems to have been written just to accommodate the fact that Scarlett Johansson is now the Major.The story is now that a refugee's boat was shot & sunk by terrorists (going back to the bad writing I mentioned, that is literally all they ever said about that. Terrorists shot at you because you were a on a boat full of refugees, no other details needed) & her brain was placed into a synthetic body. That's not what really happened as you find out later but the bottom line is, she was already an adult when her brain was placed into the machine. An Asian women's brain was placed into a non Asian looking synthetic body. Okay, yeah, I sort of get that they did that to try & side step the whole white washing thing but all it did was lead to a story that was ultimately so much more simple & dumbed-down than the original.Visually I wasn't impressed to begin with, during the assembly scene of the Major's body, but the films visuals throughout were very good. The music was not great in comparison to the original.All in all this could have all been salvaged if the dialogue wasn't so robotic (irony) & dull.",Ghost in the Shell

437,grabboid-44815,Where do I start?,7,1 April 2019,"Im a huge fan of Ghost in the shell movie and anime series. I won't ramble about crap, so going to jump right into it. First, Scarlett Johansson would have been great if she actually watched and studied the anime. It was like she read in the script that the Major was an android, so she thought she had to act like robocop .. The Major has a very sensual personality, sexual. They had the scenery looking awesome, but between Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of the Major and the garbage story line. They could have done so much with this. I really just think there was no homework done before making this movie.",Ghost in the Shell
438,grabboid-44815,Irreplaceable.....my time..that is..,7,1 April 2019,"Scarlett Johansson shows that she has never watched nor studied the Ghost in the Shell anime...at all. She portrays the Major as a female Robocop. If she and the directors did their homework, they would know that, yes, they are androids, but they are androids with a ghost(soul). They aren't some emotionless things. Also, the Major has a very sexual, sensual personality. All the actors looked the part, she bombed it. Add her portrayal of the Major plus the garbage half produced copy of the original storyline, and you have a failed movie. Honestly, I thought Scarlett Johansson would have made the perfect Major, but she ended up turning her into another Lucy. Garbage. Im starting to see Scarlett Johansson has no acting skills. At all.",Ghost in the Shell
439,grabboid-44815,Ummmm.....,7,1 April 2019,"I think the graphics in this movie is incredible. I think they did an awesome job recreating the futuristic city. The story line was close to the original, the actors tried. Scarlett Johansson looks awesome as the Major, but I think all the people who are fans like I am of the anime, have a problem with how she portrays the Major. Yes, she has an android body, but she doesnt walk like robocop, and she doesnt talk like robocop. She acts like a very sensual woman. I think Scarlett Johansson is a badass, but should have studied up on her character. If she would have actually watched the series and movies, then she would know that Ghost in the shell refers to the ""ghost"" or ""soul"" of the human in a shell, the shell being a mechanical body. Disappointing.",Ghost in the Shell
440,grabboid-44815,Ummm....,7,1 April 2019,"Graphics were awesome. Actors looked awesome... Scarlett Johansson must have never watched one movie or episode of Ghost in the Shell. She portrays the Major as some emotionless robot. Like a female Robocop, and she even walks like robocop. The Major had a very sensual personality, very human like with a sense of humor too. The point is, the Major had a human brain & soul (which is the GHOST), but only an android body(which is the SHELL). There was no homework done before making this movie. It was boring.

441,trailer_trashed89,"It's not deep or profound, but it is plenty pretty and entertaining",7,28 October 2019,"I vaguely remember watching this film on it's release, and feeling a little underwhelmed by it. And I do not think on second watch, it has endeared itself to me anymore than it did the first time.So, Major Mira Killian is a hybrid between an android and a human. She has a human brain inside an artificial body and she works for a kind of spy organisation, which works to stop cyber crime in a vastly technologically advanced age. But she finds out that not everything she has been told is true and that her past is not as black and white as she thought.This film was one of the most Visually beautiful things I have ever seen. The city-scape scenes, with the cameras soaring over the top of the downtown area make my jaw drop. Its just stunning. All the sets are gorgeous and all the character visuals are just beautiful. I mean we could have done without the stupid amount of scenes with ScarJo wearing little else than a skin coloured body suit thing. I mean she wasn't naked, but she may have well of been. The airbrushed look to her face was also a little unsettling but I guess it was done to make her look a little more inhuman that the others, to mark her as something other.Plot wise, there isn't a lot of plot. It's a pretty basic premise, uses a lot of plot points from your average soy thriller and places them in a futuristic setting. It was interesting enough, but it was completely predictable and nothing that happened was really all that shocking. So if you are looking for something that you haven't experienced before, this wont be for you, but if you want some fairly interesting sci-fi then you will be entertained for and hour and a half.",Ghost in the Shell

It is visually stunning, has an engaging story, and has excellent pacing. It engaged me from the start to the end.Many hard-core fans are decrying the lack of philosophical debate and the deep dive into cybernetics and morals of the original mature Anime series and movies. I'm willing to bet that those in this camp had such high expectations that no movie would have met what they expected.This is an origin story. It's meant to give people who have no idea about the characters and the underlying themes a background without making it overly complicated.

443,themoondweller,This shell is really empty..,4,23 September 2017,"I guess ""ghost"" pretty much means """"blank"" in this movie..I don't know about the anime or any previously made movies about GITS, but this movie is unoriginal from beginning to the end.It is mainly the combination of Robocop and Totall recall, and a lot of other original sci-fi moviesBut, it lacks the originality, mystery character evolving depth twists and shocking endings the other movies had.I expected the ghost's original character to have some important role in the story.. but she was literally nobody! The twist was that there was no real twist at all. I mean I had already figured out that the brain belonged to a ""victim"" of this company like within the first quarter but I expected the real character to be connected to a deeper mystery!! No, just some usual rebellious teen living in a shelter..Oh, by the way, they can create pretty much a whole human body, skins that generate camouflage effect to the point where the character virtually becomes invisible ... but they still drive cars from the 90's, have machine guns to kill full or half robots!!! and the buildings... they look like they are from the industrial era with huge machine parts making most of the outside walls. The inside of a house looks exactly like any standard house so what the hell are those huge engine like stuff for? They look like the the engines of air conditioning system from the 60's or maybe even an earlier era..I love sci-fi and I was so looking forward to see this movie.. so I can't describe the disappointment I felt.. Watch the original total recall movie. It is old and lack today's cgi technology and other digital technologies but still, you will enjoy it 100 times more than this hi-tech empty shell flick!The 4 stars are for some of the acting and the good visual art work..",Ghost in the Shell
444,cmtrisket,"Ghost in the Shell, Honest Review",7,7 June 2017,"I know there was a lot of build up for this movie for some people because there have been Manga books and animated films already made. There are also video games, multiple. People who have followed this in any way had high hopes for this movie becoming a reality. Many others just got pulled in by the presence or Major (Scarlett Johansson), and action in the movies trailer. Either way there was some decent hype about the movie.This movie is based in Japan, as it should be, and sometime in the future. I am not, really, a fan of films in other countries that have main actors and actresses that are white. It just seems weird to me, but I can understand why they do it. Just a personal gripe. At one point in the movie you get confused because Major is a white woman and you have to realize that her brain or 'Ghost' is Asian. You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie.On to the summary! The movie was 107 minutes long which is in the good range. Again, anything pushing over two hours either has to, damn near be the best movie ever to keep people's attention. The movie opens with some written dialogue that sets the scene pretty well. It speaks of ""the line between human and machine is disappearing"" and ""allow humans to enhance themselves with cybernetic parts."" The story itself evolves throughout the movie. It starts with Major being saved and working alongside her partner Batou (Pilou Asbæk). Major is a total bad ass and is portrayed as such. Her movements instantly reminded me of ""The Matrix"", and I kind of liked that.The movie was slower than I had anticipated, and that held true throughout, with only minor exceptions. It also seemed to not really divulge any information in the first half of the movie.t left me wondering what was coming next. I didn't really have any questions so I wasn't sure where it would/could go. The direction of the movie seemed to be going one way and after the start of the second half of the movie it changed. You start to see more of the antagonist Kuze (Michael Pitt) and wonder what and who he is. You develop questions at this point about motives for things and motives for others. It took half a movie to get to the REAL point. It was done in a decent way, and maybe that is how it went in the series of shows, books, and games, but I wouldn't know. I didn't follow the series before this. Looking at it as a standalone movie is all I can do.Throughout the movie you can tell it isn't so much about the whole plot as much, rather it is about Major finding truth. Not just truth in identity, but also truth in life. A major (no pun intended) part of the film is figuring out where that line is drawn. What makes a human, human? At what point, would one not be considered human? Is there a soul? Do you have to be born? These and more pop into your head as the movie progresses.Towards the end of the movie everything starts to come together quickly. You find the answers to some of the questions you have/had. There also starts to be a little bit more action. A few good fight scenes, and a great build up to a pinnacle. As well as a strong musical presence. The movie ends somewhat softly, leaving you with an open door. You can see that this story line ends, but there could be more to come.The actors and actresses did a great job. Scarlett Johansson and Pilou Asbæk have great chemistry in the movie. This could in part from their work together in ""Lucy"" in 2014. There are other lead roles I didn't even mention because their parts were secondary to Scarlett's role. Anyone could have done it, and the movie would have had the same impact. That was another aspect I didn't think I would see. I thought there would be much more emphasis on the other characters than there was.Making these types of reviews that summarize, and try not to give anything away is hard. Just keep that in mind ha ha. Over all I did enjoy this futuristic movie. The gadgets and cinematography are cool concepts. I love see what people think the future will look like. The idea of the movie is great for people who like more sci-fi type movies, even though it isn't listed as one. There is moderate action, a decent amount of drama, and all of it is a crime in progress. It did fall short in some aspects and that did effect my rating.That all being said I would recommend you watch this movie, if any of the stuff I wrote about interests you! I personally give this movie a 6.5/10",Ghost in the Shell

448,IanFRobinson,I liked the live action GitS a lot,9,23 April 2017,"There are spoilers in this. Seriously - see the film before reading this. Overall I like this 2017 live-action version of Ghost in the Shell more than the Anime versions. I went to see the new one several times in the cinema. I loved it every time. I watched the Anime version one day before going to the new one. It confirmed my view that the new one is better for me. But I'm not a big Anime fan. The fact that both exist is good. Having the new one doesn't mean that the 1995 Anime, or the Manga books, are confined to history. It's possible to like all, some, or none of them. I'll be very surprised if Ghost in the Shell 2017 isn't on my top 5 list of films at the end of the year. If it hadn't been for that dodgy bit of CGI in the Spider Yank scene, I'd have rated it 10/10. As it is it's a 9 and I can't wait to get a copy for home viewing later this year.This film arrived with a bit of controversy regarding the casting of Johansson in what many people see as a far eastern role. I never had any problems with the choice. Firstly this is a Hollywood film, and the current thinking in the studios is to put a well-known actor to American and European audiences in the lead to help fill seats. Secondly, and more story related, Johansson is playing is a cybernetic human with a full body prostheses with just a human brain in an android ""shell"". This body is artificial and can have any appearance the manufacturers decide. The first scene of the film shows that the person the brain comes from is Asian (Played by actress Kaori Yamamoto). I had no issues with Johansson before seeing the movie, and afterwards, I have to say she was perfect for the role. For anyone who doesn't know, Ghost in the Shell takes place in a technically advanced mid 21st-century Japanese city called New Port City. Due to geopolitical events and war Japan is a major world power and the population in New Port City is very multicultural and has lots of ethnic mixing. In this future, the boundaries between humans and computers are essentially nil. With lots of cybernetic enhancements available to anyone who can afford them. What it means to be human when more and more body functions are enhanced or replaced by cybernetic parts is the central theme of Ghost in the Shell. The ghost refers to a person's consciousness or spirit, and the shell is the body that this ghost inhabits. Johansson plays a character called Major Mira Killian (her name at the start of the film anyway) who is the first successful full body prostheses with just the brain from her original remaining in a cybernetic shell. So the Major is an extreme version of the Ghost in the Shell paradox. Is she human? This idea of ghosts or spirits inhabiting inanimate objects, but still having some vital aspect, is a big part of the Japanese Shinto tradition, where there are known as Kami. Or so I understand, but I'm not an expert. I don't buy into it myself as I'm a strict materialist, but it's a good premise for stories that address what it means to be human.Plot wise the new 2017 version of Ghost in the Shell starts a year after Johansson's character has been 'born' as a cyborg. She is part of a government security team called Section 9 that is tasked with dealing with cyber-related crime. Someone is killing scientists and managers from Hanka Robotics, the corporation that made Major's cybernetic body. Section 9 has to investigate these and this leads Major to question her own past.The subplot towards the end in which Major regains her identity as Motoko Kusanagi and reconciles with her mother Hairi (Kaori Momoi) is fantastic. The scene in their apartment is wonderful. The counter-play between the facially expressive mother and the passive android Major is excellent. As is the graveyard scene where Motoko tells her mother that she doesn't have to come here anymore to see the Motoko Kusanagi grave. From a craft perspective, I loved this film. Johansson is excellent as the Major. Her portrayal of the angular and stymied movements of the artificial body are subtle but excellent. She walks and moves fluidly, but just different enough from a real human to signal that Major's body isn't human. The depiction of New Port City is incredible. With advertising holograms sprouting all over the place in the more upmarket areas, and plenty of squalor down in the narrow city streets. The CGI is great except for one bit near the end when Cutter is attacking Major and Kuze with a remotely controlled Spider Tank. There is a bit in which the Major is running away from gunfire and rockets where she jumps up on pieces of falling masonry to get to an overhead walkway. It looked wrong and rushed. I read somewhere that the CGI was only finished 2 weeks before release. So maybe they ran out of time. There is an excellent scene in which Major does a deep dive into a damaged Geisha Bot to read it's memories before they fade. Inside the memories, you can see objects dissolving to pixels and dust as they fade away. That one weak bit of CGI at the end was definitely an aberration.",Ghost in the Shell
449,themwntl,"A ""CAM"" of the original GITS Staring Frankenstein with Character Assassination",1,4 April 2017,"A ""CAM"" is a low quality pirate video made with a video camera from the dark, back seats of a movie theater, and posted online for the ""benefit"" of those unwilling to pay retail movie ticket prices. This GITS '17 is the metaphorical equivalent. It takes a certifiable anime masterpiece from 1995; invents a pathetic origin story for the main character, pirates a plot line from a GITS sequel, and directly steals shot for shot action scenes. Why Bother? $$$ I'll dissect this morgue ready corpse for you. 1. Origin story of the Major: The original '95 version dispensed with it, and jumped directly into a fascinating, complex, and fully realized future universe where adult characters, plot, and motive unfolded in a believable story. GITS '17 lazily falls back on the most boring and predictable of graphic novel plots: ""A troubled teenager must save the world and revisit a childhood trauma"" and so, true to form ""17 has a multi-billion Yen Corporation (classic evil.com) resort to kidnapping runaway teens to experiment on. This version of ""teen Frankenstein"" is doubled down in the movie because not only is the Major a kidnapped teen, but so is the villain (Hideo Kuze.) Seriously!!! And they also knew each other in the past, living together in the so called ""outlaw zone"", (where the Evil Corp. gets its ""Brains"") 2. Put a good teenage brain into a cyborg and you instantly get a ""Major""; a tactical wizard, a quick thinking leader, and a hacking genius. Put a bad teenage brain into a cyborg and you get Kuze, a tactical wizard, a devious villain, and a hacking genius out for REVENGE. The revenge plot line is so common and predictable it's easy to imagine it was the producers' first choice when adapting GITS '95. Anything else might have required writing skill. 3. In 1960 they made a perfect movie called Psycho. In 1998 a Hollywood genius decided to remake it shot for shot, but it color. Of course it is a failure on many levels. The same idiocy infects '17, as many shot for shot scenes only serve to highlight the director's lack of creativity. If you feel the need to systematically destroy a classic, why bother quoting some of its great scenes? It's because the lazy adolescent ""brain$"" who made it have no Adult skill4. I may as well mention so called ""whitewashing"" by saying that in this sucide vest of a movie, it would matter not one whit if the cast was entirely Japanese, since there is nothing in the writing that can salvage the character assassination this movie has produced. Scarlett Johannson spends part of the movie in a white wet suit (or are they long johns?) cloaked from human eyes. Well, Scarlett, I can see you. You are in a crap movie. Stop it. 5. It is important to roundly reject these Hollywood clones or they will continue to produce them. They hope that the audience is too lazy to seek out the real thing. They hope you'll be happy with their CGI special effect driven, eye candy film. They hope that you don't want anything of substance when you can safely watch a wet suited chick, fighting in the shallows. ""Shallow"", now that is the right word for this movie. 6. Please go and rent the original GITS '95",Ghost in the Shell
450,krisztyxx,worse then I expected,4,2 April 2017,"Ghost in the shell, worse then I expected. When I saw the trailer expected something like that, but it even worst, as I ever thought. The dialogues are too simple are too dull. Everything is over interpretive. When I watched the movie in the cinema I feel it is an analysis of the original Ghost in the shell. Let's explain everything, that couldn't explain in the anime Scarlett Johansson not very good in it, she knows much better then she does in the movie. Juliette Binoche highly better for that, I thought this his worst role. I like her so I was very disappointed with her and the others. Acting in this movie is so bad. Pilou Asbæk is the only one who good in this film. I hate the end, is also stupid, it makes me mad. I don't like when a movie things the audience is a fool and they don't know anything. The positive thing in the movie is the CGI. The cinematography is amazing. This is the only thing to worth to saw it. Definitely watch in the cinema, if you decided to see. Another positive thing is: this is the best adaption of an animated film, I know. I think is hard to do out of something good from something brilliant. Not an easy job for the filmmakers to make a good adaption of an animated film. Besides that, I think this movie is a waste of money. So I don't recommend for the fun of the anime.",Ghost in the Shell
451,johnpendarvis,Futurism without heart=tedium,2,13 July 2019,"First of all, looking at the futuristic cityscapes in this atrocity, I think Ridley Scott has a legitimate plagiarism case. But, on the other hand, Blade Runner had a seamy, grimy underbelly that lent realism to the otherwordly pastiche. This thing is shiny and shallow.I remember seeing Scarlet Johannsson in Ghost World, great small release film from 2001, and thinking she's a nice actress who should be interesting to watch. Fast forward to now, she has had tremendous high profile, big budget success, but that's not always such a great thing. Watching her sleepwalk through the endless Marvel drivel prepared me for her self consciously robotic take on her role in this film. And yes, I am aware of criticizing her portrayal of an android as robotic seems silly, but being enigmatic gets extremely tedious with no other even mildly interesting other characters to play off. She's dangerously close to sharing stereotype status with Mila Jovovich and Charlize Theron-futuristic badass, invincible babes who routinely dispatch trained male assassins twice their size with minimal exertion. It's BORING.The film itself is a CGI mess, and even after the film was over, I had no clue what the motivation or purpose of any of it was. I think you could probably make 10 interesting films on the budget of this pointless piece of dreck.",Ghost in the Shell
452,S_Rhea,Much better than hyper-critical fans would lead you to believe,8,22 April 2017,"Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a long-time fan of the anime. So I came into this movie both nervous and hopeful. That said, don't let anyone who's a stalwart champion of the anime fool you. The GitS original anime movie is far from the golden standard that people imply. The voice acting for several roles are wooden, the story pacing is disjointed, and the resolution is...weird. The SAC series rightfully disregards this resolution, shores up the deficiencies in voice acting, and delivers two rock-solid seasons. The Arise series similarly plots its own storytelling course separate, apart, and unrelated to the others.I say all this just to reinforce that anyone who balked at some of the core items from the anime being re-imagined hasn't looked very recently at the anime. Nor does any criticism that labels this movie as shallow bear up very well if you revisit the original anime movie.Now, having said all of that, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, had equal parts action and story/character building, and did a good job showcasing the dystopian, cyberpunk universe in which it's set. It lifts several scenes almost verbatim from the anime but wraps them in a story woven from a few different plot lines from the originals.Is it perfect? No. I would have liked to see more of the team have a chance to shine, particularly Togusa. I also think perhaps Aramaic is a bit reckless compared to his anime counterpart. And how can we have had a soundtrack without Yoko Kanno or without some tribute to Origa? And I did cringe when the Major used her title like a name or call sign. Nonetheless, it captured the flavor of the universe, provided an entertaining plot, kept the basic personalities of the characters intact, and did a good job with the Major's relationship with Batou. It surpassed what I expected.At the end of the day, movies like this have to do three things to please me: it has to honor (at least in spirit) those elements which I enjoyed in the original material even if it takes liberties with them. It has to entertain with more than just mindless action. And it has to have some heart with the characters. I feel like all those boxes were checked with me.Remember, too, that movies like this, Speed Racer, Pacific Rim, and numerous others don't translate well for folks who didn't grow up with anime. That doesn't mean they're not good. This movie has the unfortunate distinction of missing out on those moviegoers who don't get anime as well as being the victim of a hypercritical that views the history of the show through overly rose-colored glasses.",Ghost in the Shell

I think Scarlet is a good choice for the role, I know she is not Japanese but for the color and shape of the eyes of the original character I don't see the problem (about the white washing controversy) although I prefer an actor not so famous.Also I want to praise some iconic scenes from the original anime that it looks like they trace with magnifier. It was a beautiful work! The only thing that I regret a lot is the ending. They remove all the essence of the original story. The message is OK but I think they lost the path the main idea. I think is not fair to said this move has no soul or ghost, is just that is not the original ghost is not the original ghost in the shell.The problem is that the original idea of the anime is just an outstanding concept but in the movie they just make it standard or boring plain.I think the director or writers or both just didn't understand the original idea. So sad.",Ghost in the Shell
454,AlexFalzon,"Review: Ghost in the Shell - A little uncomfortable, but looks and sounds great.",6,29 March 2017,"I suppose the first thing to say here is that I actually haven't seen 1995's Ghost in the Shell. I do make an effort to engage with original source material before watching film adaptations; alas, I could not find a physical copy, nor could I find a way to legally view it online.So I went in blind. This can have positive and negative consequence, the positive being that I can't critique the film too harshly with regard to its adherence to the original film, and the negative being that I might have no idea what's happening, as was my girlfriend's experience with last year's Warcraft. Fortunately, Ghost in the Shell was very easy to follow..The story is of Major Mira Killian (the ""miracle"" pun was cute until other characters decided to treat the audience like idiots and point it out to us), a cyborg comprised entirely of technological components but for her human brain. Another cyborg, very similar in composition to her, begins attacking her creators in revenge for some heinous act. It doesn't take a machine to guess where the plot goes from here. Also, it's very annoying that the writers feel we need to be told multiple times that ""ghost"" means ""soul"". Those of us who didn't understand that when we walked in got it the first time you told us, thanks.The film came under a lot of fire for whitewashing. Most of the time, I'm okay with characters having their ethnicity changed, as long as it makes sense within the context of the story. For example, I mentioned in my Power Rangers review that three of the five rangers were of different ethnicities than in the series, and it didn't bother me at all. I was also fine with Tom Cruise appearing in Edge of Tomorrow, which was based on a Japanese novel. I was even okay with Tilda Swinton's performance in Doctor Strange. Ghost in the Shell, though, bothered me. A lot.The film is set in a Japanese metropolis, and nearly every minor character is Asian, but every main character is white (both antagonists, both main protagonists, and Major's primary creator) except for one Japanese character: Aramaki, who is Major's direct superior. What's worse is that every person speaks English, except for Aramaki, who speaks Japanese – even when they're all speaking to each other, and even when they're all employing telepathic communication, rather than verbal. It's extremely strange. More Asian characters were desperately required, because as it is the film felt as if it were using ethnicity as a marker for the audience to know which characters were important and which ones weren't, and it was extremely uncomfortable. I'm honestly not sure why the filmmakers didn't just go ahead and set the movie in New York (the aforementioned Edge of Tomorrow went this route and simply imported the entire story). The only reason not to do so is that they viewed it necessary to retain the story's Japanese setting, so which is it? Either the Japanese origins of the movie are important, or they aren't. You can't half-respect them.The most painful moment in the entire film is when Major discovers what she looked like before her brain was supplanted into her machine body. She was, of course, Asian, and this revelation had half of my audience laughing hysterically and the other half sitting in stunned silence. Actress Kaori Momoi appears in only two scenes, including this one, and on a positive note, her performance was one of the film's brightest highlights.Other highlights include Scarlett Johansson's performance (whatever your stance is on her casting, you can't fault her acting), and the film's wonderful musical score and beautiful cinematography. As mentioned, I haven't seen the original, so I have no idea how much of the music and how many of the shots were taken from that, but this movie looks and sounds awesome. I should mention that I saw it in 3D (not by choice), and I feel as though I would've enjoyed the visuals even more if I'd just gone the 2D route. There are some fantastic sequences, too. There's an ankle-deep-water-fighting scene that was shown in the trailers which was great, and Aramaki gets two great scenes with his revolver, one of which was probably the best scene in the film.I took issue with some of the editing, continuity-wise. A few bullet- holes in one shot where there weren't any in the shot prior, that sort of thing. I'm also not sure how two civilians managed to get their hands on assault weapons with less than five minutes' notice, let alone cloaking technology. Not sure why characters' lips sometimes move while communicating telepathically and sometimes don't, and I'm not sure why Major sees her memories in the third-person.I actually got quite the RoboCop vibe. She's a cyborg in law- enforcement with repressed memories who slowly tries to claw back her humanity. RoboCop was much better, though.",Ghost in the Shell

I didn't see this in theaters, but recently watched it on a plane. Man, I really felt like I missed out. I had seen the original anime and loved it, but decided to dismiss it because of all the negative backlash and reviews. Even though I saw it on a plane, I was extremely impressed with how well they recreated a lot of the scenes. The atmosphere of the world was amazing, and surreal. I thought Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job!! She didn't need to look or be Japanese. In the anime, she looks completely different from everyone else. They make her look ""doll like"" to differentiate from being human. It works well. For anyone that's seen the original anime, I would really recommend it. There isn't anything I can say that makes me think it should receive anything less than a 10. I liked it so much that when I came home from the flight, I watched the trailer and comparisons to the anime for several hours... then bought the 4k edition to watch soon. Great movie!!

Before watching this, I went back to re-watch all the original GitS material because I wanted to see how well they did (or didn't) do this.Overall impression? Passable.

It does borrow sequences from the 1995 film but thank god it is not a Watchmen style recreation. The world building was incredible and the film for me very much has its own atmosphere which I was not expecting but thoroughly enjoyed. The visuals and cinematography are superb. The plot is soft enough to not be wrapped in star wars prequelesque dialogue scenes but does start to skim the surface of philosophy of GITS. Whilst I love the 1995 film, some of the sequels and the SAC series for me there can be moments when the existential debate and discussion can be a bit long in the tooth, especially for a film adaptation that is attempting to bring the series to a wider audience. The casting debate for me was total nonsense and implies a massive ignorance in the origins of Kusanagi and the choice of a generic cyborg shell. I am actually quiet happy with the origin of this interpretation of the character. Making a runaway with concerns about technological integration into a cyborg was for me a nice touch. There isn't a real twist in this film, more of a gradual unravelling as to what is going on which is also nice. Films relying on a M. Night Shyamalan style twist and reveal can become tiresome as a plot device, so the slow unwinding of what is going on is satisfying. The prop work from WETA was first class and I would say only twice did the CG pull me from the film. I hope the numbers for this film pickup because it definitely does not deserve the 6.8 it is currently on. I also hope that maybe some of the die-hards will give it a chance as this could be a great starting point for a series.",Ghost in the Shell

461,donuts_69,"Keep your hands off Akira, Hollywood! Disaster!!",4,27 July 2017,"After waiting 20+ years since I first saw the original anime cult classic, I was equally excited/terrified that Ghost in the Shell was finally getting a big western studio refresh. Obviously the full gamut of the Ghost story would be impossible to recapture in one feature length film, but if the essence of the original 1995 movie could be maintained I felt as though many existing fans as well as a new audience would be able to enjoy what is a difficult sell for mainstream fans of film.The thought provoking and philosophical approach to the original sci-fi was the pillar of it's appeal. A detailed and fleshed out background into the world of GitS complimented the deeper themes in the movie and it was all tied together through some of the most iconic action scenes ever animated supported by a haunting soundtrack. The modern Hollywood action movie owes a lot to the 1995 original (see: The Matrix and its derivatives) so with a major Hollywood studio/star behind the wheel, there was plenty of potential for another leap forward in the action genre. Unfortunately for all involved this remake is a clunky, soulless mess that neither delivers on the morality of project 2571/Section 9 or the cyber action contained within the unfolding story. For a screenplay supposedly based on Shirow Masamune's Manga, there is an alarming lack of soul from a story basically questioning the souls' very existence in a world where technology has replaced/enhanced human capabilities. A character like the Major whose internal dialogue with her conflicting thoughts about what existence is, has been totally glossed over – possibly due to the fact that casting Johansen in the role leaves producers pushing for ""style"" over ""substance"". Johansen is afforded plenty of opportunity to showcase the vulnerability and conflict she is experiencing in trying to piece her memory back together while carrying out an investigation into a string of cyber hack related corporate assassinations, but unfortunately her character is not provided with any context that permits the viewer to fully understand her motives.It is a problem for all main characters in the film. Batou chaperones Kusanagi as she stumbles through the plot, but he cannot provide her with the back and forth dialogue that opens the themes of the original to poignant levels. The glossy visuals, too, are neither ground-breaking nor original, with ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Blade Runner"" the obvious inspirations. Key action sequences such as the Garbage Truck chase and Tank battle are both sorely under cooked. Even a scene where the Major lies at the bottom of the harbor before ""rebirthing"" herself is not allowed to find its way to the heart of the source material.The attempt to wedge the Majors' past into proceedings only serve to confuse the underlying concepts of the story and come off as an afterthought and confusing. Kusanagis' quest is not to find her past but to discover what it means to be human after the transplant of her only surviving organ into her robotic body. Back in 1995, GitS was a movie offering a question that led to a deeper understanding of reality through its combination of biology with technology. For a movie based on the fundamental question of what makes us human and asking the question of where does the line between reality and technology come into play, this is a desperately shallow showing and one that will not inspire audiences into shelling out for future Anime re-boots.I fear for Akira",Ghost in the Shell
462,vovaparkour,"A movie worth seeing, disregard the purists and social combatants",8,9 April 2017,"OK a few things. SJWs: Thank you for fighting the good fight, but ScarJo looks like Major in the movie, and they very explicitly nod to her origin at some point in the film. Plus there are plenty of diverse characters throughout the movie. Purists: I watched GITS two days before seeing this, and you should chill. First of all, GITS isn't even that amazing (it's great but I need you to settle down), and that's coming from a sci-fi fan who loves cyberpunk and Transhumanism and all that and whose favorite movie is probably AKIRA. So stop docking points from this movie when it's fairly faithful to the original while meeting mainstream expectations. You should really learn to meet producers halfway if you want animated movies to become mainstream and eventually masterpieces. Support the movie. Everyone else: Watching this movie solely for the visuals is worth the price, especially if a sci-fi tech world appeals to you. In that case don't miss it. On top of that, the characters are likable and the plot is more than sufficiently good. The dialogue is fine, not a masterpiece but not cheesy (maybe 2 instances I thought were trash). Although the philosophy is tweaked down, there are still many questions that arise through the dialogue and the characters. The movie itself is a visual exploration of what it is to fuse humans and tech, you will see a lot of whirling trinkets and gadgets. There is one visual failure in my opinion in the beginning, kinda looks like garbage. So I apologize for the disjointed ""review"" and for throwing some shade I was compelled to post out of salt.

If they had kept the original plot intact and script similar to the 1995 movie, gave it to someone like Ridley Scott or Nolan had actors that were representative of the characters, it might have stood a chance. There is good reason that this movie bombed hard at the box office... The reaction from fans of the original was - You Cannot Capture the Magic of a Classic - They tried with Robocop... it failed... They've tried with Ghostbusters... and failed on and on and on so was mostly boycotted, those that had never heard of the movie... it would just look like any other cash-in on the current fandom around Japanese popular culture.

468,hyperiontitanj,There Seems to be More than One Version of this Movie Playing,2,19 April 2017,"There are a few problems with this movie all of which are do to incredibly poor directing:1) The exposition. Where is it? Unless you've seen the anime (I haven't) it's very unclear who she is, exactly who she is working for and why she is doing what she is doing (which is what, again?) There are a lot of regular characters in this movie and none of them received any substantial character development--so little, in fact that I hardly know any of their names. The setting is even less developed. It's not even clear where/when the movie takes place. I assume some future Japan but I don't even think they bothered to give the name of the city much less explain who they are fighting against and why they are fighting them.2) The movie fails to pay anything more than lip service to the concept of...is she human? Is she a robot? That would have been a compelling area to explore. The movie almost completely glosses over it and overall the plot is very shallow.3) The CGI. There is good CGI bad CGI and Ghost-in-the-Shell CGI which is undoubtedly the worse. The textures look so unrealistic it's jarring to seem them imposed on live action scenes and the movie is oversaturated with it to the extent it detracts from most moments in the film. The physics are way, way off which greatly diminishes the impact of the action scenes. It's difficult to sell a fight scene when the characters move completely unnaturally and appear as though they are weightless. It seems that either:A) They used decades old CGI techniques which wouldn't hold up back in 1998. B) They hired a cheap studio for the CGI which has little skill with it. C) They hired people to do the CGI that have no prior relevant experience a la Mass Effect Andromeda.People who are suggesting the visual effects alone are worth seeing the movie for clearly saw a different version of the film than I did.4) Dialogue and acting. It's not very good. Scarlett Johansson comes off as a human trying to move like a robot and in an extremely unconvincing manner. This is a shame because I think she is a fairly talented actress. I will chalk this up to directing because they definitely should not have gone with the shots they did.

469,HumanLifeMovie,"Ghost in a Shell takes us to a city with Bladerunner feel spiced with the Borg ideas, all wrapped up in anime legacy",7,1 April 2017,"I expected a sci-fi sitting down in that chair at the movies. I didn't know the anime heritage, until after the movie, when the person, next in the seat to me, told me that the movie was based on a anime with the same name. The person recommended that I see the anime. I haven't, but here is the review. The film has some Bladerunner feel to the design of the city they are in. The city has the same colors, the same darkness and the same technological noise and flickering really. There is also one Borg moment for the Star Trek fans, when the Major hibernates in Major's apartment. The Major is the lead character, played by Scarlett Johansson. Also Alan Walker's video ""Sing me to sleep"" has the same feel as the whole movie design set really. In the music video the environments fade and so they do in this movie to. The hacker in the movie also wears a hoodie, so stereotype for a hackers ""image"". So this movie doesn't deliver something new in the design department, but since i happen to think the references to the design are great, so is this movie. The designs are interesting and beautiful, but not new. Scarlett Johansson plays the lead role as Major. Someone ripped her brain out and placed it inside a robot body. The Major hasn't much memory of the past, so Major lives in the present. Major is a expensive machine, just like Robocop, out fighting for the Japanese government with the help of a private company named Hanka Robotics. This brain in a robot body is just as the Borg queen in the Star Trek Next Generation series, the Borg queen has her spine still though. But just as the Borg queen has access to the Hive, so does the Major, the Major can talk ""telepathically"" with the team(with the help of technology of course). Either anime was first, or this movie has a lot of references to Star Trek. However, even though Star Trek also takes up the ethical surrounding the Borg hive and individuality, so does this ""Ghost in a shell"", but still this movie doesn't feel as the ""Borg"", it has the feel of ""Irobot"", but since the Major is a human, Major doesn't phase the same issue of not being considered human. Major is the next step in evolution of humanity. So what is the story really? Well, some earlier reviews said the story is shallow, but I happen to disagree. It is about finding out what really matters for you and what you could do for your beliefs when you do. So with that said, this is a sci-fi movie, that isn't boring in any way. It has a artistic feel to it and in the end we get to know the Major just a little bit more, enough to want more episodes of this film, even without action and murder. Just to explore the cyber human, that most likely will be possible, due to the more artificial stuff we invent. So is this the future? Cyber humans? With body parts of technology? So are the new threat the hackers in this universe? Those that can hack into the cyber humans technology? What happens to free will, if your mind is hacked? I think this movie addresses some of the fears hidden inside the development of cyber humans. The Major has no privacy, since all her thoughts can be read. So is this a possible further step for mankind? Are we gonna be connected to hives, in a neural network? This movie doesn't tell us what it would be like. This movie seems to be pro for cyber humans. It seems to be anti-hackers, but at the same time glorifies and demonizes them. Major has a special walking style through the film, so it doesn't come off as a human body in fully. I think Scarlet does it well. I actually like this film and in the genre of sci-fi I would like to give the movie a strong grade. This movie might disappoint anime watchers, since it didn't feel anime to me in the designs. It is a very Japanese movie, with feelings of Japanese designs all over it. I wasn't bored at any time and time flew fast. There is no sex in this film, so if you like love scenes you are going to be disappointed.",Ghost in the Shell
470,kasparslabais,Could be better but I liked,7,5 April 2017,"First thing which you should know is if you are thinking ""Should I watch anime or movie first?"". Then answer is - don't watch anime before movie. Why? Short answer - anime has more complex story and ideas which it tries introduce to you, movie has ideas and other goods, but it isn't so deep. I will not spoil the story, so it is spoiler free zone. Movie was interesting and I enjoyed watching it on big screen. Scarlett's performance was solid and good - which isn't surprising if you seen her acting in ""Avengers"" and ""Lucy"". Supporting cast was good, maybe it wasn't introduced to you properly but it wasn't something you need in the first place anyways. Movie has good sound tracks, great visual effects and solid performance from cast and crew (as filming, montage, etc). It has its own look and feel which was great. Then why I gave 7? Story was good, but I would say it was too simple and already known, so if we compare with anime, movies story was re-created for wider audience so it would be more action flick not something deeper and less meaningless. Basically that all why I could take off some stars, because in other departments movie did a great job. p.s. I know there was some talks about whitewashing, but if you will watch anime and movie, it just hard to imagine another actress who could play better this role except Scarlett Johansson. And to be fair, if you watch anime you will understand that there isn't really a reason to talk about whitewashing.",Ghost in the Shell

I feel that the 1995 version pales in comparison to the 1968 short story by Philip K Dick, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep."" That observation is also irrelevant.
For what this attempts to do, the remake does an excellent job of conveying the underlying themes.

But then I thought - hey, that's maybe not exactly what they were going to say at all. I think that the goal of the movie is to 'prepare' majority to coming era of human augmentation. And how can you possibly do it with such a complex thing as original GiS? Who's gonna watch it and what they would understand, if anything?

Both the protagonist and the villain as well as their motives were altered and therefore the deep philosophical meaning and its unique content was vanished... The new plot was nothing original to say the least and sentimental clichés were not absent. We must not forget though the good characteristics of the movie: I liked how the future city looked, soundtrack was cool,the atmosphere of the original movie was maintained to a certain extent, Scarlett Johansonn suited this role, and most importantly the action scenes. The action scenes who were awesome in the original movie were perfected here mostly due to amazing spacial effects (even though we did not get to see the 'massive muscle breakout').

482,pianotm-58404,There's a lot that makes this movie worthwhile.,7,15 August 2021,"I really didn't want to see see this movie and I'm not sure why I decided to. I went into it expecting to be disappointed.And I wasn't. I am glad I watched it. It makes a few story changes that kind of separate it from the manga and the 1995 movie, and anyone who knows them will be uneasy for about the first hour. I wasn't enthusiastic about them. When I saw the changes being made to the story, especially how Puppet Master had been changed into a prototype of the type of cyborg Major was, now named Kuze, I was concerned. They seemed to have made some significant changes to the Puppet Master character. Instead of being a sentient AI that evolved from the network, he was now a cyborg that created his own network. I was seeing the warnings of a Hollywood screw-up. Fortunately, that screw-up didn't happen. I don't feel like they were completely faithful to the story, but they were certainly faithful to the characters and the setting and I think they did a really good job on this movie.Scarlett Johanssen's performance; I'm on the fence about this. For a solid half of the movie, her performance seems to be not great. I can understand the robotic movements, considering the character has a robotic body, but she's a cyborg. Surely she hasn't forgotten how emotions work? But there are things later in the movie that would plainly explain why her behavior was so bland and emotionless throughout this first half. In the second half, she completely comes to life, and there is plenty of context in the movie for this shift in behavior and attitude. It's just that I can definitely see people losing enthusiasm and checking out of the movie due to the dry, almost lifeless acting of ScarJo in the first half.There is a bit of racial thing that you'll miss if you're not paying attention. That being the notion of a major corporation basically kidnapping Japanese people, experimenting on them, and inserting their brains into robot bodies with very caucasian appearances. It didn't bother me but it occurs to me that some people might misconstrue what the movie was trying to say with that and be justifiably upset, particularly given the context of when the movie was made. To me, it just made the main villain look like even more of a dick.I won't talk about what happens at the end because I don't want to spoil it (and I do very much recommend this movie. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.), but I would like to warn people that it doesn't have that deep, thought-provoking conclusion that the 95 anime did. Although I liked the ending and liked the decision they made, it still doesn't sit well with me. It asks a very different question about identity that, being fair, is deep and thoughtful in its own right, but it doesn't leave us with that deeper question.Instead, it seems that it answers that deeper question. This film, the anime, and the manga all inquire into the substance of a human. What makes us who we are? How do you define the human soul? At the end of this film, the Major clearly has the answer to these questions, whereas, in the anime and the manga, she's accepted that there is no real answer and that it's not a question to answer so much as an unknown possibility to explore. This movie doesn't try to be that deep, and thinking about it, it probably shouldn't. After all, the anime and manga already explore that question, and this film looks at it from a very different angle.While it may not be the Ghost in the Shell you're looking for, I think it's a good movie, and I'm convinced it's, importantly, good sci-fi. I didn't expect to say that about a live-action anime remake. Particularly this one.",Ghost in the Shell

The actor's are well chosen and perform well.As per the title of my review, it feels a little like a 2017 homage to Blade Runner, style wise it is heavily influenced and did we actually know if Harrison Ford was a Cyborg Cop? If you are also familiar with Mirrors Edge the game, you will also see it in the movie ( I can't say more as it will be a spoiler).Scarlett Johansson seems to have turned into a modern day Nicholas Cage, picking roles that make her either super intelligent or having super powers, her ego is getting a little thin on me now and I am no longer lusting over her as I once did.Minor gripe aside, its worth a watch, it's in the same league as her film Lucy, watch it once, nod your head once in appreciation and not plan to watch it a second time.

A lot of people I see reviewing are almost borderline edgy babies and all their reviews can be summed up as ""Whaaaa, it's not the 1995 one, it sucks"". Really now, what gave it away, the 2017 at the end of the movie name?We can all agree that the visuals and general feeling of the movie was fantastic, so moving on from there. The plot was simple enough, yet engaging as well. But that's the thing. It is not a long-spanning manga or series or something like that. It was a two hour movie telling an origin story and it did that very well. Character interactions were good and believable and the acting as well. At times you can even see how most people act like humans while Scarlet stands still like a robot.In my personal opinion, there was no whitewashing (MINOR SPOILERS) We can clearly see that the Major was originally a Asian/Japanese girl that was later rebuild as a western looking one duo to the simple fact that the team that rebuild her (the ones we know) are westerners as well.A lot of people expected a sort of a drama/moral conflict. What were you actually expecting? She had her memory wiped as well as a whole year to actually get used to been what she is. Besides, if the entire movie was every 2 minutes the main character going all like ""Have I lost my humanity? Am I human anymore?""/questioning her humanity in some other way, I would have honestly fallen asleep.All in all, it is a good film that you will enjoy if you go into it with an open mind and look at it as a stand-alone piece.",Ghost in the Shell

486,trims,Pointless live-action version misses the soul of either the mana or anime...,4,12 December 2020,"First off: the whole controversy of the casting of a white actor as The Major was just stupid. The setting of the mana (let alone the anime) makes it clear that it's a hugely mixed-race place, as is common for the genre. The Major isn't Japanese. She, in fact, is very ill-defined as other than a robot.The problem isn't that. The problem is Johansson, and that she's both horridly mis-cast (in terms of ability and presence) and that she's given a poor script to work with. Johansson does Black Widow well, but The Major is NOT some anime-version of BW.It's a much more complex character to act - BW is a reasonably single-tone character with a complex backstory, but the CHARACTER is pretty simple to portray, in terms of how they act/emote. Or perhaps I might say that BW is really a consistent character in terms of how they appear/act.The Major is not - you're looking for someone who can rapidly switch gears between an array of characterizations and ""personality"" types. Johansson simply can't do that, and several of The Major's characterizations are simply out of her wheelhouse.You need someone with the ability of say Cate Blanchet or Jessica Chastain or Charlize Theron. Someone who can be terrifyingly competent, sexy silly, intense, flirty, and even openly self-contemplative, and swap between them between scene without seeming out of place. it's a tough job, and there's frankly not a lot of actors who can pull off that level of range.It's made worse because the film script doesn't bother with much more than superficial resemblance to either the manga or anime before it. And that's NOT a good thing, because the new script is weak, once you look past the flashy visuals.In many ways, this is like the Star Wars sequels and prequels: a lot of pretty good actors, miscast, or laboring under a crappy script. all layered over with distracting SFX to cover the fact that it's actually a pretty blah story.NOT recommended to anyone, particularly anyone with prior experience in GITS media. You'll be sorely disappointed.",Ghost in the Shell
487,p_bourha,Painfully commonplace,3,20 August 2017,"When will Hollywood be tired of regurgitating the same old and go for more original stories? The cinematography is remarkable but the story is a hot mess and frankly in 2017 no one is impressed by Hollywood nailing CGI.My first problem with the film is that thought it is set in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama every main character is Caucasian. A company of white people with white scientists creating white robots. Even the protagonist, who was originally an Asian woman, was placed in a Caucasian cyborg. I haven't read the anime but ""based on"" implies the creators can make changes to the original material.Another thing that bothered me was that it was your basic, around the mill action movie with gorgeous, badass characters that go around punching the hell out of people mainly for the sake of it. It had no substance and though I agree that a movie needs also be entertaining it seems that now that's all movies are. Art should contribute not just entertain.Somewhere around the middle of the film a limp attempt was made for an existential quest but the film only ended up contradicting itself. Dr. Ouelet says ""We cling to memories as if they define us, but... they really don't. What we do is what defines us"" but throughout the film Major feels alone and disconnected because she misses her memories: ""Everyone around me seems to fit. They seem connected to something, I am... not"". In the first half of the movie she makes certain choices because of who she thinks she is, which is defined by what she ""remembers"", while on the second half of the movie she changes completely because she regained her memories and therefore her true self. Bottom line is the screenwriters through in some pompous lines without any regard for how they fit with the story only to make the protagonist sound wise.I was also upset by the ""judge, jury and executioner"" concept. Vigilantism is always wrong. I know there are crimes that make you want to take the perpetrators head of right then and there but what society would we live in if the injured party got to decide the perpetrator's sentence? Last but not least, I was not impressed by Scarlett Johansson's performance of the cyborg Major. Summer Glau did a far better job in ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles""",Ghost in the Shell
488,RNJ97,it's okay but nothing too exciting,5,19 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell asks the perennial question every human being asks and yet unable to answer-- Who am I? Those who think they have the answer are usually mistaken. Major who is given a body, not just any body but a Scarlett Johansson body, finds her law enforcement gig less fulfilling without a memory of her past even when reassured by her creator, Dr. Phil, played by the lovely Juliette Binoche, that life is defined by what one does rather than one's memories or past. And of course, everybody and his dog know Dr. Phil is full of it. Like Major, nobody is free from his past and everybody is burdened by history. The movie doesn't come with any surprise everything happens just as expected or even like a déjà vu. Every futuristic cityscape scene is derivative of Blade Runner except it is a knockoff and ten times cheesier. The Hong Kong streetscape can be interesting only if the post production doesn't feel obliged to add more and more and yet more video gimmickries to the mix. The few architectural shots are almost facsimile copies of Peter Stewart's pictures of the same. The 1.85:1 aspect ratio is supposed to give audience an immersive experience but sometimes I can't help but feel like watching 4:3 standard definition TV, also the PG-13 rating doesn't help either. Nothing good can come out of any existential crisis not even good cinema in this case. Scarlett Johansson does have very good skin which manages to salvage the movie from downright unwatchable to somewhat entertaining and somewhat watchable.

490,QuintLives,Instantly Forgettable,2,25 May 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is based on a Japanese comic book/anime series that started in the late 80s. I haven't read the comics or seen the anime and I wish that I had because then I might have something more to say here. The hardest movies to review are mediocre ones because they don't inspire either positive or negative enthusiasm. I barely have the enthusiasm to acknowledge that I watched this movie let alone review the damn thing. But I'll give it a shot.This takes place in the future when robotics have advanced to the point where most humans are augmenting themselves with robotic parts. Scarlet Johansson plays a robot with a human brain and is a cop or counter-terrorist or military or something. I never exactly understood what she was supposed to be. Anyway, somebody is killing people that have something to do with how she was created, so she goes after them and starts learning more about where she came from. It's a very generic story where the hero with missing memories begins to assemble their history. Ever seen Robocop? Imagine that, but worse. Ever seen the Bourne movies? Well, I don't like those movies either, but this is Jason Bourne with robots. Kind of like Robocop. Except worse. I have heard many people say that a wooden performance from Scarlet Johansson is the main problem with this movie. I disagree. There isn't anything particularly great about her performance, but it isn't terrible. In that sense, her performance is a microcosm of the entire movie. I just never cared. I didn't even really understand what was happening until the last half hour or so. But I could never even give enough of a crap to be angry with it. The performances are boring, the plot is both generic and confusing (which is actually something of an accomplishment) and I just wanted it to end. I will say, though, that the production design is excellent. The massive city lit in neon with massive holograms is well-done, even though it reminded me of Blade Runner and made me wish I was watching that instead.Maybe I'm the wrong person to review this since I don't know anything about the source material. I would be curious what fans of the anime have to say about it. But if you know nothing about the source material, there is nothing notable here. Don't go to the theater for it; maybe watch it on Netflix if you are really bored. But for the love of god, watch Robocop or Blade Runner first if you haven't seen those classics. They cover this material in a far more memorable way.I try to make these reviews at least 500 words..but I've got nothing. Scarlet Johansson is really pretty. Did that get me to 500 words? Screw it.

The characters have no personality, no depth they are walking and talking clichés. This whole movie is a cliché. Scarlet Johanson's performance is like any other she had. She can be either a robot or an assassin without feelings. Why? Because she can't act. She's linear can't express emotions due to that. So she's kinda perfect for this role you will think. No. A good robot was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, staring through things and moving your head unnatural doesn't make you a robot, it makes you a bad actress. A hot bad actress. I gave 5 to the movie, 1 star cause she's hot the other 4 for visual effects witch were pretty good. This movie also contains emotional baits witch if you forgot to call your mother a long time you'll fall into this trap and feel something. There is nothing to feel. You can't empathize with this mother daughter relationship because there isn't one to begin with. It's just the ""shell"" so to speak. Old women + house with old objects + hot robot who can't remember her past = instant sobbing. There is nothing into it, like i said, there is no depth, there's no feeling, it's mathematics. I can go longer about what's wrong with this movie but I got bored. My advice, don't waste your time on this movie UNLESS : you're the stalking type of fan of scarlet johanson and you want to watch the movie for some masturbation material you can go watch it, i think half of the movie are just shots of her ass and boobs. You can also go if you are a visual effect freak, you're passionate about that, there are some things to see there or you're homeless and you found a ticket to this movie, go to it only if it's cold outside. Aside that there's no possible reason to go to this movie. Don't let yourself dragged to see this movie like I was. You'll regret wasting precious time where you can watch Split which is best movie this year by far.",Ghost in the Shell

It's not a terrible film, and I really believe most of critics were predisposed to review it badly due to the supposed whitewashing by ScarJo's casting as Major. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and I actually found myself becoming more attached to the live action version of Major than the anime one. The extra backstory certainly made me more invested in her and it made her motivations more believable and interesting. As cheesy as it perhaps was, I even liked the alternative ending in the live action movie as I felt the one in the anime wasn't very satisfying. Sure, the plot could have been ""deeper"", but I almost felt like the anime was too deep, i.e. too much lofty dialogue about philosophical stuff instead of exploring those topics simply thorough character actions and the visuals. The live action movie could have been improved by sticking closer to the some of the scenes in the anime, especially aesthetic-wise, and I think I would've liked it even more if it was R rated as it would've added some extra grit. I recommend that you watch it for yourself before judging it.",Ghost in the Shell

It's has a feel of Blade Runner in the way the City and inhabitants are depicted and is futuristic and real looking . The only quibble I have is the lead Actress as she is not quite convincing in the role and would have liked to see another more athletic and/or stronger Lady in the part. There are a lot of action Asian Women who would have are also good actresses who could have looked and done it much better but then I suppose it was more of case of it being successful in America .In the starting scenes the music made me think of Oblivion .I particularly disliked the Naked Body suit Scarlett Johansson she wore she is too well built Woman wise to look like a sleek Human/Cyborg, looking more like a tubby unfit housewife in some sort of Yoga Pants suit.

Nothing says these are not a path to happiness and joy than this movie. I don't care if this is not a movie from major movie-making companies, as long as the movie does not have too much violent, brutal, bloody, sexual scenes and above all, help enforcing a basic rule---humanity is our virtue, I am all for that.

+ Really good soundtrackA bit wooden acting in some placesBut, after watching it again (a habit, I tend to watch things twice), I saw some gems hidden away in there. Non obvious, or maybe they were to everyone else...+ The scenes with Major's mum, while Scarlet is a bit wooden, the mother is more real. Not understanding the insane plot, she just sees a little piece, she still doesn't believe, and the actress plays that out nicely.+ Near the end, two scenes with the boss. One where he points out ""you kill her, you kill us"" and later when he asks for her permission... There's this subtle undercurrent that he's her boss, but somehow she outranks him.+ The last lines in English in the film are well chosen. ""I know who I am, and what I am here to do."".

499,w-53813,Flat Tire,1,31 March 2017,"The best thing I can say about ""Ghost in the Shell"" is that it was not as bad as Suicide Squad. I hated the fact that this movie used CGI to create scenery that tried (very unsuccessfully) to emulate ""Blade Runner."" The movie also tried unsuccessfully to borrow elements from ""Max Headroom,"" ""Wolverine,"" and ""RoboCop."" So here we have a modern day movie that does not meet the aesthetic and thematic standards of movies decades past. Blade Runner had grit not antiseptic CGI with mangled shots of Hong Kong. If you have ever been to Hong Kong you will immediately know that Ghost in the Shell was shot in Hong Kong. Why then would Japanese people (and cheeky and cheesy cyborgs alike) be living in and dominating the street of Hong Kong. As to cyborgs, why not 3d print a plastic jawbone or Victorian clockwork eye sockets of your own. That is how cheesy the non-cgi effects were. Why would a modern day robot have steam-punk eye sockets? Why?This movie had phony special effects but lacked any kind of social commentary or science fiction story whatsoever. Death Race 2050 lacked special effects but had a totally incredible level of social commentary that used a science fiction story to talk about current issues. Death Race 2050 made people uncomfortable, it hit home.If you want science fiction your best bet is to watch TV. ""The Expanse,"" talked about the fragility of human designed (and thus simplified) complex systems. A show with no budget, and minimal special effects, hit upon an issue that great thinkers such as James Lovelock have identified as being a very important part of our future. Ghost in the Shell is not science fiction, its milieu is cheesy and unbelievable, the action is flat, does not talk to the ethics of technology, and the action sucks. Perhaps sensibilities of Chinese production companies has killed yet another movie. When I see Chinese production companies take credit for a movie I about to see I shudder.",Ghost in the Shell

And boy am i glad ,i never watched it, so i could not possibly get ButtHurt. But i should also admit, That i'm a huge fan of sc-fi , and cyber-punk, And my Top 10 movies includes Dark city, Matrix, Fifth Element, Blade runner,and Robocop for example, So i m all into this Genre.What can i say about this flawless movie, that has the best directing of action scenes since Matrix 1? That has The most detailed and rich set designs in any action movie ever? That has unbelievable Cgi , and special effects. That should get a Oscar for a costume design? A movie that finally doesn't have horrible hip hop , or dubstep soundtrack? Main actor that is a most bad-ass women in universe , and is so beautiful to look at that you get depressed about yourself.? I seriously can not admire enough , the efforts that were put in the making of this movie. The evidence of hard work by the whole crew, is just everywhere. Nobody would plan everything in such a detail if they weren't fans of the original, and can you even imagine how hard is to make exact replica of a scene that was originally only drawn on a paper with a pencil?Scenes of the city are just breathtaking, and fighting and shootout scenes are like a ballet. ScaJo's suit and body, is an image i will remember till the day i die, And all other actors and characters are valid replicas of anime original characters, and very well done. One of the most important pluses of the movie for me, is the camera job. Finally for the love god, we do not get Shaky cam, instead we get most sharp and clear action scenes since matrix. Choreography of fights and using guns is done so well, that you get goosebumps.I appreciate it so much , because i always felt eye raped, with action scenes in last 10-15 years.They are all horrible, and not one is memorable.The story is not weak or dumbed down, as anime fans are saying it. It is actually completely the same, and all important points and messages , are spoken out in the movie, and there are some very emotive scenes. There are also some very cool and unforgettable lines in the movie, like for example: ""You never send a rabbit to kill a fox"" That reminded of the substance and style movies of the 90's had, which were super sharp and memorable punchlines, or jokes.I just can not praise this movies enough.

I will admit it was well budgeted but there was nothing to make me want to see it again nor recommend it to anyone else.

One guy speaks Japanese, and other British accent, another British but trying to hide it...another is a stereotypical black guy (why not cast a black person as a scientist rather than a player?).Than it gets worst. Their accents and languages just don't flow or feel natural. It's more forced than any movie I've seen in a long time. I wish it was just all Japanese actors or all British it just feels all over the place and no one feels like they belong....nothing flows dialogue wise.But it gets even worse...they ruin the famous intro scene. It's completely different. In APany trailer reviews we saw direct scene from the original so that made fans excited..BUT WITH THE MOST FAMOUS SCENE THEY REWRITE IT ENTIRELY and it's just not as strong. Adding the shoot out action doesn't match the intense sniper scene of the originals opening scene.Then gets even worse and we're still talking about casting...Majors sidekick doesn't have cybernetic enhancements like in the original. Hahahah. There are special effects literally everywhere..but her sidekick who barley talks (unlike in the originals) doesn't even have his eye enhancements.That's all I need to know.

I am not entirely sure who was the target audience for this film? The fans of the source material have absolutely annihilated this picture with scathing but well-founded reviews. On the other hand, the uninitiated have discovered the universe of the Hanka corporation and its dubious plans for mankind.
Being a fan of the original film, its sequel, and short forms, my disappointment was justified: terrible casting (besides Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche), simplified plot losing all philosophical subtleties of the original material, the amalgam of shot-for-shot references from the original were a good addition but pointless.
At a time when we get smart science fiction films like Arrival, Interstellar, Inception,... why the filmmakers decided to dumb down the story. Was it for the sake of western audiences? The original concept is unique and asked so many ethical and philosophical questions about cyber technology, religion, self-awareness, how far should technology go and how much should we depend on it. The 2017 version simply heavily signposted these deep meaningful questions and didn't bother capitalizing on them. Wasteful!
The only redeeming aspect of this pointless, white-washing remake is that it makes you desperately want to watch the original material.

The atmosphere, the plot, the characters, the back stories and the OST. Immediately after the movie I downloaded all the anime and saw it all. And guess what? I still like the movie the most. So to say they failed this movie is a complete understatement. I truly believe it's underrated and critiqued to harshly. They did many things and changed a lot of things to appeal to a broader audience and in my opinion it works. As a complete newbie to Ghost in The Shell I found the movie to have a striking balance between all it's elements, enough to keep me invested, curious and wanting more. It's a good film to whet your appetite. Nothing is to confusing, nothing is dumbed down to much or perhaps enough to give you the perfect understanding and intrigue. Overall I thought it was solid and a good introduction for someone who's never seen or heard about Ghost in the Shell.

I think the manga or the animated TV shows that are based on the manga is the best you can read or watch from Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 movie is a great film for its time, I enjoyed it, not a huge fan though. The sequel that came out in 2004 was a bit boring and slow, not bad though, every frame from that film looks great.First things first, the movie's rhythm is very slow. That's not necessarily a problem, but the story is not very interesting and the shots aren't either. The original story from the manga had a completely different plot from the one on this movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the plot now is all about the main character and not about hacking or even technology anymore, it's about the main character making bad choices and finding out who she is. The action is okay sometimes, but they have a dark scene where you have no clue of what's going on. Same problem with many action movies that come out often. And there's really only one good action scene in the film at the beginning.In conclusion, they had a good script and plot and they just turned it into a pretty boring and uninteresting movie.",Ghost in the Shell
510,coolmunky88,"All Shell, No Ghost",5,1 April 2017,"Being a long-time fan for everything that is Ghost in the Shell, does this film do justice towards the franchise? To put it simply....NO. To give the film an honest review, you have to grasp the core concept that is GiTS. Major ideas within the franchise are: How do we define ""life""? How does cyberisation change our sociological and psychological understanding? And what happens to the ""human condition""?. This is just but a few provocative questions that the franchise has asked within the many iterations (OVAs, series and manga). What appeals to die-hard fans of the franchise are the philosophical questions that are asked, and how this is seamlessly blended into a nitty gritty cyberpunk future. This is the essence of Ghost in the Shell. Comparing this to the original film is probably unfair, as the 1995 iteration was filled with monologues and exposition, which you have to watch over and over to fully grasp the complexity of the situation and ideas (but this is what made the film great within its 82 minute run time). Every version of Ghost in the Shell to date has rewritten their own story, creating multiple universes in the process, so forgiving the casting choices (which is not an issue), the main problem with this latest iteration is the plot itself. With notable nods and cherry picked scenes from the original movie, this film lacks a clear cut understanding of what the source material is conceptually, and takes the all too easy film trope of ""Who am I? Am I just a weapon?"" and cliché revenge route. The amalgamation names from the series, and scenes from the original make for a very confusing film that does not feel like it firmly creates a unique or cohesive GiTS universe of its own. Visually pleasing scenes, and credible acting does not quite make up for the empty feeling I had from watching this. It felt all too shallow, trying to please fans, all whilst keeping the plot understandable for the mainstream audience. Excuse the pun, but this was all Shell, and no Ghost. With a few interesting scenes that could have given a deeper level to the film, the plot ignores this and continues back to clichés. With this all being said, it is not the worst live action film adaptation from the huge abundance of anime/manga sources, but it certainly did not fulfil the basic fundamentals of what makes Ghost in the Shell so great. None of the predecessors needed to dive into the origin story of the Major, because a story untold can be just as fulfilling as one that is (glimpse of the Majors past can be seen in a few Stand Alone Complex episodes, but is never the main focus of a whole story arch).There was every freedom for this film to follow the similar footsteps from what came before, but instead it took the all too easy route of making a hollow, over simplified film that aims towards the mass market who may not have had any other experience of its predecessors, which ultimately fails to give a Ghost in the Shell feel.",Ghost in the Shell

This is greatly underrated because it had to stand in the unfair comparison of the anime. I don't believe it is possible to replicate animes so just go and see it for what it is.

In my opinion, this was a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action movie. The overall mood is really dark and gritty, thanks to an exceptional production and costume design. The VFX and CGI was well made, didn't feel as cheap or overdone as we often see in this genre. The score was satisfyingly powerful, kinda reminiscent of Tron: Legacy. I liked the cast, especially some lesser known actors. Scarlett's performance was typical. Good, but nothing out of the ordinary. By far the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. I can't say enough about how exceptionally well shot this was. This movie is such a pleasure to look at. The framing, the camera movement, color grading and the use of light are all top notch. Simply stunning visuals! Yes, this had the potential to be so much more, but I still wouldn't call it a disappointment like some other reviewers have.

515,benjaminmoleb10,I have never been more insulted by a movie in my life,2,31 March 2017,"Big ol spoiler warning for this review, cos there's loads of them.I hated this movie down to my very bones. I went into this movie assuming that i would be getting an original story within the GITS universe. Nope. This movie doesn't seem to have an original thought in it's head. It opens with the shelling sequence and the Major jumping off a building; OK, that's cool, nod to the original then depart, i'm on board. But then there's another scene from the original, and then one from Innocence, and then a plot point from SAC, and what we ended up with was a frankenstinian mishmash of bits and pieces from the rest of the chronology trying to be a coherent movie apparently unaware that all the previous GITS have been slightly separate from all the others. Get ready for some of your favourite, iconic scenes like you wish you'd never seen them before. As bad fan service. The big issue is that the movie simultaneously (SPOILER WARNING!! HOOT HOOT PUT IT ON MUTE) tries to be in all the GITS franchises at once, but also tries to distance itself from them. First she's the Major, but she isn't Motoko, then she is in the end, and Batou has human eyes then he doesn't, then he gets new ones; so is this the same Batou from the original or not? was he a ranger or what? Why is the Major constantly talked up as some incredible, advanced weapon of anti terrorism but also continually beaten up by people with tasers? Why does she walk like a badly programmed AI with faulty navmeshing? Why does she consistently do stupid things that no one with her level of authority would reasonably do? Why are the techs at the Hanko company dress like the Section 9 techs from the first movie? Why is the beagle still a theme when that wasn't actually relevant in the first place, it was just Oshii liked beagles? Why is Ishikawa coming on a raid? Why is all the game changing stuff that happens to 1995 Motoko happening to a different character? Just kidding, I know that one, It's so we can have a SEQUEL. The movie tries to make new rules in-universe but doesn't stray far enough for me to know which rules still apply from the others.The really depressing part is that if they gave all the characters moustaches and different names and called the movie something like, i dunno, MINDHACKERS or something, then i would have had a lot of fun. It would have been a 7/10 easy. But nope, you just had to take something i love and ruin it. You had to take the ambiguity and deep philosophical roots of the series and push it through the Hollywood filter of 'No dumdum left behind' until you infinitely cheapen the message and mindset of the previous works and hack out the same clichéd movie that's been done a thousand times. Bad guy was just misunderstood? check. CEO of shady corporation was the real bad guy? check. Clearly telegraphed twists? check. Happy ending? big ol check. Badly edited, hard to follow, CUT CUT CUT CUT CUT fight scenes? check. Romance subplot shoehorned in? Didn't have this one. Credit where it's due I suppose.In fairness it wasn't totally awful, for one thing the aesthetic and visual design is excellent; absolutely nailed it, and the music was quite good. I also found myself liking the secondary characters quite a bit more than i thought i would. That's not to say i came in to this with low expectations, i just liked them a lot, which wasn't too hard when they stood next to Scarlett. Now hold on, let me explain, i actually quite like Scarlett as an actress, so I don't know if this is her or just lousy direction but i think at some point in development someone said to her ""your character is a robot"" and she went ""ill just act totally robotic then"" and no one decided to tell her that actually her character has a human brain, so you can still act a bit human, and less like a bad walk cycle in a (frankly dope) bomber jacket.If you've never seen or read or played any other GITS materials then go see it. It's a good looking, fun beat em up movie to kill an arvo. If you enjoy the GITS series, then i cannot recommend. 3/10",Ghost in the Shell
516,akirat-16506,Poor movie and even poorer adaptation/remake,5,31 January 2018,"As a movie this is just average at best. As adaptation/remake of the 1995 film classic Ghost in the Shell it's incredibly bad. This movie is more of a remake of Robocop than Ghost in the Shell because the story is manly about the main character contemplating who she is or was, essentially origin story with revenge.It's like writer and director of this movie were given a buzz real of the original films and TV series and just yelled out lets do that. There are lots of nods/Easter eggs to the original films and TV series but the film lacks any understating of plots in them. The only thing this movie really uses from the original films and TV series are character names, scenes (re-mixed, remade, and out of context) and surprising one musical track from the original film. 
 
The movie is slow... pacing is bogged down by many scenes of exposition. The environment and state of technology in film is more in line with game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This because cybernetics are still new and society is still on the edge of excepting it, unlike original Ghost in the Shell where cybernetics and full body replacements have been a way of life for decades. The film pounds down that the main character is the first of her kind but in the original was one of many.There is so much this movie does wrong then right lets just sum it up:The visuals are not bad but are jarring at times where CG and real sets and people collide. Its not at a level where I would say you could just watch this to just look and the effects.

518,xardos,Bad cinematography made an original Sci-Fi legend turned amateur,6,1 April 2017,"As the 1995 ghost in the shell anime was successful due to the concepts of technologies, the producer should prepare more about the adaptation of the anime. Whether about the martial art side, transitions from Japanese language and cultures, and also story line. I will not discuss the story. But it was just a waste a veteran actor (scarlet) wad not utilized as good as what she did as the black widow. This kind of movie should offer more bangs and booms and fights rather than forced unimportant stories or unimportant scenes.In this era of advanced cinematography community, a successful 1995 movie becomes an ordinary movie in 2017.If i was the director, i will convert all into the English, new environment but still the same adapted characters and the same concepts regardless what people will say.

520,peteroravecz-99823,"Fun, light version premake",7,10 July 2017,"I've been somewhat of a fan of the franchise, first seeing scenes from the original anime in a music video, then seeing it at a friend's place, then watching the GitS: SAC series when they came out, I've even played with the game on the PS1 - well that could have been left out. I haven't seen Arise yet.I've been waiting for this title to come out, I've also been satisfied with the choice of Scarlett Johansson for the lead, I usually like her movie performances, but they are a bit light.That is also the case here, she was nowhere close to the original badassery of the anime, she simply does not possess the physical weight and strength to pull off those moves.So, I've sat down to watch the movie, and for some time I could not decide whether this was a prequel or a remake (or another parallel universe, as with SAC), as the character was very inexperienced, but the major plot points and visual elements were there - turned out to be a bit of both. I am OK with this, but I would have favored a live action remake.The visuals, the sounds and music, the casting of characters and the atmosphere is very authentic (though faster in pace), cgi is sometimes a bit cheap, especially in contrast with the anime.The story is a bit simplified from the original, but fun, and interesting with lots of well handled action.In all, it is a fun, light action movie in a sci-fi setting, that is overshadowed by the original.",Ghost in the Shell
521,radelite,Good but not great,5,3 September 2018,"Last year when I first seen this I probably would have given it a 7 but Ive started watching the actual ghost in the shell anime and they are just so much better. I feel like hollywood kinda diluted it to appease new fans but in doing so the kinda leftout fans of the actual ghost in the shell. Kinda like what they did with star wars just on a smaller scale. Hollywood listen up once you dilute these stories that fans have loved for years you can only make a quick buck before it loses its credibility and just fades off into the thousands of other movies that will probably never be watched twice. When a movie is good you could watch it hundreds of times and still be amazed. This however is an ok movie that you will probably watch once and then leave it to collect dust on the shelf as it should. More- Btw the reason video game movies, this movie, and the star wars flop havent worked these past few years is because hollyweird does not respect the original content. They take original content, flip off the original fans and creators and take it in a totally different direction thinking they know better and then wonder why it dies so quickly when its lost all thats made it what it was.",Ghost in the Shell

523,J-Star,Works great as a prequel to the original movie,9,10 April 2017,"While fans of the 1995 film will recognize scenes that have been lifted near verbatim from the original, this is not a rehash of that story. Instead this iteration of Ghost In The Shell can be seen as a prequel; an origins story that chronologically sits before the anime. It fills the gap between the time when the protagonist was just a plain girl and the time when they have become the slightly detached, mature and hard-boiled Major Kusanagi.And with this, the film works really well. Long-time fans get to know the background of familiar characters such as the Major and Batou (including how he got his eyes) without mulling too much over the already familiar philosophical questions. And newcomers into the Ghost In The Shell universe get an exciting ride and a more easy-to-digest introduction compared than the heavy mind-jobs that are the previous ones. As such it works well for both camps.The visuals are excellently crafted, retaining the mood of a high- tech future, where human and machine are becoming blended into one, along with the grit and grime that have become a hallmark of franchise. The environs are completely credible as an image of the future, the characters are believable, and the action is amazing without being needlessly outdrawn or becoming cheesy.The only thing that prevents me from giving this film a full 10 is that they lifted one too many scenes from the original, in an attempt to appease the fans. Had they gone fully with making this an origins story, I would have been happy. But that small flaw is easily overlooked. Be kind and see this as a prequel and as live-action's first tentative outing into the Ghost In The Shell universe, and you will not be disappointed. I recommend both fans and beginners to see this film.",Ghost in the Shell

Unfortunately the only times this movie entertains is when they are copying the best action parts of the original or TV series that came after.

Many of the critics on here act like the 1995 original is perfect and god-like compared to this version, but just watching that one, I was surprised at how unrealistic the dialog is in that one, like a political propaganda film.Interestingly, people are criticizing the 2017 version for being too sexual, but the original makes her body almost indistinguishable from a human's body, whereas the 2017 version makes it fairly obvious that the body is not human.The 2017 film is not perfect, of course - the story lacks the depth of sci fi films that are more cerebral and drama based, rather than action based, but the story is nicely complex and the ending is not predictable. It is not the original, but there's no law that says it has to be.",Ghost in the Shell
532,clonaris,Classic Science Fiction for philosophers.,10,9 June 2017,"I had attempted to view the original animation but could not. I am a science fiction fan and was very pleased with this movie. I began writing some of the quotes from the movie for example;1) we cling to memories as if that's what defines us.2) when we see our uniqueness as a virtue only then will we find peace. 3) what we do is what defines us.As a movie it has the right tempo. It does not stall. Action sequences are well directed and paced.The computer graphics blend realistically with the live footage. The main character the major, played by Scarlet Johansson, is slowly brought to life in two ways . Her first birth is the melding of the brain and the machine. The second and more interesting birth, is that of her memory. As this memory is awakened we see the fleshing out of the character and the development of the story. This is what makes a good movie for me. The cinematography is also excellent so I am putting it in the 10 class.I am glad I did not see the first movie. I am also glad that the Japanese actor ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano spoke in his native Japanese language and not in a bad English accent. In the movie you will see why this is possible. This movie is full of science and full of little stories within it.I am tempted to seek out the original 1995 animation of the same title.The Japanese writers of science fiction seem to be making the most interesting stories concerning humans and machines. The writer of the story, Masanori Ota or Shirow Masamune as he is known now should be commended on this interesting piece of science fiction.

For a film about the existence of a soul, this film has none.And I won't even get started on the blatant whitewashing. The controversy is justified. No attempt was made to give it a Japanese aesthetic.

535,nenetrader,Ghost Runner,9,5 April 2017,"Reading earlier reviews, I am relieved I have never seen the original Manga version. It means I can come at Ghost in the Shell without preconception or expectation. I can see many cinematic influences, and accept that the greatest influence of all will have been the original, but it is not there in my memory to colour my impressions of the film I saw tonight.Cinematographically we are in Blade Runner territory, the near-future dystopian cityscape created by Ridley Scott by way of William Gibson, a neon-lit eternal night of wet streets, flashing kanji logos, littered alleys and animated ads. There is even an ad for the long- defunct Pan-Am, a direct nod to Blade Runner. That said, Jess Hall has done a magnificent job in creating a brooding and entirely plausible world, CGI holograms producing a gritty, disconcerting surrealism, a trippy might-be of militarised urban evolution.The story is told in linear sequence. In a culture where the cybernetic enhancement of humans is routine, we are taken through an opening lab scene that gives the technology its acme, 'Major', the cyborg played by Scarlett Johansson, a human brain implanted in an entirely robot body. And as sinister Hanka Robots boss Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) makes clear to Major's principal creatrix, Dr Oelet (Juliette Binoche), she is a weapon, no more. An investment that is expected to provide a return and victory in a war being fought in boardrooms, Yakuza bars and the bitter night streets of the Lawless Zone.'Cyber-terrorists' are waging war on Hanka Robots. In a stunning early action scene that sets a high standard, hacked geisha-bots go rogue during a meeting between Hanka representatives and the visiting diplomats of an African nation, murdering the ambassador (Chris Obi). Major and her squad of 'Section 9' special forces intervene.Major 'deep dives' into the central processing unit of one of the geisha-bots in an attempt to discover the hacker who turned it. She nearly comes to grief in the nightmarish, Jungian underworld of the AI's subconscious, a dark hell of shifting imagery and viral programs, but comes out with the necessary intel.The pursuit is on. Major and the rest of Section 9, a kind of heavily-armed, cyber-savvy SWAT team who seem to communicate telepathically, go after the hacker-terrorists she has identified and located. And so the story proceeds. The pace is relentless, the action explosive. I won't go into more detail for fear of spoilers. But as Major closes in on her quarry, she starts to question her origins and her identity. She sees visions of a girl being dragged from a burning hut by black-clad police. Her hazy, incomplete memory tells her she was a victim of terrorism before her transformation into a cyborg, her parents killed, but is it true? In sci-fi terms we are on familiar ground, charted by Philip K Dick: if androids dream of electric sheep, do cyborgs dream of a humanity they have lost? Major finds herself in the philosophical grey area between her perceived reality and what might be a computer-implanted false memory designed to create and motivate a corporate killing machine. Does she -- her soul, her eponymous 'ghost' -- remain truly human, or human-cyborg, or something new and different that represents an evolutionary advance? Director Rupert Sanders does not shy away from these deep questions while continuing to serve up a dramatic, visually electrifying and attention-holding story. The special effects are entirely convincing. The music (from Lorne Balfe and Clint Mansell) drives like a train.Johannson's performance holds centre stage by necessity and definition. This is not a glamorous role. She plays a hard and determined robot killer. Even the flesh-coloured, skin-tight latex body suit she wears for several scenes (squint and you can pretend she's naked) belongs in context, more functional than sexual. But she brings to the role a subtle, wondering vulnerability beneath the steely professionalism of the assassin, an emerging humanity that blossoms by the film's resolution. There were objections to a Caucasian playing a 'Japanese' character, but they don't make sense to me. Major is anethnic, a cyborg, her robot body manufactured in a lab. How could she be any race? Now I will be off to investigate the original version of Ghost in the Shell. I will try not to judge the original by the standards of the remake. I am glad to have been able to judge the remake on its own merits, and they are considerable. I recommend you see this film.",Ghost in the Shell

Honestly, I never thought the 1995 movie was that great. So I'm happy this live action version was not 100% faithful to that movie. I haven't read the manga, so I can't comment on how faithful it is to that. And I don't really care, since I enjoyed this movie so much. If I have only one complaint about this movie, it's that they explained what ghost in the shell means at the very beginning. That was an unnecessary way to use the exposition to make the rest of the movie less confusing. IMO, it wouldn't have been confusing anyway, so they could have left that on the cutting room floor.Beyond that, though, the visuals are stunning. With one exception, the action scenes are very engaging (the one exception being the dark action scene where you can't really see what's going on, but that was brief). The casting is perfect. Yes, I would have preferred a Japanese actress for Major, but I can fully understand why they chose Scarlett Johansson. She's gorgeous and has the box office draw.

I won't lie to you and tell you this film is on par with something like The Matrix (the original was) but it is well worth seeing and stands out as unique. We all know that's nearly impossible to do these days. Please take this into consideration and go to see the film with no expectations. You'll be surprised that way.READ: (For those who HAVE seen the original films)I'm sorry this film wasn't everything we dreamed it would be, but can we honestly act surprised when Hollywood screenwriters avoid immensely complex story arches? They have simplified this story for the masses in the same way The Lord of the Rings was simplified for the masses. If you spend your time comparing this film with the originals you will come up short, every time. This is NOT the original film, this is its own film that you need to appreciate as it stands (I know that is difficult, believe me). If you haven't already seen it, please take my word for it and go in with no expectations, go in cold (like it is a new experience). (Final Comments)I take user reviews to heart for movies. I appreciate the opinions of the people more than I appreciate the opinions of the paid critics. Seeing a 6.9 as the current user score (as of March 31st) is unfortunate, because this film captures EVERYTHING that Ghost in the Shell was and thanks to this film IS CURRENTLY. As a film it stands strong in the Sci-Fi genre and does manage to still be thought-provoking. Please consider taking your time before giving it a low rating. Understand that the talents that put this film together adopted this baby from its original developers and they did NOT destroy it, as some over-exaggerators may proclaim. ""The Last Airbender"" - THAT is an example of something being destroyed. GHOST IN THE SHELL stands still intact. Of course it isn't as fleshed out and philosophical as the original film (which paid an immaculate amount of attention to detail and information) but it DOES live in the same world and it DOES tell the same story. I promise you that if it HAD stayed completely with the script of the animated film, it would be getting attacked for being an unnecessary remake or overly complicated.I've given this an 8 out of 10 because I see 6 as mediocre and 10 as a perfect film. 8 is somewhere in between. I do not believe this is the best adaption or sci-fi film I've seen, but it was enjoyable and much pain-staking work was put into it... that shows when you watch it. Don't be entirely emotional about the way you view this movie. Watch it for what it is, not what it is in comparison.Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.

545,codythrowsrocks,A step in the right direction,6,29 July 2017,I wasn't expecting much from an anime to high budget silver screen adaption upon my first viewing of GITS. I've been watching the original anime for years off and on so my expectations were not exactly sky high. I can say that the visuals are really impressive although it does seem a little too clean and lacks an organic feel to the world. Most action scenes were impressive which for the most part were easy to follow and pretty cool/entertaining. There is a lot of fan service pulled directly from the anime and Rupert Sander's (director) pretty much nails it in almost every way.My biggest complaint with the film is its an extremely watered down version from the original narrative to cater to a wider audience. There's is a lot of external conflict with the character of The Major instead of personal battle from within. She does struggle with her inner growth as a character but its a far cry from the original anime. There is a lot that's changed with this adaptation so much in fact that it comes out to be a very average run of the mill action film but it's still a decent movie. It's also a step in the direction for adaptations and I hope that future directors take this movie into consideration when future ideas come up for similar attempts.,Ghost in the Shell

What we get is very bad acting located in an extremely cluttered yet visual interesting CGI landscape. In this prequel/origin story, a girl was a runaway teen who was kidnapped by the ""stock villain"" evil Corporation, had her brain removed, wiped clean, and implanted into a cyber-body. Low and behold, only a year later, she is a ""Major"" and the leader of Section 9 crime squad. It is perhaps the quickest rise in rank in military history? Absurd and Absurdity continues because the ""rebel terrorist"" was also a teen runaway whose brain was also stolen. and in what amounts to the closest thing to ""romance"" , CyberFrankenstein and the girl ""knew"" each other as teenagers!! PUKE! Finally, the Girl has to track down her mother and remember why she was so miserable in the first place that she needed to run away and live in the ""outlaw"" zone.

555,aa-ron-1,"Poor script, decent adjusted story and visually stunning.",7,3 April 2017,"I think this is a solid 6.5, so I'll round it up to 7, I believe most of the harsh critics come from the angle of being worried about rating it favourably due to the manufactured outrage (more on this to be addressed later under the spoiler section). The movie is visually stunning, with many iconic scenes and technologies being portrayed almost scene for scene without being a direct copy due to the story adjustment, if you are a fan of anything Cyberpunk, this is pretty much the closest thing to looking like Neuromancer's world on a big screen with today's effects. The main critique I'd have would be for its less than subtle script, the dialogues are at times cringe worthy, and at other times redundant, where the writers felt the need to spell things out directly to the audience when everything is obvious from context.That said, I enjoyed it thoroughly, it was well paced with amazing visual effects, locations and props. The casting was better than I'd expected, the story was decent, and I would fight the urge to let professional critics sway us from seeing this movie over some melodrama.*SPOILERS BELOW*As an East Asian living in the West, my main initial skepticism of the Scarlett Johansson casting upon viewing the trailers wasn't the fact that she is white, the same way I didn't worry about Attack on Titan sucking because everyone was yellow, but instead it was the impression that she may have shown too much femininity / emotion in the trailer clips, something Motoko was anything but, she is also growing as a female action star with her success in the Avenger series and Lucy, leading me to worry that this would become a mindless action movie. The result however, had proved I'd worry too much, while not as philosophical on existential topics as the 1995 movie, it certainly was not dumbed down to a pure mindless action flick, the story adjustment and the ""origin stories"" are also welcomed in my opinion especially for the masses who may not have seen the original, whether if it's how she became the first fully integrated brain in an android cyborg, or Batou's eyes. The race change was clearly acknowledged in the story, and in my opinion, necessary, to enforce the story that her identity was forcibly taken away from her and erased. Whether she had been put inside a white body, or a black body, the change in race actually is more impactful than if it were the same race, remember how thought provoking it was when Motoko got put in the body of a little girl in the 1995 movie, or when she basically didn't need a physical body anymore? I walked out of the cinema having seen it with 5 Asian friends, some from Hong Kong who welcomed the portrayal of their city in this ultra cyberpunk world, some from Japan who thought Scarlett Johannson did a good job, none of us were offended to the slightest, I wish people would stop using minorities as a means to make a living by either being professionally outraged on behalf of us, or purposefully inflame an issue, when there is nothing to be outraged about.",Ghost in the Shell
556,oZo61,A love letter to Motoko (spoilers),7,13 July 2017,"I wasn't exposed to the anime GitS when it came out. I had heard of it but that was all. I watched this movie after hearing all the cries of ""whitewashing"" because of Scarlett Johanssen being cast in the lead. After I had finished, I went and watched the anime movie from 1995. I was amazed at the reaction people had had. It was very close to the source material. It had some scenes identical, in fact. But what got me the most was the main character, 'Major', didn't really look all that Asian. Like a lot of anime characters she was kind of Asian, but not really. To the film, I thought it was fine. After viewing the original I feel the new film is more of an homage, or a love letter if you will, to the source material. The purist in any genre will always find something to pick apart when this sort of adaptation is made, and I get it. We like what we like, and we like it pure. But Scarlett got a bad rap in the role, as I felt she did fine. Some have said that the CGI is overdone, and detracts from the story. But if you look around you and see how modern advertising and multimedia are so 'in your face' already, it's not hard to imagine that a future city might well look as it does in the film. Michael Pitt's character was interesting, and he played it well. I would recommend it, but maybe not to an hardcore anime fan.",Ghost in the Shell

To the point where, apparently, they have to say soul constantly to make sure ppl aren't to dumb to follow, what ghost means. Why not just rename the movie ""soul in the robotic body"" First - setting - japan is not supposed to look like a bad ripoff of blade runner. Yeas like lots of anime it has different cars but the city looks like cities pretty much look today.Second - ""Major"" - Worst casting, what were they thinking? She looks, acts, walks, moves, all wrong. She is supposed to be a very ""hard ass"" who is tougher than pretty much anyone, says little and is very cryptic and closed. Pretty sure ""Major"" would refer to her military rank, or something similar, not some random thing she got after one year.Third - story - the story has nothing to do with any of the GITS stories. it just takes a bunch of pieces from different movies shows, strip them of any meaning, and put them together in a way that losses everything the originals were. and the depth and complexity of the animation story lines.Fourth - the casting all around seems terrible, maybe the director was just that bad. But none of the actors seem like the character they are portraying, or supposed to be portraying.Fifth - god what's left? They stripped the story line, picked the wrong cast, the dialogue is terrible, it's a massive train wreck.IF you want to see something that is actually done well go watch the first ghost in the shell movie and forget about this crap, they are not even in the same ball park.

563,KeroScee,"Good on it's own merits, but lacks any sense of subtly",6,16 April 2017,"The original 'Ghost in the Shell' was a hallmark gem of which has been the base for many 'near future' movies to copy, borrow and steal from for the past 20 plus years. It's difficult to write a review without making a comparison, but avoiding the parallels is not made easy when this live action fails in achieving the nuances that the original material essentially invented.It's a true shame. Set and costume design is top notch, a very capable cast demonstrate talent and exceptional emotional depth in the few moments they can. But again, and again, the childishly written, overly simplistic script and over-reliance of cheap linear VFX sequences ruin all the good work in other avenues. The story moves in a predictable fashion, with much of the plot movement spontaneously directed by characters suddenly 'knowing' vital locations and details without any adequate visual or audible explanation. 'GITS' fans may notice how the pacing links with on screen events easily, but newcomers will be a little at odds as to how 'hacking' works in the future when there are no sequences that show it off. A likely result of poor scripting, editing and a refusal to add coherent infodumps or 'so you know' scenes.This poor scripting shows, conversations are extremely one dimensional. Intentions are plain to see and many sequences occur with very little justification or thought. The whole film reeks of studio meddling and too many script writers. The interactions between Major (Scarlett Johansson) and Batou (Pilou Asbæk )are arguably the best parts of the movie, which makes them feel like they're written by someone else. Likewise much of the themes that 'GITS' relied on are nigh non-existent. The notion of constructed identities and hacked memories are left in wasteland as poorly thought out corporate conspiracies take centre stage. The whole thing feels very much like the recent Robocop remake; poorly handled.Overall Ghost in the Shell is worth seeing if only for the set design and effects. The on screen chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Pilou Asbæk is worth studying on how to show inferred love. Everything else? Forget about it.6/10",Ghost in the Shell

Please save yourself 100 minutes of disappointment and either read the manga if you want the original story, or watch Stand Alone Complex (the TV series) if you want to see how a movie conversion of this material should have been done. There is already enough controversy about ""whitewashing"" etc. in the movie, but the truth is its biggest sin is that they threw out an iconic, original story with compelling characters and replaced it all with generic Hollywood trash.

An upgrade?..yes an upgrade. As I said before, I love the Anime version but it is a little heavy to watch for most viewers because it gets messy and boring, that's what this new version is not, it is more common viewer friendly and less philosophical type of fan.Yes, the movie keeps the questioning about humanity and soul (or Ghost), and all those things that makes Ghost in the Shell, well... Ghost in the Shell, but also takes us for a much more fun ride, easy to understand and easy to enjoy, than the original movie did.Hardcore Fans would say the movie is too much light or even empty but I think that it is a great adaptation, they took a great animated movie and make it into a great live action movie.",Ghost in the Shell

569,aripyanfar,A worthy variation on The Ghost in the Shell by Masamune Shirow,10,8 September 2017,"The original manga is an outstanding graphic novel. This is a worthy variation of that high standard story. I considered taking off one star just for the script of the last voice-over. I don't think the philosophy of the story boils down to so simple idea of what defines humanity. However, since such a range of ideas about what makes a human human, and what the division of human and machine is came up in the movie already, I didn't think I could penalize it a whole star. At its best the movie captures the grandeur of Shirow's visual compositions. It also retains in variation some of the most iconic action sequences, which is extremely satisfying. After all, in so many ways this is an action movie. The comedic interludes are ditched, but that's fair enough for the story telling space of one movie. The drama and tension remain high. The soft-core porn treatment of the Major's body is kept, and this is neither accidental or unnecessary. The choice of a body that is easy to sexually objectify is critical in a story that is examining the boundaries between subjects and objects. The boundaries between conscious and non-conscious entities. The boundaries of consent and non consent when the subject does not know what they are consenting to. The boundaries between medical-procedures-to-save sentients and machine-upgrades for owned objects. The antagonist and the progress of the plot is changed considerably. It could have been a disaster, and no doubt some fans of the existent story will consider it a disaster. However, I think the producers absolutely kept the most important part of the story intact. That is the philosophical musings of the story. Where the story fails as a pure action movie, it does because its climax is bent on throwing out at least two dozen philosophical questions, instead of two dozen explosions. If you don't go through at least a mini existential crisis after having ideas in the movie bubble back up in your mind, then that's perhaps because you don't have the same time to stop and absorb the ramifications of ideas in the movie the way you get to pause over the written story. The written story also had the luxury of sinking into the idea of the evolution of consciousness in the way that the movie doesn't and couldn't, without pausing the action and having a 30 minute dialogue. The script of this movie gives a great shot at throwing Shirow's questions into audience minds without pausing the action, and by delivering them through a changed plot that is perhaps more easy to relate to than the disembodied character(s) of the original.I was extremely happy with this GITS variation.",Ghost in the Shell

572,tallmike-22-826360,Better than the anime?!?!?!,9,23 July 2017,"Dare I say it? I know you are either supposed to hate this movie because it was not cookie cut from the anime, or you have to hate it because you want another X-men McDonalds version of a movie. I would hate to spoil the plot with this review but; ***spoiler alert*** Being someone who saw the anime so many years back this movie just made way more sense to me than the animated version. The movie did a great job of patching the plot holes, but I still loved the anime. In the anime the major was a prosthetic human, she would drone on about it, but it had no real tie to the plot. Eventually, for no good reason, in the anime she decided to go rogue and merge with a random criminal AI. The AI in the anime had a weak back story, another section created it and it escaped. Eventually they merge, run away (her for no good apparent reason) and do nothing significant with their merger. The live action movie made all these acts more justified, and she goes rogue only after uncovering a major business/government scandal. In the anime she simply went AWOL, and I even asked my brother if her reasons for doing so bring into question her professionalism as a soldier/police special ops. The merger of the two in the movie made a lot more sense as well, who would merge with a random rogue computer AI?! The movie tied in these holes rather well, and I think they redid the plot just right. The one thing I was a bit disappointed about the live action series was the fact that they left out a lot of the pivotal supporting characters like Togusa and Saito, who when lined up had the full gamut of completely non synthetic (Togusa) to full synthetic (the major) and every variation in between. The full team also had a completely diversified experience from super cop (togusa) to super soldier (batou). Saito only had one tiny scene, kind of a disappointment for the coolest character. Other than that they did a good job converting the movie from the anime.The movie stirred a lot of controversy for no good apparent reason. The whole white wash thing with scarlet made little sense to me, as in the anime a lot of the section 9 personnel were Caucasian, including the major. I don't know how they could have fixed this loop and still pleased the fanboys and SJW at the same time, but in my opinion the fact that it angered a lot of easily triggered nobodies was a bonus. I really think that loophole in the anime, which was no big deal in 90s just could not stand the test of contemporary political correctness. The same people who criticized this movie for whitewashing are also currently criticizing Dunkirk, a battle between the British and Germans in WW2, for being whitewashed as well, so I am surprised they were able to make a dent with this movie.The real criticism I do have of this movie though, and the reason I think it bombed, was because it was too little too late. When the anime came out in 1995 (originally started in the 80s!) it was a story about a cyberpunk future where humanity is at the cusp of merging with technology. All technologies explored in the anime series were mind blowing at the time; full internet connection to everything, car, phone, mind, people able to hack all of the above, sniper shots targeted via satellite, comms with everyone and everything all the time, advanced prosthetics that could replace all but the brain. 20-30+ years ago all the technologies and negative effects of them were hard to imagine, and with graphics the way they were live action would have looked horrible at best. Now that technology has caught up where this world doesn't look so bad in a live action film, unfortunately it also means all the technology in the original series is everywhere in our lives as well, and I think that is what really took away a lot of the magic in the film. All the tech in this film is easily imagined 5-20 years from now. When the series came out in the beginning of the information age it was aligned with other science fiction dystopias like the terminator (machine exterminate man) and the matrix (machine enslaves man). The director and original series even inspired and influenced the latter. Now as man is currently merging with machine, just judging by how people are glued to their cell phones, the genre is a bit dated. Fortunately for us though ghost in the shell reality seems more realistic than the other two, but I think since we are closer to that reality it takes a lot of the fascination away. That is why I cannot give it a full blown 10 stars. This would have been a smash hit 10 to 15 years go. However, this is a great action movie, beautiful and captivating action scenes, and the story is better refined in my opinion than the original series. It is definitely worth your time and in my opinion will no doubt become a cult hit.",Ghost in the Shell

The visuals look spectacular but this is not just about eye candy. The movie has a lot of substance as well. Story is great. I won't spoil anything but it revolves around a character named Major, performed by Scarlet Johanson. As usual she delivers just like how she always does, both in acting and action department. Other characters are likable as well, and at no point I felt that some character in the movie didn't serve his or her purpose. All of them were awesome, none of them were annoying or boring. The movie has great action scenes as well. They are fun to look at. But at the same time, this movie isn't about mindless action only because as I mentioned above, the story is pretty good at the same time. Soundtracks are brilliant and make the movie even better. Clint Mansell, the man behind The Fountain movie was involved and as soon as I read his name during opening moments of the movie, I knew the movie will have great soundtracks. These soundtracks have dark and futuristic feel to them. It reminds me of Deus Ex games. Overall, the movie is excellent and I'll definitely watch it again, once I have the blue ray version.

It's been years since I've seen the anime original, so I cannot comment on the two films side-by-side, but I'd say this version still asks questions of what it is to be human. Is it memory? It isn't what is explicitly said in the film sometimes. It's what is implied – so the plot isn't as 'spelled out' as critics might imply. When Motoko visits her Mum – there is a part of her that is stirred yet this stirring cannot be from memory because her memories (the implanted ones) were false. And yes, she was given the door number as a key to her past – but that was it. Somehow, we too feel her stirrings towards her ancestral home. And her Mum – what a beautiful and stirring performance! Her Mum sees her – looks into her eyes – and just 'knows' this is her daughter returned to her. It's a beautiful moment that tells us that the soul will transcend any shell given to it; that the soul will reveal itself in the end. I'd seen the original years ago. I expected to be engaged visually but I never thought I could be emotionally moved by this film, but I was blown away by the whole thing. I'd viewed this in 3D and I was utterly spellbound by the visuals. Stunning. I hope to see this again at the cinema soon – there aren't many films that stand a second viewing. I found there was a subtext below the gung-ho, Hollywood movie. It's a glorious mix of the usual Hollywood bravado and questions about what it is to be human. b): Scarlet Johannson as Motoko: She is.

Movies are meant to be experienced, not overly analyzed at the expense of fun.With the slew of, honestly, disgustingly bad films recently and to come, that have zero acting talent, poor script writing and plot as thin as the air of deep space, while still enjoying a massive Hollywood budget, I'd say give this a try.This movie makes me believe that Hollywood isn't utter junk yet.GitS is good.",Ghost in the Shell
584,pranther,It wasn't too bad,7,6 May 2017,"If you are a dedicated fan of the anime or the manga, understand that this movie is very different from that, the plot itself was pivoted away from the deeply philosophical analysis of the anime. There are plenty of new characters and additional background character modifications added that would make a lot of the anime purists cringe. Instead, the plot took a more traditional protagonist versus antagonist approach. However, if you think of the movie objectively, the plot is reasonable, the character development is good, the character's relationships between each other have also been maintained. Scarlett Johansson captures the essence of Major's personality incredibly well. The cinematography is also very good, with vibrant and LSD-hallucination-esque visuals and awesome choreography. All in all, its short-fall lay mainly in the fact that it very quickly became a generic action film which fell below the standard of the anime.",Ghost in the Shell

Let me admit it, that I haven't seen the original anime and I am not a fan of cyberpunk anime. That's why it took while to watch this film. Let's start from Visual. CGI looks almost perfect (Only a few moments were destructively bad) Visual/Special effects are stunning. Scenes of fighting and shootout scenes are just breathtaking (heard that Scarlett was pregnant and it makes more beautiful and memorable scenes with her involving). Coming to plot. To cut long story short, I would say that story isn't engaging, the dialogue is bad and poorly delivered. Soundtrack and acting was nice. Scarlett is excellent in her role, of course, and Takeshi Kitano also stands out. However, soundtrack and acting cannot improve plot. One of the pathos moments I liked: ""Never send a rabbit to kill a fox"" by Takeshi Kitano.If you would like to watch about philosophy line between human and machine, advancement in technology which allow humans to enhance, then WEST WORLD is the perfect choice. 6.5 out of 10.",Ghost in the Shell

Is this as good as the original? No, but for a live action remake it's faithful, or as faithful as it could of ever been. The visuals are commendable the acting is fine not amazing but good enough. The story is abit different and dumbed down abit to draw in new people aswell as fans but still good enough. The action is great and the soundtrack as far as I'm concerned is better then the original. You can see they really tried with this and it's a shame it didn't make any money.For people who haven't seen this movie please check it out, don't always listen to critics cause I did and missed out on what would of been a great cinema experience.

Sure the script is toned down compared to the actual anime but who wants to see the actual anime in two hours? Is it even possible? It's a complex anime and it's theme is not very commercial.

593,grayfox777,Ghost in the Shell falls short but was enjoyable never the less.,8,6 August 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is a live adaptation of the highly successful anime film of the same name by Mamoru Oshii which is also based on the manga by Masamune Shirow. The Ghost in the Shell franchise has spawned several sequels and series and is considered the quintessential cyberpunk science fiction story. So how does it stand up to the original? In short, not really. Scarlett Johansson plays the cybernetically augmented Major, a member of an anti-terrorist unit Section 9 in the hunt for the extremely proficient hacker known as Kuze. Funny walk aside I think she did a decent job of portraying the Major. It was by no means an easy task. Michael Pitt was OK as the disturbing Kuze, he seems to be good at these roles. The other casting was nothing special and the acting wasn't anything to brag about. The cinematography on the other hand was gorgeous. Almost every shot shined with the futuristic cyberpunk aesthetics, from the holograms adverts that swim through the city to the debilitated outskirts. The CGI and music were also topnotch and added to the cyberpunk atmosphere. This was without doubt a treat for the eyes and ears. Unfortunately the plot didn't explore the existential themes that was so well executed in the original film. They opted out for a more simplistic sentimental plot about Major's origins which worked in enough ways to carry the plot to its end. However this did not take away my enjoyment of the film and most critics in my opinion weren't fair in there critic. In contrast to other critics Ghost in the Shell stands out from the typical Hollywood drivel as a science fiction film worth viewing. My Thoughts on the ""whitewashing"" Despite the outrage for casting Scarlett Johansson as the Major, the fan outcry seemed to have spawned entirely from people outside of Japan. Even Oshii himself liked the casting of her stating: ""The Major is a cyborg and her physical form is an entirely assumed one. The name 'Motoko Kusanagi' and her current body are not her original name and body, so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her. Even if her original body (presuming such a thing existed) were a Japanese one, that would still apply."" Fans and critics have forgotten the very essence of the movie and how the ""Shell"" doesn't matter in comparison to the ""Ghost"" inside it.",Ghost in the Shell
594,bonesnbraids,Beauty Turned Frankenstein by Hollywood,3,18 May 2019,"This is such a weird movie to watch. I think I've see the animated GITS perhaps 50 times. And I owned the manga as well, which I read multiple times.In this movie I see pieces of the original, scenes done exactly like in the GITS anime. And they are nearly perfect, beautifully done. As many other reviewers have stated, the movie is a visual spectacle, but is, as is Hollywood, hollow. The original themes and story disintegrated into a hollow form that reeks of interference by those that never understood the original.It's a bit of a mix visually of The Matrix, Blade Runner, Assassin's Creed (the game), and weirdly, Max Headroom. It's like those in charge of the movie had a lot of great influences, but couldn't be creative enough to develop their own and didn't want to stick to the original GITS imagery for reasons I can't guess.The storyline is pure Hollywood and we've seen it a million times. It totally breaks away from the OG GITS and has a ""bad guy"" who, in his highly altered form is muscular, which is so weird and un-necessary. His voice glitches like Max Headroom, and he has to explain his whole ""thing"" to the audience, giving us a narrative instead of building a story that brings us to the internal struggle of The Major and the human condition or ""ghost's"" need to explore, evolve, become stronger in ways that seem dangerous or illogical to some. Evolution, indeed, is a critical piece of the story that is simply washed away.Add onto that the standard stagnant seen and heard in any other action movie one-liners and the multitude of advertisements with little to no character development and, you get a ho-hum 4 star rated overproduced underwritten predictable story with a lot of paint (visual effects) to cover up that fact and hope the shiny object will keep you from noticing.I'm personally tired of it. Of all the focus on gun fights, drugs, and fighting in general while dumbing down one of the most important stories told, a story with real-world, right-now consequences voiced by some of the most powerful in the world (Elon Musk) when it comes to AI, humans, and what kind of future to expect.As an adaptation of the OG GITS anime, it gets a 1 or 2 for trying and succeeding in the visual through some scenes (just an homage to the original) that are nearly frame-for-frame exact. But the most important part, the story, is gone. Stick to the anime or manga. Watch and read it several times. And remember that it predated the Matrix and perhaps even inspired it. It's brilliant and should have been given a more serious live-action representation. The actors all did their job. As did the visual effects artists. The writers and producers failed miserably on this one. As a stand-alone movie, ignoring the original material, it's a solid 5. Worth a watch if you like sci-fi movies.",Ghost in the Shell

However they massacred the story, dumbed it down to a level that is not engaging but understandable so the average or slightly bellow average person will ""get it"" and consume the product with little to no questions.
The origin story in the (live action) movie for Kusanagi was probably the most stupid and lame choice, completely loosing the spirit of the original and making it on the same cheap story level, much like 95% of current TV series running on most known services.I view this as a fan remake of the original source.I think you did enough Hollywood.

How did they manage not re-capturing that intense undercurrent of that scene?And then there are the new parts they added to the move, such as the one-dimensionally cruel financial sponsor to the project, a character stolen from the TV shows my 5 year olds watch.

606,more-13,A failed movie (remake issues taken aside) (spoilers),4,29 August 2017,"First things first : the main critics were against the story and casting : I'm totally okay with these. I don't see any problem in altering the story to better fit the destination product : it's an adaptation, not a frame by frame remake. I don't care about the occidentalized cast : it's supposed to be a big budget movie targeting an international audience, it's logical to have international popular actors. And anyway the sci-fi context permits such ethnic variety.The problem is the movie itself : it's just a bad movie. For many reasons. I will treat it as if it was an isolated work, not taking into account all the adaptation issues.THE problem of the movie : ""Show, don't tell"". If there were no introduction text, no voice-over ending, no text overlay on sci-fi stuff, no ""switching to telepathy mode"" line, no masterplan exposition dialogue, no line explaining the emotional subtext of the scene, we would have TOTALLY understood the movie exactly the same. But the production chose to consider their viewers as dumb****s who need explanations (note that the original movies and series don't do it). Best (worst) example : Batou saying ""you're not the same"" ""it's just a robot"" after the Major looks her harmed arm and the geisha robot : this is USELESS, we already totally understood her doubts, her emotional state, just with Johansson's eye acting, we don't need more. Any viewer over 10 would have understood how she feels. This just RUINS the emotional subtlety of the scene, the compassion for the character. And the movie just never stops doing it.Oh wait... actually the worst scene is at the end when the Major and her mother meet at the cemetery : we already know they know. We don't need doubles of fact force-feed.(counter-example : we have no explanation on why the Chief speaks Japanese and the rest of section 9 speaks English and they all understand each other, and we DON'T need one counter-example 2 : we understand that Major and Kuse were probably lovers in their previous lives, we don't need more. This is how it should have been done for the whole movie)Sci-Fi cred : some sci-fi movies have some cheap out-of-tone tongue-in-cheek stylistic or ideological digressions that can go from tolerable to totally illustrating the intentions of the movie. GITS is serious AF, it's solid rock sci-fi : you cannot have any element that looks cheap, misplaced, out-of-tone. And unfortunately this movie has some cheap effects that ruin the immersion for any sci-fi enthusiast, especially all the stuff linked to technology. Best example : the glitch effects when Kuze speaks or when the temple (is it a temple ?) re-emerges from the Major's memories : we already don't have this kind of audio or visual glitches anymore in 2017, why would we have some circa-90s glitches in the future ? oh BTW : this is exactly the kind of stuff that don't age well.The social implications of the future technologies is also failed : we don't feel the dependence, we just see it through hit men, hackers, police and yakuzas, but we have no idea how it impacts everyday life.Writing : The stakes are low : the plot revolves around a bad guy's personal masterplan, when it should have been about a struggle against a huge militaro-industrial machine. We never feel the paradigm change that the Major represents on a big scale. The writing is focused on individuals but we never feel the threat that the technology behind the Major's reconstruction represents if it is in the wrong hands. You cannot bypass politic subjects in a movie like this.Huge writing error : The Chief, mandated by the Prime Minister to stop Cutter kills him as an act of revenge, after he's been unarmed. First it's cliché (revenge for justice is a morally wrong choice but still valid in a movie). But it's technically a writing error : since the bad guy is not a threat anymore it's murder (the Chief could have arrested Cutter), they are on the grid, so they openly kill him, which means they go rogue. So if they go rogue the wouldn't have to wait for the Prime Minister's approval in the first place, they could have went to kill him directly.But there are a few awesome moments too. Of course the modern take on iconic scenes is awesome (except the spider tank scene, this is actually a failure at understanding the original scene), and there are also some great new iconic scenes too (that don't all fit the original GITS timeline) : Batou's new eyes (the mixed feelings of badassery and regret), when the Major meets Kuze, the deep dive...Conclusion : this movie could have been great. Contrarily to hardcore fans who can't stand a real remake I actually liked the new story and casting. But the movie failed miserably because of a few bad choices and a huge disrespect for the audience's intelligence (yes, we can understand subtle stuff).",Ghost in the Shell
607,eduardodevicentechato,"It looks like GITS, but it doesn't feel like it...",8,3 April 2017,"It's been over twenty years wondering why nobody thought of adapting the anime to the big screen in a live action film, and although I was surprised that it wasn't a Japanese director and a Japanese production taking on the task first, I was nevertheless excited by the prospect of it. I love the original, but I am not a hard-core fan, so I was open to be taken for a ride regardless of all the controversy surrounding the movie prior its release. I always thought that in this particular case using the ""whitewashing"" card was at times hypocrite when if you know a little bit about manga and anime you should know that the characters and aesthetics are vastly modeled after western beauty standards, but let's cut to the cheese. This is an highly entertaining movie, it is also visually stunning. It is well acted and in my opinion tells an interesting story, one that could be part of the Ghost in the Shell movie, only this one doesn't belong to the Major. This adaptation looks like GITS but it doesn't feel like it. This feels more like a remake of Robocop, but does that take away from its achievements? Not really. As a film, forgetting it's based in the anime, it's one hell of a ride, and of course it's impossible to forget the source material, but let's face it, if the options where this adaptation or not adaptation at all, I'll chose this movie a hundred times over.

614,KrabbyPatties,Quite possibly the most generic sci-fi film I have ever watched,2,10 April 2017,"I've not watched the anime /manga/ movie it was based on so I'm purely judging this as an original work, which you think would make it suck less but it doesn't.What this film does not have:Originality. And yes I do know it's an adaptation but was the actual work really that generic?? I mean we've seen this a hundred times. The transplant into a new body, the protagonist wakes up and adjusts to life, cue existential crisis, cue a series of events that leads to the protagonist learning that she has been manipulated into working for a higher power, the protagonist struggles with the big, evil corporation yadda yadda ya. And to be fair, there are many sci-fi flicks which have the same premise which I still enjoy as they've managed to keep it fresh or added a new twist to it. This one does no such thing, it is predictable from start to finish. Of course, it's not as if it has to be unexpected for an enjoyable experience (see exhibit a, shamamalamamdingdong) , it just has to not be so damn generic on all levels! I have a feeling that the manga this was based on contained much more than this. The movie actually feels like the bare bones of an idea, like writing a series of steps to get to plan A but not actually filling in the little details to make it work. This entire movie is a vague outline of what could have been, a teaser you show to get the appropriate funding for the actual film.What this film does have in spades:Angry power-walking (because this is my way of telling you that I am a bitter cybernetic droid!!1!11)About 10000 too many overdone slo-mo fighting scenes. Particularly, Scarlett Johansen's fight (with the guy who tried to kill Dr Ouelet) in the water, there had to be at least 4 slo-mo takes in that one scene, because omgggg water droplets and splashing and violence equals to heart-pumping action. Also, I'm not sure if the fighting style was meant to be stylistically shot in such a way? but it looked rather clunky to me. Johansen's overall impression was that of a lumbering, albeit tiny, heavy- footed golem. Or a hulking ogre. Or an elephantine something. I don't know what it is specifically, perhaps a culmination of her speech, walk and fighting style but it didn't match the sleekness of her outward appearance and that's what caught me off guard. Maybe that was their intent, maybe it was the original author's design. But I'll never know since I don't give enough of a bloody tit to find out. EXPLOSIONS. Grenades are thrown, booby traps are rigged and a goddamn spider tank is on the rampage!! And yet, I find myself struggling to keep my eyes open 30 mins into the show. My father who watched it with me rolled his eyes for a minute straight after the third explosion.Shitty dialogue. This happens nearly every 5 seconds or so and I very nearly want to bite someone's head off by the end of the film. Quotes taken from the IMDb page itself, Dr. Ouelet: ""We cling to memories as if they define us, but they don't. What we do is what defines us."" The Major: ""Everyone around me, they feel connected to something. Connected to something, I'm not.""The Major: ""Well, maybe next time you can design me better."" Really? I suppose they think of us as vacant, simpering fools who don't understand complexity nor how actual humans respond to one another. I can actually imagine a bunch of studio execs reading Dr Ouelet's and Major's lines and going, ""Ah yes, yes, we want the emotion, we want the tugging on the heartstrings, splendid work."" Again, I have not watched the original work so I have no idea if this is a fault on the part of the scriptwriter or the original artist. There're much worse lines in the film, but unfortunately or fortunately for me, I have forgotten most of the them for the yawn-inducing, mundane snoozefest that they were. The female protagonist is tedious to watch, I don't want to understand her personality (because she has none bar alternating between being angry-confused and bitter-angry) and I don't want to know more of her backstory due to the aforementioned reason. I can't comment much about the acting since most people's emotions and faces are mainly one-note, they all feel like cardboard cutouts and I can't bring myself to care at all.The only thing that comes close to interesting for me was the opening fight scene between Major and the geisha. Visually arresting and nicely choreographed. This f*cking pleb of a movie is getting rave reviews from other audience members and I'm genuinely wondering why.",Ghost in the Shell
615,Exit_Music,Surprisingly good (but streamlined),10,30 January 2018,"Before I get into this review, let me start off by saying that I'm very familiar with the original Ghost in the Shell. Overall, the original was an excellent movie. Moving on, I'm pleasantly surprised how good Ghost in the Shell 2017 is. Within the first 5 minutes, I was immersed in the film's atmosphere. It seemed as if the music and sound, the camera angles, the lighting and effects, the acting, etc, all served a purpose for the greater good of the movie. Never once did I get the feeling that the special effects were there to just be eye candy. All the elements of production seemed to synergize off of each other. It seemed that every singe ounce and aspect of production effects were used to their full potential. The film looked gorgeous, and sounded awesome. Every scene had a sense of wonder to it as there was always something to visually admire. Wardrobe was amazing as well. The acting was ok, but I'm a little biased since I'm not too fond of Scarlet J.Beat Takishi was phenomenal (as always). The actor who stood out the most was Pilou Asbæk as Batou. His performance, body language, and overall presence was great to watch. The only reservation I had about the film was the story line. The only comparison I will make to the original is that this 2017 counterpart is more streamlined compared to the nihilistic tone of the original. I'm not necessarily saying this is a bad thing, it's just different. This definitely had a more mainstream appeal to it. Again, not bad, just different. The action scenes were breathtaking and exciting. The few times I've felt this type of excitement towards action scenes were 1) The first time I saw the trailer for The 5th Element and 2) The first time I saw the trailer for The Matrix. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about Ghost in the Shell (2017). It's a pure sci-fi movie down to its core. While it doesn't alienate most of its viewers, it doesn't spoon feed plot, character motivation, or dialogue. In my completely subjective opinion, it is a visual appealing, streamlined masterpiece of the original.",Ghost in the Shell
616,innon,Even Scarlett couldn't make this work,5,1 May 2017,"I wasn't really tempted by the trailer but I watched the movie anyway, since Scarlett Johansson is one of my favorite actresses. Boy was I disappointed! The only thing that kept me from leaving in the middle of the film was the hope that Scarlett will miraculously return to being her beautiful self- blonde and gorgeous, alas that never happened. I think this was one of her worst movies ever. And why make her Japanese is beyond my understanding. In fact, many people in the theater left just after 20 minutes, since nothing really was happening. And ghost? Using this word for a soul is a really alien concept for Western culture. Plain, schematic, unintelligible, shallow- that sums up the two hours of whatever was happening on the screens.",Ghost in the Shell
617,drarchy1,"Yep! It blows, what a surprise...",4,30 March 2017,"**THE REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS, BUT READING IT PROBABLY WON'T CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE WHETHER YOU'RE A FAN OF THE GITS FRANCHISE OR NOT**So I just came from watching the live motion picture of a franchise I've been a passionate fan of for the last six or seven years, even though I knew the script was rewritten several times by five (according to William Wheeler six or seven) writers. Even though premises were changed from the ""Laughing Man"" saga (from the TV series GITS:SAC) to just recreate Mamoru Oshii's animated adaptation from 1995. Even though young and not very competent Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman 2012.) was hired as director, and even though the female version of Keanu Reeves was cast for the not very, at first glance, demanding leading role. To put it up shortly, even though I knew it would suck.And just as you already concluded, the movie turned out to be as bad as everyone expected, looking at it as an adaptation. As a plain movie, it succeeds to transfer a gravely anti- technological message, to some extent, and it has some nice but not overly good cinematography, as every now and then it borrows the shots from Mamoru Oshii's movies just to remind you what you're not watching. And that's about it for the good things.After the opening sequence ""Making of Cyborg"", which for some reason does not contain the brilliant song of the same name by Kenji Kawai, we see a close-up of lovely Scareltt Johannson's face groaning and panting for the next ten seconds after she just woke up in her new cyborg- body. It is after this laughable scene that I realized all hopes for this adaptation to be at least descent are in vain. Now, to be fair, Scarlett is actually the least problem, although someone could have told her that the character she's portraying is not sad all the time and does not make up stupid face expressions in the manner of a Kristen Stewart and beat up potential witnesses with unreasonable rage, but rather has a calm attitude where emotions are brought up in certain situations which makes them effective and believable. This can be seen best in the TV series or in the later chapters of Masamune Shirow's 1989. manga.Apart from many other unnecessary problems like Daisuke Aramaki having no personality what so ever, the rest of the section 9 been represented as a bunch of retards, losing screen time by unnecessary and no way philosophical dialog between Major and Batou like explaining to the audience they have the radio-communication mode (because the audience is to stupid to figure that out by just seeing them communicate that way, I guess), the movie's real problem is it does not know what it's trying to be. Is it already mentioned anti-technological manifest? The action-cgi-drama with not very impressive action sequences? Or a quasi-origin story of Motoko Kusanagi which succeeds at adding no depth to the character?But the cherry on top is the soundtrack. Not that it's awful or anything, but to not include any of the tracks from six Yoko Kanno's albums or Kenji Kawai's original score and to put the intro song of Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence as background of boring end credits is the very top of the insolence.I would say don't go to the cinema, wait for the director's cut, although I doubt it would improve much, but judging from the ending they obviously intend to make a sequel, and it would be best if you as an audience would not help them doing so by giving them your money.",Ghost in the Shell
618,ignition1377,Superb achievement - nice attempt thoroughly enjoyed it,10,16 August 2017,"I am not sure how many times I've watched the anime version. Too many to count , a couple of times since my teenage years and i am now 40? Perhaps a tad more. Its not easy to portray such an icon of existential Japanese artistic creation but I believe Rupert has done it. Despite negative comments, most of critics, and some media crooks, I believe that he has tried to bridge an uneducated audience ( simply due to generational media exposure- who watches noir cinema these days?), politely, carefully and masterfully , for the talented Mr Sanders not only achieves a decent package of special effects but weaves a script almost true to the original masterpiece. I just loved it. Somehow I thought that the film had not only elements of Ghost in the Shell orig. but also some characteristics of William Gibson's Neuromancer protagonist. For sure, I was expecting a taller Major , less explosive more steel, some protagonists different... but the essence is there. and that's all we need folks. Looking forward to see Mr. Sanders next movie. Scarlet is killing it .",Ghost in the Shell
619,Mario_CRO,Good adaptation to a Hollywood type movie,8,30 March 2017,"Hi,I have to give a score 8 out of 10 after just watching the movie in IMAX theater. The visual effects were astounding, especially if you consider that the movie was based on the cartoon in which there are no limits. In this regard the movie is even 9 or 9.5 out of 10. But I gave the overall score of 8 just because in the end it is a rewritten and adapted version of the original and the Hollywood always considers larger masses and not just the fans. I believe that most of us that saw the original years ago had the more time for the story to settle in and as time passed the connection to the story got stronger. So when we watched the movie it is perfectly normal that not everyone has the same opinion regarding the movie since most of the opinions are subjective and not objective. Personally for me the adaptation was done pretty good, considering all things that they had to put into the film to pay tribute to the original and to appeal to larger masses. In the time that the movie goes on (a bit under the 2 hour mark) they squeezed pretty much all the important parts and made the scenery from the original very real with the visual effects. Watching it in the IMAX surrounding was great and all the city scenes were like nothing seen before. That is pretty much it regarding the movie story and scene. Now a little about the main character... Scarlett was great, and I really mean great. I think (and I may be wrong here) that she didn't read the manga or that she saw the original animated movie but she captured the personality of Major pretty damn good. In playing a character that is a cyborg and in the same time a first of it's kind she gave a great performance. It was just so in line with the Major from the original as I wanted it to be so maybe I'm a little biased.In the end, go and see the movie, I promise that you won't be disappointed. In the sea of Hollywood mainstream movies lately I found it quite good and fresh. If you're a type of viewer that doesn't care too much on a movie giving an homage to the original you will definitely find it interesting since the story like this didn't came before and all the Hollywood things like good acting and stunning visual effects are there.",Ghost in the Shell

621,kot_belozero,"About Human and humanity, but with old ideology",7,18 April 2017,"The original anime poses very complex and painful questions to the viewer. Questions about what it means to be a Human? Where is the line between the human mind and the artificial intelligence? What is the soul and does it really exist? Its unlikely that all of these questions can be answered unequivocally with a brilliant film or anime. But the original anime leaves a deep impression after viewing. You've been thinking about what you saw for days and nights. Look for answers to questions that can drive our civilization crazy. Is it possible to say the same about the film? Unfortunately no. The film leaves a deep impression. But more with the help of an absolutely stunning visual style and fear for the main character. But not because of global questions that fill all the thoughts after viewing. In the film, there were moments when I wanted to cry. Emotionally the film is able to hook anyone, unless you are, of course, the one who comes to the cinema to look at the explosions and eat popcorn. But the main problem awaits us at the end of the film. After such difficult questions and emotional experiences in the middle of the film, in the end we are disappointed. The main heroine, through pain and suffering, finds answers to her questions and her past. He realizes (like the spectator himself) that she is a human, not a machine. She understands that the police, state, corporations and society wanted to do her robot. They wanted to destroy her humanity, changed her memory, erased her life. They almost could turn it into a silent instrument of achieving their own goals. But she knew the truth! She was ready to sacrifice her life for those she loved (try to search in your life for those who are willing to give your life for you). Motoko realized that she was a human (and we must admit this, since humanity is manifested in actions). But at the end, when she could make a choice, as she finally realized that she was a human.. She continues to work for the government, as the movie says explicitly. A government that will reflect that vile society in which we live, for which human life does not matter. This society and this government stole her life and the lives of others. They branded people with the words ""poor"", ""ugly"", ""unworthy"", and then endowed them with the appropriate characteristics. They tried to do this with Motoko, which was supposed to be an instrument. But she was able to escape from this trap. And instead of asking this world cruel and truthful questions.. She begins to serve this world. The same problems exist in the original anime. But they recede into the background because of the complexity of philosophical questions about man and his boundaries with artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the film can not boast of something like that. Beautiful picture, beautiful music and acting, a high level of emotional saturation, but a complete defeat, if we talk about the formulation of global and substantive questions.",Ghost in the Shell

In terms of referencing source material, they did a good job. But at the end of the day, casting was DEFINITELY AN ISSUE (& not from a whitewashing standpoint).

627,Landgraab,"Take a look at the original animation of Ghost in the Shell, which is based on it",6,25 July 2017,"Human consciousness is not the object ... animation that sparked the creation of the matrix in the minds of its creator *********************************** The Ghost in the Shell was made in 1995 by Japanese director Mamouru Oshi. Subsequently, several TV series were made and the second part of the animation was shown in 1996. The spirit collection is in deep sketches about artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind and self- awareness. The first part when it was shown in Crescent Critics could not understand it. Nevertheless, this film is respected by some of the world's largest cinema directors. From James Cameron to Andy and Lana Wachowski and Steven Spielberg, in the last decade, they have been honored with the Japanese animation of the Ghost in the Shell. James Cameron from the film called ""a curious work, a curious story."" . . The first example has reached a level of literary supremacy. ""The movie Avatar Crameron has semantic similarities to this animation. Steven Spielberg is another fan of the Japanese cartoon, and its impact on his two films is undeniable. ""Artificial Intelligence,"" which implies the implications of the confrontation of humans and robots, and the ""minority report"", and the look he has over the future and advanced technologies. The sci-fi movie of the alternatives by Bruce Willis is also related to the meanings of this work. Wachowski brothers also decided to make the matrix after seeing this animation. They even gave a copy of the film to the producer and said they wanted to create the real version of this animation. However, in the end, the triple matrix with a different theme than This animation, with a very complex structure, was made more meaningful than this animation. The soul animation narrates the story-line in 2029. When technology has advanced to a large extent, many human organs can be replaced by artificial and more efficient organs. In this situation, a new generation of human beings is faced. Many members of the body, even the key, combine with electronic devices. Under such circumstances, it is possible for some to hack into the brain chained by hacking all their brains, including memories or feelings. They take control of the person completely. The Storyteller narrates the most famous and most powerful of these brain hackers by a special section in the Japanese police. The Ghost in the Shell has two kinds of important messages: Warning of the danger and warning about the future of cybernetic technologies, including the next generation of human beings - a human who is strongly combined with the ligament and can no longer be easily distinguished from ligaments. A new kind of species, or some kind of metamorphosis, is placed at the highest level of the Darwinian cycle, replacing ordinary humans today. But the more important and inward message of the film is that it is at all what the meaning of man and soul is and who and what can be Human being alive and intelligent? Do not necessarily only those who use this physical body to be alive? Or is the awareness and consciousness of an existing thing beyond its physical base, which even has the ability to transmit in various ways, such as the Internet? Consider a world in which we can capture all the memories, consciousness, and consciousness of a human being from within, and upload onto a hardware such as a computer, or even put it on the Internet. Then we will be in a new phase of life that is no longer dependent on the object. This new level of life is the only consciousness.",Ghost in the Shell

There is no need to tell a long time fan something about this and it might even be impossible to write an accurate review for a fan. For someone who doesn't know the 90s anime or all the other stuff, comparisons doesn't matter anyway.This movie is set in a future where cyber enhancement has become the norm and this opens up the questions of ethics and moral. One of the questions is: What is real and what not? The body can be altered, even replaced, as can memories and personalities. What are the consequences of this possibilities?
The next question is: Where is the border between human and robot? What makes a human human? And at what point is a human no longer master of his own life?
This are quite philosophical questions and the movie can't give answers. It can only make the viewer think.One other question is: If companies control the technology, what rights do they have, and what power? Can they experiment with human bodies? Do they have the right to make decisions over this cyber enhanced humans?Today we are at the very beginning of this development. Making this questions a topic now is quite important. We asked them too late when other technology was introduced in the past. (Like when companies started to control our food or our medicine.)Some people complain about a movie that is set in Japan but has nearly no Asian actor in a major role. I don't know if that's important in an sci-fi, action movie, set in a future where all kinds of body modifications are possible. This movie was set up for a world wide audience and it doesn't change the story where the lead actor comes from. That's just the business side of the business. Maybe that's not good, but we all know that the name of the lead sells at least half of the tickets.Visually this movie is great. The acting is good, not great. The cast plays well. Johansson plays it cool or reserved. She played a robot with a human brain and no memory of the past. Her new life, the only life she knows, is that of an agent. The fact that the story doesn't tell all the details from the beginning equals the fact that the characters know very little themselves. They know little about the attacker, Major knows nothing about her past. And the fact that she was reconstructed as a weapon makes it hard for her to be emotional. She has to get used to be human. She sees herself as an outsider.
This is a movie with not many words. There are no characters who talk a lot. Well this is not Dawson's Creek, it's a Sci-fi setting with a military/police environment. It is not a thriller where the main character has to discover a complex secret. We don't need Sherlock holmes, the story unfolds by the actions of the attacker. The philosophical or moral questions are what's interesting, not the crimes.",Ghost in the Shell
629,jamesdashberry,Fun but unoriginal,6,7 May 2017,"I should start out by stating I am not a fan of Manga. The closest you will get me to anything remotely Manga-esque is The Animatrix. When it comes to comic book adaptations, my level is Transformers, Marvel, DC and The Crow. Beyond that, I struggle. However, the trailer of Ghost in the Shell interested me greatly, and as it seemed to share similarities with both The Matrix, Equilibrium and Blade Runner, I gave it a go.What this film represents is a enjoyable way of spending nearly 2 hours on a Sunday afternoon. What it doesn't represent is an original and thought provoking cinematic success. There is unfortunately nothing in the film that hasn't been done before - do not watch this film expecting originality.I am aware that there was much criticism of this film over the casting, and many felt the lead should have been oriental. I don't think this is an issue for the general public, and the film has wider reaching issues than cast. For instance, it is immediately apparent (to me at least) that the villain of the plot is Cutter. I should point out that I am one of the only people I know who didn't catch on that Bruce Willis was actually dead in ""The Sixth Sense"", so for me to figure this out so early on is not a positive!Secondly, the contradiction of futuristic urban settings in Japan with cars based on vehicles that look like they are sourced from 1980s Britain doesn't sit right to me. It's obviously intentional, and whether or not it is born of Hollywood or the original Manga, I don't know, but it didn't work for me. It was is if there was an internal confusion over whether the film is utopian or distopian, and as it is clearly both this confusion has become apparent.Third, the film is supposed to be set in Japan, yet the location is very Hong Kong like (which is no surprise as the film was shot in part in Hong Kong). It felt like Yellowthread street in the future.All that aside, it IS fun. The opening sequence promises much, and in general cinematography is slick, even though it is not in the same league as The Matrix or Equilibrium.

Short answer: Not really. Not even nice try. Long answer: The cinematography its truly remarkable, it somehow reproduce the atmosphere of the original anime, the decaying, depressing, dark megalopolis is correctly reproduced here (despite the giant weird advertisements that are spread around, that doesn't really make any sense, and didn't appear in the anime, what are they trying to sell?), the costumes, robots, and the general look and feel of the characters are quite satisfying and solid. The music is not bad at all, includes some of the original score and it work towards creating a dense and dark environment. The acting is standard, not bad at all. The script is.... ohhh boy, let me breath... to use nice words, the script seems to be written addressed to children or to very 'slow' people. All the rich complexity, all the mature and philosophical themes, all the sides of the story that the original material let out to be imagined by the viewer, all that is gone here. Here you can find a bland, generic script, that explain a generic origin story, that never tries to get into the philosophical or ethical implications of human body enhancements or AI. Where the characters are one-sided, good vs bad people. We are use to that over-simplification of a movie plot, since we sadly live in a world conquered by the 'marvel'/'batman' method of making a movie, where the plot should be simple and thin, the characters shouldn't have any grays and the action should be convoluted and confusing, full of minions to destroy for the sake of fill 100 minutes (well at least this adaptation has correct action scenes, that are easy to follow and most of the time are not annoying). To wrap up, a correct movie, that shines in the visual and action sides, but has a forgettable script and characters. It will probably perform good in the box office, and that worries me because what could come next, it will be really sad to see how they reduce Akira, Jin-roh, Evangelion or Cowboy bebbop to a generic action blockbuster without any of the things that made those stories great.",Ghost in the Shell
641,michaelpaice,Nothing (new) to see here.,3,5 August 2017,"I have never seen the original and am not a manga/anime connoisseur, so I came to the film as a regular lover of good science fiction movies. Maybe I have just seen too many now because I guessed where this yarn was going from very early on. There was no depth to the story or the characters and that feeling of 'not this old thing again' set in pretty soon. I stuck with it, however, hoping that I might enjoy the ride - sadly, it was just a yawn-fest through yet another dreary dystopian future world.The cast were professional but unable to stir any emotion as they stumbled through a breathless and rudimentary script. The production values were solid and the effects generally of a decent standard. But that's it. The film left me flat and has so little about it that I doubt that I could sit through it again.Looking at other reviews,this version of Ghost in the Shell is pure Marmite - you'll either love it or you'll hate it.

I'd read something or other about ""whiting up"" the characters with ScarJo etc. but m'eh, wasn't bothered about all that, I just want entertaining tonight.Ho hum, was not to be. The film, I found, was visually great, even fantastic. It captured the Bladerunner feel with a modern/future update, hell, there was almost a direct reference to ""if you could see the things I've seen with your eyes"" from the dude that lost his eyes. And no, I have absolutely no knowledge of the anime history that goes before this film, in point of fact I have no experience of anime full stop, I just don't get all that stuff. So in a way, I'm the perfect target audience for this multi-million dollar film, i.e. they don't spend that kinda money just for the fanboys.I'm left feeling that the plot has been done many times before......RoboCop anyone? The scripting was just dull and predictable, trite really as I found myself internally groaning at most of the lines. And that's my point, I wanted the acting to match the visuals, I wanted the characters to matter to me, and they didn't. ScarJo was not good casting, I bet she had to rest her face for a month after shooting to relax all the muscles she used to portray her constipated look throughput the film.All things considered, it kept me busy for a few hours, but not fully entertained, so now I'm left feeling glad that I watched Logan last night which, albeit a very different film, was a much more satisfying way to spend the evening.",Ghost in the Shell

As a proof, just compare this film, its plot, with any other Hollywood 100-200 million production, and you will see the risk they have taken to show this sci-fi history in a non-animated fashion, with incredible special effects and not losing the original track at all, although simplified.",Ghost in the Shell

If you want to watch a real action movie, please scroll through. If you are looking to be entertained, or better yet, if you are one of those people who like goof movies mixed in with the sub mediocre coincidences , like the 'Scary Movie' types, only then do I recommend this.I basically laughed out so loudly throughout most of this film. The acting was so hilarious and amateurish and painfully forced. The behaviour of the 'spies' was unpredictable because sometimes when the plot wanted it they could walk only slowly, sometimes run away like athletes with ghoulishly done faces, and sometimes become invisible, it almost felt they were sympathetic of the main characters sad life.

661,gallick_x,Potential for more. But anything more must be different.,7,31 March 2017,"I am an avid Ghost in the Shell fan, so my experience was always going to be overshadowed by the anime that came before. But I did not expect such cinematic splendor and costume/set design.Story: Dead -It is dead because it chopped up story from the previous movies and tried to Frankenstein them together, whilst adding in new backstory that only made fans cringe. There was no life there, Rupert should have tried to move forward with new content instead of trying to play it safe like Star Wars Episode 7.Characters: Dead -The life that was brought into the anime characters was lost here. There was an attempt to give ""The Major"" and emotional core that amplified her so called ""Ghost"". However in reality (Anime) the majors ghost was not highlighted by any emotions whatsoever, only her observance as to the lack of said feelings. Her philosophical and analytical nature was what gave her the notion of a ""Ghost"". So in a sense, they restructured the very definition of who the Major was.Batou attempted to be a good buddy like he was in the anime, but he never really had the chance, the story moved too quickly and his connection was lost. I think the Major had too much baggage going on to allow anyone else to show themselves.The side characters (Section 9 crew) were all just background fluff and didn't even matter, which is good because I don't think I could handle any more characters being misrepresented.Aramaki was alright, I think Kitano was just used for novelty purposes, and these days he is just like a Japanese Harrison Ford, grumpy and only around for the money.Set Design: -Alive. Alive in every way, the world they used was full of cyberpunk goodness stripped right out of the heart of the anime. Every detail was accounted for and it truly was the highlight of the entire film. I will include the background characters and extras into this as well, they were all very much apart of the world and the state of society was quite evident.Sound: -Alive, but misplaced. The music was fantastic, but never seemed to show up on time, it was always late for the party. Even the music for the into sequence(for the anime) didn't arrive until the credits. For them to leave out the song was advertise with the new intro out of the new intro.......there are no words.I like this movie a lot, I will be picking it up on 4k Blu-Ray asap, because I am only going back for the beauty of the cinematography and CGI.

669,stonez_74,Oh Man what a rush !!!,10,2 April 2017,"First of all I would like to point out that I have NOT seen the original movie, nor the remaining from the GITS universe. On the flip side I have seen almost every science fiction movie, franchise which matters up to this point, just to mention a few 2001, Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and the list goes on. I think I proved my point that I am Science Fiction fan. Now that we got that out of the way, I am going to point out my thoughts about this movie.First of all the visuals are amazing !!! The city design is something what you have never seen before, it kinda reminds you of Blade Runner, maybe even on par with Blade Runner in some cases. It just gives you that wow effect and you just keep on staring at the world and billboards. This alone is enough to go see it !!!The acting was believable and enjoyable. Scarlet and Michael Pitt had some mistakes, there were some scenes which felt kinda hollow but it didn't kill my vibe. A big shout out goes to Pilou Asbaek who just nailed it.Now the story was pretty straight forward but does the job 100%, basically its unraveling the plot until you find out what actually happened, with a lot of amazing action sequences which will keep you on the edge of your seat. From what I have read from other reviews, a lot of people say that the story is real crap compared to the original material. Maybe this is so, I have no comparison. What I can tell you instead that the story WAS good enough to keep me interested until the end, and left the theater smiling. This is actually a very big deal, I have seen thousands of movies and I am very hard to impress.SCORE: 9.50 / 10 !!!!PS: An amazing movie to a Science Fiction fan who did not seen the originals !!! Go see it !!!",Ghost in the Shell
670,Ivanero,Outstanding visuals,8,6 April 2017,"The movie is amazing. Of course, I didn't expect a faithful adaptation, that's why I didn't even watch the original film that I watched a lot of years ago and I almost didn't remember.I didn't have the need of finding any different detail to the original film, that makes you only focused in destroying and over analyzing the film instead of enjoying it. A fresh mind is way better.I even thought that it was BASED on the Ghost in the Shell world, therefore I didn't have any expectation. I was prepared to enjoy just whatever it was enjoyable.With an amazing first action sequence, I was more than satisfied with the stunning visuals, effects, photography and direction of the scene, enough to think ""wow, after this, it's already worth the money"".Script is just OK. Enough to show Ghost in the Shell ideas, without being pretentious, and with a lack of complex that, yeah, I don't like too much. Scarlet Johansson was amazing, really nice casting choice. Asbæk characterization is amazing and his acting is good enough. Visuals and photography are amazing as I already said. The only mistake? Trying to make the film for the massive public, avoiding complexity of the script and avoiding female nipples.Hey guys, complex films like Inception can make a lot of money too. And a female nipple is something natural, without any intention of being sexualized in this story.",Ghost in the Shell

Reading many negative reviews of this adaptation from both ""experts"" and commoners, I decided to give it a shot. Well, I found it a well-made, fun, and engaging movie. I know why many people love to hate this movie, and I agree on some of the points they make. But I believe a movie should fundamentally be judged by its own merits and limits, and not by comparing it with the original, be it a novel, cartoon, or another movie. This movie is not nearly as bad as some of the haters say. It has good characters, fine acting, nice (albeit a bit stereotypical) story, wonderful visuals, hypnotic music, and a haunting theme.

Therefore when it came to a Hollywood adaptation i had the biggest doubts and the original feedback was terrible, even cutting its debut short in my country. I proceeded to push back watching the film until almost a year later.I was mistaken to. The film is far from a bad adaptation, it manages to capture the same de-saturated enigmatic future in all aspects, including story. Its watered down, yes. Enough to make it a modern, viable, cinema going mass market experience but they still take chances with timing and shots that are more accurate to the 1995 Anime.This is a great go at an Anime adaption, and although i would prefer An Asian lead, I hope following Anime adaptions keep the same ability to transfer the smell, the root feel of an Anime.",Ghost in the Shell
673,torvum,The remake misses the mark,5,17 April 2017,"Let's start off by saying this: I'm not a fanboy of the original. Although I do like the film, I thought it had its problems. What Hollywood got right: The visuals in the movie are gorgeous and for me a lot more ""believable"" than the original. The original was intensely drab and didn't paint what for me a future world should look like. Sure, it helped establish a mood, but there's other ways to achieve that. The acting is fairly good, although Scarlet's clunky style of portraying her character was a bit off-putting, to me. By that I mean that she kind of stomps around in the film, almost like a exasperated angsty tomboy. It seemed too out-of-step with her acrobatic and finessed fighting style. She can do flips while running on the wall but makes walking in a straight line feel awkward. Pilou does a really good job with Batou, though. His character seems to be the only element that feels true between the original and the remake.Certain crucial story elements were rewritten, and although I don't like what they came up with (more on that below), I did like the fact that they decided to remove the unnecessarily complicated foreign-affairs-mystery bit from the original; it was a bit difficult to follow and didn't add anything to the film. What Hollywood got wrong:The philosophy. The central question in the original is: what makes humans, special? If our bodies don't (since everybody's replacing their parts with robotic ones) and our memories don't (since those can be altered and are just units of information just like in a computer system) then it must be our sentience. But what if a computer became sentient? And if it did, would it be entitled to be treated like a human? Then I ask you again: what's so special about humanity? The film ends in a question: can the marriage of computer intelligence and humanity surpass both? These questions are personified by the film's antagonist, which is why it works so well. Both the audience and Major are compelled to come to grips with the meaning of humanity. Hollywood butchers the philosophy. It instead recasts the film to be about human memories, and it asks the rather banal question: do your memories define you? To which it ironically answers: no, your actions define you. I say ""ironically"" because actually the entire film speaks to the contrary: Major only starts to work against her programming and Hanka Robotics because of her intuitions which are fueled by her partial memories. It's not until she regains her full memory that she knows her place in the world and how to act ethically. The film's antagonist is flimsy and plays no role except to point Major to her true identity. He doesn't represent any kind of serious challenge for either Major or for the audience, unlike in the original, and consequently the film falls flat on its shallow undeveloped face.",Ghost in the Shell
674,david-dubuis,Just watch the original,5,6 April 2018,"I'm a massive fan of Sci fi and of classic anime so when I tell you I didn't particularly enjoy this movie you can rest assured it's coming someone who should be perfectly primed to love it.It lacks the subtelty of the original. This is typical of Hollywood I suppose, they tend to underestimate their audience so everything has to be spelled out in case someone fails to grasp the meaning. I appreciate their inclusivity but it results in some seriously dumbed down movies. Case in point here is the insistence on explicitly explaining that the ghost in the shell is the soul of the human whose brain has been implanted in a robotic body. Like, if you need that spelled out to you I don't think movies with substance and subtext are for you.

Having watched the original animated movie and it's sequel as well as the TV series ( both seasons) and it's movie follow up along with the new series Arise. I found this movie to be very enjoyable and interesting as they took bits and pieces to make a movie that was intellectually stimulating as well as an enjoyable action flick.

Without comparing it to anything else as I think it's proper. I don't understand why people always search in movie adaptations the original book or movie etc. I think this comes out of stubbornness. Take it as it is and enjoy it. Now, about this movie. First it is visually stunning and a high-concept sci-fi. It reminds me of the world of Bladerunner. Of course the emotional and psychological sides could've been better developed but, we can read between the lines and see the deeper meaning if we want. Basically the question is ""Are humans only flesh and limited by it or they can evolve by choosing trans-humanism and keep their deeper self at the same time?"" I think the message of ""Ghost in the shell"" is that being human means what we feel, how we feel and how we act regardless of what materials we are made of. And not to forget Scarlett. She's a doll :))))",Ghost in the Shell
678,cguild1987,"Highly Enjoyable, But Flawed",7,17 January 2018,"I can see what Scarlett Johansson was trying to do here. Despite being unintentionally humorous at times, her stilted posture, gait, dialogue delivery, and facial expressions BELONG in this film. They belong not only because the viewers are expected to believe Scarlett's character is sheltered, confused, and possibly in over hear head as an exploited yet proficient soldier, but they belong because the Major displayed the same idiosyncrasies in the 1995 anime. The Major has always been no-nonsense in her work, but she's also the one who drives the franchise's characteristic philosophical themes of ""self"" and personal identity in a futuristic world humans may not yet be ready for. To that extent, I applaud Scarlett's choices for the character.I can also see what the filmmakers were trying to do. The source material (namely, the 1995 anime and certain plot elements from the animated series) has clearly been researched, to an incredible degree. And from that research has come an incredibly vivid, beautiful, bustling, yet overwhelming and dangerous world. The level of detail -- from the mile-high holograms and over-the-top advertisements, to the subtle wires/electrodes/LED lights/prosthetics woven in and out of ""enhanced"" skin, to the breaking glass and ensuing mayhem of the ""Jump"" sequence -- is truly impressive. The sound design and sound editing are top-notch, with every booted footstep, metal clack of magazine reloads, blast of gunfire, and hallucinated ""glitch"" landing flawlessly. The music, while subtle, adequately does its part in supporting the futuristic yet sometimes bleak setting of the story.The characters (with the exception of Major, Batou, and the film's antagonist) are unfortunately given very little to say or do. There's so much more to these characters, and it's a real shame they weren't given the development they (and the movie) deserve. Despite this, I enjoyed (and believed) the chemistry between Major and Batou, with the latter providing his signature level-headedness and pathos to the former's insecurity and logos. The film's antagonist deserves special mention as well: The character provides a fascinating story arc, and the actor's portrayal of the character's speech and physical mannerisms are akin to a futuristic/omnipotent Joker.With that being said, I believe the movie's greatest fault is it's short run time. This, I'm guessing, had to do with the studio rather than the actors and filmmakers. Regardless, it really does impact the film. The editing feels forced and choppy, and certain parts of the story seem to have been cut short or eliminated completely. Director Rubert Sanders and cinematographer Jess Hall clearly want to draw out and savor their beautifully crafted scenes, but unfortunately someone somewhere opted instead for ""Nah, cut it there. No need for shots lasting longer than 2-3 seconds."" PG-13 audiences just don't have the attention span, sadly.It's wishful thinking, sure...but I'm holding out hope for a Director's Cut (""Blade Runner,"" anyone?). The makings for an incredible film are here, but the theatrical cut unfortunately falls short. The cast and crew deserve better. And the fans deserve to see what I believe was originally intended.",Ghost in the Shell

She cries at one point, no emotion within her voice or face. Like the film lucy, kills the story somewhat.The story line by itself is weak and very obvious. Within the first 15 minutes you could tell exactly what was going to happen.At the end, the spider tank? This kind of thing belongs in the 1960s sci-fi horror films.

686,icp-48859,What happened here.,1,14 April 2017,I'm not even into the first 4:20 into this film and I'm like what happened to the storyline you're taking a classic and what destroying it just to say you made a film.If your going to unwrite her back story to people that have been loyal fans and followers of the GIAS story for decades you better get the story right first. Her brain case was from another artificial body she grew out of and was offered the job in Section 9. Without that custom new one she would have remained just another ghost in a shell get the point of the backstory now.OK lol she wasn't the first the real story was the great war sunk half of Tokyo into the ocean and with that came chemical and biological toxins that leaked into the waters around japan so they had to mechanize humans to repair the damage and get rid of the toxic waste. Also they where used in that great war as soldiers and where given full prosthetics to help win. But in that after math Chinese refugees have now come into the under water areas to make a new area. Known as the refuge district.Mr.Aramaki is the leader of Section 9 and he speaks English just like everyone else don't translate everyone from Japanese and not him this movie should have a bellow 0 rating so far.Batou I feel sorry for him his character is a muscle bound large man with cybernetic eye's from being in the great war. He lost an arm and had it replaced. Take the actor they used and I don't know upgrade him like 10x or even 20x you have the real Batou. Who is this guy a pewny BS actor which if I saw in the future I would think he's loser and give change to not a war ventern.OK it's about half way through the movie and I walked out what a waste of time and money. The hole reason someone made this epic storyline is so there would be a future real life movie. You can't just chop out parts you think are cool and consider this to be ghost in a shell.It should have been called something like not good acting dronecop. Didn't the lead actor watch the films or the series to get a better understanding of the role she was asked to play didn't the director notice that he was following a script that ripped the number one all time best japan anime into dishonorment.You all must know the Japanese do things in a manner that keeps things pure and immerses someone into what they want you to see this movie doesn't do it for me and if I was the original creator of GIAS I would sue whoever desided to release this movie to the public.It could have been over the top made the box office top 5 for the year but if I can't watch it all the way through that says something about what went wrong.,Ghost in the Shell

The details like the road, lighting, billboards, buildings, cars are well done. Yes, the boiling kettle and apartment setting are out of time but it's kind of proof that there are real humans alive.I like the part where the movie tells us how Datou got that weird pair of eye. I like the part where Dr. Ouelet sacrifices herself to free Mira to redeem her mistakes and ultimately lead to her possible mother. I like the fact that the enemy here is Kuze instead of The Puppet Master in the anime), and they did not end up merging together.Most of all, I like the way Scarlet portray Mira in a more humanistic way.

689,soraswork,"So close, yet so far",6,9 April 2017,"Let's sort out what works first.The casting. Johansson is a great badass leading lady as usual. She does the job she's supposed to with aplomb. Asbaek is great as Batou, giving you a perfectly likable oddball character to play off ""Major"". Kitano plays Aramaki as a an awesome old badass and nails it.Then there's the visuals, which everyone covered. Awesome, very awesome. A world of giant holograms everywhere, crazy cyborgs, overcrowded Japanese cities, and on and on all brought to life with (almost) entirely solid CGI. Batou even drives a semifuture Delorean, awesome!And then, you get to the story. The good news here is that the American adaptation here wants to have the kind of brains and examination of humanity and its relationship with technology that the original movie and then series did. It very, very much WANTS to, but it doesn't. And that's because the plot is disorganized mess of trying to stick in old GITS story lines, be a Hollywood blockbuster, be smarter than a Hollywood blockbuster, and about a half dozen other things as well.In other words its a mess. Not a mess that isn't followable, it perfectly well is. But it's a mess in that it doesn't know what it's trying to do or what its overall goal is. The bad guy is, Kuze.. who uhm. His goal is too... uhhh. Destroy a robotics company, sorta, a bit? And the main characters care about this... sort of, like tangentially. Because it's their job too mostly? Also there's a bunch of comparisons to the first anime GITS movie and the bad guy there, but it's just kind of there to be... there?And then it turns out the real bad guy is the corporate asshole from the beginning. Whos personality can be summed up as ""evil asshole that will get shot or something"" and then he gets shot. And his plan was too... uhm. Hmmm. Be, an asshole to everyone? Cause that's all he really does throughout the entire movie, whether it makes sense or not.Also by the end Kuze, the initial bad guy, dies but doesn't. And no one ends up caring where he goes or what he was doing throughout the first 2/3rds of the movie even though that's what a lot of the movie was about. Because... uhhhhh. Well I don't know and the plot sure doesn't, the movie just kind of ends. And what a downer that is. Some people, the concept artists, the cast, the VFX team, all feel like they worked really hard on this movie and nailed there parts in what could have been a great translation of GITS into live action.

She captured the melancholy air and expressions of the Major admirably.Yes, the story has been changed somewhat, but that's fine. It's a different film, with a different story.

693,khorzon,"Astounding sci-fi movie, and faithful to original",9,17 April 2017,"Walking into the theater, I was anxious about this movie. The source material has a large range of stories from anime movies, manga and a animated series. Would it stay true, and yet still be entertaining on it's own?The answer is a resounding 'yes'! The movie and story was based 75% on the original anime movie, 15% on other source material (manga, other movies and the show), and 10% its own original concepts. There is a very intelligent blending of aspects from several of the entries to this franchise that come together to make for something entertaining.To that point... the deeper aspects of the film explores the dynamic of how the connection to humanity could be lost to technology, and what makes us human. And it immerses the viewer in a cyberpunk world that is a visual and action feast.The pacing is actually very good despite what some have said... and at no point do you feel lost in plot or scene transitions. Everything feels believable, just highly technically advanced... and somewhat eerily possible for a future of mankind.Regarding the whole fabricated controversy surrounding casting Scarlett Johansson - The story within the movie actually explains the casting decision. In fact, its somewhat integral to it. And it completely proves that this was a politicized knee-jerk reaction to something that didn't deserve it.

I thought they were all good casts overall. I doubt the casting director was being racist in any way when doing his job - he found a good fit and stuck with them.I've seen the Anime, yes yes I know - I have, and have to say it was done really really well.Sure it may not follow all the Anime's plot points to a T but it gets the general feel across.This is a movie you can watch with family and friends and that's the point.A movie for the general public - if it was done solely for fans of the Anime it would have been 3-4 movies across with more silence and more character development than a soap opera - more than necessary.This is not that, accept it for what it is - entertaining.Go back to a time mentally where you did not over-analyze everything and stay there, you'll be better off.I personally thought it was worth the money and then some.",Ghost in the Shell

It's a fine line in having to stay true to the original, yet making the movie palatable enough to engage the newbie viewer.For me, it was enough of the story line coupled with with amazing cyberpunk eye candy. I thought it was amazing. I frankly find it funny that a white actor is so harshly critiqued for playing Major, despite Mamoru Oshii, the director of the original anime adaptation, endorsing it.That's like telling Monet that he needs to add clarity to his impressionistic paintings, or telling Bach that it's all about the bass.Seriously, go in with a clean slate, and you'll enjoy this movie.

699,leathymasensi,"Hollywood, you really had to mess this one up too huh!!!",3,5 April 2017,"*******Major Spoilers for the Original and this Crappy Version************This movie is just not good. Nothing to do with the fact that it is whitewashed or any of that. It is based on one of the best animated films ever made in a sense that its original material is very slick, revolutionary, philosophical and also unconventional. For example, the Major Kusanagi is a cyborg with a human brain but she does not know who she is deep down. She first of all does not know emotion and therefore doesn't cry or have watery eyes in an emotional situations like Scarlett Johansson's version but yet you feel very connected to the character because of the story behind who she is. And also why cast Scarlet Johansson as the Major and make this movie PG 13. The original is rated R for nudity and some violent imagery throughout. But no you want to put ScarJo in the movie and know damn well she will not get naked but you think have her in the movie will appeal to the masses. Well guess what Production. People are just not interested. I am honestly being objective. This is not a good movie. You don't feel any connection with the main protagonist because her story is not well explained and also oh for people who watched it. The main antagonist actually merges with the Major at the end of the movie and she becomes 2 entities living in one mind. Even that part Hollywood was like nah we are not going to put it in the script because people will get confused. But what was more confusing was the motive of the antagonist in this version. The original does not really have an antagonist it's that simple for people who watched both versions compare how lame the ending is in this one. They just took the original story and switched things around and it makes no sense. Just like Denzel said to Cuba Gooding JR in American Gangster ""you don't have to change anything its good enough the way it is you can make enough money off it by keeping the Ghost in the Shell, anything more than that is greed"" Why not just keep the whole movie intact and not try to put certain scenes from the original in the live action. It is plainly simply dumb doing that because most people don't know Ghost in the Shell. They could have just retold the whole story like it is done in other made to live action film. Great example the beauty and the beast. Why not do it like they did it but no they wanna change the story to fit the masses but it does not work again people are not interested in visual effects as much as they used to. This ain't the early 2000s. They already have their allegiance to movie series in the Marvel Cinematic World, Transformers etc. Whoever was behind this movie production i mean not just the producers but all the people involved failed miserably and it will hurt their pocket unfortunately because like i said this is 2017 people don't really care for these special effects and good looking imagery. People want something cool they can say oh damn this is different and clever at the same time which is how the original Ghost in the Shell is. To sum it all up this movie just didn't do it for me and a lot of people will not care either it's just not good. Even the rating on IMDb will go way down by May it will probably be in the low 5s.3 Star because i am an objective person so i give 3 for the attempt to make a good movie but the plot and essence of this classic had been completely destroyed by Hollywood, again good job for destroying a great classic and oh the director for this movie did not help either you can tell he is an uninspired one. The movie has no substance to it by the end of the movie you just don't care for any of it that's on the director. Even with the script he had he couldn't execute the material.",Ghost in the Shell

702,disciple_of_sauron,An enjoyable watch for fans of Sci-Fi with great visuals but held back by mediocre dialogue,8,7 April 2017,"Hey there. This is the first review I've written for IMDb though I've been using the site daily for more than a decade now.I've watched Ghost in the Shell at the cinema 3 days ago, knowing beforehand about the controversies that have surrounded this movie for the last 6 months or so. Science fiction movies are probably my favorite genre and I also enjoyed most of Scarlett's movies for the past 8-9 years so those two factors were a plus for me going in. Regarding the whitewashing business, I think its been blown way, WAY out of proportion by social justice warriors with nothing better to do than drag media attention over whatever they're feeling insecure about this month/year. For those of you who might be on the fence about watching a Caucasian actress in the role that (supposedly) should've been reserved to an Asian actress, please consider this a NON-MATTER and watch it anyway. The character she is portraying is SUPPOSED to look Caucasian/white. It was the same in the source material and even the creator of that anime said so in interviews.Now, is the movie any good? In my opinion, yes. Yes it was. It wasn't amazing but at the very least entertaining. There is a good amount of people who score this a 1/10 because they are butt hurt that the story was changed a lot. Please ignore them and see for yourself even if you're a fan of the anime and are able to keep an open mind. I think maybe I was able to judge it more objectively because I had zero knowledge about the story in the anime going in, but, if nothing else, the movie actually made me want to watch those old ones to compare.The acting - 7.5/10 - Since Scarlett Johansson is the only big name that the movie is being marketed alongside, I'd say she did a good job. At no point in the movie could I say she didn't belong there. She played the part of cyborg who had difficulty belonging in a human world very well. The cast is diverse enough in my opinion, though some of them get pretty little screen time.The visuals - 9/10 - If there is one point most critics/viewers are in alignment concerning this movie, that point is definitely the visuals. The movie both looks and feels spectacular, with the futuristic city looking like a close-future mix of Blade Runner and TRON. The combination of CGI and practical effects looks organic, the movie's powerful themes of excessive self-augmentation and technology almost running amok represented very well visually.Soundtrack - 8/10 - Sometimes pretty subdued, sometimes almost-but-not-quite in your face, I found the soundtrack to vary between decent and very good in some moments. It didn't MAKE the movie but it enhanced a good deal in my opinion.Story - 7/10 - Here is where the good points of the movie kinda start to run dry. A lot of other people would probably rate it a lot lower, with 5 or 4's if they're at least trying to be objective. Yes, the story is fairly predictable, and the fact that the movie is only around 100 minutes long doesn't do it any favors either. Here is probably where most of the legitimate hate towards this movie stems from. The creators adapted a story that had a lot more depth and philosophical insight and turned it into a somewhat generic cyborg coming of age story mixed with an evil corporation doing questionable things. The villain is also very cookie-cutter and has almost zero depth. HOWEVER, I do think that concerning this film's particular themes and narrative, a weak villain doesn't hurt it so much since its more about losing/gaining your humanity through technology than any bad guy trying to shoot you.Writing/Dialogue - 6/10 - By far the movie's weakest aspect. In fact, I believe if some more meaningful dialogue and character interactions were written into this film, it could've easily been 1 or 2 points higher on anyone's scoring system. As it is, the dialogue is shallow and fairly run-of-the-mill for about half the movie's length. Some bits of good interactions are sprinkled here and there, and thankfully that's enough to preserve the soul of the movie's central theme of human souls surviving in machine bodies, BUT not enough to give Ghost in the Shell the depth it should've inherited from the source material.Overall - I gave this movie 8/10 stars here on IMDb, mostly because I couldn't give it a 7.5 which felt more appropriate to me. My advice would be to not listen to the whitewashing nonsense, because that's exactly what it is, nonsense. Also don't listen to the haters who rate this movie a 1/10 or call it crap because those people should not be reviewing anything to begin with. It is a decent movie, with great visuals and a theme that might get you thinking for a couple of days after seeing it. The acting is decent, with an above average performance from Scarlett and a good soundtrack that might hit the right spot on occasion. The only bad aspects, like I mentioned, are the film's rather short running time and weak dialogue/writing which hold it back from being truly great.",Ghost in the Shell

It is important to remember that over the years there have been many different iterations of Motoko Kusanagi. The original manga version being far different (visually) from the 1991 film, which was far different than the form Motoko takes in the sequel film released in 2004, which again is far different than the version we see in both TV series (Stand Alone Complex and Arise).With that in mind I cast aside my reservations and withheld any judgment of Scarlett Johansson being cast as Motoko, and for good reason. Anime/Manga-to-Live Action adaptations typically fall in one of two categories: American-made films and Japanese-made films. The American-made adaptations tend to suffer from a disconnect between hiring the actors that ""sell"" and hiring actors who actually fit the part. Japanese-made adaptations tend to suffer from hiring actors who visually (and culturally) fit the role, but do to the nature of the Japanese film industry, these actors are often underpaid and lacking in talent/experience as a result (see films such as GANTZ from 2010).While I may not be a fan of Scarlett Johansson I was surprised to find that not only does she physically fit Motoko's famous ""tough chick"" build, but her body language and personality quite well too. I see many reviews saying her acting was ""hollow"" and often ""expressionless"", however I feel these reviews are completely missing the point that she is ~95% machine, confused, alone, and not even convinced that she is human. If you were expecting her to be energetic, overly-animated, and girly then you have misunderstood Motoko Kusanagi's character altogether. Even Pilou Asbæk did an excellent job of portraying Batou's hard-headed, yet soft-hearted personality. Batou may be a Japanese character, but Pilou Asbæk' Batou is nearly a spitting image of the original character, which is likely why he was cast int he first place.The film does suffer from the occasional poorly-conceived dialogue and a few plot elements that could have been more fleshed out, but the overall experience is very faithful the whole Ghost in the Shell body of work. I find it unfair that reviewers champion films like Beauty & The Beast for being so faithful to the original, while harshly criticizing films like Ghost in the Shell for depicting so many iconic scenes from the original film(s) and referencing scenes from other elements of the Ghost in the Shell universe.In the end the film's explanation for Motoko's new body appearing Caucasian rather than Japanese isn't too difficult a pill to swallow as the company who built her (and the other soldiers) would clearly want to distance themselves from making their soldiers look identical to their original bodies to avoid anyone from recognizing their soldiers and drawing attention to their illegal experiments. This is further supported by Dr. Ouelet (a Caucasian woman) being the leading scientist behind developing Motoko's new body, her emotional attachment to Motoko, and at times even treating her as if she is her own daughter. An argument could certainly be made for Hollywood whitewashing, but this film actually goes out of its way to provide reasonable explanations and hints for why the non-cyborg Japanese characters are played by Japanese actors and those with cybernetic enhancements/prosthetic bodies look noticeably different, almost generically humanoid in terms of race. One may notice that the only cybernetically enhanced characters that still look Japanese are using very low-quality technology and their bodies are not full prosthetic (the Yakuza being an example). The end of the film finds Scarlett's character coming to terms with her Japanese ethnicity and accepting her Japanese mother back into her life, potentially setting up a sequel as she has found her true self while still perusing the life & purpose of the new person she has become.TL;DR - This film does not deserve even half the backlash that it has received. While I too would have liked the studio to explore other actresses for the role of Motoko, this film goes above and beyond to further the importance of female-lead hero films. Any comic book movie fan who has been asking for films centered around female characters like Black Widow, owe it to the future of the industry (and even Scarlett) to see and support this film. Boycotting it or leaving (biased) negative reviews will only tell Hollywood that female-lead action films are more trouble than they are worth, rather than seeing that there is potential for greatness, albeit still room to improve.",Ghost in the Shell
709,joanne-hadewiger,Why do people like this film,1,23 March 2019,"OK I know its not as bad as the Disney Star Wars but even if it were a stand alone film it is down there with the worst of the Hollywood remakes.1. There is not a single good performance from any of the actors. 2. The set design both outside and inside is derivative. 3. Llke many recent films it is filled with interminable action/chase scenes this is why both fans and critics hate it. 4. The story line is much simplified from the original works within the constraints of a mass market movie. 5. I disliked it and already forgot what was in it.

Ah, the plot: such as it is, is lame and shallow and doesn't even attempt to address any of the questions that GITS was all about. The anime movie took a chapter of the manga and expanded it a little to make a coherent story. This flick took the core idea of Robocop and dressed it up as GITS. Awful. Was Scarlett miscast? Well, she's a white actor playing the part of a Japanese woman. And she doesn't seem to make any effort to behave like a Japanese woman. She does seem to try and behave like a robot, which is pretty much the opposite of what GITS was saying, and is symptomatic of the complete lack of understanding of the source material displayed by the script, the director, and herself. Maybe she shouldn't have watched Robocop. If you know nothing about GITS, maybe you can watch this movie and see a second-rate sci-fi flick with some good visuals.

It was delightfully weird, such is all sci- fi anime. The visuals were stunning, and relentless. Each character had a great identity under their surface, though many critics would disagree (many of which were unfamiliar with the anime movie).The score sounded amazing. The whole feel of the movie is very enveloping. The pace is also perfect. by the end, the movie just feels so neatly wrapped up, it should have ribbon tied to it. Many movies nowadays feel very jittery and forced, but this had a great flow to it. Watch it. You might love it, you might hate it. But don't just hate on it because everyone else, and critics did.

And I have read much of the commentary both critical racial and political noise, which I will discuss later.Bottom line: this is a gorgeous movie that sticks faithfully to the universe. The actors, director and certainly the set/CG and costuming were all excellent. The first major scene in the Geisha house was amazing. I watched a second time simply because it was wonderful to look at.The story was a bit typical of these futuristic settings, whereas they feel they have to give the protagonist a way to discover their true self, despite the government or corporations or whatever. It's a pretty well worn path.However, it is also an acceptable one, given this movie was going to reach a larger audience.As far as the casting, yes, it would have made more sense to cast a Japanese actress. However, with an international star like Johansson the movie had a chance to make money and receive a proper budget. Right or wrong, it made sense, though many Japanese actresses could have rocked this part. I appreciate the conversation, but don't let it spoil the movie for you.That said, given their choice of Johansson, I don't know why they went with a futuristic Japanese setting. That's where things get a bit weird; most everyone is Japanese except Section 9? To be fair, the cartoons sort of go that way too.

I thought this adaptation of the story was very intriguing both visually and philosophically. Sure, some of the complexities from the original 1995 version have been simplified, but let's face it, the 1995 anime film is not for everybody. Johansson appears to have really taken her character seriously and I felt more depth to her character than I felt with the anime Major. I think this new adaptation will reach more people and hopefully get folks interested in the source material. If you are looking for a live action copy of the original, then go back and watch the original. If you enjoyed the 1995 GITS and the thought provoking concepts and issues it illustrates, then I believe that you will love this film as much as I do.

739,menesta,Not worth a single star,1,7 April 2017,"First and for most I've watched this movie twice.There are two ways to see this movie. First you can see the movie as a Ghost in the Shell live action adaptation of the original anime. The second way is to see it is as a original Sci-Fi movie. As if it would be an original movie.But this is not an original movie but a Ghost in the Shell adaptation. The problem with this adaptation is the director Rupert Sanders tried to do some sort of a comics adaptation and he definitely has no clue about anime.He tried to make some sort of Batman sequel/prequel thing. He tried to add backstories which are totally irrelevant for Ghost in the Shell. They definitely don't belong to this movie.Ghost in the Shell is not some kind of Batman movie where audience is trying to figure Joker's past or Batman's past.Now as we talk about whitewashing it definitely was a bad choice. There is a mix of Japanese and American actors in there which definitely do not fit. It is supposed to be in Japan, and you have a lot of American actors and then you have a lot of Japanese actors which many times speak a bad English or Japanese. Many times an actor speaks English and the other Japanese.Then they put American actors in a Japanese room and it's so obvious they don't belong there. And as it comes to recreating the anime characters, other than Major and Batou all the other characters are so different from the anime both in terms of looks as well as personality. Even Batou and the Major were very different from anime.But the most screwed character was definitely the hacker. I could not believe they did that. Awful.As it comes to the scenes replicated 1:1 they also fail big time.If you see it as an original movie it fails in so many aspects. A lot of bad dialogues, poor acting and poor story structure. So many on the nose dialogues.There is even more in the graphics department. In many parts the CGI is absolutely horrible, many parts that have no role.I gave it one star just because I couldn't give it zero stars. That's how much it really deserves.

I thought the adaptation was very good. The visuals are very strong. The action is excellent. The adaptation of the source material seems honest and sincere. The story line and some of the character development choices miss the bull's eye for me, but I can't say that they are bad or wrong. It felt like to me that instead of taking a chance on making it completely true to the complex concepts of self and humanity, that they took a chance on a less complex story in hopes of grabbing more seats.They chose to emphasize the Major over developing the team work aspect. The source material has the advantage of numerous episodes to explore the teams unique personal qualities, so I get that they have a limited amount of time to use to fill out multiple key characters. The Hollywood approach of focusing on the leads and deemphasizing the team saves time and generally results in a personal movie. I hope that they get the opportunity to make a sequel to fill in more of the characters. The sound of the movie is very good too, and keen ears will have noticed themes from prior sound tracks.

It's not a bad film. Standing alone it's an OK action/sci-fi film. As a live action recreation of the GITS universe it falls flat. Why? 1. It somewhat misses (or ignores) the point of the original Ghost in the Shell even though the term is used in the film. 2. It has none of the rich backstory of the universe in which GITS exists. With all the material which has gone before a better picture could have been painted of this future world and how it got to be what it is. 3. The Section 9 team were not a team. The banter and humanity of the section was lost in the glare of the spotlight on The Majors story. Motivations were also unclear partly because of the lack of backstory.A cynical view says the story may have suffered from being dumb-ed down and then being passed through an internationalising process to remove anything which could potentially have caused offence.Being optimistic there is so much material from the original stories that there is opportunity to correct the errors in the sequels.",Ghost in the Shell

While I understand that Johanssen's character is supposed to be a robotic body housing a human mind, it really irritates that she moves her body as if trying to look robotic. Gait mechanics are much less complex than neural interfaces - if you can make a robot that looks human, and interface an actual human brain, you can't make one that walks normally? Pass.

I will re-watch the anime for sure.As for the plot, it was simplified but I have expected it to be, so it didn't come as a surprise. Some of the scenes were also simple, and maybe felt a little bit blunt. However, I believe it still wasn't enough to ruin the experience. At least for me. I have seen much worse in big movies/adaptations in the past years. The length of the film was also just right.I somewhat can understand the disappointment of the die hard fans.

Simply put: too easy for old fans and too hard for young ones. For example I am a fan of the 1995 manga movie but I really liked this one even though it wasn't as deep as the first movie.

Got quite excited when I first learnt that they are doing a live action, but the actual movie fell short of the hype.I think the problem is that it is trying to cater to everyone, cramming all the stuff that G.I.S. spent a few dozen episode to go through, into a standard movie time.The result is another typical book/long story adaptation scenario -- No time for subtlety and development, gotta introduce everything in the first 1/3, show the conflict in the next 1/3, and show down for the last.***********POTENTIAL SPOILER*****************The conflict depicted in the G.I.S. series is not one sudden incident, it was a web of minor incidents and the diversity within the crew of PSB Section 9, eventually all pointed toward the core topic of ""What makes us human?"".The original series, though presented mostly through Major Kusanagi, the viewer also got to see all the different team member's opinions towards adapting to cybernetics. From Togusa's ""don't even trust a semi-auto pistol"" type of conservative view, to Bato's ""other than vital systems, everything else is battle oriented cybernetic"" utilitarian view. Then you got the two extreme cases, Major Kusanagi with complete cybernetic, yet human body, and the the Tachicoma battle tank AIs' fully autonomous consciousness with diverse personalities, yet in a machine body. All these took hours of show time to give the viewer to start pondering ""Will I define Tachicoma AI as a person? How is Majot Kusanagi so different from the Tachicomas, as she can also survive within the Net without a body?

Nothing could have prepared me for the immersion and dystopia of the senses that brought home so many important issues of the technological age. The acting was far better than expected, the script was believable and the visual effects were stunning. I've not seen a movie about the future that touched me so much since Her. As we are nearing the age of cybernetic enhancement this was the perfect psychological thriller of how our consciousness might be transported in the future. The urban landscape created by the film was haunting and the story built up to an amazing 2nd half of the film, with not poignant but colossal insights into the very core of the human condition. The movie retained some of it's ""Asian feel"" that greatly improved the overall impact. While it had elements of ""Hollywood"", it's core features transcended any transhumanistic vision Hollywood could spawn. I have not been philosophically moved by a film of this magnitude in quite some time, an instant classic in my sci-fi obsessed voyage into the future. The layers to this movie are deep and other-worldly and yet so intimately near when we consider how fast technology will exponential change the human condition post 2025.",Ghost in the Shell

It pique my interest early on and through the rest of the movie. The action is amazing. The visual is amazing. The main characters are great. At first I dislike the actor playing Batou(Not enough muscle. Too many smiles.). But in the end, I find he played the role well. I also like the villain.

Good one Major. All in all, fan wise, this movie maybe can fill the cup.

756,raminbahari,"Best anime adaptation so far, lacks the original vision for the future (No spoilers)",8,23 April 2017,"OK, so you probably read the other comments and you're trying to figure out what to think of this movie. First let me go trough the parts really quick (TL/DR below):Visually: 9/10 - The creators really blew me away with a lot of the CG and special effects love put into the film. The scenes that were borrowed and recreated from the original gave me goose bumps.Overall Acting & cast: 8/10 - The makers did a great job of selecting the characters and especially Batou was 100/100. Even his love for dogs and long hounds (sorry bad at dog types).ScarJoe as Major: 9/10 - Really can't see the criticism here. She does a great job and also really looks like the Major.Directing and Cinematography: 7/10 - While some scenes referencing the original anime were great, I thought it lost some of the 'weird' 'uncomfortable' but very ascetic shots the anime had in favor of more 'action'-type shots. Script (THE BIG ONE): 6/10 0 A lot of people are really stuck on the part that this movie is a simplified version of the original, in terms of the psychological and ethical dilemma's that made us think after we saw the original. And I agree. I was 14 when I watched the original and it blew my mind. And so we're a lot of other 14 year old minds in the day. We watched it over and over and became otaku's after. I think that's what people are expecting again. If you think about the idea of the original script, it was a new story and vision about what makes us human vs what makes us a machine. This topic was very new and untapped at that time. Since the original GITS hundreds of films were made out of the inspiration this film has caused - pretty much every sci-fi film out there about man vs machine.After watching this film I felt some nostalgia, but it didn't make me think about the future and the man vs machine relationship the way the original did. And it's because it clearly wasn't the choice of the makers. They wanted to tap into the nostalgia and make it a homage for a wider audience.But if they started in a different spot... If they would have started with the original idea ""let's make a new story about what makes us human vs what makes us a machine"" they could have build upon the GITS vision and the ideas of other sci-fi movies to makes something truly new and mind-blowing. A recent example was the film ""Machinima"". It plays with the same tension, but is a truly mind- blowing film. Just like the Black Mirror series.It was great seeing the Major again, at the same time I would have appreciated a totally new take on the theme. One that takes us another 20 years forward. And a movie I would re-watch 10 times, like the original GITS.TL/DR As a homage this is the best anime film so far, but they didn't nail what made the film great in the first place: a new vision for the idea and philosophy of ""what makes us human vs what makes us machine""",Ghost in the Shell
757,rickard-joh,Ghost in the shell does not have a ghost at all.,2,1 April 2017,Motoko is reduced to a whining little teen girl. The art team did a solid job but it's completely wasted on the complete lack of story and depth. They should have had plenty of content to work with to be able to carveout a decent movie but more or less the removed the rough and interesting edges. It's a cliché Hollywood movie wearing a ghost in shell costume with some iconic scenes throw into the blender from the animation. I would avoid this movie if you are a ghost in the shell fan you will be bored to the maximum. Scarlett Johansson is as dull as a rock as usual.,Ghost in the Shell
758,gorg-basil,Went to see it 3 times,7,16 April 2017,"This is what I do when I see a good movie: I go see it again. Saw it with different people. Haven't heard a bad thing from them about this film. I did see multiple times GITS anime (all) and I'm no stranger when it comes down to cyberpunk.I was searching stuff on this site about this film and found: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219827/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv (A Care2 petition against the film's casting titled ""DreamWorks: Stop Whitewashing Asian Characters!"" received over 104,000 signatures.)Right, I said... some people like to judge things even before they should. But apparently some of those brainless yet pretentious punks are now reviewing negatively this movie. (at the moment of writing this: 14 260 people voted between 1-6 and 27 125 people voted between 7-10)For me this was a great experience. Beautiful shots, very good casting, dedicated actors who did their job flawlessly, a plot that respects it's audience and stays true to the original material, great visuals, very good sound, memorable quotes.I'm not trying to convince anyone that this film is great, I'm trying to point out that there is way too much hate.Have a good one!",Ghost in the Shell
759,william-james-ve,A fun ride!!! Very respectful to the source material.,9,3 April 2017,"I have to completely disagree with the negative reviews on this one.As an old time fan of the source material, I think this movie was a fun ride with incredible visuals and a nice arrangement that stand itself apart from the source material (you know... something new) while paying homage to it in a very respectful and smart way. I'm sad to see so much hate from the so called fans of the original, who instead of welcoming the new addition to the franchise for what it is, they prefer to infinitely and unfairly comparing it the original (this are the same guys that applaud the very average ARISE).While the movie is not perfect (some cliché dialog here and there) I was completely engaged during my two viewings, I think ScarJo nailed the character of the Mayor and the supporting cast was even more awesome (Aramaki, Batou, Kuze and even mom Kusanagui were very interesting to say the least) the fan service was completely integrated into story instead of being random things thrown in your face (I'm looking at you Force Awakens...), the world was dream like and at the same time realistic and the investigation itself was interesting and gave the film a very noire touch, and the action scenes were well constructed, well timed and as intense as the more visceral video game (Deus Ex brought to the big screen) the seamless integration of CGI and Practical effects were beyond perfect and never took you out of the movie (I'm looking at you Rogue One).About the whole ""Scarlet's mayor was flat""... have you seen the anime??? Mayor is flat, bland and inexpressive... it's a freaking robot!!! Any rating for this movie below 6/10 it's evil and snobbish and it represent the worst of the internet era. This movie it's a solid 7/10 for me (for some people even an 8, 9 or 10).Again, the people in general who are giving low scores to this movies are the same people who gave The Force Awakens (episode 4 rip off) and Rogue One (a movie with no character development whatsoever) 9s and 10s... it's not that I didn't like them but for Christs sake BE CONSISTENT! THE GOOD:-Perfect visuals.-Perfect photography.-Perfect Soundtrack.-Perfect Casting.-Solid World.-Interesting investigation.-The Mayor.-The supporting cast.-The first villain (Kuze).-The Action.-The little philosophical bits.-The twist (racial-controversy/name resolution with a very emotional flavor) -Spider-Bot Battle THE BAD: -The second villain (Corporate evil guy number 232937829380)-Not as deep as the original.-No chorus in the construction/birth scene (although the music was good) -No singularity/fusion/new-life-form for the mayor in favor of the chance to bring ScarJo back for the sequel (not exactly bad but very studio driven) -""We cling to our memories as if they define us, But what we do defines us"". By far the lowest thing in the movie, a complete rip off of the super hero genre(specifically Batman Begins)and a completely unnecessary cheap-philosophy catch phrase in a story that clearly didn't needed it. Do not underestimate your audience.OVERALL: 7/10 A fun, visually awe inspiring and interesting investigation movie set in a more than interesting cyberpunk/dystopian world. The most fateful adaptation of an anime by far. With some week script points and clichés, but a solid hit non the less. Already waiting for a sequel!!! (sorry for my bad English)",Ghost in the Shell

762,spidermanchan315,"""Major"" Disappointment",4,1 April 2017,"I am going to begin by stating that I have never seen the original Ghost in the Shell anime series, therefore I provide no comparison to this adaptation. I went into the movie having an open-mind and honestly neutral opinion about the movie. That being said, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of plot and various times where the CGI lacked.Again, this is only my opinion: I felt that this movie ended the same way as it began, but provided no change in Major's perspective. To me, it felt as if the whole point of the movie was moot. Once she discovers that she isn't the only robot who had a human brain implanted into her, she goes on a search to discover who she was and to take down Mr. Cutter (the superfluous villain of the story). Once she realizes her past and also comprehends the murder of the girl whose brain was implanted in her, the movie quickly wraps up.However, at the end she doesn't use her name- she just refers to herself as ""Major"" even though the whole movie ALL SHE WANTED WAS TO FIND HER NAME AND BE HER OWN PERSON. Yet, she goes back to the same job and works for the same man and does the same exact thing as she did in the beginning of the movie without any proper implication that she utilizes her name or even cared about the whole journey of discovery. Not only that, but in order to catch the villain, Major's boss, Aramaki, just told the Prime Minister that Cutter was bad and then told Cutter that he was going to prison. Once the villain realizes he is out of options, tries to kill Aramaki- but Aramaki just shoots him instead. So- for two whole hours, was Cutter really that hard to take down? Why didn't Major just shoot him in the beginning? Or better yet, when she's escaping with the help of Dr. Ouelet- why didn't she break into the room Cutter was in and KILL HIM THEN? Or if she didn't want to kill him in order to not be framed for the destruction of the Section, she could have broken into the room and detained Cutter; this would have allowed for Ouelet to stay alive and be a key witness in the horrific events that Cutter had done and provide proof that Major was innocent. It was weak is the best summation I can say. The plot provided no memorable or important message, no change in the main characters, and the climax was just one minor character killing the villain. Plus in instances you can clearly tell when CGI is being used (the overview of the city and when Johansson is climbing up a building in the climactic fighting scene).I will say the good things about this movie as well:Kuze was a very dynamic and important character to the story. He provided insight into the minds of the ""rejected robots"" while providing help to Major. In addition, Major's best friend, Batou, was also a brief relief to the plot because of his struggle with his newly robotic eyes and his soft-heart (especially for dogs). Lastly, I will say the actual metal robots they built and Johansson's suit were unbelievably cool. In addition, when you saw the street view of the city, that was well done and reminded me of Blade Runner, so much respect on that front.I just wish the positives made up for the unresolved plot.",Ghost in the Shell

767,sramsey-janus,"Strong on it's own merits, weaker as an adaptation",8,7 April 2017,"I am a Ghost in the Shell fan but I didn't let that bias me when watching the movie. I went in expecting to be a little disappointed, not because of reviews or casting controversy, but because it's an adaptation and they are rarely as good as the original. But, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised.This must be reviewed two ways: 1. As it's own entity - Firstly, it is visually stunning. You will be hard pressed to find better cinematography this year. The action is solid and interesting, the acting up to spec although there is nothing that particularly stands out. The main themes ask the questions of how we value consent and whether that would be diluted in a world where your memories and identity can be manipulated without you ever knowing. They also ask how we define humanity in a cyborg world but this is a little heavy handed at times. My biggest criticism is that sometimes the film seems to abandon logic in a few small circumstances. In Hollywood action movies this wouldn't matter but Ghost in the Shell is more intelligent than that so it was a little disappointing to see. Overall though it's a clever and exciting sci-fi thriller. Stand Alone Score: 8/102. As an adaptation - Of what though? This film takes material from the original manga, and also the TV series and movies which were separate adaptations as well. There is no such thing as a loyal adaptation of Ghost in the shell's story. To date, This is the fourth attempt. So how do we compare? Well we look at the themes again. The question of how we define humanity in a world of increasing cyberization is central to the franchise. The film addresses this but in a way that lacks the subtlety of previous incarnations. Having said that, it asks questions and adds emotional heft that previous installments have never attempted and it's stronger for it. This helps it contribute to the franchise - it's not just a pale copy. The other thing to judge is the story beats it takes from the other material. The villain is from the TV show, many visuals and fight scenes are taken from the movie, the opening scene is a blending of those from both the animated film and it's sequel. By taking these scenes and folding them into a new story it lets the movie feel familiar while also adding something new. Will fans be disappointed that it's not a beat for beat adaptation? Probably, we usually are, but in this case I think the film is better for it. Adaptation score: 7I recommend this movie. It has been buried under negative reviews fueled by casting controversies that don't have any impact on the movie itself. A hugely underrated film and one that will be vindicated in the future as have so many other movies that opened with terrible reviews and went on to be revered.",Ghost in the Shell

And Filmed During The Day?,2,31 March 2017,"Ghost in the Shell is yet another Hollywood adaptation of a classic Japanese Anime and like all the others, it falls flat on its face with simple characters, a boring plot and a conclusion ripped from every scifi anime/video game ever.Ghost in the Shell tells the story of Major (Johansson) who is a cyborg government agent/cop/SWAT/counter terrorism agent(It's never really explained who she works for) who is hunting down a cyber terrorist who is killing scientists who were part of a secret team that would later be responsible for Major's creation. Major is a cyborg that is completely robot except for a human brain to create the ultimate weapon, the best of both human and machine. Throughout the film Major is haunted by ""glitches"", images suddenly appear before her and she isn't sure if they are something from her past or nothing at all. It isn't until she meets the cyber terrorist, Kuze(Michael Pitt) that she begins to doubt herself and everything she stands for and begins to wonder what is real and what is fake. After this, the film suddenly rushes to the climax of the film and feels as if a lot of the film had been cut out.If anyone says that this film isn't Whitewashing obviously hasn't seen the film as the ""plot twist(?)"" revolves around Major discovering her past and who she is. It is so terribly done that it is like watching someone say they are innocent of a crime while committing said crime. They didn't even try.What could have been a saving grace for the film are the Major's Response Team which was made up of diverse and potentially awesome characters that would have been cool to get to know if they were in more than two scenes(other than Pilou Asbæk's Batou and Takeshi Kitano's Aramaki). They were a waste and should have been used. Absolutely ANYONE else could have been Major in this film as Scarlett Johansson proves that she has little to no range in her performances. The only reason she is in the movie is so the production companies can use the starpower of her name and face to promote the film. Throughout the film she is emotionless, looks like she would rather be anywhere else, and her posture and movement is painful to look at that it reminds me of a badly programmed video game character from 15 years ago.With a combination of: other than Batou and Aramaki, there are no characters that come close to being likable, the first hour + just drags on with little to no story progression, the ""plot twist""(and it's barely that) is so embarrassingly badly written that it makes bad M. Night Shyamalan twists look good, Johansson's performance is dreadful, the random over the top video game-ish final fight is out of place and too many CGI city shots(although gorgeous) makes Ghost in the Shell one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time.",Ghost in the Shell

OK, I get it, you have no life, GITS was your life, and this movie was the worst thing to happen to you since you were born. Life sucks, now, stop downrating this movie so other people who have never gotten into the whole GITS thing can go check out this movie and enjoy it like I did.2. Whitewashing? OMG. Do you have eyes? All Japanese anime comes pre-whitewashed! Like, duh, the Japanese want to look like Caucasians, so they draw their anime characters, especially super hero types, to look just like White Europeans! Oh, sorry, you didn't know? How long have you been watching Japanese anime? Do you actually know what a real Japanese woman looks like? And I mean a real Japanese woman who hasn't had plastic surgery to make her eyes and nose look more Caucasian, that is. Yes, that's the harsh truth - it's very common for Japanese women and men to get eyelid plastic surgery to make them look like Caucasian eyes (Koreans do this even more). So, when was the last time you pulled out your treasured DVD/BluRay of the GITS anime movie and actually looked at how the facial features of Motoko Kusanagi were drawn? I mean I just took one look at some individual images on the internet, and like, hey Motoko may have a Japanese name, but she sure looks like a White European woman to me, and Scarlett Johansson is a pretty darn good representation of this character, as drawn, by the Japanese.3. I'm a Game of Thrones fan too, and have never read the books. The book fans long ago gave up criticizing the HBO show for not following the books and simplifying the story and cutting huge amounts of stuff out. The HBO show stands out by itself. Really, live action movies have to simplify things from the original book. And speaking of GOT, I really loved seeing Euron Greyjoy play a good guy with ScarJo in this movie. Didn't quite catch Khal Moro's part in this movie, will have to see it again.4.

However, this was not the case. Apart from being in awe of how visually stunning it was (props to the cinematographer), I found myself relatively bored throughout. The pacing was off and even in what should have been exciting fight scenes I was not captured and I was even yawning.

That's why I read the reviews here and the 7,x rating was convincing too. So I went to a cinema with a friend of mine and it was devastating. The beginning was not even that bad, the music (by Clint Mansell) and the effects are also decent. But the story is HORRIBLE. Incoherent, simply absolutely terrible. No act of suspense, no deep connections between the characters and no profundity. I even gave the movie a few chances but ultimately I left the cinema hall after about 40 minutes. The only way to explain the positive ratings is that these are fake (isn't it weird that from 7,6 or so the rating fell to 6,7?) . I won't fall for them again and inform myself better next time. Usually you can say that movies having a rating over 7 must be decent (in the most cases), but don't count on the rating when the movie is in the cinema, the movie industry is not stupid. Eventually the movie is going to get the rating it deserves.",Ghost in the Shell
781,korstp,Ghost in the Shell without the ghost.,7,2 April 2017,"Saw the 3D version. As an avid fan of the original 1995 anime, this 2017 remake was poorly served by Hollywood dumbing it down and changing the fundamental story and plot. It truly disappointed me because the reason they are even making the 'Hollywood' version 20 years after the original is the narrative stood the test of time. ""Ghost in the Shell"" has a worldwide following because the narrative resonated but of course Hollywood thought they could do it better which ended up so typical of Hollywood remakes, a disappointment. While it is fine as a plain scifi action film it totally lacked the nuance and depth of the original. Everything that made the original classic and resonant was stripped out and replaced by a simplified 'good guy vs bad guy' narrative which has lead to Hollywood movies all being so generic nowadays.The 2017 version is fine if you have never seen the original. It is not a terrible film just not even on the same playing field as the 1995 version which has surely disappointed fans of the original who hoped for a truly updated movie benefitting from 20 years of technological advancement in graphics. The casting was fine, the acting was fine, recreated scenes from the original were fine if a little rushed and clumsy but the changes to the narrative ruined it. That the original music score was neglected also detracted from the whole. The music created an atmospheric resonance in the original which was completely lacking in the 2017 version.Perhaps what annoyed me the most was the doctor talking about the Major's 'ghost' still being present when in actual fact what she was talking about was her consciousness. Calling it a 'ghost' felt, to me at least, just a pathetic attempt to tie it to the original idea when in reality this version completely omitted the 'ghost' aspect of the first movie. However, the people I saw it with had never seen the original and liked the film. I liked the 3D work which really did add a dimension to the film worth experiencing. On the whole it is a very well made movie in every aspect except for narrative. It is not Ghost in the Shell but it is a good movie.",Ghost in the Shell

783,D-PadRadio,"More than a popcorn flick, less than a mind-bender",7,3 April 2017,"As a fan of the cyberpunk genre, or anything sci-fi for that matter, this movie succeeded in scratching an itch that I've needed scratching for a while. If there was anything that this movie did well, it was successfully merging the dazzling futuristic visual aesthetics with the gritty and dark undertone of detective noir. I hadn't seen any film hit the cyberpunk nail so finely on the head since the first time I'd seen Blade Runner. Mix that with a surprisingly good soundtrack, and I'll give the setting of this movie a solid 10/10.The movie is not perfect though. It did suffer from having a cookie-cutter plot (secret agent, has no memory about her past, sets out to find her identity) and the action was mediocre. You can tell the writers wanted to play with deep existential themes, but didn't really have the courage to risk being too hard for the masses to understand. So they tried to play it safe and just make it a good action flick, but even that fell short. The action scenes start to go stale towards the end, and the movie sort of plateaus after the initial excitement.If you are a fan of the original 1995 film, you will likely not be disappointed. Sure, they did change the story around for a broader audience, but it fits. The original anime, although a masterpiece in its own right, was very dialogue heavy and slow paced. Rupert Sanders took the liberty of westernizing the story a bit, but still included some fan service (some shots and lines taken directly from the original) so that fans could still see their favorite anime movie come to life. I've been seeing a lot of backlash and criticism from the die hard fans, saying that this film is a ""dumbed down"" version of the original. I'm not going to deny that claim, but if you could watch a live action exact replica of the 1995 anime, would you really want to?Overall, the film is entertaining and certainly deserves a watch. I was satisfied, and so was my girlfriend who knew nothing about GITS before going into the theater. At the very least, I see this movie becoming a cult classic of the cyberpunk genre, and heck, it was better than Johnny Mnemonic.",Ghost in the Shell

I disagree with the reviews that talk about ""white washing"". It is a very western thing and shouldn't be a reason for disliking a movie; the creator of GitS said he didn't mind that she was cast because the Android body doesn't have a race, it's not a natural human body.

After watching it I was compelled to write a review. Because it's ""what we do that defines us"" and ""it's justice"".Let's begin with visuals. Color spectrum is not coherent and you feel like you're watching an Ibiza party on acid in some scenes. CGI is plainly awful (although there are some nice effects, they are ruined by non-realistic ragdolls and bad 3D perspective). Visuals are the best part of the movie.The dialogues feel as they were written by a three year old. They usually don't offer any insight into the characters and sometimes feel so artificial you'll wonder if all the heroes are dull robots.Characters. Oh boy. Scarlett Johannson as Major is perhaps the worst cast since Tommy Wiseau. She's weak. Soft. Crying. Uncertain. It's like they took Motoko Kusanagi from the original and made her into an EXACT OPPOSITE. Plot. Man this is one dumb movie. It has no philosophical elements. Shooting and punching in the face. No plot twist. You can tell what's going to happen by third minute (and that's the time you should leave by the way). TLDR:If you've watched anime get a restraining order against this movie. If you haven't watched anime do the same thing. Unless you think Captain America is the pinnacle of cinematography. GITS was ruined by this movie. It's just terrible.

792,mmackey-72535,An overall undeserved beating for an ultimately great movie.,9,11 February 2018,"As this movie approached theaters there was an almost turn of events that led to people feeling like it was an ugly picture to go see and it seemed like the media got on that hype train helping render it a global failure that it DID NOT remotely deserve. The ticket sales evaporated by and large based on the grievances anime fanboy's had in it casting white characters into roles that in the anime were by and large... white characters. *gasping* I mean... did we really expect them to put Jackie Chan in as Batou? Jet Li as Kuze? Maggie Q as Major? The casting was EXTREMELY well done and provided the character appearances to their anime persona's in a very faithful way regardless of skin color or country of origin. Why this became the sticking point to a movie produced for global audiences is beyond me. It is a very Nationalistic world right now and so many lines drawn in the sand about race, creed, culture are dividing a society that needs to come together in greater appreciation.And the greater irony in many reviews? That it stuck too closely to the script in most capacities. ?!? What?!? The whole point of bringing a story from Anime to big production movie... is to take a great storyline and depict it in live-action to an audience that may or may not EVER watch the anime! As someone that has watched both the anime and the movie... I thought they did a great job of remaining faithful to a good body of the original script and even recapturing some of the original anime scenes respectfully to the original.And where they deviated? I honestly felt it left things left ambiguous and more humane. In the anime I got less of a sense of the torment and pain that Major felt in having her ghost's history erased than I did with Scarlett's portrayal in the movie. I felt like Kuze's character was faithful to ""The Puppet Master"" in the anime without having the hokey ""Puppet Master"" name attributed. Both portrayed robotic figures very well showing the sense of emotionless facade that you generally attribute with machines, but... the reality unfolding of finding out who they are (and the inner emotion that isn't facially expressed) helped the inner human of their ghosts come out to reveal the torment they were under. Yes... you don't see the emotion through their shell, but I never felt you did in the anime either. I thought that was kind of... the point?I saw a review blasting that there was no backstory and the reality was... they kept the backstory from you to build suspense! Reality... the anime started out the exact same way. The long starting sequence during the credits was literally grifted from the long starting sequence from the anime (faithfully reproduced with minor creative freedoms). And the deviation in Major in the movie pining to know her past, to find out her history, the questions as to why she doesn't remember so much... and the glitches that pop in/out that give her clues and semblances were a nice touch that built along the way. You learned that the medication she was given and told would help her was actually there to suppress and block her past from coming back to her (as Kuze told her). In many ways, this was FAR less ambiguous than the open ended nature of the anime's story which didn't really seem to tie up the loose ends or add the human element back in. Had they just gone in and showed you that from minute one... why bother with the rest of the movie? LoL I mean, you kind of want to unravel the fact that this big business robotics industry is stealing people's ghosts, corruptly mutilating their bodies to steal their brains, and embed them into robots to try to build elite robotic fighters/weapons for armies for the future? If we were told that from minute one... there'd not be a whole lot more to tell or much reason to watch the rest of the movie. In that vain, I thought the writing was very well done. I felt the emotionless state of Scarlett's face was a very digital persona that hid the inner torments and questions that lurked through various capacities in the story that unfolded over time.Having Major learn of and know her mother, having her know of her past, having her know that she was an anti-technologist runaway that had her human life taken from her and her ghost severed from her original human shell to be put into a technological robotic shell (with far more idealistic visual depictions that fall inline with even the very nature of ""large eyed"" anime characters derived from a more western visual than Asian culture) and the 
obvious future suffering to endure knowing that which you stood against is now the very embodiment of your current existence? There's a layer of complexity to both accepting it (no choice) and trying to maintain or find as much of her previous livelihood as she possibly can, even with her love in Kuze being taken from her (again). It is her new balance that she has to endure going forward. She was handed lemons, she's trying to make the best lemonade she can... while doing what she does in the here and now.People want to say... ""It's not the anime"" that are anime fans. True. But if you went in anticipating it being the anime, you're missing the point and you're selling the movie short. It's unfair to expect it to be the anime. And yet there's a large number of anime fans that felt like the storyline for the movie should be completely different, or felt like the characters shouldn't look anything like the original anime, or felt like the movie gave away too much and should've been as ambiguous as the anime. To which point... why even do Ghost in the Shell if it's NOT Ghost in the Shell? If you're going to be creative with it, it should at least remain 80% faithful to the original and I felt it was EASILY that close. I feel they did an exceptional job, I felt it was faithful where it mattered and more humane when it absolutely and necessarily improved the plot. I give it 9 stars.",Ghost in the Shell

Anyone with half a brain should know making the original its impossible even in 2017. You are looking at a production employing thousands of people with high salaries that need to be paid. People expect the director to go total indie and create something philosophical and complex as the original without realizing that such movie 100% will fail with an American audience. Not disrespecting Americans but the society here is not even close where GITS stands. The social changes within the GITS world has gone way beyond what we are right now in USA. We are rather a backward xenophobic society (hence the whitewashing) and you want a Hollywood company to risk millions and create something that has aged beyond what we are at. Well its not going to happen. Have in mind the original is more like a cult movie in US. You go out and ask people nobody knows what GITS is. Its anime, its manga, and a certain group of (highly intelligent) diverse group of people are into those. Watching the GITS is like staring into a Crystal ball. It would take another 100 years for our society to understand its complex world full of details and hidden messages.Now the movie itself. Its a little gem. It starts slow. Seems like the makers of this movie were almost obsessive with the original environment and it looks amazing an faithful. The story is dumped down to a revenge story to sell and be understandable within our society. It hurts because such beautiful movie could've been so much if we actually could stick to the original script but as I said that is just impossible right now. It be me and 10 more people watching that production while rest of the country scratching their heads. The movie picks up after the introduction phase and becomes very powerful toward the end. Michael Pitt portrayal for Kuze is nothing short of amazing so if you are GITS fan you will start to like the movie from that point on.My advise is to look at this movie for what it is.

800,boshrocks,Too much,2,11 April 2017,It has some good points but it felt rushed. Perhaps the script was changed at the last minute or maybe it was intended to feel like they were trying to cram an entire season into one film. It's not a long film but it felt much longer. There were several points they could have ended it satisfactorily but didn't. It's almost as though they had no faith in their film and didn't believe it would earn a sequel. They also whitewashed the cast and awkwardly tried to explain it away in an almost painful scene where Major meets her Japanese mum.

802,kitsuneiyama,"Just Because It's Pretty, Doesn't Mean It's Good",2,27 July 2017,"Beautiful, absolutely stunning scenery. A technological masterpiece combining daily, possibly modern life with the beautiful aspects of Eastern Asian culture (Hong Kong and Japan). The detail and complexity is perhaps the highlight of the film and what drew me (and many others) into watching this. The fights were amazing (as all Hollywood action sequences are) and Scarlett Johansson has once again met expectations for a big movie. That is all the good things in the movie. But they hardly outweigh the issues (unfortunately). I really would prefer not to hash out the whole argument about casting but really? You gave her a Japanese mother for goodness sake. Also, a lot of the roles that had a screen time longer than three minutes were white. I would be perfectly fine with Johansson being the main lead. But making the majority of the cast that actually talks white? Seriously?Moving on, this story was..... I don't even know. I didn't get it. I have never watched the original, but it seems the main character was trying to find her previous life (and herself). I could kind of see it in this movie but it was very weak. I can't tell if that was the plot or a subplot. It's also follows the Marvel Superhero Cliché. Some of the dialogue and scenes were so Marvel that I'm kind of surprised this doesn't belong to them. *I'm about to give a spoiler for Wonder Woman.*For example, in Wonder Woman, a being talks with her and tells her that they do not belong on this planet. Therefore, she should join the being and destroy the human race.*SPOILER END*That is the exact same as what happened near the end of the movie. I like the action scenes. But it felt like half the time, it was just action. A movie cannot entirely consist on violence. You need a point. You need a reason why you do this (which they had). But you also need to make it reasonably balanced with what you're trying to get the audience to learn. I regret watching this. It's very disappointing and somewhat frustrating to see another possible Asian cast movie get whitewashed again. I feel bad for the criticism (mine included) of Scarlett Johansson. She did an amazing job and brought a fair amount of life to a very dull script and boring movie. But a lone actress cannot keep a movie afloat.

There's a few but, there certainly aren't enough intelligent portrayals of the inner lives of robots and those that are robotically enhanced.The next best example I can think of is Blade Runner. But whereas Blade Runner (adapted from a novel) is told from a very human point of view, Ghost in the Shell takes you so much deeper in to the world of cyborgs that you forget what human is, and you are lost in Masamune Shirow's (the manga writer) very possible future.As a fan of the anime as well, I also enjoyed the subtleties that showed up in little places like Scarlett Johansson's posture, perfectly done.I am certainly surprised by the general critical response. As other reviewers have noted, this is a little scary because other brilliant, insightful and just plain different Japanese science fiction stories need to be retold for the big screen and for Western audiences and for me. As it is, with Ghost in the Shell not making big returns at the box office, we are doomed to keep getting mind numbing predictable crap (Terminator vs. Transformers 7). There are just far to many good ideas that Hollywood passes by. But movies are a risky business, and if no one wants to go see the good ones, the same old crap will get the funding.My biggest regret of the year is that I did not see Ghost in the Shell in the theater, in 3D. I listened to a friend who said it wasn't good. After seeing the movie on DVD, I re-asked the same friend what he didn't like and found that he didn't really know ~ something about Scarlett Johansson not being Japanese enough.

I have watched my share of anime from Japan (probably ten of them in my 31 years) but I had never watched Ghost In The Shell. For those who do not know it is a Japanese TV series and films with sequel. It is about cyber crime and what is life and what is just a machine.I hope this is helpful for you out there.I went to watch the film as a first date with a fan. The guy loved and watched the original and could tell you all about the Section, the Chief, The Major and Mega Tech. He was unimpressed because the major lacked nudity, music was not in the right place and also the film assumed it is more clever and knows more than the original.Whatever the case, I thought the action was good. Think like Matrix and its sequels. There are some impressive effects. Scarlet Johansson was too dry and robotic, but perhaps she is supposed to be. I mean she is a robot basically. Then again, I never liked her. I mean she is the extra and unneeded character in the Avengers.

Without spoiling anything I can only say the decision to replace the philosophical and ethical inquiry at the heart of the original Anime with a more drama oriented dumbed down plot intended to appeal to American audience has killed this movie's chance to shine. I felt the director had no respect for the intellectual capacity of the audience which led him to extract the ghost and leave this adaptation nothing but a shell.,Ghost in the Shell

Some of the elements of this film like the visuals, the cinematography and the music are freaking perfect. The acting is also pretty good. Where the film kinda makes me lower my grade a bit is the script. Many plot elements to be honest feel rushed. Especially the ant-climatic third act. Not that the movie doesn't feel like a coherent movie (cough..cough..Death Note), but as far as the ending goes to be honest it comes to a whole pretty quickly and feels not deserves. The passe is the reason this film doesn't get a higher grade. Like I previously mentioned, the acting is pretty good and Scarlett Johansson is really fine here. This is obviously a role that fits her, as we've seen from movies like Lucy and Under the Skin. The character Batou and Kuze also appealed to be and made me care about them. Especially Kuze was one of the best parts of this movie.

811,generiaperez,Likable and Disappointing,3,12 December 2019,"This movie adhered to the anime/manga setting to a certain degree. However, I think the film missed so much of the depth of the story. It's visually fascinating but, shallow in everything else. Nice try, though. What could possibly make this movie better? For starters, they should not have attempted a remake (or close to it) of the anime. They should've created something based on the same setting with different characters altogether, and maybe add cameos of some of the original characters in some scenes to draw the anime fans in. Then, they could've titled it ""Ghost in the Shell: ???? (add subtitle there).""Scarlett Johansson is good in some of her films but, this one was just not for her. No, I don't think having a Japanese lead was necessary (of course, many fans might expect that). I just think they should've picked a different actress to portray the role (no offence to Scarlett Johansson fans)--someone who understands the character she's portraying much better. Of course, it possibly could be the lack of direction on the set that made her portrayal disappointing.On another note, I think what makes things worse is the dialogue/script in some scenes of the film were not very good. The dialogues could have been polished better.Overall, it was a decent attempt. Nevertheless, it would have been better if they wrote a different story with different characters based from the original setting.",Ghost in the Shell

The writing was mediocre at best and the best lines in the movie are also in the trailer. The plot felt to me like its something we have seen over and over again, and is starting to become clichéd. They tried to make it more modern, futuristic and appealing by adding the idea of hackers taking over cyborgs, but even then this has been done time again by classic movies like Total Recall and Terminator.One upside of the movie is Scarlett Johannson. She is probably the only reason to watch the movie. She makes the part her own throughout most of the film, only being let down by the mediocre writing and plot.After watching this it seems like Hollywood doesn't want to come out with anything original but wants to use CGI to appeal to moviegoers and make money.

821,Kazrak,"Very good, but lost the best part of the anime versions.",8,3 April 2017,"I really want to love this movie as much as I do the original 1995 anime version. This version suffers in comparison to the anime versions. If I had never seen the original I would probably have rated it higher. The live-action and CGI are blended almost seamlessly. No surprise but there is a ton of CGI, although I understand some of things that look like they probably were CGI were actually filmed with mechanical effects.The imagery and action are excellent. The plot, dialogue, and acting are very good. The costume/makeup/body-suit of the Major is good, but often looks like a wet-suit instead of looking like synthetic skin. The story develops somewhat differently than the anime versions, but hits most of the major and minor plot points, however, ...(Here comes a major spoiler and my biggest complaint.)The best parts of the anime versions (and most of the related movies, TV series, and OVAs) are the questions raised about what it means to be alive, machine, cyborg (some of each), self-aware, conscious, sentient, AI, human, and/or virtual. The climax of the 2017 live-action has been simplified to make it easier to grasp for people not familiar with thinking about what it means to be alive. This is certainly a trade-off to make it more palatable to mainstream viewers and critics. However, it steals the whole theme of the source material from the story. What we're left with is interesting and entertaining, but not something that challenges what viewers think and believe.If you enjoyed this movie and haven't see the 1995 or 2008 (2.0 remastered) versions, treat yourself and watch them. If you agree they're better, then watch the rest of the GitS universe. Prepare to think about things you may not have considered before.

826,flast-21993,'Major' is not a nickname,1,11 July 2019,"The casting, set and prop design are not bad, they match the original 1995 film. However the writing is poor making the film unwatchable. It's full of clichés typical to the 'Anglosphere' (to use a William Gibson's neologism.) The person who wrote it clearly never stepped out of their culture, never lived in a foreign country or learned to speak another language. It's a look at the mind of a typical brexit voter's heuristic vocabulary. It's horrible to be frank.
The writer doesn't respect the source material, he treats it as if it would be a Superman comic book story. He doesn't understand the struggle of the main character Motoko who is coping with trauma induced by firstly losing her body in a plane crash as a child and then having to swap between bodies while growing up. In the TV series for example she describes the experience of crushing a doll she held dear because of having poor motor control of the new artificial body. You can relate to the character's experience.
Also the relationship between the Section 9 characters is wrong. She is the leader of the team, she gives orders. The other characters (apart from Aramaki) are her subordinates.

Maybe not the complicity of the orignial one, but still great.ALL and really ALL actors were great Scarlett Johanson made such a good job here.

What I am saying is, that blue eyes will no more exist in the near future, aside there will be an ice age and if so, blue eyes are an advantage, because you can just show your face to the sun and will get vitamine B (Could be an other...probably D). So this is the reason northern Europe is still full of those, but it will be lost soon...If you are developing any cyborg, what will he look alike? It was a genius decision to give him blue eyes...

833,galileo-cheng,It's not Hong Kong on a bad day,6,30 March 2017,"The title was from an interview of Blade Runner, on setting the 2019 Los Angelas as ""Hong Kong on a bad day"". Both movies has trace of connection to Hong Kong and China, with funding from The Shaw Brothers (Blade Runner) and Shanghai Film Grp/Huahua Media (GITS) (Ref: Wong Kin Yuen (2000) On the Edge of Spaces: Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell , and Hong Kong's Cityscape - http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/80/wong80art.htm). If you did read on how GITS 1995 Anime was produced, the anime has strong influence on Blade Runner of how the cityscape reflected the mass flow and excess influx of information - neon signs, messy town planning, dark alleys, rainy days.So GITS anime then utilised Hong Kong as base of set for Niihama-shi, or New Port City in the manga, and so the movie does.The ultra complex and crammed cityscape of Hong Kong truly fits a dystopian world and set - but you have to see and create beyond that. The movie inadequately stuff these elements into the already-there Central, Yau Ma Tei, Jordan, Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kwun Tong Harbourfront, Lai Tak Tsuen and Causeway Bay, while I couldn't feel a sense of disorder, or how it was linked to information deluge - they are only futuristic sets, no more. As Hongkonger, the set rather likes Blade Runner and filled with wrongly typed or meaningless Japanese wording like ""high"" ""so high"" ""Innocence""(Ok it actually refers to the second anime in same font). In the anime, there was even a rightly sang Cantonese song! It's shot in Hong Kong, yet not even Hong Kong or anywhere else in a future world. The disconnection to the set's cultural background is misplaced.Beyond the set, all I have in mind is Total Recall and RoboCop. The manga was a 1991 rightfully done cyberpunk work with extended footnotes on the technology mentioned. The 1995 anime however, indeed twisted the plot into a discussion of oriental side of identity, self, existence, Buddhism & Shindao & Zen. In this movie?

The story was as expected, slightly simplified, compared to the anime, but it is catering to a mainstream audience. I particularly loved batau and the Major. Scarlett played her so well. ANd the characters were true as can be to the anime, so anyone disparaging the characterisation is obtuse IMO. It's way better than my expectation of a Hollywood remake of an anime like this. A lot of anime has totally random and disjointed story lines anyway, so standard Hollywood scripting is fine. I loved this movie, I want to re-watch it, just because Batau is so badass. Nothing would be good enough to please all the fanatic basement dweller nerds, and self-satisfied armchair critics who think being hyper- critical makes them intelligent--they obviously can't understand the uniqueness of this film.

843,SteveTobias,"Stylistic, Gorgeous, Worth Watching",7,4 April 2017,"It could have been better but it could have been a whole lot worse.The Ghost in the Shell universe is my personal favorite sci fi universe, anime and American TV/film included. I've watched Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig multiple times, watched the movies multiple times, even got Richard Epcar (the voice actor of Batou) to sign GITS: Innocence on DVD, and so forth.Here is what people are not getting. Stand Alone Complex has very little to do with the manga. Movies like Solid State Society have very little to do with the manga. Yet these, in my opinion, capture the best of the character development and the GITS universe. If all we had were the GITS movies and the manga, nobody would care about GITS. Variations from the original story are what make the franchise succeed.Secondly, have you watched Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence lately? Or even the new GITS: Arise films? The writers tend to go way overboard. I wouldn't even call it ""philosophical,"" it is just a giant wall of text that voice actors callously read. The writing can get way too complicated and wordy for no reason to the point where the movies get emotionless, cold, and even boring in some parts. This happens sometimes, not all of the time.Here is the lesson: it is okay to change trivial parts of the lore, like when Batou gets his eyes or which, if any, family members the Major meets. The specifics really, truly do not matter, as long as it tells the same story.Visually the film was absolutely amazing. The music was amazing. The casting, by far my biggest gripe going in, actually worked out. They did a good job.My two main issues: the PG-13 action and slight dumbing down of the story.Production IG is so incredibly good at drawing and animating weapons, gun fights, fist fights, that it's hard to live up to the action scenes, especially if one chooses to remove blood and violence in order to get a PG-13 rating. This took away from the film for sure. There was little to no punch in many of the action scenes.GITS's story can go in so many brilliant directions. It's not that this film had a dumb script or a dumb story, it's that in comparison it wasn't as brilliant as the TV shows or other movies. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, because as I mentioned sometimes the animated GITS movies go overboard, but one does notice that some of the brilliance is lacking.The film was extremely successful at creating its own GITS-compatible style. It created a metropolis far better than any of the other GITS films. The synthwave music was fitting and very atmospheric. It surpassed the anime in these areas.Those bashing the film and giving it 1/10 are dishonest, misanthropic neckbeards, in Japan known as otakus, and you should refrain from giving these reviews any your time.",Ghost in the Shell

It was in fact a good adaption! Especially when u compare it to other adaptions! The CGI was amazing atmosphere was right, the designs were so accurate and close, the only problem was the edited story, ALSO when comparing the movie to the anime you should keep in mind the GITS rich and amazing universe and story was made by multiple animes! Not just the original one!There was 3 big problems.1. its very hard to remake what is already perfect! There will be SO MANY critics and fanatics yelling even at slightest change or mistake!2. the fanatic anime fans who want everything to be sound and looks Japanese, and blind social activists who want to bash everything.3. They edited the story.For example FANATIC fans were keep crying about why the actress isnt Japanese.... when even the main character(major) never did resemble a Japanese girl(only in the first original anime film she was looking a little asian) and not to mention that in GITS universe major can have ANY form of body she wants! So nagging about her race is beyond stupid both in role AND visual!Or another problem was the FANATIC fans and social activists (who mostly had no clue about GITS universe) were keep bashing the movie for having all white actors EVEN though there was asian actors too and EVEN THOUGH in the anime AGAIN hardly any of the characters resembled an asian figure for same reason as major (prosthetic body), in fact the producers made a right choice to hire a good main actress and some good actors to give the viewers a good top score acting and nice English talking just to be bashed again for caring...In short this good movie was mostly victim of people who will never be satisfied with anything no matter how hard the producer tries, and this is why we will never get cool, good remakes...I gave it 8/10 who as an old fan of all GITS series gave the original animes 10/10, reduced 2 points due to editing story and trying to compress multiple stories in 1 movie.",Ghost in the Shell

It was based specifically on 1995 Anime/and 2.0 CGI upgrade (which means no Tachikomas, but there was a spider tank). SCENES. Some scenes were clearly copied from 1995 Anime, or its 2.0 upgrade, and I mean copied in an almost frame to frame basis (there are even some comparisons of trailer elements on YouTube, if you want an example). some were partially copied, with some new elements introduced. (several elements were in fact good, like geisha's, but some changes were illogical and unnecessary). However, some other scenes were invented anew (f.e. yakuza bar scene) and their design was performed in a very sloppy manner. They do not match other scenes in style (and the difference in the choreography of the scenes, or logic of the gun standouts is way too visible f.e. Aramaki defending himself against a a squad armed with assault rifles with a suitcase) and are much less stunning visually. STORY. The story is very different, and is full of Hollywood clichés – Evil Corporation, fake memory etc. I was expecting a new story (and I'd rather prefer a new story to something, that I know well), however this new story is very secondary (to an extent, that I'd say I've seen it in every second American Sci-Fi movie including James Bond) and is mainly used to tie in the scenes, rather then to tell a story. It is heavily based on Motoko, rather than exploring and presenting the world around, and the concept is that Motoko is unique first human brain transplanted into a cyborg body, who is on a hunt for her past (and you can easily guess the whole plot from here). WORLD. The world itself is not that bad, although in those brief moment of world presentation, there was a designer's desire to shock us with futuristic ""asian/japanese"" (although the country was never mentioned, only the Prime-Minister was mentioned few times) world filled with bright colors and 3d projections. Try portraying glamorous cyberpunk on LSD to get the idea. ACTORS. Despite my initial skepticism partially due to the white washing, Johansson played the role well (although there was limited space for that), and it looked like at least she was familiar with the character she was playing from Anime/Series (unlike the scriptwriter), however actor playing Batou was very weak (the actor wasn't trying to play anyone at all - he was more impressive in his brief role as Euron Greyjoy in Game of Thrones), even though the casting and character design was good. Other members of Section 9 made too very brief appearance to say anything serious about them. Aramaki also was quite good, although Takeshi Kitano altered the character significantly. New characters were way to simplistic and cliché based (motherly figure, antagonist figure, foe-turning-friend figure, etc). VERDICT: 4/10 – Some scenes are visually good, and they are recreation of classical GITS (so much recreation, that i'd rather watch those scene incorporated into the anime) Some are way too bad/primitive/simplistic. Especially the bar scene, which leads to Motoko's torture scene, which was pretty unnecessary, and way too out of movie style (i got an impression, that it was there, as scriptwriter just wanted to have a female torture scene). I do not recommend seeing this in the cinema (CGI is not really that stunning – Dr. Strange CGI was way better), just wait for an HD version appearing on sale. Also if you are fascinated by trailer, per standard Hollywood practice trailer is way better then the movie.",Ghost in the Shell
848,celtic-moniker,Not lost in translation. A very competent addition to the franchise.,8,29 March 2017,"Off the bat, this film isn't perfect. Batou is flat and lacking the cocky charm many of us have come to love. And some of the character changes out-right counter the key themes of this film. And sadly it does wander down the road of American tendency to spell themes out to the audience. That said, this film had an unexpected level of depth. The trailers for the film appear to have been intentionally deceptive, creating an image of the plot and characters which the film progresses to shatter. 'The Major's' character is fleshed out with additional substance. Scarlet's version of the major stoops unnecessarily, and poses awkwardly while not moving. It seems odd at first, but realized as intentional later on. While the film lacks something akin to the 'intermission' scene from the 1995 film, it still takes time to explore The Major's moments of self examination. It is in theses scenes where the film slows down and allows the audience more time to read. The action scenes are mostly fun, but they too don't stray too far from the central premise and don't overwhelm the story. So much so that the re-creation of the garbage truck pursuit is cut down to a fraction of what it was, giving more time to other plot elements. As for the cultural appropriation? Well, the film uses that controversy and turns it into a major plot point. I'm a little uncomfortable with how they achieved that, but it is very inventive.",Ghost in the Shell

The production staff should have also been again more Asian or Japanese seen as they would know more they anime stuff.

Although the camouflage is different from original, but it really Looks like a flappy suit with the Terrible skin gap around the neck area when scarlet wearing it. The feeling of loss connection to the world acted by scarlet is just not up to the par. The empty feeling person eyes' sight should be dead still, Not with those confuse eye balls that is rolling around.There's no passion in making this movie good but a quick money making film. The building advertising and street hologram in the scene may just be the only thing that impressed me. But kept repeating. Isn't there anything else to impress us?

While I was watching it in the cinema, I looked at the other people in the audience and I could see people shuffling around, basically bored and waiting for the movie to end.

It should get an 8 or 9 on average so due to the people who down-vote this movie I had to give it 10 points to up the average! The reason is simple. I saw the original animation when I was a young boy and loved it. To see this story re-envisioned in reality really overwhelmed me. So please go and see this movie.

The main problem is how predictable and self explanatory the story is. There are even embarrassing moments of the characters literally explaining all the secrets of the past and the background of the protagonist just by talking with a cup of tea.

855,cool_taff,This movie is more a decent introduction to the franchise than a stand alone movie.,7,3 April 2017,"For a more visual and in depth review; check out this YouTube video: /watch?v=4nCb5WaOexsThe live action movie of the beloved Ghost in The Shell is based on the 1995 movie and the animated series. The reason why I say this, is because this is basically a new origin story for the Major mixed with elements from the other incidents. Even if the story is now more character driven with a betrayal and revenge arc thrown in, it never felt that it wasn't a typical ghost in the shell story. I would call this Diet Ghost in the Shell, since it does have the same elements that we come to love, but is not execute as well.Scarlett Johansson performance reflects the 1995 movie and the Arise portray. She stares a lot at the camera and speaks sometimes like a robot. Other times she is more naive and does show some vulnerable emotions, which is not a good thing as Major should have a commanding presence. But regarding how the story is set up as the first year on the job, is not that bad I guess. Fortunately, Pilou portray of Batou is more spot on. He is a likable character and he deserved that little backstory about his eyes. The chemistry between Major and Batou might not be as strong as in the show, but it's still presence and has a charm to it. Rest of the Section 9 is yet again being pushed aside, but considering how the story is more driven for our main character, It's not that big of a concern. Except for Aramaki, who only speaks Japanese for some reason and has some cool scenes with a gun. Action was kind of lack luster, they did not give the proper energy it deserved, but boy does the visuals make up for it. Just look at all the neat things! Yeah, they went far with the details, and it shows that this movie is more an introduction than a stand-alone. They took scenes that people liked. Like hey, do you like that opening scene, we got that. You like that fight with the camouflage, we got you cover. And what would a GITS be without Major ripping her arms out? It's A BAD HABIT! Other than that, this movie might be one of those live action movies based from Japanese comics to be good. So I really hope this movie will have a follow up just to justify the characters and themes more. As for now, I am Taff and I give my consent.",Ghost in the Shell
856,rip-56,Not Really Ghost in The Shell; maybe Brain in the Shell..,4,5 August 2017,"This is the way 13 year old student's understanding of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. We have watched a movie from people who have a lot of money but very limited brains. This is not a remake of Ghost in The shell for broader audience or simplified version of the anime, this is literally what the filmmakers understood from the original one.First of all; Ghost in The Shell is originally a movie about Artificial Inteliigence being self-aware and having existential crisis, questioning its own existence and trying to evolve and trying to find a place for itself in evolution pyramid, which suppose to be the top of it. The original movie is not about robots, cyborgs or artificial intelligence, it is about being human, it is asking the very question of ""what is being exist"". Is it about having ability to think, is it about having a soul, is it about memories or is it about self awareness? What if a machine would have those? What if a machine have soul and memories, what if it could think, what if it is self aware? Should they be considered as people, they are not a person but they have personalities. Lifeforms that are much more intelligent than mankind, where should be they in evolution pyramid? These are the questions the original movie suggests.However; in this adaptation of Ghost in The Shell; the movie is about some dead peoples brains are preserved and put them in some cyborgs body, and some of those cyborgs are are trying to find who are responsible for this. It is like some donors who didn't donate their brains for scientific experiments, but they used them anyway, afterwards brains started to remember and trying to revenge those who used their brains.Hollywood filmmakers are took a very philosophical plot and made it very superficial. This is Ghost in The Shell for Dummies; maybe not even that..",Ghost in the Shell
857,sabersforever,Never seen GitS before? Enjoy!! Die-hard fan? Huge let-down,7,2 April 2017,"Alright, need to vent a little bit.Just saw Ghost in the Shell. Solid futuristic action movie. For the uninitiated, I'd give it an easy 7 out of 10. Breath-taking cinematography (especially in #IMAX3D, holy crap), soundtrack was gorgeous, acting was pretty good. Go see it! But, as a die-hard Ghost in the Shell fan, it was a huge let-down. I knew it wasn't going to be a shot-for-shot remake of the 1995 classic, that they were going to piece some parts of Stand Alone Complex (the series sequel) into it, but I still had high hopes. But apparently Hollywood doesn't mind butchering a masterpiece.First of all, they really f*cked with the main character's origin story. Completely changed it - which is sad because those are some of the most beautiful episodes of SAC. They did it because they wanted to have the existential theme of ""What does it mean to be human?"" tie into the Major Matoko's background, but honestly, the original movie handles that beautifully without messing around with pointless exposition. It just feels rushed and like an excuse for the question, ""Why isn't Matoko Japanese?"" (uh, she has a cyborg body, get over it).The fact they used her figuring out ""who am I"" as a plot engine really dumbs the character down and waters down the importance of the Major. She's supposed to be a Super-Wizard-Class Hacker, but never is that mentioned. They make it seem like anybody could hack into a cyberbrain. She's supposed to be an elite, ex-special forces commando, which is fine from how they do the action, but where did she learn all that if she was just a political activist/street-rat a year ago? Okay, besides the writing flaws, the pacing really bugged me. It seemed like they had 4 or 5 scenes they cut & pasted from the original (and SAC), but patched up the seams with pretty CG and fast-paced go-get'em. Give it time to breath, Hollywood. So much meaningful philosophy was lost because they just rushed to the next ""whammo"" and didn't incorporate what the anime was trying to say.Alright, thanks for hearing me out. Excuse me as I pull out my ol' GitS DVD and take a deep breath.#GhostintheShell #remaketantrum #supporttheofficialrelease",Ghost in the Shell
858,adamc012,"Decent execution, but rather simplified for my accustom",7,1 April 2017,"Being a big fan of the anime (In all the films and the SAC series), this film certainly made valiant attempt to pull some punches in terms of overall execution, albeit to a more down to earth standard standard to accommodate the more mainstream viewer rather than myself.The film provided some incredible visuals to suit to the film's story and setting. Nothing too over the top, but I couldn't help feel that certain elements of which became a brief distraction at times, especially when the holographic effects appeared more clustered together in some particular scenes.Action remained rightfully prevalent at times in this film, of which I believe was perhaps one of the better factors. Nothing to over the top either to monopolise this film's story-line too much, which I'll go into a bit more with the plot. So this factor has delivered a rather satisfying result to say the least.The characters, especially with Major and Batou, stuck significantly to how I know them to be. Though with the overall cast there wasn't an absolute massive depth and/or background to see from them here, so a new viewer may end up struggling to perhaps understand each of their profiles to a good degree. I will have to admit that the casting of Scarlett Johansson was, if not the perfect choice, an acceptable one. The major wasn't always a massively emotional character as such, and her performance stuck well to that basis.The plot became a surprisingly easy one to understand for a Ghost in the Shell film. But this being made by Hollywood means, that hardly surprised me. To allow the simplicity to slide, a significant part of the saga's complex political philosophy had been compromised to cater to the more mainstream audience for them to understand. In this case: Emphasising much more to the Major's traumatic back story and the semi-sinister truth she eventually unfolds as the film progresses. As much as I am in fact a little let down to this result, I am also someone who can be a little willing to make a sacrifice (Only should I absolutely have to). It was also rather nice to see some memorable moments from the original re-performed in this film, even if it did however make the flow of the story appear a little bit wonky IMO.To give this a 7/10 may seem like a rather lenient result to some, but I'm someone who often throws a bone to films like this. I can certainly agree it was neither an absolutely perfect adaptation nor is it to be the best film made this year, but I remain satisfied at the commitment this film has shown to keep with the premise of the GitS saga, and that this has as an overall final result not disappointed me very much.",Ghost in the Shell
859,weng910,"There's no Ghost in this Shell. Should just call it ""Generic Cyborg Action Film"".",3,29 March 2017,"Firstly, let's get the metaphorical elephant out of the room by saying Scarlett Johansson did OK playing the Major. Next, the guy who played Batou did a better job.In some aspects, a decent live-action re-enactment of all the iconic scenes from the 90s anime. The effects guys, the camera and lights guys, set creators, make-up artists, costume makers and this Sanders fellow got the looks, feel and mood of the original GITS environments of the manga and anime series absolutely spot on. It's eye candy for fans who've wondered how GITS can be visually represented in a live-action film. That's all there is to have; everything else is just utter rubbish.This film is not worthy of the title, Ghost in the Shell, because apart from the visuals, there is no semblance of it to the source material that one can consider it generous to call this ""a generic cyborg action film inspired by GITS"". If we are to just listen to the dialogue, and all the character names are changed and Section 9 is called something else, we wouldn't have a clue that this film is adapted from GITS. The essence that makes GITS what it is in all its different incarnations (various manga and anime) is missing and we are left with bits of shallow musings about what it means to be human in a robotic body.So all in, if you're unfamiliar with the source material, it'll be a mildly interesting plod through a pretty but rather boringly paced sci-fi. Fans of GITS would probably wonder why bother to make a live-action adaptation if you're not going to put the spirit of the source material into the movie.",Ghost in the Shell

Part of that spirit transfer appeal. Plus, in a lot of Anime they don't just stick to just Asian characters. One of the reasons I love animation is because it's multicultural. They loosely follow the anime plot but the visuals are awesome. Just think of it as one of Majors reboots. They do have a few coinciding scenes direct from the anime and they are very visually stunning. I really liked Johansson she did a great job. They also did a great job at keeping to everyone's persona. Was better than expected.",Ghost in the Shell
861,hugh_tran,Fan of the original. Exactly how live action adaptations should be!,8,30 March 2017,"As a fan of only the original 1995 movie which inspired The Matrix (For the unaware, there was no anime series/spin-offs/reboots yet at the time, just a full feature film on its own), this is how you properly adapt something to live action. There were times I got chills from seeing the old scenes being re-created shot for shot straight out of the animation!Just watched this last night at an advanced screening and wasn't blown away, but very surprised at how well they pulled it off. Everyone I have seen the original with in the past has fallen asleep halfway through or did not understand the story. Some might complain about 'Hollywood' thinking we are dumb and need to spell it out for us but.. truth is, some of us actually need that to appreciate. The pacing was perfect this time around and actually added to the original plot to wrap it up nicely. I am all for the original ending, but couldn't help but wished to see more back in the day, now that void is filled. My only gripe is that the 'intermission' scene was missing and I felt was pretty vital to put the audience in a certain mood and thought process, the 'interrogation' scene also felt rushed for this same reason. However, I can forgive it since it is already a 2 hour movie. Cast and acting was perfect! The Major's walk was even robotic and her voice was cyborg feeling with the perfect small touch of emotion to remind you that she still has her ghost. Batou's banter with her was just as connected feeling as it was before, and seeing him feed the dogs was just a treat to see.Also just throwing this out there for some of you confused ones, MAJOR is a RANK, not her name; her full real name is still intact in the movie. If you have only watched the more recent anime episodes and manga, do yourself a favour and go back to watch the original first film before you spread uneducated misinterpretations. All the ignorant pre-release complaints have been cancelled out right in your face in this movie. If you liked the OG version, you'll love this version.",Ghost in the Shell
862,DrissDae-Su,A shell without a ghost,6,31 October 2017,"I'd like to start by saying that I appreciated this movie for what it is, the narrative was simple enough to enjoy, visuals were tantalizing and beautiful yet Rupert Sanders's Ghost in a shell is but a shell without a ghost. It has the name, it has the very basic shell of the original 1995 anime film 'Ghost in a shell' but leaves out Its ""ghost"". Its power/impact. Although I'm not against having S. Johansson play Major, the fact that the film leans heavily on Japanese culture makes it hard not to shout ""CULTURE APPROPRIATION!"" within the first 30 minutes of the film. Come on they have white/black actors/actresses playing Japanese named characters... Ghost in a shell lives in a world where the robots, its cities, its characters are all very Japanese. So its begs the question that if Hollywood are willing to use the Japanese cultures in its movies (clearly because it sells) then why aren't they willing to use Japanese actresses/actors for their movies?",Ghost in the Shell

Instead, it's  tepid. I didn't hate it, but it was a bit like a nice, but not great roller-coaster: nice entertainment for the moment, but nothing you write home about. It has lots of great CGI effects, but the characters are seriously lacking. It's like they didn't want to give the characters any texture or depth because that could detract the viewer from the special effects. I think this is more a question of direction and editing rather than acting. Typically, I feel I can re-watch a good sci-fi movie a couple times. Whether it's more action like Minority Report or more drama like Interstellar, the rewatchability factor to me is more a question about the feeling I get from watching the movie. Sadly, the rewatchability factor for this movie is basically 0 on my part. In the end, it's like watching a very long movie sequence in a video game - but in a video game, the film sequences are just a small part of the whole experience.

The first animated movie was cut up and rearranged into an unimaginative and by the books plot with hardly any philosophy or anything else of what made the movies or TV shows unique. The worst/hilarious part of the movie was the literal white-washing of Motoko Kusanagi. As in, they took an Asian woman and put her into a white woman's cyborg body.

Evil corporation, stolen identity, revenge. Whoever wrote the script for the movie payed no attention to the plot line at all. It neither shows philosophical spirit of the movie nor the masterful social comments of the 2nd SAC series. And Kuze, I have no idea why was he in the movie.

The key to not hating this film is ignoring the links to the anime. To be clear the anime is WAY better and this film just takes parts of it and combines them to a worse version.

869,Lossincasa,Insulting,1,4 September 2017,"I thought the original wasn't the masterpiece all its fans were preaching but a strong piece of Japanese anime culture. At parts the story was enjoyable, others not so much. But everything was done skillfully and in a very adult manner. Whatever anyone's disagreements though Ghost in the Shell is an outstanding story. However... This current pathetic attempt at white-washing a whole genre, striping and dumping down the storyline, removing all adult elements from the film to make it palatable/serviceable to a wider audience should stand as beacon to every anime fan everyone. Do not give in to the big studio's ideas. While I like the actress in other films, choosing her for the part (against everyone being vocal that she was miscast) didn't serve the movie at all in the end. She brought with her the baggage of all big star names (a costume to avoid appearing naked, a blond westerner playing an Asian, a convoluted, almost drugged performance etc) and gave almost nothing to the material as was expected. In fact she went one over and messed everything up. She just couldn't do it, this was a role she had no business being involved with.The film if one removes it from the Ghost in Shell universe and sees it as a SciFi original is mediocre but serviceable. The direction is good, I don't want to attack the wonderful professionals working in the film, the cuts were brisk and the colors vibrant. Some ideas were interesting. A very decent effort, unfortunately it was brought down by the lead actress and the rating mafia. My final take? Not the worst SciFi movie out there if you wish to watch it in a vacuum. A solid 5.5.But if you want to watch a Ghost in Shell film, then this isn't for you. At all. The grade reflects this fact. Hence the emphatic ace.",Ghost in the Shell

871,Gmyster2020,Faithful Adaptation to a Ground Breaking Anime,8,10 December 2020,"I normally don't write movie reviews but after reading a lot of the negative comments here on IMDb about this film, I felt compelled to set the record straight on a number of the complaints on here.First off, this film really stayed true to the original look and feel of the 1995 Anime. There was no cheesy product revamp or complete disregard of the original story. Best of all, it stayed clear of any PC stereotypes we've come to expect from 21st Century Hollywood.The first film was more of a philosophical journey as this version stayed in the psychedelic thriller mode which helped keep the focus more on the characters than the original. Togusa and some of the other characters do fade in the background, but Bateau and Motoko really come alive in this present version.The Anime only hinted at Motoko's relationship with Bateau but in this present film, we get a much more intimate look as to why these two are so loyal to each other. Even when Motoko begins to question her allegiance to Section 9 and also to Bateau, Bateau stays by her side regardless. Like the stray dogs he cares for, he is loyal to Motoko no matter what happens.Though the first Anime film focused on the human soul, the philosophy of being and the externalization of memory by technology, this present film really honed in on Motoko's personal journey and rediscovery of identity.After having watched this live action version of Ghost, Scarlet's performance really gives a more intimate look into the kind of character Motoko is. She's a human brain inside a synthetic body. Still a part of the world but detached from it because of the loss of her human body.This director really spent a lot of time with the original material, leaving behind beautiful imprints of the anime throughout the film. As someone who expected this film to be a horrible reboot like so many others, this was a very pleasant and enlightening surprise.The original Anime is a film I've watched over a hundred times since 1995 and now, after seeing this live action adaptation, I feel that I am now looking at Ghost in the Shell in an entirely different way.I would encourage the viewer to watch the original anime first so that you'll see how well this present adaptation parallels and compliments the original. It is very evident the original film was sacred to the Director as he succeeded in making an already incredible classic even more iconic with this film.When watching the original Ghost, be prepared to be profoundly shaken by its passionate outcry of modern dehumanization. But delve into this live action film and be seduced by its beauty, sadness, isolation and exploration of a feminine soul wishing only to have an identity in a faceless and soulless mechanistic world.I wonder if the Director's message may have been that in this soulless world of machines, Motoko was able to rediscover her own soul and not lose it amidst the chaos and confusion that surrounded her.This film was a great cinematic achievement and I'm very grateful to the Director and the cast for resurrecting Ghost in such a profound and illuminating way.",Ghost in the Shell

The revelations of this film are all explained, unlike the anime, opting for an emotional conclusion instead.",Ghost in the Shell

ENJOY, admire, and most of all, understand: this is not a remake, the movie is an adaptation. PERIOD. Well, the story blends a couple of ideas from the anime universe, however, I might call it ""GHOST IN THE SHELL 2.75"" because, we watchers want to see what has happened in between INNOCENCE and COMPLEX, you know, just the thrills.Now, everyone wants to fix this movie inside the anime time-line... FORGET IT, it is a a ""lonely riff floating aside what you have observed"". All of you: embrace it without misconceptions, believe in what you have in front and admire the story, the effects and the performance, because this movie worth it. Scarlett Johansson fits and push the character towards old story lines, and Batou relies in the proper ""lifeline"" and must be preserved.

On top of that the cast and yet another Hollywood whitewashing sh*tstorm. Is this a perfect film? No. Some story elements were simplified to appeal to a broader audience and I would have done some scenes and dialogues differently. But overall it is a solid movie in the Sci-Fi genre. The atmosphere, effects, music and aesthetics are stunningly beautiful! You can still feel the heart and soul of Ghost in the Shell. The story is there - slightly changed but still thought provoking. There are many scenes where you can really see the amount of work that was put into making this movie - tiny details in the background, the aura of Hong Kong and other locations where this film was shot and just the overall look and feel. If this wasn't an adaptation but an original film I'm pretty sure the ratings would look completely different and the critics would be positive only.

877,rotheche-252-521736,A pretty failure,4,14 April 2017,"Basically, this is a pretty failure.Even with those low expectations, it's a pretty underwhelming movie, which is sad. The original movies, manga and series aren't just action; they're about the nature of identity and consciousness, what defines us as humans. The live action version does have some bits about that, but it's just some platitudes about our actions, not our memories, defining us repeated at the start and end of the movie. What replaces it is about the most hackneyed ""origin"" story possible: ""they"" stole her memories and gave her fake ones and now she wants to know what really happened.The movie pillages the original anime movie for pretty much every striking visual it can get away with: everything from the opening credits through to the final battle with the spider tank. But it doesn't take any of the themes or thoughts, just the gloss, and that leaves it a shell without any ghost.The performers try hard but, when you get down to it, it's a slight story that misses every chance it has to do more than be a visual rip of the original.",Ghost in the Shell

You can really immerse yourself into the world of GITS. It is visually beautiful. If you've seen the anime you'll easily recognise the places and characters, and that's just itself so enjoyable for the fan of the original. The plot is changed, but still familiar. The themes are not as deep as in the original, but let's be honest how many people would go to see a SF film based on anime if they wouldn't make it easy enough to digest for a regular movie-goer? I see it rather as a single step (finally in a good direction) and deeper themes may be introduced further along the way. Look how far the comic book movies got, and how acceptable it is to be a fan of them nowadays.

I make you responsible for this awful adaptation that should have been great!!",Ghost in the Shell
881,jaredsterry,"A treat for both fans of the original, and new initiates...",8,1 April 2017,"FOREWARD: First off, I was exposed to the original film back when it was only available in a very small Anime section in BlockBuster. It could be bought in limited outlets like SunCoast Video, MediaPlay, etc.I was in love with the original film not only for it's action, attention to detail in weapons/gear, and appreciably grounded view of future tech...but also it's deep view of existential questions, the pitfalls of technology, social/political themes, and character development in the movie and following series. Of course, like today, it was widely regarded as too complex and cerebral for those who had no exposure to other types and styles of film, and regrettably dismissed by those who considered an animated film to only be suitable for children's stories.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to take some air of superiority in my tastes, I like a good brainless or mainstream film just as much as anyone, but the original GITS was a landmark and a very cherished memory of my teen years. THE MEAT AND POTATOES: I went into this film with an understanding that adaptations of franchises like anime and video games, have often failed to meet the expectations of fans and newcomers alike. Lets face it, most of our beloved franchises are deep and vast. And to take the best parts of those and wrap it into a film that tries to honor the original work is no small task. Not to mention please typical moviegoers who are used to films that lay out the plot in a very predictable or even simplistic way.This movie touches on all the amazing parts of the original. The story in this movie is lifted from several parts of the movie as well as it's episodic versions. I personally think they did a wonderful job of faithfully preserving the best of the best.The plot may not be as ""sexy"" as modern films go, but for those who suspend their typical expectations, it's a wonderful dive into ideas of what it means to be human when the technology of the time may be at odds with individuality. While most of our lives are inexorably connected to technology and networking, there were definitely parts that drew a comparison of being ""too connected"" to technology (i.e. social media, phones, computers, and corporate advertising), whilst seeing the inherent value of ""disconnecting"" from such trappings occasionally in order to discover oneself so to speak. I thought the running time was a little short. Even 30 more minutes could've developed the story better to folks who are viewing this with fresh eyes. However I can also understand the need to trim ""filler"" for the sake of giving the film a broader appeal. Though I really wished for more development of the characters aside from the Major, (Togusa, Saito, Ishikawa, Borma, Aramaki), I felt like the other roles were portrayed faithfully and yet breathed new life into their characters. I really hope this will not be the end of the series if nothing else but for the sake of exploring these characters more and seeing the actors flesh out their roles. Unlike most films with a central character, the movie and the series really took time to make each of these characters very unique and made me love each of their personalities and quirks.The tech, weapons, gear, concepts that were of course laid out in the first movie, were mostly well preserved and adapted. In closing I personally loved this movie and am glad to see it directed/produced/casted/created in a manner that stayed true to it's roots. Make no mistake, you are not seeing a film that is trying to be like most major blockbusters. And it is also not a direct clone of the original. But don't mistake this for an indication of avoiding it. Get lost in it, let it have your undivided attention and I think most can appreciate this wonderful dive into the unknown.",Ghost in the Shell
882,xyunbekannt123,A very good Hollywood adaptation,9,29 May 2017,"As there are so many reviews pointing out what's supposedly wrong with the movie, I decided to address the most ridiculous criticisms.1. Scarlett Johannson and white washing: From all the criticisms I read after watching the movie this bugs me the most. The Anime character doesn't look very Japanese to me. In general, 90% of the Manga I read in my life, had western looking main characters(even if I only read what was available in my country back then, so I understand that this most probably was a very slimmed down selection for the western market.) I really think the whole debate doesn't have anything to do with ghost in the shell at all. There are so many movies out there that actually white washed some characters that really should have been African/Asian etc. but people rather pick on Scarlett Johannson for playing a woman that really looks like her in the movie?! Please think twice before jumping this hype train and shitstorming all over the internet.2. Scarlett plays like a wooden Ben Affleck and her role is one dimensional: You don't say!? She hasn't really decided for herself if she's machine or human and only had one year to find some sort of place in this world. She plays that spot on, period.3. The movie is just another Hollywood action movie and crippled the philosophical approach of the Anime: If you watch this movie and it doesn't encourage you to think about some very crazy, frightening, disturbing, controversial problems and monstrosities a future with available technology like this might create, in a society like ours, that already is driven by profit and stepping over dead bodies for reaching our goals. Then it's most likely not the movie's fault. If you are one of those people that need stuff like this forced down their throat for 3h so they eventually finally think about controversial topics, then go watch Civil War. It's true that the plot was simplified and the writers boiled most things down to a Robo Cop vibe, but it works rather well I think. Especially compared to Robo Cop, Ghost in the Shell just works so much better on so many levels. If you are a die hard fan of the original Anime on the other hand, then why were you expecting a perfect copy of your favourite movie that somehow magically did something better than the anime that justified the existence of the Hollywood adaptation?",Ghost in the Shell

I strongly disagree with those saying that this film is a beautiful shell with no ghost. Absolutely not. This film has a strong thematic issue, a warm heart, a well developed character and good shaped story. If the original GITS was about the difference between man and machine, this movie is about identity. And it pushes it very far, reaching the boundaries of sexual identity as well.
Scarlett Johansson is a good choice as well, being both the badass heroine we expect and the fragile girl in quest of identity.

The philosophic questions aligned exactly with the way I explored life existentially.This remake is an adaptation, clearly meant for the masses. But, in contrary to other reviews, I think they summarized the core quite well; the question. ""What is a soul"".And for one, I think this is a very positive adaptation, so more people can understand these questions. So they too can ask them self what responsibilities come with technology and what it means to be human. I do not think these questions should be reserved for the intellectual elite. In contrary, we, as a society as whole, are all in it for the long run.Furthermore, they'd manage to capture the atmosphere quite well and the visuals were at times stunning. Scarlet was very convincing as the major. And the right amount of action.I really was scared the movie would be a let down, so I didn't go see it in theater.

It should be above a 7 so I give it an 8. I find it worthwhile to warn others not to follow the opinion of the fanatics. It is said that the plot is dumbed down, but in truth, the fanatics should understand that the anime is not as deep-layered as they think it is. You don't need to see the original anime to understand what ghost in the shell means, as long as you know that this movie is about cyborgs. It's a recurring theme in any cyborg movie...even the one with JCVD. Yes, the original is good, but don't exaggerate. The fact that they don't explain everything in the cartoon doesn't make it better.What I really liked in GitS 2017 is the setting that was created on the screen. Nothing I've seen in the cinema before and it really gave me the feeling that I was watching something original, even though this is a cinematic remake. The visuals are very good. You don't go to a movie like this for the acting, it will not win Oscars, but the acting is OK. It's not an action movie, it's sci-fy, but there lies my main problem with the movie. If you don't make a film for the acting or the action, than least give more thought on the underlying message about what defines a human being. Still, GitS is worth your time. The message should have been brought clearer, but the story is still there and visually it is quite unique.",Ghost in the Shell

895,tnorthreading,Future Cult Favorite,8,1 August 2017,This movie has been handed a lot of bad press. The film it self is great! Really! I have been a fan since 1995 with the first movie which was done in anime style. Loved the whole franchise ever since. I have collected the whole franchise and still watch them to this day. The film is this fan's newest must have and I am glad I got it. I enjoy this movie. The film should be embraced by the fans of Ghost in the Shell for it's efforts to bring the complicated story to the live action science fiction genre. The sets and design as well as the special effects are all top notch. The film moves at a brisk pace and the action scenes are well done. The actors were all well cast and did a good job in bringing the characters to the big screen. There has been a lot of talk about comparing Ghost with Blade Runner. I consider Blade Runner my favorite movie of all time. I accept the comparison and can see it on several levels. What I see here is a future cult film. It is a shame the way this film was cast aside when released but that is what happened to Blade Runner. In the future we may see a Ghost in the Shell receive a higher score which it deserves. If you haven't seen this film I recommend it highly.,Ghost in the Shell
896,crocodilejock,A beautiful vision of a somewhat dystopian future...,8,28 April 2019,"I've read an abundance of negative reviews about this movie, and most seem to be by fans of the anime original. As someone coming to the film fresh, as many will, I thought I'd try and give a different, and maybe more mainstream perspective. Its beautiful. Disturbing. Ethereal. There's a decent story, the actors are fine, but the heroes of this film are the sets and costumes. Yes, we've seen similar in Bladerunner, and that film influenced many others, this one included. But here the filmaking technology of today allows a fully rendered glimpse of the future of tomorrow. It felt like being inside a William Gibson novel. It really worked for me. The technology felt real... And just around the corner. The whole movie sometimes slipped into video game cut scene territory, but that fits with the whole is it real, is it virtual, is it human, is it enhanced, is it a robot theme of the movie. A quick word about Scarlett Johansson... Again, I've seen many negative reviews, saying she's wooden in this movie. She's not. She's subtle. She underplays everything beautifully. Perfectly for the part. Should an Asian actress have been cast? Probably. But they weren't, and Ms Johansson did a good job. To sum up, if you're a fan of the anime original, you probably won't enjoy this movie. If not, and you see it on a decent screen, you probably will.",Ghost in the Shell
897,megadyne,Westernized and streamlined but still functional as a film,7,26 August 2017,"First I want to say that I am aware of the big challenge that the makers of this film had to face. Ghost in the Shell is one of the most iconic anime's out there. When I saw the original anime in the mid-nineties it really left an impression on me.As a result it is very easy to anger the (for an anime) huge fan base who see every deviation from the original as some sort of sacrilege, but at the same time Ghost in the Shell is still a niche product even if in its niche (anime) it is one of the biggest films.To leave this niche and appear more to the casual moviegoer the producers made the decision to cast Scarlett Johansson, an A+ Hollywood actress as Major Motoko Kusanagi. I can understand why they did this but it will of course anger quite a lot of fans. In the film it is later explained ""SPOILER COMING!"" that the source for the ""Ghost"" (brain) really was a Japanese girl named Motoko and the evil company just happened to toss her harvested brain into a shell that somehow looked like Scarlett Johansson. Sorry but that seems just a bit cheap. It would have been better if (after choosing a top-class Hollywood actress to play the role of the major) they had just followed this through to the end and left the whole Motoko background out of the film. Batou is of course also played by a western actor (who did a reasonable job). To at least somewhat please the audience that had already seen the original anime the producers decided to include one Japanese actor for one of the bigger supporting roles. They choose Takeshi Kitano for the role of Section 9 boss Aramaki. Again, I can understand how they came to this choice - a Japanese actor was needed and it had to be one that might be known, even by the casual moviegoer so Kitano seemed like a natural fit.If you can see past this (really needed?) westernization/hollywoodification then what you get is a fully functional sci-fi film. Although it has to be said that the story from the anime was not recreated 100%. The producers choose to use some elements from the original but at the same time changed quite a lot story-wise. On one side they (the producers) undertook quite a lot of effort to recreate some of the iconic scenes from the anime (the beginning where the Majors shell is ""made"" for example and also the scene where the Major jumps down the skyscraper while her camouflage kicks in) while on the other side parts from the original plot where left out/changed or streamlined. As a result there are some situations who are very unbelievable and would have been unthinkable in the anime but who are at the same time very common in Hollywood films like the whole situation surrounding the planned deactivation of the major after she has discovered her real background. Cutter (your cookie cutter:D Hollywood greedy and unscrupulous corporate villain) who desperately wants to deactivate the Major chooses of course Dr. Oulet, who has already several times voiced her absolute displeasure with Cutters actions and who is clearly emotionally bound to the Major, to deactivate her. He even leaves the room and watches the Dr. from afar so that he conveniently can't really see that the Dr. is instead freeing the Major. There are also some other scenes like this where you are reminded in the most harshest of ways that this is a big budget Hollywood movie where common sense is unknown when it helps the constructed plot to move further.Apart from this (for Hollywood films rather common) flaws you get a functional and stylish streamlined sci-fi action film that cam be watched without any prior knowledge of the anime.Will the ""old"" fans be pleased with this? I don't know. Has the full westernization/hollywoodification of the film really helped to catch a greater audience? I don't think so either as the worldwide gross of 169 million dollar doesn't seem that much when compared to the production budget of 110 million dollar, where the costs of advertising aren't even factored in.",Ghost in the Shell

900,ranmah76,Ghost in the Shell Review,7,24 April 2017,"The film like the anime and the manga the visuals/fight scenes were quite impressive. There are some similarities to Oshii-san's fight scenes from the anime that translated very nicely to film. The kinetic energy of the fighting and shooting did harken to some of Masamune Shirow's manga and earlier works, such as black magic m66 and appleseed. Added some HK grittiness to heighten the flavor. Also add Oshii-san fave dog for kawaii factor.I was impressed with the film to try and to condense the story of science, eastern religion, western religion, philosophy and psychology of the manga that Masamune Shirow penned. The story in the manga is very rich and thick with all sorts of the things stated above. The production staff probably toiled for many months to try and make the chaotic world of Masamune Shirow as palatable as possible. I am sure Frederik L. Schodt and other translators had a similar problem translating all of the Japanese to make sense. I still was blown by the story and complex by the source material.I am only disappointed that the director didn't have the courage to dig deeper into this complex and fascinating universe. I guess time and money like all things hollyweird is always the issue. Like the manga, it pays to re-read/watch the film again.I would like to say lastly there technically was an Asian actress in the lead film... it is based on interpretation.",Ghost in the Shell

903,kevinschork,"The best ""cyberpunk"" movie in recent years",8,30 March 2017,"After seeing the movie I have to admit it was better than I expected from the Trailers. Having seen all of the anime and manga source material it can feel a bit weird to watch some of the scenes, as they took a lot of iconic scenes and character names from the previous movie/series and incorporated them into a new plot.I think the most noticeable change from the previous adaptations is the way in which the story is told. They basically shove the plot into your face sometimes! Which I expected from Hollywood. I can forgive that, as I know this movie needs to appeal to a much wider audience as the anime series/movies.The acting is solid, but nothing extraordinary or Oscar worthy. The visuals and soundtrack on the other hand are really well done and make the dystopian city believable.All in all I think this is one of the better if not the best anime adaption made by Hollywood until now. And surely the best cyberpunk movie that has been released in recent years. I would recommend this movie to fans of the anime as well as lovers of sci-fi and cyberpunk in particular.",Ghost in the Shell
904,alexisharriott,Don't waste your money,1,7 April 2017,"What a dreadful film. The plot was not only simple but for the simple minded, I have not seen the original but then all films should stand up in their own right; but I guessed the plot in the first 5 mins, and that is being generous. The director obviously grew up watching Blade Runner on repeat and the setting and action was clichéd. Scarlett J walked as if she had 10 sanitary towels between her legs and this film was not worthy of her. It was a study in the unoriginal. I will make a point of avoiding this Director and his future films. My friend fell asleep at least 3 times but I gave her a good nudge and told her she had to suffer like the rest of the audience. I didn't hear anyone say anything positive about it.",Ghost in the Shell
905,fatih_kecelioglu,Remembered,10,26 August 2017,"My first review on IMDb, because I am shocked by 6.5 for this movie. I watched it holding my breath. The story is amazing, and told wonderfully in this re-make. Actually, I realised that I did not understand most details of the story, although I watched the original one twice. Maybe it is my dumbness, but I feel very satisfied emotionally while watching this one. Scenes are re-created with about 90% fidelity to the original. And the music of Clint Mansell gives a wonderful taste to the movie. Well done!",Ghost in the Shell
906,avabaxter6,"Not Bad, but Not Comparable to the Original",6,15 April 2017,"I understand that there are many fans who feel scandalized by this reboot of the film, but I'm not here to take a side on whether or not this lives up to the original. The Ghost in the Shell from 2017 and The Ghost in the Shell from 1995 are so different that in many ways they cannot be compared. The central messages from either is not like the other beyond a surface level, and the story and style of each is vastly different. I do believe that this is an overall good movie, but it feels more like someone's in depth fanfiction that reveals characters' backstories than a remake of the original. The changes made were so drastic that you can understand when there are direct references that tie it back to the 1995 version, but beyond setting and characters, they are not very much alike. The changes made were mostly appropriate and acceptable, with a few exceptions which made me roll my eyes (and which I am not going to specifically point out in order to avoid spoilers). There were new scenes added and old shots revisited, but nothing seemed very out of place. I did not enjoy the shift in antagonist or the explanation of Major's backstory, but one can only expect this when an extremely deep and strange concept is being adapted for a Western audience that craves almost nothing action. Those who have not seen the original film may not see many large problems with it. Those who have seen the original will probably be cringing at some crucial aspects that were changed. The story is not necessarily weak overall, but it is rather cliché and more predictable than I, and many others, I'm sure, would have liked. I must admit that I have not seen the original sequels to the 1995 film, so forgive me if some of the changes are references to other details that were described in the later movies, but as a whole the original story should have been enough to produce a large audience based on intrigue and entertainment alone. The only reasonable explanation that I can come up with for why they would change the story so drastically is that they wanted it to be open for a sequel. Visually, Ghost in the Shell is stunning, and I cannot think of a single aspect of the design that I disliked. The reinvention of Section 9, while perhaps more optimistic than the original, was beautiful, believable, and extremely fitting. The set design is fantastic, the cinematography was great, and the occasional recreation of iconic destinations was so spot-on it was nearly scary. If I had watched this movie muted and without subtitles I would still enjoy it. The soundtrack is very fitting. It is not much like the original, but I did enjoy the soft voices in the songs near the beginning and end that brought back waves of nostalgia from the original theme. I know some people are going to complain about it, but this movie has an entirely different feel from the original, and the music fits the film this movie is, not the film this movie tried to recreate.In short, if you enjoy the original, disconnect it from this movie and you will enjoy yourself. At the very least it is beautiful and entertaining. If you haven't seen the original, don't worry, you'll still have a good time watching it. This is probably the best adaptation of an anime I have seen so far, and while that is not saying much considering its competition, it at least proves that progress is being made, and that in the future we may get a fantastic interpretation of another film or series.",Ghost in the Shell

I was actually doubting for a minute when i read a few reviews but now i know its all bull****!! its all them ..whatever you call them people who don't believe it lived up to there expectation when it actually did! so they lie and make other fans think its not good when its more than that, because this film was soo good, the actors played the characters to a T! Great cast! Batou was my favourite! his and majors friendship you could feel the harmony between them and that they cared for each other, you could get a sense of that straight away which was great! also the music i loved it! it had a 80's electronic style to it, this film has great colours and great shots and THE CAR IS JUST AMAZING! second behind the delorean no doubt. Main thing was.. it lingered on me, some films now i go see and forget about it the next day but this stuck on me and i couldn't stop thinking how good it was!

910,xiaomin_jin,best Anime Live-Action Movie by Hollywood so far,9,2 April 2017,"I read people complaining about Scarlett Johansson being casted for this role because of her race. It's kind of ridiculous. The Major in the Anime never really looked like an Asian woman. And both the movie and the anime the ghost(brain or soul, however you wanna see it) was put into an mechanic body. In the anime of 1995, the major could choose any body she want. So far to the controversy.Ghost in the Shell (2017) is the most solid Anime Live Action movie made by Hollywood so far. The visual is stunning, especially if you watch it as IMAX 3D. It feels like the movie was made for 3D viewing. You feel like that you are in this futuristic cyberpunk world. And you see the world, the people through The Majors eyes. The acting is pretty good. Scarlett Johansson is a very talent actress, so is Pilou Asbæk who played Batou. The dynamic between the two actors makes you feel like, if Batou and the Major have been working a whole life together. Johansson acted exactly like how her character ""Major"" should have behaved in all situations. There is no overacting. It doesn't feel like forced.The Plot isn't completely new, but it still fits in the universe of Ghost in the Shell. And i like the fact that the movie is no 100% copy and paste from the anime. Usually people always want an adaptation be a 100% copy of a book or anime or whatever source they use. But for me a movie is still kind of an art, an expression about how we (or the director) interpret the source material. There is not only one way to do it. The actors, Rupert Sanders, Clint Mansel and the rest of the team did a great job to adapt a very complicated source material. That's why i think Ghost in the Shell (2017) deserves a lot more than 6.9.And as always a review is just a subjective view of a person! :D",Ghost in the Shell

They turned Motoko from a perfectionist calculator to a little girl searching for love. You take a Matrix level scenario and turn it to a classic Hollywood love story. Ghost in the Shell is a deeply philosophical piece of art that goes through the problems of a post modern society and emphasizes on the birth and evolution of an entity greater than AI.

I went to see this movie trying to forget the anime, letting myself be surprised by the characters and plot. And must say that I really enjoyed the movie, especially that ""retro noir"", post apocalyptic atmosphere a la Blade Runner. I never expected to find the same scenes that appear on the anime, that would be a complete waste of time and effort. What would be the point on replicating the same scenes? Instead of that, the movie adds a slightly different approach compared to the original story and sacrifices some philosophical matters perhaps to keep the fast-paced of the action. Another aspect worth to mention is the original score, so magnificent, flowing with the scenes, helping to create that dark, robotic and apocalyptic look.",Ghost in the Shell

It makes it safe for a younger crowd, without ruining the original story at all. The other thing that really stands out is how many scenes are identical to the Anime, at the major plot points it's done seamlessly.This isn't Anime which should be obvious, but it seems some folks are struggling with that. If you miss some part of the Anime, go watch it again. The Anime nerds ripping it apart should consider live action adaptations are going to pull back to low budget B flicks from all of the ignorant reviews. As it stands, they'll likely go dig another crappy DC/Marvel story from the bottom of the pile before ever funding the finish of a live action Ninja Scroll, or Akira.",Ghost in the Shell
916,bit-972-170053,4/10,8,4 April 2017,"The visuals are utterly stunning and fit the tone of what this film should've been so well. Excellent casting, Scarlett Johansson fitted Kusanagi perfectly. Sound track is mostly the same or very similar to the original, so can't go wrong there.The problem with this film is they Hollywood-ed it and changed the story for no reason which made it far less interesting raising less questions and overlooking the entire point of the original.Its as though someone watched GITS and just didn't get the message it was trying to convey and made a movie about how they think it should've gone. They half tried to copy the original in terms of how it was filmed but added unnecessary exposition which deducted from the mystery of the film. On top of that they then somehow ended up making it about Kusanagi fighting the company that made her because they're evil?The original made you ask what makes us human and at what point do we draw the line between humans and machines and the remake just totally doesn't get it and turns it into every other action movie ever.There is a scene in it where Kusanagi goes diving and in my opinion it's the best scene of the original. This is incorporated into the new one but it's an example of how this new film doesn't grasp why the original was so good.Kusanagi goes underwater and then comes back to the surface. Batou asks her why she risks her life and she explains how it makes her feel human because her synth body can malfunction and she could die which scares her. She explains her self identity and how she is still herself, even in a world where she has effectively given her entire body and mind to Setion 9.She says when she surfaces she feels like she's being reborn which foreshadows the ending of the original and the whole scene really builds her as a character. This is the sort of thing that separates GITS from this Hollywood remake.This is completely missed in the remake. Yes, she dives underwater, but she does not expand on why at all. I am certain if you asked whoever wrote the remake why Kusanagi went diving they wouldn't have an answer.Note that this is a reboot and why bother reviewing it at all if you don't compare it to the original.",Ghost in the Shell
917,jwhiskey89,They captured the Shell but lost the Ghost,5,6 April 2017,"Ghost in the Shell (anime) was one of those movies I had on my watch list for years but never got around to seeing it, that is until I decided to see the live action version in theaters. I watched the anime on Saturday evening and the live action Sunday afternoon. I had no prior attachments, nostalgia goggles or anything but the original wins hands down.While the original had less action it did offer intriguing themes and philosophy. We get thrown into this world where most characters already know what's going on and do little explaining. We as the audience are expected to keep up and fill in any blanks by our self.So now for this remake:They absolutely captured the look and even the aesthetic feel and even made improvements here and there. The cinematography is beautiful and the score seemed perfect in any situation. The acting seemed above average and the characters and character relationships were pretty decent. The story has been simplified or even dumb ed down and the script is pretty generic and standard. They only touch on the philosophy in favor of adding exposition and action scenes which is pretty standard in most Hollywood adaptations. Now to the real issues I have with the movie.... It's devoid of any spirit (or ghost ha ha...) and relies too heavily on typical formulas and tropes. We get yet another ""Superhero"" origin story which we have seen a million times since it's the easiest way for the movie to explain stuff to the audience without it feeling unnatural. We get so many clichés, from the villain twist reveal to the typical evil corporation boss to the visions of past / future events the main character is having. We get every point of the story spoon fed to us so nothing remains a mystery or there is any doubt in anything that is going on. Pretty much all the characters are either portrayed as good or evil and act about as predictably as the overarching story line. There was one scene that really highlighted the week points IMO and that was the interrogation of the garbage truck driver.In the original we find out that memory hacking is an issue that is already known to the police but they are powerless to do anything about it. They know how to prove the memory was hacked and are even able to convince the truck driver leaving him devastated. The implications of this are terrifying and really tie in with the philosophy that we are who we are because of our memories and altering them could change or destroy us as a person. The driver feels the loss of his daughter even though he knows she never actually existed since his memories made her real to him.In the remake there seems to be no reason to why he should think he had a daughter. He seems to get hacked while in the truck and turned in to a murder machine. In addition this seems to be the first kind of human hacking, yet the major and the others are immediately able to spot it and ask just the right questions. They were trying to keep the same cool concept of the memory hack but handled it in such an inferior way... Similar to the rest of the movie.Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate the movie it just seemed kind of... shallow. It's yet another adaptation that didn't really add anything new while loosing some things. It's just OK; 6/10 PS: I don't give a damn about the whitewashing ""issue"" so that has not influenced this review at all.",Ghost in the Shell

The news of this adaptation just make me feel curious and think ""how bad can this be ?"". Hollywood is famous to make crappy live action adaptation, is this one included ?I entered the cinema with neutral mind although i already read some reviews And i watched this one, and be like ""How the f*ck ?"". Why the character name changed to Mira Killian ? and claim this is not whitewash ? Motoko Kusanagi is the dead one ? The brain is Japanese with white body so the character name must be white too. Then why the hell she keep called MOTOKO in the ANIME ? wow. just wow. nice try Hollywoodback from cinema, i found the original 1995 and SAC series and trying to compare the story. So different. The only common thing are Section 9 and cyborg female called ""major""and some plot from first episodes SAC series. Thats it. This adaptation story is shallow and predicted. oh the real villain is the inside guy, the fake villain only just a puppet. Why Kuze must be there ? Hollywood try to change the story. Standing ovation.Back to my first question, ""is this one included ?"" yes this one is included to Hollywood collection of crappy adaptation. Don't get me wrong, the visual is superb,music is fantastic, Scarjo in tight suit is gorgeous but all of those are only skin outside the lame,shallow story as the core of this movieso yeah, if you never heard of GITS before or just want a good visual, go see this in IMAX 3D.

In addition to the visual fidelity, several scenes are practically the same as those of the anime. It warms the hearts of fans. As for the existential questions and the philosophy that are the forte of anime, in this adaptation does not deepen so much, but it is still there but superficial some existential questions.

922,galloglaoch,Go and see it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. If reviews are turning you off ignore them!!,9,11 April 2017,"This is the first time I felt the need to write a review but the failure in the box office of this movie hurts me immensely and add to that the dominantly negative attention it's gotten I just couldn't stop myself from coming here and offering another point of view. The movie is really good for what it is and I do mean really good. Not mediocre... REALLY GOOD. Yes it's nowhere near the anime film but it's not what it's supposed to be. If you honestly expected the anime in live action you are your own reason for disappointment. With that being said let me clarify that this movie is not a masterpiece but keep reading and let me explain to you why it's really good. (I will not talk spoilers)First of all Scarlett Johansson was great! I really don't understand the whole buzz of her not being Asian. We had a pretty good female lead and she acted made the role hers. If there is one criticism to be made it's that her Major is not as robotic and synthetic as the anime one and this in fact recreates the character but I don't think that's bad. I actually felt more connected to live- action Major than the anime one.(granted we're not supposed to feel connection with the anime one) She was great in action scenes she was great ins scenes exploring the philosophy of the movie. Also the movie had a clever way of explaining her not being Asian, well played movie.(I liked it at least) Second reason why the movie is great is because it carries the philosophy of the original. Yes it's simplified but it makes you think! It's not a dumb Hollywood action flick, it asks many important questions the original asked, it misses some but it adds a new twist here and there too. The ""villain"" is not as good as the anime one(in my opinion) but it's a pretty solid one and a lot better than what we get in most movies nowadays. I've been told this character appears in the anime series(I haven't seen them) so perhaps he's not inherently worse than anime movie one but just supposed to be a different character altogether. Anyway the ""villain"" made you ask questions and that's the important part.Visually the movie was stunning. This is how the best sci-fi films should look like and it was incredible. Add to that Batou looked great(and played great), the villain looked great and in the third act there is a thing straight out of anime that looked great. Add to that the great soundtrack and you get a great treat for both your eyes and your ears.It's getting too long so I'll cut it short. Overall it's not the best movie ever made and it's not as good as it's source material but that doesn't make it bad. I actually think it's pretty good. Anime adaptations are definitely on the right track. Unfortunately it seems we won't be getting a lot of them because us anime fans keep on hating on anime adaptations because they are not exactly what we want and in my opinion this is childish. Live action Ghost in the Shell definitely honors the anime and if anything it opens the door for new fans. I wasn't planning on watching the Stand Alone Complex series but now I will because now I like not only the anime movie but the live action one as well so this makes me want to dive deeper into the philosophy and ideas of the source material. I feel this means the movie did it's job and I'm happy I saw it and I'm proud to stand and proclaim I wasn't disappointed and I rate this movie very highly.(Menaing I don't consider it a guilty pleasure)In the end of the day it's something you yourself should decide if you like or not. Really it depends on your taste. You might not like the philosophy, might not like the setting or you might enjoy it.What I'm trying to say is you need to watch this as a stand alone sci-fi movie with it's creative decisions and themes. Only after that you're allowed to place it in the universe the source material created back in the days. I'm certain we need and deserve more movies like this but it seems we make it impossible by letting this gem suffer in the box office. Thanks to this prejudice we're unlikely to get a good anime adaptation anytime soon. If you are a fan of the anime don't walk into this with prejudice, let it be it's own thing and treat yourself to a good movie and decide if Hollywood got it right or wrong.If you have't seen the anime and the only reason you're not seeing it is because reviews... ignore them, you never know what made this person write it. He might be wearing his dark tinted glasses or his pink tinted ones. I ain't a one to tell you that you MUST watch it and you must like it. I'm saying, give it a chance! I'm giving it 9 out of 10 because it satisfied everything I wanted to get from a sci-fi movie, the only reason it's not a 10 is because I can't lie to anyone and say it's a perfect movie. It has flaws but it's merits out weight them. This movie deserves a chance to impress you, don't let someone deny you a thought provoking flick. The best part is after you finish, if you like it there is a whole universe of it in anime form and you are free to explore it.",Ghost in the Shell
923,andypaine01,Almost there,7,1 April 2017,"It has almost everything it needs to be a 9 out of 10 (and still can be in a good re-cut), but the soundtrack needs some work, a little bit of additional side story for a character or two that could be added in, and a few bridge scenes to make the whole thing come together more. The story wasn't disjointed but the overall product was. Every time it approached an immersive experience it would lose it. It felt like watching a series of great scenes that added up to a cohesive story. I think the cast was amazing, the story was great, the visuals were awesome, and the scenes were great. They just didn't tie together the way they should have for the final product. All in all I enjoyed it and am optimistic that a directors cut or extended cut have great potential to solve most or all of the issues that kept me from giving a much higher rating.

The movie deviates from the original anime in terms of concepts (the ending of the anime is different from the movie) but I would say it is more realistic and logical. For those who do not follow the anime, if they watch the original 1995 anime movie they would not understand some of the gist especially the ending but with the movie it is a fresh work of its own by itself. From beginning to end, you will be able to follow and it is high action most of the time with a good plot that attempts to explained all that has happened within the short time frame of the movie. One part that is a bit hard to follow is the dialogue switch from Japanese to English with the words all over the place instead of at the bottom. Makes you miss some of the dialogue.

I watched a few clips from the original anime prior to seeing the film just to have a point of reference to compare, but was largely unaware of the previous story lines.When this movie is taken at face value, it is a coming of age story that focuses on the Major. I though ScarJo did an outstanding job and the supporting cast was tremendous as well. The visuals are stunning and the attention to detail in the set design was outstanding. The storyline is not as complex as the original material, but it wasn't trying to be. The complexity of the plot is still miles ahead of most films made in the genre and I loved every bit of it.Bottom line, please attempt to see this movie with an open mind and take it at face value.

926,zharko,Huge disappointment if you are true fan of the original,2,9 May 2017,"To summarize: if you are real fan of the original and have not watched this yet then *don't* do it!OK, so the good bits first. Visually it is pretty solid, it does good job to capture the GITS dystopian cyberpunk world: large skyscrapers, holograms everywhere, people all around enhanced with robotic implants, etc. Sometimes the lighting colors seem too flashy and inadequate and there are some large hologram ads which seem out of context, but it's not a big issue, the visual part remains on solid grounds and deserves praise.But then there's the real issue - the script, it is garbage compared to the original. The characters are one-dimensional: either good or bad. They lack any depth, their dialogues are shallow, unconvincing and feel forced. The garbageman acted by Shia LaBeouf is so flat it hurts to watch him. As a viewer it leaves you no room to emotionally connect to any of the characters - an aspect that is so beautifully done in the 1995 original. The thought-provoking aspects about blurring boundaries between humans and AI, and what an identity means in a highly advanced civilization are reduced to shambles.In short, this movie is what you get when an amazing, deep and complex original story is degraded and adopted for an average viewer who reads news about Kim Kardashian and watches reality shows.",Ghost in the Shell
927,Talacaoriginally,tedious,2,8 May 2017,"A slow-paced, ""kinda"" action movie. there was no real action sequences or real power behind the visual effects. I would describe the movie as one with a lot of potential and material but lacked the right direction, writing and acting. After the hour mark, it was hard to stay awake and focus on the movie because the dialogue is so clichéd and delivered with no conviction from any of the actors",Ghost in the Shell
928,thuggyj,Great Movie,10,1 April 2017,"I gave this Movie a 10 simply due to the Low ratings it received prior to having even come out by Ghost in the Shell anime fans that simply watched the Trailer and hated on the movie before even having seen it. Such is the anime community sigh*. That being said i'd give the overall rating of this Film an 8/10. It's absolutely visually stunning with great special effects which really give it a similar/same atmosphere as the original ghost in the shell although a bit brighter and colorful. Having seen Both Original Ghost in the Shell series and Movies, I think this live action adaptation did the best job possible in terms of bringing the anime to life. Much of the live action is very much the same as the First 1995 animated Movie a few tweaks to the storyline made but with the MAIN Iconic action scenes still intact. Anyone who gave this movie under a 6 was simply coming in with expectations waaaaaay to high as there's no way we were gonna get an exact replica of the 1995 series to think that would be naive. Overall i would recommend you see the movie for yourself and gain the best experience viewing it in 3D as i found it more immersive for this particular film/genre.",Ghost in the Shell
929,spaliuke,Disappointment,3,16 April 2017,"I am a fan of original anime and I love Imax 3D. Usually I don't expect some great plot from Imax movies, I just want to see something beautiful and stylish. I am not hater or super-critic and this is my first review for IMDb, but I just have to say how disappointed am I. This movie well done (visual effects) but everything else... I don't know where to start. 1. It is slow. I mean it so slow that become boring. They tried to show us some thoughtful moments, but it just don't work. 2. Plot is dumb and nothing like original, but this one I could forgive. As I said, this is not movie for Sundance festival. What I couldn't forgive is characters' misinterpretations. They looks like original visually (from anime), but characters... And worst one is Major itself. In anime she is super-cool robocop - very clever, knowing what to do, confident and even her weaknesses don't ruin her toughness. Here she is lost sheep and victim. Really? Why to name movie after famous anime if you want to do such a thing with MAIN character??? 3. Acting. Scarlet is awful :/ I don't know is it her fault or this is plot and film director, but she just don't fit in this role. I mean she is good as a sheep, but not as a Major. Since movie creators decided to make a movies about a sheep, maybe she is good for this role, but I wanted to see Major... I don't know if I could recommend this film. Maybe I could if you didn't see original series. But if you saw original, I think you will be disappointed. 3/10",Ghost in the Shell
930,peter-214-15666,Don't listen to the negative,8,27 November 2020,"If you are a fan of Ghost in the Shell, you should give this rendition a shot. Reading through all the negative reviews I was afraid I wouldn't like the movie at all. However, now that I have seen it myself, I wonder if anyone who only has negative things to say about this movie are even real fans of the franchise to begin with. Most of the negative comments about Johanssen being the Major and that this movie is ""white"" washed clearly missed the point of the film. Was it supposed to be a perfect rendition of the franchise as true fans have come to know this world to be, ...no. But it is pretty close. The cast was what I felt was a good mix and embodied each character well, not perfect as I wished it would have developed each character more, but enough to know it is from the franchise. Besides, this is about Kusanagi. Even the different story arcs from the anime have taken liberties to ""reinvent"" the Major. This one made Kusanagi the most human. If you get hung up on these superficial aspects of the film that everyone seems to complain about, then I don't think you get Ghost in the Shell and wonder how much of a fan you really are. Even the creator approved of this film, so you can't say it isnt respectful to the source material.

It begins with the complete miscast of giving the lead role of Major to Scarlett Johansen for the sole purpose of better marketing in the non Asian world. It sucks! And you feel in it in every Scene with her. She does not belong in this movie. Even when you see her as a decent actress, that she is, there are way better suited actresses of Asian origin for this iconic role. It gets even wierder when you see the likes of Great Japanese actor Takeshi to not even bother to speak English. And why would her Mother speak English with an hard Japanese Accent?? It makes this movie so wierd!And there are parts of the movie where they really tried to stay true to the Original but chickened out of it for the female lead?! It really destroyed this movie for me and shows you everything that is wrong in the movie business.The story is still good, but never got me like with the original.If you are interested in this movie, please watch the original Anime, it is so much better!!",Ghost in the Shell

All this talk about white-washing denigrates a pretty solid movie IMO. Its brought the Ghost in the Shell series to an audience who normally wouldn't be interested in anime.

The problem hereby is that most of the remade scenes lose their meaning and impact if they stand alone out of context; like they do here when they are shown in some pseudo random points in the movie.Of course the movie looks stunning but compared to the 1995 anime (witch still looks gorgeous too) it looses almost all of its character. The fact that the story is really dumbed down doesn't help.So did we need this? Is there any reason to watch this over the anime? I think the answer is ""no"". It isn't an awful (or particularly good) movie but there simply is no necessity for it's existence.",Ghost in the Shell

939,hypokrites,Somewhat lacking performance by Johansson backed up by Pitt's character makes for an enjoyable watch,8,3 April 2017,"Where does this movie stand? It is NOT as good as it's counterpart, the original animated movie. However, this movie is not bad, and while it drew a lot from the original movie, it takes on a slightly different direction in the plot, character development/focus and appeal. It has been a good number of years since I watched the original, so I had only a mild recollection of the movie going in to this one, which was nice, because I was trying a little harder to figure in this movie, vs scrutinizing and comparing. So in that respect, if you have any interest in seeing this movie, forget watching the animated one, right before.Scarlett Johansson did an adequate job playing the Major, but she certainly did not play the Major of old, and I did find her some what more 'distant' than what might have been required. Her almost complete lack of emotion, and the way the introduction, year later scene really made it hard for me to buy in to the character. However I did find the ending very touching.The plot diverges enough so that you are not watching the same movie, and I felt the performance/story of 'Kuze' was very provocative and complemented Johansson very well. I would give the movie 1.5 thumbs up, with respect to most of what Hollywood is producing, it gets two solid thumbs up. & Yeah, Takeshi Kitano, almost worth the price of admission right there.",Ghost in the Shell

With time man and machine start to become one with unlimited possibilities to create and evolve.Sometimes fiction is not that far apart from reality.This is what Ghost in the Shell brings us with this live action adaptation that explores the meaning of being human.As a big fan of the Ghost in the Shell universe I have to say this was my most expected film of the year, counting the days for its release and finally it is here, but did it leave up to the hype? The Story: For those unfamiliar with the 1995 anime film Ghost in the Shell fear not, the story is well paced and easy to understand for newcomers and for fans this was a very special experience as the story has a new but at the same time familiar feeling that makes you say This is Ghost in the Shell.Art: The futuristic world portrayed in this film is absolutely beautiful to look at, the CGI is so good that sometimes I forgot it was CGI, in my opinion they represented the world of Ghost in the Shell perfectly.I was very happy with Scarlett Johansson performance in this film, she became the major and did an amazing job at it, not only is she beautiful but very talented to make one of the most well known characters in the history of the anime industry her own.If you still have doubts about going to the movie theater to see this movie, please do yourself a favor and go watch it now you will not regret it.

941,camilaba13,Definitely not up to par with the original,4,24 March 2017,"Rupert Sanders is back again with the live action remake of the acclaimed Japanese film ""Ghost in the Shell"". Which talks about a future in which humans can enhance ourselves with robotic parts. The movie follows the story of Major, a woman whose body is 100% robotic, but her brain is human. Starting with Johansson's performance, her acting is quite stiff, similar to how we saw her in ""Lucy"" , this is comprehensible, since in the original film, Major's speech and mannerisms are very ""robotic"", however, it doesn't feel like Johansson achieved that, and her acting ends up looking forced even, which wouldn't be much of a problem if she weren't the main character and we saw her 99% of the whole movie. The film, compared to the original, is very easy to understand, everything is explained, either visually or in the script. The movie pretends to be reflexive, but it doesn't achieve it at the same level as the Japanese version. It's reflective in a way that appeals to the emotion. Visually, the film it's incredible, the weapon design and the design of the city are impeccable. The sequences of the city are incredible. However, this alone doesn't keep the movie afloat. Also, there are sequences that are straight up copied from the original film, but they don't evoke the same feelings. The action sequences are good, but they're definitely not up to par with the ones from the Japanese version, they don't generate the same feel and become predictable. The movie seems to be embellished more than it should, with unnecessary visual effects, sequences, and shots, which, on the long run, make the movie feel long and become quite boring. The original version works because, despite being simple, it's reflective, aesthetically beautiful and has an amazing soundtrack. However, and, leaving comparisons behind the movie works for what it is, a Hollywood remake that I'm sure the general public will enjoy.",Ghost in the Shell

Obviously the movie won't be as good as the 1995 original mainly because the studios want to reach more people instead and also because it is easier to do a lot more for less in animation vs. live action. If you are angered that it isn't as good as the 1995 movie, then please stay home and watch the original and not ruin the movie going experience for normal and new fans who will look at these ratings and decide the movie isn't worth watching.Please take all your complaints to anime forums instead of those used by the general public.",Ghost in the Shell

And also, please don'tforget we don't know her real ethnicity, age or sex. So Scarjo is not the big deal here. Good cyberpunk movie in general, the plot is a bit dumb but it's OK.

Since I saw the trailer for the 2017 real make, I wasn't able to hold back my excitement. But after seeing the movie, I realize how big a disaster the movie is. It was totally disappointing. The beauty of the plot and content was nullified to a significant extent. They changed the original story so much that its hard to believe that this mediocre movie is really the remake of the legendary Ghost in the shell. As a fan of the original work, I can't feel it any more in the movie. Scarlett Johnson, even though she did her best, was quite far from resembling Major.

But this movie does pay homage to the original in a way i have never seen before, some scenes are recreated as close to exact as possible and i loved seeing them. The movie does portray its own dumbed down version of the story whilst maintaining some original elements.Obviously it has its flaws but the things it gets right outweigh the negatives.The world building is amazing and crosses the boundary of original styles and the new styles. The characters are cast pretty well.Some important scenes are recreated albeit in the dumbed down manner, but the respect to the original is still there.Try to have an open mind while watching it and you will enjoy it.",Ghost in the Shell
950,markswam,An excellent movie that fits wonderfully into the Ghost in the Shell universe; unfortunately hindered by negative pre-release drama,8,16 April 2017,"THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW. THIS IS AN EXPLICIT WARNINGFrom a technical perspective, this movie is excellent. The cinematography is beautiful.The special effects are stunning.The music perfectly complements the visuals (though it did rather annoy me that they didn't use Kenji Kawai's ""Making of a Cyborg"" during the cladding scene).The fight choreography is some of the best I've seen in a long time, and actually manages to keep a lot of the fluidity and feel of the movement from the TV show and OVA series. And the casting choices were spot-on. Every single actor in the movie played the character they were given perfectly.The only gripe I have with the casting is that is the elderly Japanese woman they cast to play Motoko's mom was hard to understand due to her ridiculously thick accent. But that's understandable because English obviously isn't her character's first language, and I'm guessing it wasn't the actress' either.Scarlett Johansson especially was able to do an excellent job of being both robotic and emotive, all at once, which is exactly what her character (the Major) needed.Then we get to the story part, which is where I'm hung up. If I knew nothing about any other entry in the series, I think I would absolutely love this. My problem comes in that it relied heavily on references and homages to literally every other entry in the series. Ghost in the Shell (1995). Innocence. Stand Alone Complex. Arise.I want to preface this by saying that I think that the story was fantastic, and it did a great job actually being a Ghost in the Shell story.That said, watching through the movie, I could tell exactly what they were lifting and blending together to try and create something new. For example, the deuteragonist (Hideo Kuze) was lifted straight from the second season of Stand Alone Complex, but he was also sort of melded together with the Puppet Master from the 1995 movie. The killer geisha robots come directly from Innocence. The spider tank fight scene was again a combination of something from the 1995 movie and one of the episodes of Arise. The hacked, murderous garbage man was also lifted 100% from the 1995 movie.That's what I don't know how to reconcile. On it's own, it would be fantastic. As a Ghost in the Shell story, it's also really good. It sort of combines the plots of all of the previous installments of the series to give a complete story, from the Major's cyberization, through her self-discovery, and ending squarely on her becoming the terminal/ultimate/final/complete Major. I just feel like they were banking a little too hard on references to things that already exist rather than trying to create something new.It was an all around *GREAT* movie. The problem, if I can make it explicit, is that my brain keeps telling me to compare it to literally everything that came before. I never had that problem going between the other three canons.All of the other timelines are easily separated from one another and judged independently because their only common thread is Section Nine. This, on the other hand, is sort of acting like mortar in the wall of the series. It has tendrils weaving its way into the cracks of everything else. It's not me looking for reasons to hate it; it's more the movie itself unintentionally inviting undue attention to other entries in the universe and distracting from itself. I think they knew that this movie was going to be highly contentious and that it would be judged harshly by people who genuinely want to hate it because ""HURR DURR NOT Japanese ORIGINAL SO IS BAD,"" so they tried to distract those people by throwing their attention to the other things that they do like. That may work for those people; it just felt to me like they were trying desperately to cover up flaws that just didn't exist.If you go and see it, you'll probably see where I'm coming from though. The story is great. The filmmaking was fantastic. I just think that the studio heads were a little more cautious than they *could* (not necessarily *should*) have been.All in all, it's a solid 8/10 as a Ghost in the Shell movie. As a standalone post-cyberpunk movie, it's easily a 9.And since I warned you about spoilers at the start, I might as well give one explicit one now: Don't get annoyed when the Major refers to herself as ""Mira Killian."" That's the name that Hanka Robotics gave her to try and stop her remembering who she was. Her real name is still Motoko Kusanagi.",Ghost in the Shell

I saw the movie yesterday and i was impressed at how they actually managed to translate the anime into ""real life"" stuff, this is no small achievement.People are overlooking the great qualities of this movie for the sake of criticism and ideology. As an anime and manga fan, i have to say that i recognize what we are supposed to get if we expect it to come from Hollywood: we get what we got for ghost in the shell 2017.Did the story lose depth? Its actually a questionable complaint... i have watched many anime and ghost in the shell always stood out as one of those who belonged to a niche. If anything, i feel that if there is anything that will impact this movie's performance, its exactly this: its directed to a specific public. And this actually should account as a sign that they actually hold loyalty to the source material when they wrote the script, because they could have made this a movie that appealed to other fan bases, depending on the direction it took.I have mixed feelings about this choice, i want the movie to perform well, because i want more anime/manga movies... but to perform well, sometimes you need to make more marketing, you have to destroy it a little. I expect people to blame the wrong things here, when the only thing to blame is the story itself.Ghost in the shell was new when it was new, now that everybody copied and created other stories inspired on it, critics will call it ""unoriginal""... how unfair.",Ghost in the Shell

The guy cast as Batou stole every scene he was in. And visually, it gave us all the touch points we've been seeing for two decades.The story... they were too busy trying to mash together 20 years of stories into one movie. They had the Puppet Master, Laughing Man and Individual Eleven story lines in one room, tossed in some Robocop and then put turned on the autotune. As a result, it was trying really hard but never quite got there. They could have done better coming up with a new story rather than this hybrid.I do think that Ms Scarlett wasn't the right person. She doesn't have the chops to carry a GitS storyline, which by nature should be complex and more than a little deep. When compounded by the weak script.. Yeah. She never played the Major, she did a hybrid of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop and Natasha Romanov.So all that said, it was not a waste of time watching it. It was very pretty. Very pretty.

960,zigiwig,A wonderful standalone thing of its own,8,4 April 2017,"Well after all the speculation and reading thousands of fan crying out loud on social media about whitewashing and stripping off the essence of the original 1995 movie, I must stay I liked this movie. It is evident how hard the movie team has worked to bring this complex story on to the big screen and they deserve praise for that. I felt right with the mood of the decaying, gritting future city and the general mood. I liked Aramaki's character, what a bad-ass and the relationship between Batuo and Major is well explored. My only gripe is with the villain, it was too weak. The tone and story is dumbed down to make the pace going as this is an action flick but it still touches that philosophical mark that the original is all about. Overall I should say weather you are a fan or not, just go with an open mind and give this a try.",Ghost in the Shell
961,bladerunner-44109,Scarlett's take on the major was interesting,7,31 March 2017,"WARNING MIGHT CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Naturally it was with some trepidation that I went to see the Hollywood remake. I probably wouldn't have except that Karen really wanted to check it out (love you). I left feeling very satisfied. Perhaps in part because of low expectations but also because it really is a solid movie. To my surprise it felt almost like a prequel even though the adaptation kept the general story and many of the iconic scenes. It followed Kusanagi much closer. In the '17 version her thoughts and feeling are laid much more bare than in the '95 original. She comes off as much more fragile and lost, barely keeping it together. I was very, very impressed with Johansson portrait of the major. Never once did I miss the aloof and coolly professional major. And if I do she's still there in '95. Another great aspect is the atmosphere and especially cityscape. Perhaps the only thing better than in the original. Another review talked about how bladerunneresque the cityscape was and I could feel it. The whitewashing did disturb me a little. Especially the casting of Binoche as Dr. Ouélet felt off. I also had a hard time with Pitt as Kuze but he sold me on his character eventually. The only thing I was really disappointed in was the soundtrack. Nothing more than a bleak echo of the original. I'm looking forward to see both versions back to back. I recommend the '17 version to anyone who likes the original (and isn't a purist).",Ghost in the Shell
962,habbtar-74961,Great movie from a classic anime,9,28 April 2017,"I had incredibly high expectations for the movie, been watching the anime for as long as i can remember (i.e. re-watching when i get bored with all the dumb anime's out there) and this movie was excellent. It captured the essence of the characters of motoko and batou, albeit with a few ""Hollywoody"" additions (seems inevitable) but that didn't take away from the movie at all.If a little bit of Hollywood-ization is the price to pay to such classic made into good movies, i'm all for it..",Ghost in the Shell
963,madameluciel,The best part of the film was thinking Batou might be Kiefer Sutherland from Lost Boys,2,6 April 2017,"It's like a conversation with a guy who just sat through a marathon of all the Ghost in Shell films and series while drunk. He remembers elements and gets a bunch of the details wrong and in general it doesn't make any sense. It's more or less hacked together from 3 different narratives.The problem with this is that out of the 3 main story lines they seem to have, non of them work properly because they're missing the beginning or end. We have the original story line with the end hacked off, then some second start missing story in the middle that isn't ended properly, then some random third story line limply stapled on the end. It would have made more sense to have either picked one or at least made it coherent.To get a similar effect, just get all the material on this franchise, pick random scenes, remove or change most of their relevance and you've basically got this film. There are characters there for no reason, there's background changes for no reason. The whole film just feels like it has no reason to be based on the material they didn't even use.Even if you're not a fan of the series, the plot isn't very good and quite nonsensical. They seem to rely on you having knowledge of the material, but then change things anyway. So both fans of the material and newcomers don't really have much clue. But OK, the plot sucks, there must be something about this that makes it worthy of glowing praise some people feel it deserves?, right? Not really. The action is kind of boring and poorly choreographed, and is just generic police show level material for the most part, or badly done redos. Scarlett Johansson isn't very believable in this role and looks kind of awkward and not very believable or impactful. the acting is wooden and mostly terrible. It's like b movie level if that. The main actress gets lots of screen time, but just seems really bored, though that's her thing. The casting is mostly forgettable. There was the slightly odd decision to have one character speaking Japanese while everyone understood and responded to him in English. Which was only odd because it made it hard to assume everyone else was just was in Japan speaking Japanese, unless everyone in Japan but him speaks English now? Who really knows!The dialog is poorly written and kind of insultingly simple. You'll have an already simplified concept explained to you, then explained to you again by someone else, and then again like we're all little babies that can't grasp anything by our little own selves. I'm not sure the target audience for this but i'm guessing it wasn't 5 year old children. People who claim it is ""though provoking"" do look a bit silly, as PeeWee's playhouse is more challenging.There are far too many scenes of filler nonsense (in a not very long film). Mostly of Scarlett Johansson staring at things looking bored. She stares emotionless a bunch for no reason too many times or just does things that makes no sense to her character. Maybe they just filmed her in her lunch break and then used it to pad out the film, who knows.In all the film just felt really lazy. There was little care taken in any single aspect of the production, from the designs that made no sense and had no solidness or grounding to them, to the bizarre city of weird holograms for no reason. Or the disparate story lines not properly explained and the insertion of random other story lines for no reason. Non of it has any relation to anything else and feels really superficial and disjointed.But is the film enjoyable? Not really. It doesn't serve a purpose as a mindless action film (the action is bland) or a thought provoking film (the dialog is idiot level simplified) or even a good coherent story.Like I said, I did think one of the main characters looked really like Kiefer Sutherland from Lost Boys at one point. That was probably the best part of the film.",Ghost in the Shell
964,nsmith-37261,A true gentleman,8,2 April 2017,"Lets imagine, that you are the Hollywood director of the first live action movie from the diverse universe of ""Ghost in the Shell"". You will take the original score from Kenjii Kawai and take the plot and scenery shot-for-shot from Mamorou Oshii's work. You will cast Asians only, because you care about the race. Let us be philosophical: What is a race? We are a copy master without own ideas and deliver nothing new. Just compete with Oshii, because you can do it better. Take some new bible quotes that provide no clear answers and let the audience think: This is philosophy. Threw your ancestors on the ground. /sFortunately, Rupert Sanders is not such an unfair director. His interpretation does not intend to be better than the original, it never wanted to be. Instead it is truly original and has its iconic moments and Easter-eggs as an homage to the predecessors. He unifies some ideas and creates something new, just in the spirit of project 2501:""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system""Music: Origa. Scott Mattew. Kenjii Kawaii. Steve Conte. They are all various interprets from previous iterations of GitS. It is no surprise that this film starts with a different kind of music, too. Clint Mansell (known for Requiem of a Dream) did a great job of combining wave-synth elements with orchestral parts and choir samples. Unfortunately, at some moments, the music is a way too subtle. For example, when the Major and Kuze met for the first time. The dialogue is very strong, but needs more music as an undertone. Sometimes, there is a jingle from the predecessors, a rattle, some bells. My try to memorize the music was nearly impossible, since the music lacks of a Leitmotif, but I took my pen and paper and it wasn't forgotten. (7/10)Visuals: The visuals are truly remarkable. I saw on Adam Savage's ""Tested"" how much effort WETA had put into this movie. When I saw it finally on screen, it was not overloaded with CGI and used a lot of practical effects. I adored the 3D effects, too. I also kept in mind, that Rupert wanted to create his own world (any comparison with the predecessors is quite senseless). (10/10)Acting: Scarlett Johansson (Major) and Pilou Asbæk (Batou) representing a strong duo. Mr. Michael Pitt (Kuze) is outstanding and Takeshi Kitano (Aramaki) performs great as a wise chief director. Juliette Binoche (Dr. Ouelet) delivers a solid performance as a mother and scientist at the same time. However, I felt that the scientific part of Dr. Ouelet was not polished up. (8/10)Plot: Yes, the story is easy to digest. It is true, that the film does not ask direct questions to you, but this does not imply that the film is not about existence, the mind-body problem and cyber-ethics! Think about the shelling sequence as its own unethical procedure and combine it with the name Kuze. Think about cyber enhancements and look at the fate of Dr. Osmond. Will you be enhanced in the near future? Are you already enhanced, because you can not live without your smartphone anymore? What is the truth, what is real? Is existence bound to a body or can you be someone else? Imagine that you are Dr. Ouelet. Will you be a happy person? What was the price that Ouelet payed to become a modern version of Dr. Frankenstein? In this movie, humanity is endangered by technology, but the message is either not clear enough or not complicated enough to say ""this is philosophical"".

Unfortunately since this is a so called Ghost in the Shell movie it completely missed the mark. Because if you change something too much from its origin, after a certain point it is no longer that thing anymore - such as it is.Scarlett Johansson was terrible choice as Motoko Kusanagi. (ProTip: MAJOR is a rank, not a name) The studio exes simply wanted a ""Black Widow"" to sell movie tickets instead of accurately portraying the character. The character Motoko is supposed to know exactly who she is, where she comes from and her purpose, she is strong and cold, focused and brutal, a great leader part of an elite team, hardly sexual or feminine at all unless required for tactical reasons but instead we this typical generic mediocre default female lead version of Motoko.Pilou Asbæk is also a very bad representation of Batou, hes nothing like Batou physically or in character or even acting.Another case (and very typical recently) of the director not understanding the mythos, the very point and heart, of the thing they are trying to recreate and instead inflicting the audience with their own shallow misguided interpretation.Essentially the meaning and spirit of the story is completely lost in the 'hollywood washing' of the original concept, the characters thoroughly misrepresented and incorrectly portrayed.

In the four minute released clip of Ghost in the Shell (2017), it received praise and changed the minds of many once philosophical questions WERE inserted into the scenes, along with a more modern way of taking the original scenes and Americanizing it which isn't necessarily a bad thing to do. Most of the people are mad at the actors race, and the way the trailer was formatted. But in order to form your own opinion on it you should go out and purchase a ticket. I personally via early screening enjoyed the movie, the mechanics & detail put into the movie is very fitting for a 2017 film, a good chunk is not CGI either. It is very hard to talk about the film without spoiling, but with Scarlett Johansons style of acting it fit the emotionless Major even if it's not a blank stare.

Even though the accusations of whitewashing were baseless to begin with, I was concerned that they may have westernized or washed out some of the GITS flavour that I know and love. To me, this film was fantastic. I went in expecting to be disappointed and I came out grinning ear to ear. I laughed as I watched Aramaki be a down right bad ass. The relationship between Major and Batou was freakin' spot on. There's a lot of philosophy to represent, and that's not easy to do in a movie designed to capture and keep attention, but they did it. The fan service was brilliant and I loved it. It was visually stunning. The soundtrack was wonderful. Scarjo was an excellent study of the Major. It was not tacky or cliché at all. Please, do not listen to the inevitable vapid borderline insulting ""critiques"" that you'll no doubt uncover by the various news media who were targeted with pumping out a review for a movie they genuinely don't give two shits about.

Sadly the Hollywood creators did not even try, judging from the script, it's likely they didn't even understand the source content. It reminds me of the days where Hollywood use to adapt a book changing everything about it except the name. Hollywood sigh, I thought we were over this bad behavior.Every character expect for batou's dog got a serious downgrade in intelligence and depth making for a group of highly skilled idiots jumping from one scene to the next. It's such a pity because each character in the original could easily uphold a film for themselves. Visually it's fairly similar as they have taken shot for shot views which can look gorgeous. Scenes not directly in the original can look a bit flashy and unrealistic. They have attempted to imbue some philosophy in here and failed big time.

Every sequence is a great experience. I think the live action was on par or even exceeded the visuals from the anime movies before it. Pacing: They just simply did it right. It did not bore me.I am satisfied.Plot & Story: I really appreciate how they deviated the story but still were able to retain the essence and themes of the source material. I hold section 9's unity and trust with each other with a high regard.Actors: Scarlett Johansson delivers in this movie IMO. Beat Takeshi as Aramaki is badass and a awesome leader. Batou is great and complements well with the major. Kuze is freaky as hell. He is as they initially described as a combination of the Puppet Master & Kuze of the anime series. Music: The movie could have been mind blowing if they try to tap into Kenji Kawai's Iconic sound track and Yoko Kano's ""Inner Universë""and ""Torukia"". It is still good though. I still gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because of the musical score that could have been a lot better.Final Thoughts: Go see it in 3D and be immersed into a futuristic world where technology and humanity become one.

With that said, I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be bad and adds to love for the series and my collections. I glanced at my GITS DVDs as I left the house excited for the possibility. I really wanted this film to surprise me, but did not want it deviate from an already exciting and innovative plot too far. It failed to achieve that however. What I saw was a shoddy story, a lack of understanding regarding the morality of GIIS, a lot of impressive graphics and an actress who does not belong, is of the wrong ethnicity and really does not know what the original story of the film she is in is about. For her, it is a pay check. The music, in particular was disappointing and fails.

The story is not perfect but good enough to explain the setting of the GIS world. THE GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT IS: Aramaki's actor, Takeshi Kitano's face looks more like a gang boss who's cunning and ruthless, whereas Aramaki is a loyal protector of justice and you can see the righteousness even from his eyes.

CGI were mostly spot- on, only one or two scenes pulled me out of immersion. As a big plus, the film took some time to actually present the world itself without jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen time, but still delivered. Now, Johansson as the Major, I know a lot of fuss was there about whitewashing, I don't care about SJW thing, what matters to me if an actor/ess can act the role and IMO she was a great choice. In most scenes she behaved exactly like her character should, it didn't feel forced or overacted to me.And for the plot itself, I'm not saying it was fresh or never seen before thing, but it was a nice take and it brought something to the franchise.

However I feel like I just got scammed that's why I'm compelled to make an account just for this movie. Next, I have to say that putting aside the GItS label this movie are just your usual mediocre SF with crisp visual, the setting of GItS has inspired so many works over time, which ironically resulted in said GItS re-adaptation 22 years later seems cliché by comparison. However to this date there's hardly any adaptation that managed to be as thought provoking as GItS, which is why I had hopes for this adaptation could capture that essence. In reality?? I bet 10 bucks that midway through the movie most of you guys will have a general idea as how the movie will progress, the story are just that generic. Now that I got that covered, let's get to the main dish. First the casting, I'm not bothered by whitewashing and honestly SJ done great as Major, and Pilou Asbæk are perfect at his role as Battou. Honestly the casting are perfect. however I found the name change to be unnecessary but that's my opinion. Next Visual, I found no fault in it, and I love their car selection which are quite accurate with the original GItS. Now.. time for main part, the plot or rather the theme. I'm sure there's billion fans already grumbling about the plot which is why I won't repeat it, however I must say that the biggest fault of this supposedly 'adaptation' is that they throw all of the original's soul or rather 'ghost' out of the window to make it simpler and more appealing to western audience; which arguably are unnecessary considering heavy movie like interstellar and Inception are widely received as positive, while trying to market it as GItS. If I were to write in detail why this movie are not Ghost in The Shell then I doubt that 1k words will be enough however I must raise this fatal one, this movie failed to address the question of Evolution in cybernetics society, it instead offer us a cheap justice and bad romance to fill the hole that such heavy theme left us. Conclusion? Another Hollywood attempt to sell us garbage by attaching shiny label. At the very least it's way better than DBZ and Avatar, however it still lose to Edge of Tomorrow in term of adaptation.

In my opinion Scarlett Johansson did a good job acting out this machine- human. Her pose, her (missing) facial impressions and her regular speaking voice is well done, judging from the background and the character.To the person who has seen the original, there are some elements that are more fleshed out than in the original, probably for the western cinema viewer who would probably have difficulties reading between the line of the original Japanese predecessor. Most of the scenes are however very close to the original with a lot of love for detail.The visuals are stunning and it feels very retro-90s futuristic.

I am not here to give any spoilers so I will just try and keep to the original content. The movie is excellent, the actors really portrayed their characters well. Scarlett Johanson really did well and all the other actors really made me believe I was watching the original of so long ago. The CGI is just as good and I could easily believe what was produced was truth and not CGI. To comment on the story itself: (without giving spoilers) there was some things left out from the original content, which would have been nice to see if it was there, (but it didn't take anything away from the storyline).The different story-lines, time-lines and content of the originals had way to many things that clashed and it is nice to see the way that the movie was produced, was where a lot of detail was actually left murky and that gave the story a chance to flow into each other. The movie also had a proper intro, body and ending, which left me as the watcher feeling complete.

There was another proof that a background is more important than skill in the way #RupertSanders executed this production and by execution I mean slaughter, decapitation...None of the brilliant atmosphere is there, no consideration of sound as an integral part of the story, no attention to detail at all [ grave ]...

I knew this movie was going to be amazing and it turned out to be more then that. people kept blaming this movie for white washing and not staying true to the anime ....well you know what who cares it's an adaptation of an adaptation that's the point. each ghost in the shell anime has been an adaptation of the original manga and that's something ""true fans"" would know. if your hesitant on seeing this GO see it if your new to ghost in the shell you will enjoy this beautiful sci fi world, if your an artist you will love every frame. if your a hardcore fan of the anime looking to point fingers stay home and don't bother to bring down a great film. my last note is this movie is truly a beautiful movie with amazing city scapes, costuming, music scoring and vfx. loved it !!",Ghost in the Shell

However, this movie is an over-simplified version of Japanese 95 film. The all charming part of original material is gone. If you are a big fan of the original film, you do not have to spend your money into this movie. For this movie, I spent almost 60 bucks for two VIP tickets. Very regret to spend my first VIP experience into this movie.",Ghost in the Shell
985,blacknwhiteeagle,Disappointing and Unsurprising.,1,31 March 2017,"Shiny, appealing veneer belies a confusing and wholly unappealing plot. Scarlett Johanson is completely unfit for this role, and the addition of ""Mira"" being the substitute for the Japanese woman is tone deaf to the point that a conservative like me can even pinpoint. It's curious that almost all the live action retellings of popular media from the 90's is floundering, but it might be because instead of listening to the critiques of fans, the producers insisted on powering through robustly with their extremely sub-par plot and trying to do a half-assed damage control by forcing Johanson to proclaim how ""liberal"" she is.",Ghost in the Shell

Scarlet ran around fully clothed the whole time. The closest you get is when she's wearing that nude colored 'onesie'. That's it. Her butt looked big in it too, I was impressed. And I'm normally the kind of guy who likes a little left to the imagination. However that guy stayed home when I went to see this movie. Disappointing. The second flaw was the old guy getting 8 shots out of a 6 cylinder revolver without reloading. Can't happen. It's science. I was mildly entertained. 4/10",Ghost in the Shell

I assumed of course it was riding on the tail of the 1995 anime and its sequel and was going to be either brilliant or stinky. I was not wrong. Ghost In The Shell: 2017 is what a typical Hollywood offshoot movie usually is. Darn it. It was entertaining in a CGI kind of way but the best part about this story about technology and humanity's stance towards it is missed. It is well done in some part (hint: eating out) but boy look at the city and they even missed out on good special effects. I know that seems strange to hear but watch it (for free) and you'll see. Scarlet should pretend she is cool or she gets what this story is about or anyone could imagine her as either cyborg or whatever!!!!

You won't find the laughing man, or the Individual Eleven here, but you will find a faithful representation of the heart of the series. You don't need to be a fan of the original to follow the movie.Contrary to other reviews on here, there is a plot, and it is enjoyable. It might not be as complex and nail biting as some might expect, but I thought overall, the story was intriguing and the action/effects were great as well. My wife, who cannot stand Anime in the slightest, sat through the entire move with me and agreed afterward that it was really good.Best of all, this could absolutely have a sequel, or even turn into a trilogy, (please let this be a trilogy) as this installment is mainly about the Major discovering who she is, how she came to be, and what part she plays in the larger picture of the world. At the end of it, I felt like it would be a shame to end the story where it left off.

The repeated use of crude, stupid whitewashing and a lack of sensitivity to the source morality killed the movie - not the first time a Hollywood remake is a disaster. Hollywood needs to stop destroying anything and everything just because it can. It is in disgust and annoyance that I write this. While I gave it the full chance, I wished that I had stopped and walked out at 40 minutes. Scarlet Johanson is as relevant here and has as much understanding of the source material as Natalie Portman did in Star Wars. The cyborg character is portrayed as unprofessional and having mommy issues - she is unfamiliar with her tools and amateurish in actions. This couldn't have been a much better movie sine Hollywood wants to insert itself everywhere and impose one of its name actresses, but reality is it doesn't work.. 3/10 for the graphics",Ghost in the Shell
996,vercingetorixofgaul,A review from an old man still loving GITS,10,2 April 2017,"Unfortunately, the younger generations have taken a rather overly critical view of this film, this is unfortunate because it may keep new audiences from experiencing the GITS world.It saddens me to see a film like this as low as 6 stars, and I have given it a 10 star to hopefully help boost it up a bit. I will address criticisms that I have read so far in reviews.Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the original GITS series and 1995 film was captured excellently here. Older more attentive fans will notice music keys and tones from the original series and movie, as well as some call backs to the 1995 film sequences. This is affected by some semi-immersion breaking advertisements for Adidas and the like, but let's be honest, we are all used to that in blockbuster films by now.Casting: Scarlet Johansson did an excellent job bringing the character of Major Motoko Kusanagi to life as if straight from the Manga I first read when I was 17 in 1990. The argument of ""white- washing"" is a complete nontroversy and waste of time, something that interestingly was only bothersome to viewers that weren't Japanese. ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano is THE man to play Aramaki. The casting for Batou was definitely my favorite of the Section 9 team, but the casting for the rest of the team was excellent. I would have loved to see more of them, but you can only do so much in a just above standard run-time movie. Story: I will avoid spoilers here so we won't get into much. The movie does an excellent job of bringing this classic Japanese story to an American audience in a palatable and mainstream available way. I experienced the originals first hand when they were new and this is on-par with them for the time it was constrained to. Everyone seems to complain that their favorite story arc wasn't included or something to that effect, but you simply cannot fit the nearly 30 years of GITS story into 107 minutes. The reason everyone, in my opinion, believes that it doesn't capture the story correctly when it really does, is that they are comparing it to 30 years of writing. 107 minutes will never be able to compete in that comparison. Critics and users alike are guilty of this false comparison. GITS deals with some very serious moral and societal issues, this movie touches the surface of that but refrains from diving straight into it, and I firmly believe that if it had dived in as some say they wanted it too, their complaints would have still been complaints, but they would have said the movie tried too hard to handle the issues the manga and 1995 film did. Conclusion: If you want to enjoy this film, you will. If you don't want to enjoy this film, you won't. If you are looking at it through the nostalgia goggles of 30 years of content and expecting it to stack up to that, it won't. Nothing can. GITS is an amazing piece of work that has been built on for years and years. No one movie, no matter how perfect, could ever stack up to it. However, I believe that this film takes as good a shot at it as any and truly sets up the GITS universe to be available to a broader more mainstream audience. The movie has set itself in a position to leap into those story arcs that fans are demanding. In order for me to consider this a success, sequels are a must because it has clearly set itself up to do so. It does sadden me to see people claiming to be fans of the GITS series that want to selfishly keep the series to themselves and protest sequels to this excellent film because it didn't in its 107- minute run-time meet all of their expectations built over 30 years. I ask them to take a step back, and view the film again, without those expectations, and see what it is capable of doing.",Ghost in the Shell
997,tristanjt,In the range of 7-8,8,2 April 2017,"I've seen a lot of people trashing this for being completely devoid of anything deep while looking really good. First off, the visuals are beautiful as many have noted, however what's really important are the characters themselves.There is depth, and honestly you are wanting this to be bad if you ignore the character development. The weakest part of the movie is the somewhat generic plot, however its important to realize that the plot itself is not necessarily out of character for the GITS universe as GITS was the inspiration for many plots of this type. Additionally, character development was solid for the main cast (except for the generic villain, although the 1995 version didn't really have a strong villain either.) The Major does have existential questioning and real personality along with the other significant characters.Its worth seeing whether you are a fan or not. If you are a fan than I'd say that there is plenty for you in the live-action version as long as you accept that it wasn't solely based on the 1995 version and that it needs to make changes for a wider audience.",Ghost in the Shell

Sure, the ideas are no longer as groundbreaking as they were when The Matrix copied them, but this film swallows the viewer into its grungy, cyberpunk world because the visuals are so rich with detail. This film nails the look and tone of the anime, while introducing changes to the story that largely work. One departure that made this movie a 9 instead of a 10 for me was the relative simplicity of the plot. While the series and movies had notoriously complicated and fast moving plots, this movie decided to simplify to a level that was predictable. I was looking forward to concentrating on the details of the dialogue to try and guess what could possibly come next, but instead found myself somewhat disengaged as the beautiful sci-fi rolled by.This was an excellent sci-fi movie and it definitely lived up to my expectations as a fan of the anime.",Ghost in the Shell

The movie is not perfect but judge for yourself. You most likely will be surprised on how good this movie is. This movie has a lot of positive things it achieved and should be noted. CASTING ISSUE IS IRRELEVANT. Mamoru Oshii, the director of the original anime adaptation of Ghost in the Shell, said that he has no problem with Johansson playing a role many have understood to be an Asian woman. His reasoning?

The only thing I did was watch the original 1995 movie, and I almost cried at how frustratingly terrible this version was. I've never wanted a movie to end so quickly. Not only was the casting decision bad (emotionless actors reading off a terrible script that did not portray the characters correctly), but the director failed to notice many small details in the original that actually provided a deeper understanding of characters as well as the philosophical twist that was so iconic of the original.There were a lot of unnecessary characters and fight scenes added that did nothing for the emotional or philosophical aspect this movie should have been. The deviation from the original plot wasn't the problem. Rather, it was the deviation from the feel of the original.I normally love Sci-Fi, but this movie didn't make me think intellectually like other Sci-Fi's. It felt like they just took the look of the characters and universe, leaving behind the ""Ghost"" of the original, and placed them into a universe that had more explosions, guns, and blood.

(hint: it's not)A major corporation in it can easily be seen as an American corporation, though, which would explain the 'whitewashing' anyways. That isn't far fetched... Perhaps they should have made this a prominent thing. Perhaps that would have helped? Probably not, they'd get slammed for that as well I bet...It is a shame that it was hurt by this. I was concerned going into it, but was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I enjoyed it because I didn't go in expecting it to 100% live up to the originals or S.A.C.? It did a better job than I was expecting. Maybe I enjoyed it more having enjoyed them. Also likely. I would like to see more, but without it having a strong opening, that probably isn't going to happen.For those that feel it was 'dumbed down', people not familiar with it wouldn't really know what is going on and why some of the scenes were even included. As it is, it really should have explained more, but yet really couldn't have due to length.I'll close by asking this: Why is it 'bad' when ethnicity is changed by Hollywood, but not China, India, or Japan?

There was nothing authentic or deep about this thing. In it there wasn't anything that you have not already seen in the originals that was not done better. The CGI is impressive, but the story is mixed up, the meaning is lost and the acting is superficial. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with Hollywood's lack of creativity.

It was always about the money. The male audience that wants to see MS. S. Johannson in a white wet suit, jiggling around all tough and bad covers half the production costs. The other half is covered by the GITS fan base, who even though they know they are going to be hugely disappointed, will still pay to see it because; ""Hope springs eternal.""

1008,archeotech,Great visuals and some good scenes but lackluster plot.,6,5 April 2017,"So went to see the new Ghost In The Shell movie... It's good in some ways and bad in others. Overall a bit disappointing as it did have potential there. Visuals are great with some great props and sets. The scene's they lifted directly from the anime tend to be the best parts but yeah plot is a bit all over the place and dialogue is kinda wooden. I would've preferred a more thought provoking plot line rather than the origin story they gave the Major which wasn't really very good. In fact they could've just mentioned her back story from stand alone complex in passing and got on with something else. A big thing that annoyed me is she's the first full cyborg and it's set 1 year later so in that time she gets all this special training in combat, and hacking and joins Section 9 as a Major. Why couldn't it have been a few years at least? And then it's set in Tokyo which is very cool except most people seem to be white and speak English while the head of section 9 is Japanese and speaks Japanese even when other people are speaking to him in English. It's just too weird so I'm thinking the Japanese Dub actually might be better in this regard. Anyway it's OK. If you're a fan of the series you might enjoy some of the visuals and some scenes but don't expect much from the plot. Also soundtrack was very basic and underwhelming but did use music from the original in the end credits at least.

This movie is visually stunning and the plot manages to be subtlety thought provoking and gripping, but still skillfully weaving in fast paced action. The performances are wonderful and the casting was spot on. Easily going to be one of my favorite movies. Side note these days people seem to think the only way to review anything is by tearing it down there really isn't any objectivity and unfortunately it will turn away a lot of people from watching a great movie and has killed any chance at a sequel.

1010,mnfru,Haters are missing the point.,6,6 April 2017,"TWO MEASLY DIFFERENCES and I would give this movie 9 stars.(1)Have a freakin' beer on the boat with Batou and talk about the meaning of life for 2 minutes. Words cannot describe my feelings of dismay as he tossed that beer back into the cooler. (2)Because of the previous discussion and maybe some feeling of kinship and the value of life, JOIN KUZE in his little personal network world or whatever. Choose to become more than you are, push the boundaries! That's why science-fiction EXISTS! (TL;DR below)There is one fundamental difference in this remake that tarnishes all of the beauty it would otherwise have, and is why I can only give it 6 as it stands.Let us note that in this film and the original work, Major finds herself in much the same position at the beginning of her journey. However, where she ends up has changed dramatically, despite (seemingly) many of the same events occurring in both timelines. Why is this? In the original timeline, Major's fight to come to grips with her uniqueness and tenuous grip on reality ends in her melding with an artificial sentience to become something even MORE unique and LESS human. She does this, realizing that life is life in any form, and preserving it is worthwhile regardless of the details. (My take in a nutshell.) In the new timeline, Major ends her search by discovering the details about her pre-shell life, and the circumstances that eventually led her to become what she is now. She decides she's ""Not ready to go"" into a similar sort of melding, and her mindset is clearly stated at the end of the film. (paraphrasing) ""Our virtue is that which makes us human."" This implies that humanity is fine just the way it is, and why bother to change when it brings all that nasty uncertainty into the picture.One ending shows an entity who is pushing the bounds of human consciousness going yet further, while the other shows a regression back to some comfortable ""normative"" human state. Are you SEEING the problem here?TL;DR As it stands, you can barely call this movie science-fiction. It's just an action thriller with a retro cult title to draw in my nerd dollars, because the protagonist makes the WRONG CHOICE in the end.",Ghost in the Shell
1011,ringsdwarves,Cyberpunk version of the A-Team,1,6 April 2017,"Review for Ghost in the Shell:Let me just say that I went to go see this movie, because I feel like judging a movie based on reviews made by people who were neither fans of the source material or don't really know how to critique films targeted for niche audiences. That all being said, IT WAS TERRIBLE!!!!First, the white washing of the major is WORSE than indicated by reviews. You can tell that the script was rewritten to make the villain of the film choose the body of Scarlett Johanssen as the casing for a Japanese teenager. As if that was supposed to make it OK for the casting choice. Instead, it reeked of desperation to keep their choice of actor, while trying to respond to the backlash. It didn't work; it made it worse. I don't hold Scarlett Johanssen responsible for taking on the role of the Major, in fact I defended her taking on the role cause I thought she would do justice to the character. But the writing and directing was so bad, that her acting ability didn't matter.Second, while there were nods to the original movie, there was so much changed that it lost the feeling of it being Ghost in the Shell. I'm not saying that it needed to be an exact replica of the anime/manga, but turning the plot line into a cyberpunk version of the A-team was just terrible. And oh my God, clichés galore! The most glaring ones were the interactions between the major and Kuze, especially hero and villain meet in the one place they know each other from. But there were more: villainous corporate CEO, the old trick the bad guy into thinking I'm killing the hero, but really I'm on the hero's side, and, my personal favorite, mother instantly knows that main character is her daughter! It was so bad.Third, the CGI was bad and over-saturated. I'm not a movie purist, I know that CGI is a tool that most, if not all, big budget movies use to enhance their products. Hell, Rocket Racoon and Groot are pure CGI creations and I still love Guardians of the Galaxy. So when I say something is over-saturated with CGI, I mean it's to the point that the suspension of reality can no longer explain the clunky jarring movements of a fully CGI'd character or the sudden cartoonish look of a CGI'd scene. And HOLOGRAMS GALORE!!!! There was a really distracting, creepy one with a guy handing a little girl a sunflower that kept repeating.Finally, the clashes of culture throughout the movie. By this I mean, the setting is in Japan, but everyone is speaking English, except the director of Section 9. White people all wearing traditional Japanese clothing, but conducting business in English. I've seen English dubbed anime, but this was just ridiculous and only made my first point more pronounced.In conclusion, I wanted to give the movie a chance to stand on its own, but was sorely disappointed. I now implore you to not make the same mistake, my friends. Do not go to see this movie, save your $20. This movie isn't even worth pirating.",Ghost in the Shell
1012,pollyyg,Seroiusly give this movie a chance! It is undeservedly underrated...,8,6 April 2017,"I have to admit that I went to watch this movie with certain reservations and worries. I was actually quite skeptical about the casting of Scarlett Johansson and also rather worried about this live adaption of a beloved old classic. But lo and behold, I ended up really liking it! The visual were beyond stunning, the characters interesting and while the story wasn't as deep as it could have been it was still pretty good. I think all the criticism for this movie has been way too harsh, the end product was really well made and if this movie hadn't been an adaption but a regular sci-fi movie I'm pretty more viewers would have appreciated it more. I have no problem admitting that my worries about Scarlett Johansson were for naught, she was actually really great playing Major and after having actually watched the movie I found the whole whitewashing ""scandal"" to be totally overblown... Seriously, both the fictional world and her team contained a wide ethnic diversity, so it wasn't like you had one Caucasian among Asians (and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb). I felt a lot of effort was put into creating a rich world, making sure that the inhabitants were fully incorporated and that their actions wouldn't feel out of place. This is after all only a movie adaption, there is only so much you can cram into such a format and changes are necessary. Sure, they could have chosen an Asian actress to play Major but in this story that detail isn't even that important... it's just a ""shell"" so to speak. The important thing is to keep the essence of the original and make sure the unavoidable changes feel logical and incorporated in both the story and the world setting as a whole. I feel that a lot of people just couldn't see pass that and that saddens me.This is not a perfect movie by any means, it was really enjoyable and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I even registered just leave this review, because I felt so bad about all the undeservedly criticism. One more tip from me, do watch it in 3D if possible. The effects really added something extra in my opinion.",Ghost in the Shell
1013,nycinterns,GITS In Body and Soul,8,6 April 2017,"This is the first review I have ever written for IMDb. I don't write this because I feel particularly passionate about GITS, both the anime or this film, but more so because it feels like this film is getting seriously under-appreciated due to all the controversy, which for the record I do get, it's just I came in watching this film as a standalone entity and feel it deserves to be reviewed as such.I wanted to first praise the art and overall look of the film. I understand it is taken heavily from the original source, but not only does the practical effects really add a layer of grit and realism to the film, it also gives each scene more of an impact because most of it is actually there in front of our characters.Speaking of characters, I personally thought Johansson did an amazing job in the role. The critiques I have read site her as being too emotionless and boring. I felt she portrayed the character perfectly; she starts off the film in her new body/shell struggling to breath and terrified, something she portrays extremely well. After that, a year later, we see her removed from herself, her body no longer hers she has succumbed to this unfeeling cold shell and has shut herself out from feeling anything. However, we see glimpses of the real her shine through, a smile petting a dog, a tear when confronted with the reality of her situation. By the end of the film she is still closed off but you get the sense she is learning to live within her shell. Now regarding the twist of her shell body being a white woman, and her original body being a Japanese woman, again for just the sake of reviewing this film as a standalone entity, I thought this was a good twist further extending the theme of ""does the shell, the body, really make us? Or is the mind and soul all that we really need?"" In the end her body is of no importance, it's whats inside that really matters. I also thought, given that the chief scientist that made her seemed to act and speak of Major like she was her own child, I surmised that she based the shell partially on her to create a sort of mother/daughter dynamic (They should have said this in the film, rather than repeat the line about her ghost 50 thousand times but I digress).Again, this film isn't perfect nor is it the best film I have seen this year. I simply felt this film was a lot better than the reviews were letting on and the controversy surrounding it muddled a perfectly good film. Hopefully what I wrote has changed some of your perspectives on the film; Now I'm going to go out and buy the artbook.",Ghost in the Shell
1014,ohbennyboy,Don't always listen to critics,8,7 April 2017,"Don't always listen to critics because that's what they are 'critics'.I had watched the anime of this movie, loved it and was hyped for this movie when I saw the trailers. Just like many others, I heard of negative reviews and, though I was always going to see it, I was a little concerned. How foolish.Just remember... people these days LOVE to hate and bring things down. If something isn't exactly what they expected it to be, 'wham', negative reviews and, like a virus, people catch the 'negativity' and it blows up in a hate wave of disappointment from people with more opinion than they deserve.I went in to the movie like this, expecting something bad and came out rather satisfied.Breakdown: Ghost in the Shell went to A lot of effort to get some scenes exactly right as in the anime. It was a beautiful movie which followed the same story with some slight modifications. All the actors did a great job. It was so good to see the world of Ghost in the Shell (anime) come to life. The very ending was different but, to be honest, before I went in the movie I knew the very ending of the anime wouldn't work in a movie like this. I'm glad they changed it.Summary: Don't listen to critics or people how love to tear things down. This movie deserved to do better than what it has but people have caught the 'virus' and are selling the movie short. It was a great watch. 8/10.Ben.",Ghost in the Shell

Just the visuals are insane. I feel reviewers are being way unfair. This movie should have been R and scenes should have been way more graphic represent the coldness of the original.,Ghost in the Shell

The visuals are out of this world, the story is great and the soundtrack OMG! just great! As someone else noted in this review section, this movie just proves that hype and reviews are not a direct representation of the actual product. People are bashing this movie for numerous reasons but without being able to see further than their nose.

1017,alrigme,This deserves more appreciation,8,7 April 2017,"Being a fan of the original 1995 movie, I honestly wasn't expecting much from an American remake (especially after reading many of the fan reviews). However, I was thoroughly surprised and impressed with how well done this movie actually was. They focus more on the action aspect in this remake which has disappointed some, but it's honestly quite understandable why this approach was taken. You have to think that they were trying to bring in audiences as well as devoted fans and while the long-time fans of the series may prefer the more existential psychological approach that GitS is known for, most people would probably not be as interested as a more action packed flick. I think they did the best they could with what they had and while it's still focused more on action, they managed to throw in some of the basic underlying themes of GitS and did a decent job of it too. I'm not going to discuss the whole white washing issue, but I personally think Scarlet Johansson did a rather good job of capturing Major for the most part. Most the time she reacted as major would and nothing she did really felt out of character. Altogether, I left the theater satisfied and would recommend it to fans and non-fans alike. I think it really doesn't deserve all the crap that people (mostly fans) have been giving it. A bad remake is The Last Airbender and this certainly isn't even close to that monstrosity.",Ghost in the Shell
1018,maryanna-98669,Ghost of a Movie (as in there was nothing there),1,8 April 2017,"Never have I ever left a movie scream laughing at how bad it was. IT WAS TRULY SO SO SO TERRIBLE!!!I have not watched the original movie, so I have nothing to base my judgements on except for what I saw in this movie. And I believe that a movie should stand on its own regardless of it being an adaptation or a remake.This movie was so terrible for the following reasons: 1: Actors: ScarJo is so not the right actress for this role. Her acting was so 2 dimensional, it was hard to take anything she said seriously. And the Haircut, it was so wrong on her. Knives Chau (from Scott Pilgrim Vs the world) rocked that look better than ScarJo. Had the role been in the hands of an Asian actress it would have been far more believable. The other Actors who are meant to play Asian characters also seem to go through the Hollywood Whitewashing treatment. If they intended the characters to be Western why give them stereotypically Japanese names? And are we meant to believe that living in a Japanese centric landscape that everyone speaks English but no one speaks Japanese, but perfectly understand when Japanese is spoken to them?2: The CGI, while appearing quite cool in some scenes, were mostly distracting. Vital scenes that they allude to in dialogue are lost in a mishmashed jumble so we have no idea as to what to concentrate on or what has even occurred. The Holograms which are meant to be advertisements I think? are creepy and confusing, as to what the hell are they meant to be advertising.3: Technology: The technology in this movie is all over the place. While some parts are so advanced, some are definitely backwards. Such as in a world so advanced, they still use a match to light a stove to boil water, do they not have electric kettles? And in a world where they have created AI's, surely they could make the bodies out of something that can withstand bullets. And in a world where they have so many robots or humans who can get robotic enhancements, surely one of the scientist there could invent a flying car? and after spending what looked like millions on ScarJo's robotic body (CGI), you could still tell she was wearing a costume from the neck down. And if she is a robot, how does she still feel cold? why is she walking around in heavy jackets? 4: The Plot. Oh where do I even begin. I still have no clue as to what the actual storyline is. The only thing I can say is nothing is explained. You are just meant to swim around and try and find your own story (""Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming""- Dory. No Dory this does not apply to this movie. I repeat swimming will not help you). If you foolishly think the backstory behind ScarJo's character will help you, think again my friend! The runaway running to the Outlaw city, which looks like an abandoned cave and finding a lost love, who looks like Frankenstein with a makeover, explains nothing. It uses tired clichés, like black widow comes to save the day trope which makes it a boring and pathetic plot line. It would have been far better if they had all died, at least the movie would have been over. And the whole Mother sideline/ tangent was laughably terrible. it added nothing to the story or character development, and the hug was sooo awkward.In short DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. it is truly so so so TERRIBLE!!!!!!",Ghost in the Shell

We saw it by downloading it. girlfriend and I stopped the movie to eat dinner and realized we were only 30 minutes into it. It was mixed up. 30 mins felt like an hour or two. Major? How the hell is that? If Japanese did something like this to an American movie it would have been rated 1, 2, or 3. Having a shadowy group in Japan with Scarlet Johansson is sad. The Studio has to make some a little sense. They just threw in an enemy it seems. A revised version of the Jap story. What about the bad guy? He looks like something from Harry Potter. He is so secretive and evil and wants himself to be menacing. I do not think so.",Ghost in the Shell

It had stunning visuals which I do not think would have been as good in Standard format and the movie captured the spirit of the original story quite well. Granted that I think if they had used the music at the closing credits sometime during the movie, it would have enhanced the ambiance but still the movie conveyed the original message well. Ignore the nonsense regarding comments about Scarlett Johansson ""whitewashing"" the movie. I do not know what the big deal is. She is awesome in it and the Japanese loved her playing the part. Honestly, I cannot think of a single Japanese actress who could have played that part well and looks like the original manga character anyway.

Having Scarlet as the Major was interesting, but as you get fully into the story line they used it fits perfectly fine.What really saddens me is they could not have had a worse weekend to open on. On one hand you have one of Disney's most iconic movies in theaters for its 3rd weekend.And on the other side you had a Dreamworks film opening against it. Which from what i see is still killing it.So two family style movies vs an obscure title at best when it comes to the masses.Its no wonder it didn't do well money wise. That is really sad because they did an outstanding job with he movie and its visuals. I would love to see them make a follow up. Better yet cut a deal with Netflix and have them continue it with a series that brings in more form the manga and anime series.",Ghost in the Shell
1022,loudlee,Garbo writers + garbo script = garbo movie,1,10 April 2017,"The reason why Ghost in the Shell (2017 film) sucked wasn't because of white washing or the controversy of white washing. It had an amateur director way out of his league trying to grasp the culture and depth that is Ghost in the Shell. But he is only partly to blame. The other reason why it turned into such a let down is due to the script, written by two-bit writers who wrote a really bad and simplified script whose only scripts involved, for the most part, transformers movies. The movie itself is an abomination and ill-fated attempt at capturing the depth and sophistication of the real Ghost in the Shell, which again isn't a surprise given the writer's track records. These writers were lazy and basically took a bunch of parts from the original first 2 seasons of Ghost in the Shell, as well as the first movie (the chase & garbage truck scene) and tried to cram it into a terrible script. They created a Major that is unsure of herself, which is very uncharacteristic of the strong bad ass women we all know and love. So don't blame Hollywood for whitewash casting. Blame the writers and director. They took a gem that had ample amount of inspiration and storyline to draw upon from, but got lazy and messed the whole thing up.I mean seriously, how can you demonize Kuze? They didn't even capture the real spirit of his character. They chose a random ""villain"" (more like anti-hero), demonized him and made him an antagonist that isn't even close to what he was really trying to accomplish -_-Moral of the story: don't count on an easy pay-day writer for Michael Bay to write something that requires thought-provoking compelling in-depth take into philosophy, the human mind, sci-fi sophistication, and imagination. Maybe they're just not capable of writing intelligent work :/Ehren Kruger, James Moss, & William Wheeler you should all be ashamed of yourselves for taking an incredible well written story with a complex characters and dragging them down to your simplified writing. You guys didn't even stand a chance. On a side note: the visuals were actually up to par with what i would expect of a future sc-fi movie and Scarlett Johansson's acting wasn't that bad either.

But! There was not that much to be harsh about. Reason why is because the movie producers didn't ""milk it out"", this made it very pleasant to watch and entertained me well.

Ghost In The Shell remake is exactly such a case. this remake is unwanted, unnecessary and lost in its mixed up story, Matrix wanna-be styling and complete non-story. Unfortunately, as much as Ghost In The Shell series/movie were fun and technologically fun to watch there was a meaningful story which Scarlett and all involved ignored/missed/misunderstood/could not figure out/accountants at studio vetoed/who knows/who cares. This is avoidable: just stop remaking other people's work. Really. Seriously. Finally, Scarlett Johansson should focus on playing middle-aged spinsters or something going forward. She is even more ridiculous in this and more useless than she is in those infinite Marvel films. Also, she should lay off japan.

It is truly one of a kind and if you missed it you will forever be deprived. If you are drawn to ""The Boss Baby"" or can't wait for ""Fast and Forever 10"" then it is probably not for you.

Growing up as a kid Ghost In The Shell series was awesome. Always something new, always something bleak. You looked forward to more of the story. Then Hollywood stepped in and things got weak, real weak, with a Hollywood actress who is the most useless of the useless in Marvel's milking crew.

1028,renekshadow,As others have said it has shell but no ghost,3,16 April 2017,"When I first heard they where planning on a live action movie of ghost in the shell I was on the fence about how I felt about it. I knew it could go either way. It could be a great movie where that nail every aspect of the original anime movie or TV show with small changes to it to fit thee west or it being a flop that never knew what it had.Well it turned into a flop. I had to fight to stay and watch this movie from beginning to end. it had very poor pacing and story that was very lack luster. it was boring , even the action I felt was boring because I found it never fit with the story fully.As a fan of the anime I know the world is very tech heavy, from having androids, computers and cybernetics along with other aspects that all give it a cyberpunk feel. I never seen the cyber or the punk in this movie, they had little parts which showed it but never talked about it either with words or with visuals. there have been other movies that was cyberpunk and where able to do this, Blade runner and the Matrix are 2 I can list.What I really found with this movie it seamed like it was a check list of things they wanted to have in it for scenes. once they had the idea of what scenes that where going to have ( taken from the original anime movie ) they tried to write a story around them. this is a typical thing that is happening in Hollywood now a days or I should say years, its not story and plot that gets the movie but the action scenes that are made.I will not get into the casting cause it doesn't really matter. if they had a strong story, plot and director it could of been pulled off. They missed the mark on making a great movie and could of had a lot of information about the world and Philosophy put in there from line usage and visuals that would of explained a lot. if you do not believe me go watch the original 1995 Ghost in The Shell that had a run time of 82 Min's compared too the live actions 108 Min's.Do yourself a favor and skip this and just watch the original works.",Ghost in the Shell

1040,theshoreoflimbo,Forget the original. This movie is plenty bad on it's own.,3,13 May 2017,"So yes, I went into the movie without high hopes. Granted, they got some visuals right and the atmosphere is interesting enough but it pales in comparison to the original in any way. But what bothers me most is that even without that, the movie is plenty bad on it's own.So let's get down to it. Firstly, the exposition talk is strong with this movie. And the dialogue is borderline condescending in how explanatory it is. Referring to the soul as ghost and the cybernetic robot as shell in the opening lines of the movie already had me laughing. More name dropping please.Of course, any attempt at subtlety that could redeem the movie is instantly destroyed by stating out everything clearly in boring dialogue.But what turned out to be worst for me is that the script was just lazily hacked together without ever considering any implications of what you are doing. Major's invisible naked cyborg assassination really feels like exploitation when we see a different character going invisible completely clothed later on. And by the way, a parkour chase with flips and crazy jumps really gains so much excitement when you can barely see the runner.Let's get to the rest of the sci-fi world. They clearly put way more effort into CGI than into creating a compelling, immersive world. I completely lost it when the doctors with heart rate monitor holograms all over their faces that must significantly obscure their vision appeared. Really? After we already had functional gadgets like google glass? The interface design in the world is just backwards and unusable.Also, what was the deal with the one character that exclusively talked in Japanese? In a dubbed version, it felt like they either ran out of voice actors or forgot subtitles? Is this an art statement? In THIS movie? I don't see the point for this at all.The acting was fine I guess. I don't particularly like Scarlett's face for Major's hair cut and at times she moved a bit too much like a robot, which I guess is director's choice. It did feel somewhat weird after seeing the advanced machinery on the inside of her body and the general tone of cybernetics being classified as improvements throughout the movie. In the end, it's just disappointing. The movie clearly shows production value and effort, but neither the story nor the world nor the directing seem to be especially developed.",Ghost in the Shell

I wouldn't have taken the time nor the effort to post a written review of this movie were it not for the suspiciously inflated IMDb score of 6.6. Curious, it is an example in appropriation, changing ethnicity of the character who even this film mentions was Japanese and then there is Scarlet. The IMDb books are cooked. I'm not a conspiratorial person by nature but with so much money at stake I have to believe that the franchisor might have had something to do with it. At any rate I would honestly rate it a 3 out of 10. But my sense of fair play bids me give it only two stars.",Ghost in the Shell

This film shouldn't suffer for the problems that go throughout Hollywood film-making. The one thing they got wrong in my humble opinion is making her a teen runaway. In the originals, the whole reason why the Major was so beyond everyone else as a cyborg is because she was raised from an infant as a cyborg... that's why she was so adapted to the body and it's capabilities and so much better in the virtual world than people who had undergone partial conversions or conversions later in life. This version makes her a bit of a Mary Sue.Would've been cool if she'd hacked some peoples' eyes.I missed the Tachikoma.I also wish they'd given better character development for section 9... particularly Togusa not having any enhancements and being insulated from hacking.I did like what they did with Aramaki ""the fox"".However... not considering the thing on it's own... it was decent.",Ghost in the Shell

When I first saw the rating here,I thought I would never try to watch this film until I ran into a chance to watch it recently. This film just blow my mind.I knew that what this film transfer is much less than the original.But I have to give a thumb to this less-than-2-hour adaption.It actually grasp the core of the original and represent it in the film.If there were no Ghost of the Shell original,this film would have easily risen to the same height of Matrix.I knew why people criticize it,but this rating isjust unreasonable.Do not compare it to the original,but the other sci-fi films.This film actually has a place in the all the sci-fi films ranking overall.",Ghost in the Shell

1051,lehmeraaron,Wanted to like it so very much,6,7 August 2017,"I am a huge fan of the original, and much of the subsequent series built out of that world. I am not a 'super-fan', not some neck-beard Otaku who is upset that this was not a frame for frame remake of the original movie. I am not even particularly worried about the white-washing of the cast that so many other Americans are on about after watching so many Japanese people react to that feedback with a 'Why would that matter?' attitude.What upset me about this movie was the lack of subtlety and confidence that it has in it's audience. A big part of what made the original anime such a masterwork was that it didn't (clumsily) spoon-feed it's audience the world and the characters. Instead, it has enough faith in it's use of atmosphere, writing, and characters that it drops us into the story and lets world unfold at an exciting but natural pace. To make a point, what is the best performance in this remake? The subtle, confident, enigmatic leader of the team Aramaki, played wonderfully by Takeshi Kitano. Without formal introduction or overt character-building we have a compelling man that we can clearly understand is a tough, hard, and wise leader. All this with just a few minutes on screen and confidence in the story and the actor.I don't really fault the other actors in their roles, but the direction. It seemed like the more attention the director gave to a character, the more they felt the need to spell everything out a word at a time. Scarlett Johansson could play this role well if she was just allowed to play the confident, deadly, but lonely Major. Instead it seemed like she had someone behind the camera the entire time saying, 'The Americans will forget you're a robot if you don't keep reminding them! Be more ROBOT!' In the end, we have a movie that was a beautiful, but fairly ham-fisted reminder of how good a story can be when it's allowed to just be itself.",Ghost in the Shell

The set design is just perfect and everything feels like Tokyo 2050. This movie is a prime example of the dangers of public consensus.

This was very streamlined stylish and thought provoking movie.

1057,lum-64329,A Waste Of Time,2,6 October 2017,"This film was a waste of my two hoursThe problem was not just the whitewashing, which is emphatically problematic, but also the soulless (sorry, I had to) acting, story and the emphasis and focus on merely visuals over depth and morality. As a woman, I was embarrassed for Scarlet Johansson for 2+ hours.Either American directors and studios just are too dense to get it or, more likely, they are too afraid that their audience is stupid and hence they dumb down their films for a wider audience. Unfortunately, this alienates the core fans of the original story and insults the potential intelligent viewer.Why am I writing this? Will the American studios ever learn? it is doubtful. One of the worst offenders (has that guy done anything original or creative?) JJ Abrams was just given the assignment to do Kimi No Na Wa... will he tone down the gender structure story? Will he westernize the setting? Will he 'improve' on that beautiful beautiful story with gratuitous morality? Will he lengthen the school girl's skirts? Will he... ah, whatever, we all know he will think he knows better and, like in Ghost In The Shell, end up deteriorating and diminishing the original.. that's what they always do.",Ghost in the Shell

1060,forshamelol,queationable budget untilization and directing choices,1,21 December 2017,"We live in a time when we see many good productions and often take it for granted, this movie will force you to understand that, this is considerably the worst I've seen in a long long time, and for no other reasons but questionable script, directing and budget, throwing a well developed original backstory for whatever reason, while it fools no one with the later budget and gross numbers.One of the main attraction Scarlet, in other films was perfectly working her ways with stunt double to create action scenes within the smallest detail, and yet she was tacky, unnatural, awkward in this movie, and so were other characters, so we can get to understand how the director sees this movie.The original series contents many parts to make it a memorable piece of production, story telling, character, thrill, action, espionage, politics, philosophical food for thoughts.This adaptation however, has a cliche story, ignore character backstory and ruins all original factors listed above, it only worked for original series because it made sense from main character's backstory and what made her so, feels unnatural when it forced unnecessary changes to create a loop of confusion because some of the original background still exist, but it only coexist with original character and not the changed, like covering a lie with another lie, makes no sense.The thrill/action/detail part that made this kind of picture memorable, was a huge mess considering the budget shown to make this, if you want to make a SCI FI film, you need to be serious and create convincing world through the detail, the 3D effect was off point and unnatural, actors were directed to move fiercely cutting through air like they are on Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, have no attention to detail of world settings->weights and physics of prosthetic limbs, which other films done their job creating it before.
Have none professional weapon/marshal art choreographer to produce convincing scenes[while the main characters were supposed to be experts that can perform such acts at highest level, the above effort of creating a world for SCI FI films was less to none, the result felt like watching some retro movie that was done decades ago.In short, cliche story line, but I'm fine with that if the rest could be entertaining. Wasted an already developed background/characters from adaptation source.
Not up to date special effects.
Not building truthful world physics detail and feels unnatural.
Not enough professional guidance for weapon/martial arts/espionage, characters looks like amateurs at above all while their job was expert in all. I only wonder how could this happen, missing nearly all factors that made original series memorable or made any other SCI FI films a success.I've seen much much better films with the budget shown to make this film....
one can't help but wonder what exactly happened?I feel bad for the poor souls who got dragged into this, I believe there's something seriously wrong in between the process of making this film, and made it being memorable as the worst if not the worst considering the casting and budget was fine.",Ghost in the Shell
1061,sinobisifa,disgrace and disrespect to sci fi films also to the original series,1,22 December 2017,"We got all these great sci fi films out there with similar or less budget, as in fair comparison to this one, but then we can see what it lacks, when you create a science fictional world, the physics detail make the picture presented to audience need to feel natural, in order to show the emotion and message the script was set to tell.IF taking from the point of first time GITS viewers much like walking in on any sci fi film, factors that's important to such production before taking in the characters, is the world background and the detail of physics blend with visual effects.
Background= they've created similar image background that tells what year and technology we can base it on, the only job they did it fine.
World Detail=The point of this world was cybernetic prosthetic body booming after the wars, so the detail should be looked closely to present, unfortunately this movie didn't, the emotions and movement physics wasn't respecting what the background set out to be, the posture, action scenes, did not consider any of it above and feels tacky and wasted actor's potential.
The main character is an elite programmed half cyborg, did the film make it believable? weapon/martial arts choreographers? nope they made it like armature holding guns and have no training to make action scenes believable. 
Effects=both practical and 3d effects could've done much better because there are films out there doing much better and was created over 20 years ago, this film ignored above world detail and weren't able to present the correct visual effects either.
-Not memorable in any ways. 
--Adaptation from original source?----what made the original series interesting without the philosophical part, the brief intro that should be taking account when making this film----The original series's world background. 
After great wars resulted cybernetic prosthetic body booming, crimes has gone to a different level, criminals with military grade prosthetic body and cyber crimes are the new waves of torture after the war, and needed more public security than a typical police officer's human body and mare guns to protect the innocent.The main protagonist, was injured and needed full prosthetic body at very young age, as she had the time and chance to develop what others couldn't, perfection control of cybernetic prosthetic body, she experience through years of wars as a military solider, thus being called the Major in ranks, female gorilla in her brutality ways, Wizard in hacking specialty, once she left military after the big wars ended, she formed an elite team specialized to fight against new type of criminals, that's where the the main focus of the story, she fights with precise weapon control and knowledge, understanding of cyber prosthetic body to take the upper hand, and use of hacking skill to use opponent's advanced against them, [and in this animated world, visual effect was easier/cheaper than real pictures depending on practical and 3d effects, but they didn't slack it, did it respectfully and convincingly with physics and detail shown, you can feel her emotionless cybernetic face and eyes almost like a robot, brutality and the prosthetic body's weight crushing the surroundings, weaponry and physics detail carefully presented to make it believable, also her past as a solider to perform above actions as a logical background. 
And after the incredible thriller and action scene, it goes further deeper when she often gets involved in cases that make her/and is question human nature and the truth she seeks, and here we can relate to this mystery roboish lady because we might have the same question as her as a audience experiencing the story it's telling , but that's a whole other story.And if you think the above listed original series background is interesting, you should give it a try. 
But I do not suggest the adapted film, it's a literal disrespect to even be called a sci fi film and a waste of resource.The adaptation ignored all above factors that could make it a success, with badly presented world detail, visual, effect, compare to what similar budget sci if movies adapted from Japan e.g Edge of Tomorrow, whilst changing character background to ruin their own chance to make it logical and presentable, overall it just feels like a low budget tacky sci fi wanna be film, trying to grasp even the littlest fame and success that made the original series by throwing random original series moments into scenes yet tacky and unprofessional, and didn't make any effort to present a story that has nearly all winning factors they could've copied and used. The grossing numbers won't lie about people's feeling in comparison to other great SCI FI films, it's a failure and hurts both the original series's image and their hired actors.",Ghost in the Shell

Second, 6.5 stars (Jan 2017) is a crime against this film. Surely there is some exterior reason the haters are going after it.

I still tried to go into it with a neutral mindset though.I think Scarlet Johansen did a very good job as the lead character, despite me having doubts about the casting (And not because she isn't Asian). She pulled it off, and most of the other characters were well cast as well.Aesthetically, the movie was well done but the sometimes overdone CGI effects prevented it from having a good cyberpunk ambiance. The giant ads all over the city in particular felt over the top.The story, as expected, was simplified from the original and felt as it was lacking depth. I also found the first half of the movie pretty boring but it picked up later on at least, and it had some scenes I liked very much. In general I found it to be a good movie, just not anywhere close to the anime movie. But fans of the anime or manga would probably still enjoy it if they do not have sky high expectations.

I saw this in 3D and was surprised by the explosion of eye candy. I do not enjoy 3D films often, but I did enjoy 2017 Ghost in the Shell's refreshed environment from the original anime.Now, let's get into why I did not like this movie as a fan boy. It wasn't the whitewashing controversy. This controversy is a social paradigm which lives outside the boundaries of this film and I am a believer film should be judged on the merits of its compilation of techniques and handling of content. Whether the character is Japanese or American didn't and doesn't bother me. What bothered me was the complete gutting of the cerebral aspects of the original film. The original Ghost in the Shell anime created a cult following due to its deep philosophical material. They dumb downed a classic. It's almost as if they took Plato and turned into a coloring book. When the impressive visual display is taken away, 2017 Ghost in the Shell is a ghost-less attempt to recreate a masterpiece.",Ghost in the Shell
