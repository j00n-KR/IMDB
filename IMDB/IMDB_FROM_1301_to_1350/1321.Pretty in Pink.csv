0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a favourite, but entertaining enough",7,13 January 2011,"I like John Hughes's movies, but Pretty in Pink is not a favourite. It is too short, and the story structure is occasionally too hackneyed complete with an ending that didn't quite convince me. But it was strikingly filmed, with an agreeable soundtrack, snappy script, bouncy pacing and good direction. When it comes to the acting, it is quite good, and the characters are at least likable. Molly Ringwald holds this movie together, and she is very good. Andrew McCarthy and James Spader are also appealing, while Harry Dean Stanton and Annie Potts are sterling. Overall, Pretty in Pink is not a John Hughes classic, but it is worth the watch at least once. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Pretty in Pink
1,bkoganbing,A Red Headed Cinderella,7,28 July 2008,"This John Hughes Brat Pack teen comedy/drama stars Molly Ringwald, THE Brat Pack female star as the red headed teen from the other side of the tracks who yearns for a better life with her preppy teen dream, Andrew McCarthy. Hughes definitely ripped the plot off from The Way We Were. Ringwald is Barbra Streisand and McCarthy is Bob Redford without all the politics.That being said it's not a bad film at all. The film has a great supporting cast with Kate Vernon as the rich snob who makes life difficult in school for Ringwald and James Spader as another preppy who just wants a quick roll in the hay from Ringwald. Spader dresses like a Don Johnson/Sonny Crockett wannabe and he really becomes someone you love to hate.Ringwald's friend and confidante is John Cryer who set a standard playing all kinds of non conformist parts from the Brat Pack Eighties down to today. You really do wish Cryer could get Ringwald, if there was justice in the world, he would have.Pretty In Pink is not a bad Cinderella story with a bow to The Way We Were. Hopefully it works out better ultimately for Molly and Andrew than it did for Barbra and Bob.",Pretty in Pink
2,SnoopyStyle,80's teen classic,8,15 March 2016,Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is a high school senior from a poor family same as her unrelenting admirer Duckie (Jon Cryer). She takes care of her tired father Jack (Harry Dean Stanton). She works at the record store Trax with mentor Iona (Annie Potts). Preppy rich Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy) is taken with the unusual Andie. Benny Hanson (Kate Vernon) is the mean girl and her boyfriend Steff McKee (James Spader) is a sleazy womanizer. Iona keeps pushing for Andie to go to the prom and Blane just might want to be her date despite pressure from his friends.This is a Howard Deutch-John Hughes 80's teen classic. The basic story is very formulaic with the poor girl and the rich boy. The young rising stars are what makes this adorable and compelling. Molly Ringwald is simply the IT girl of the era and the audience roots for her no matter what. She really projects her emotions. Jon Cryer is also adorable as Duckie and Andrew McCarthy is pretty. The music is good and who could forget about Duckie dancing. It may follow a familiar formula but they don't make them like this anymore.,Pretty in Pink
3,gavin6942,Sorely Lacking,5,24 June 2014,"A poor girl (Molly Ringwald) must choose between the affections of her doting childhood sweetheart (Jon Cryer) and a rich but sensitive playboy (Andrew McCarthy).Of all the films John Hughes wrote or directed, this is probably the least best. At no point in time does the boyfriend give us a reason to think he has changed, or that he is even someone we can see the lead actress falling for. Years later, Molly Ringwald said they probably broke up shortly after the film ends. This is probably true, as nothing suggests otherwise.Jon Cryer was impressive here, and it is a bit of a shame he is playing a geek (or a closeted homosexual, as some have suggested). Clearly he has a great deal of talent and physical ability, so it would have been nice to be able to show that off without having to be the fool.The film's redeeming quality -- and there is only one -- is the casting of Annie Potts. Although best known for ""Ghostbusters"", she is allowed to show off her acting and range here, and she comes across as the most lovable character. (Interestingly, she is supposed to be fifteen years older than Ringwald -- which she is in real life -- but has aged so well that they could be in the same grade.)",Pretty in Pink
4,Tweekums,Who will Molly Ringwald go to the prom with?,7,22 June 2012,"Molly Ringwald plays Andie, a high school girl who lives with her father Jack; that aren't well off and neither are her friends. It seems that at the school she attends wealth is very much a divisive issue. Blane, one of the wealthy boys doesn't seem bothered though and invites her out for a date one evening; at first she is unsure but eventually accepts. Things start badly when he takes her to a party being thrown by his friend Steff; it does not go well as the rich kids attending treat her as though she has no business being there. The leave and go to her regular hangout but that ends equally badly when her friend Duckie is just as rude to Blane; although that is largely because he is besotted with Andie himself. The evening isn't a total disaster though as he ends up inviting her to the school prom. As she prepares for the big night Steff starts pressuring Blane to stop going out with somebody he considers to be of the wrong class. After this he stops returning her calls and when confronted claim that he forgot he'd already invited somebody else. She knows that he wasn't telling the truth but decides that she will go anyway the only real question is whether she will leave the prom with Duckie or with Blane.This is one of numerous high school movies that came out during the eighties and the fact that it was written by John Hughes the creator of 'The Breakfast Club' and features one of its stars, Molly Ringwald, suggest that it is worth watching. While this isn't as good as 'The Breakfast Club' or Hughes' best known High School film 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' it is still worth watching. Molly Ringwald is a delight as Andie and Harry Dean Stanton is great as her loving father. This is obviously a romance and it isn't overly comical; that isn't to say they aren't laughs to be had; they just aren't obvious gags. Many of the characters are fairly despicable; most obviously Steff and his obnoxious friends this serves to make it all the more satisfying when his character is quickly demolished in the final scenes! I won't say who she ended up with; by the end either would have seemed right though and it was handled in a way that made both of them look good. If you are a fan of eighties High School films then this one is a must see; if you aren't you might still enjoy it.",Pretty in Pink
5,moonspinner55,Teen flick about bucking conventions alas falls right into them!,5,29 June 2001,"Writer John Hughes apparently reveres his childhood, in about the same way the makers of TV's ""Happy Days"" revered the 1950s. He has wrapped up his memories in plastic coating and taken care to make certain everything comes off COOL--even his leading character, a high school misfit, is very cool simply by having her rebuff the popular clique (a clique most teens would prefer to be in, rather than being tagged an 'outcast'). As played by Molly Ringwald, this high school unfortunate has her own phone, her own car, and her own job (in a fashionably retro record shop). ""Pretty In Pink"" is designed to make high school look good to junior high schoolers. It's Hughes' heaven for the have-nots (those who can afford it, anyway), where a misfit culture can make goofy glasses and thrift-shop attire something to LONG for. As a romantic teen-comedy, it stumbles by giving us insufferably smug Andrew McCarthy as Ringwald's dream guy (he's the type of actor who relaxes only when it's his close-up) and James Spader as the preppy villain (he looks so old, at first I thought he might be one of the teachers in ""Miami Vice"" dress). Ringwald is charming, and Jon Cryer takes a formula role as a goofy guy-pal and makes it something a little special (although it's a hand-me-down from Anthony Michael Hall). The film has some sincerity and a few witty lines, but basically it's pap (or rather, pablum) for audiences unwilling to chew, just swallow. ** from ****",Pretty in Pink
6,michaelRokeefe,Romantic comedy about young love.,6,6 May 2000,"Writer John Hughes has the 80's pegged. But this story could have been set in the 50's or 60's and still worked well. That is why I think this movie is so relevant. Devotion, friendship, and self worth are quizzed. The young actors were better than expected. I have watched this over a dozen times and I don't care if some people refer to this as a ""chick flick"".A young girl falls in love with a boy from the other side of the tracks. Problems occur when his peers think the object of his desires is socially beneath him. Molly Ringwald was very good. Andrew McCarthy and Jon Cryer seemed to feel their part more than the rest of the cast. But James Spader was such a realistic jerk, you want to get up and punch his face in. Harry Dean Stanton and Annie Potts play the adult roles of substance. Have you ever seen Stanton so sympathetic? A very upbeat soundtrack keeps the movie flowing and helps you feel the atmosphere. Don't write this off as just another teen movie. Highly recommended.",Pretty in Pink
7,sunwarrior13,Adolescent Insecurities,10,14 October 2012,"Writer John Hughes crafts an exemplary Brat Pack romance out of the standard Cinderella story in Pretty in Pink.It stars Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy,Jon Cryer together with Harry Dean Stanton,Annie Potts and James Spader.The movie is about teenage love and social cliques in 1980's American high schools that is directed by Howard Deutch.Andie Walsh is a teenager who lives in the dingy part of town with her terminally underemployed dad. She works at a record store with eccentric Ionia and is considered a misfit at her uppity high school, but somehow she rises above them all. Her oddball best friend, Duckie, is hopelessly in love with her, so he causes trouble for her romantic pursuits. When local rich kid Blaine develops a fascination with her, they go out on a date together. Visiting the home bases of each social clique, they are basically ridiculed for their audacity to date one another. When Blaine eventually asks the delighted Andie to the prom, he is threatened by his rich friend Steff. The romance versus high school social politics finally culminates at the big night of the prom.Pretty in Pink is a rather intelligent look at adolescent insecurities as it provides an understanding of class structure, of culture and counter-culture and the ways that teenagers can destroy one another over the subtle distinctions therein.Although it is clichéd and stereotyped, it is remarkably sentimental, and sweet as all get-out.And most of all,it manages to leave an imprint to the viewer.",Pretty in Pink
8,studioAT,The last in the Hughes/Ringwald trilogy,6,17 July 2016,"The combination of John Hughes behind the camera and Moly Ringwald in front produced some of the iconic moments of 80's film comedy, and here is their sadly last collaboration.Filled with great performances from not only Ringwald, but also Jon Cryer as Duckie, this is another example of the brilliance of John Hughes's teen comedies that are so full of humour and heart that can't be beaten.Yes, people will moan about the famously reshot ending, but in all honesty it doesn't spoil a lovely film.",Pretty in Pink
9,hitchcockthelegend,You're ashamed to go out with me.,8,13 August 2009,"Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is different to most kids at school. Being solely raised by her unemployed father, Jack (Harry Dean Stanton), and dressing in hand made clothes, she's very much from the wrong side of the tracks. It's tough in school as Andie and her pals are looked down on by the more wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body. With the prom on the horizon, Andie is feeling a little more bluer than normal, but hope comes in the form of Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy), a so called rich kid, who in spite of peer pressure asks Andie to the prom. This is something that alienates Andie and Blane from their so called friends.As it turned out, ""Pretty In Pink"" was another in the line of John Hughes films that really hit the mark with the teenagers of the time. In fact it's fair to say it impacted with almost everyone who had suffered a less than straight forward climb through some angsty teenage years. It's not a perfect piece by any stretch of the imagination, for at times it's twee and at others a little trite, it is nevertheless a finely crafted piece that deals with teen perils and the ugliness of class division. Unfortunately the class divide is something that rarely gets associated with the pic, because focus tends to be drawn to the love story at its heart. Which is a shame, because although audience expectation will undoubtedly be met in that department, Hughes has plotted it nicely to make a valid point. There is also the real notable thread of the single parent here, where the single parent is a man and a man who is unable to break free of the escalating distress caused by the break up of his marriage to Andie's mother. The two best serious scenes in the film both involve the father/daughter axis, where both Ringwald and H.D. Stanton are simply terrific. Comedy relief comes in the form of Andie's best pals, Duckie (Jon Cryer our hero) and Iona (Annie Potts), with both characters neatly inserted into the structure of the piece. While the direction from Howard Deutch is careful and brings about reality based performances from the predominantly youthful cast.Containing a kicking 1980s soundtrack from the likes of ""New Order"", ""Echo And The Bunnymen"", ""Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark"" and ""The Psychedelic Furs"", ""Pretty In Pink"" is a special movie on the CV of John Hughes. It will not be special to all comers, but for many, myself included, it strikes a mighty chord, one that was first heard back in the 1980's and for sure can still be heard today. 8/10",Pretty in Pink
10,Doylenf,A formula for what's wrong with films of the '80s...,5,15 March 2005,"PRETTY IN PINK actually has a storyline that was done with more style and wit back in the '30s, only then it was called ALICE ADAMS--about a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, ashamed of her home surf but dying to mix with the right social set and wanting to impress a wealthy boyfriend.Here it's the same situation, but moved to the 1980s, with saltier language and spicier situations--exploiting the same premise with lesser results. The crude language is a turn-off in itself.This is almost a formula for the way films reflected the cheapening of social values as reflected in teen life and culture of the '80s.It's amusing to see Harry Dean Stanton in the guise of a nice, normal dad. Especially for those of us who remember him in films like THE PROUD REBEL where he played one of the worthless sons of Dean Jagger, totally convincing in his villainous role. Here he does a complete turnaround as a doting dad.Even the soundtrack clicks along in totally '80s style with pop songs setting the stylish mood of every scene. James Spader has an especially obnoxious role that he plays with relish.Nothing remarkable here. As a fan of classic movies I've seen it all before and you won't find it done any better than in ALICE ADAMS, the Katharine Hepburn/Fred MacMurray flick from 1938. It puts this one to shame, a more high-toned version of the same storyline.Summing up: The saving graces of the film are the nice central performances by Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald.",Pretty in Pink
11,preppy-3,OK John Hughes film,7,20 November 2002,"One of the many PG (or PG-13) teen films made in the 80s by writer/producer/director John Hughes. This one isn't his worst (""Some Kind of Wonderful"" wins that), but it's not his best either. It's somewhere in the middle. A rich boy (Andrew McCarthy) loves a poor girl (Molly Ringwald). She loves him also but is constantly being pursued by hyper Duckie (Jon Cryer). McCarthy asks her to the prom. She accepts. But will his crowd accept her?What is this? In the 1920s-1950s I could believe this being made...but in 1986??!!?? Teenagers didn't care who was rich or not back then (I should know--I had a teenage sister in high school and she found the plot ridiculous too). It bothered me a lot in 1986 and it's still a bit of a sore spot today.Also the plot involves an older woman (Annie Potts) trying to help her and-sigh-her lovable, alcoholic dad (Harry Dean Stanton!)--talk about your clichés! There's also James Spader on hand playing an obnoxious rich kid.All in all though, this movie isn't bad. It has a great soundtrack, some truly incredible 80s fashions and some of the dialogue is on target (Cryer's one liners are very funny). But the acting is all over the place--Ringwald looks bored--the only time she comes to life is when she has to tell off McCarthy (a wonderful scene). McCarthy looks VERY uneasy and the scenes between him and Ringwald are TERRIBLE!!! Some of their lines had me staring at the screen in disbelief. Cryer, however, is very funny as Duckie. He wears truly ugly outfits but makes everything he says sound funny. His only really bad scene is when he dances and lip syncs to Otis Reddings' ""Try A Little Tenderness"". He tries to hard to be funny and it gets embarrassing to watch. Spader and Stanton sleepwalk through their roles. It is fun to see Kristy Swanson in a cameo, Gina Gershon (!) as a teenage (!) friend of Ringwald and Andrew Dice Clay as a bouncer! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!I agree with previous posters--the ending is terrible. She should end up with Duckie. The original ending had her not going after McCarthy and staying in the prom. Test audiences hated that and it was quickly changed. I'd LOVE to see the original ending. Is it still around?",Pretty in Pink
12,grantss,Charming high school drama,7,6 June 2014,"Charming high school drama, but you expect nothing less from writer John Hughes.Sums up well the anxieties and politics of high school. Also has a bit of a comment on social status and class divides.Mostly a romantic drama, but has its comedic moments.On the negative side, feels a bit formulaic. Also not as deeply emotional, or complex as some of Hughes other 80s movies. Plus, some of the characters were felt unrealistic and contrived. Jon Cryer's character was particularly annoying.Good performance by Molly Ringwald, a regular in John Hughes movies, in the lead role. As mentioned, Jon Cryer is annoying. Good support from Harry Dean Stanton, Andrew MacCarthy, James Spader and Annie Potts.",Pretty in Pink
13,AlsExGal,Not everything always turns out ducky...,7,17 June 2017,"... not even in the 80s, not even in a teen movie in the 80s.This is a cult favorite starring Molly Ringwald as Andie, a high school senior of limited means. She gets persistently bullied by the rich crowd at school. Her mom ran out on her and her dad, and as a result dad is chronically unemployed and likes to drink, but he's not a mean drunk. Molly also has to deal with Duckie (Jon Cryer), an amiable goofball who is madly in love with her.Andie is surprised when wealthy Blaine (Andrew McCarthy) casts an eye in her direction. However, their dating is causing tensions among his elite circle. Or should I say elitist circle? They have all the charm of the French aristocracy before they were guillotined. Blaine asks Andie to the prom, but when he comes up against brick wall opposition from all of his friends he wilts and pulls away from Andie, making lame excuses about having already asked somebody else to the prom. She sees right through him. Meanwhile Andie's dad has managed to buy a pink dress at a thrift shop, and she decides to fix it up as a prom dress and go to the prom anyways.How will this all turn out? Watch and find out. Let me single out James Spader as doing a great turn as Blaine's snobby friend Steff. He is the one who convinces Blaine that Andie is nothing special. Plus there is a scene I will never forget. At the high school, as Andie passes Steff at a distance, he gives her a look like she is something he scraped off of his shoe. It is creepy and it is real. Kudos to Mr. Spader for such a great early performance.The excellent supporting cast includes Harry Dean Stanton as Molly's dad, James Spader perfecting his rich jerk persona, Annie Potts as Andie's kooky co-worker at a record store who thinks she is a relic because she is mid 30s, Kate Vernon, Gina Gershon, Kristy Swanson, Margaret Colin, Dweezil Zappa, and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay. The script by John Hughes mostly works, and the good New Wave songs on the soundtrack add to the film's charm. I'm not exactly the target audience for teen romance films, even thirty years ago when it was released, but even I enjoyed it, so if it's your kind of thing, you should love it.Just one more thing...Jon Cryer grew up and filled out nicely. Who would have thought in 1986 that 25 years later Cryer would be the hunk and Charlie Sheen would have the appearance of a death mask. Go for depth girls, you don't know what the geeky guy in high school will look like when he matures.",Pretty in Pink
14,Wuchakk,Mediocre first two acts give way to an effective last act,6,8 May 2016,"Released in 1986, ""Pretty in Pink"" stars Molly Ringwald as a working class eccentric at a Los Angeles high school. She finds herself stuck between her likable, but annoyingly obsessive friend, Duckie (Jon Cryer), and a rich preppie with whom she shares affection (Andrew McCarthy). Harry Dean Stanton plays her struggling father, Annie Potts her older mentor at the record store where she works and James Spader the preppie's snooty friend. Andrew Dice Clay is on hand for a brief role.This is not a zany, fun high school dramedy, like 1984's ""Sixteen Candles""; it's too brooding and dramatic, which isn't to say it doesn't have comedic touches. The first hour is relatively flat, hampered by a feeling of un-reality, particularly Andie & Blane's horrible first date. Blane's decision to go to his snooty rich friend's party is bad; and his decision to continue to hang around when it's clear Andie can't stand it there is stupefying. The original ending was reshot after test audience responded badly to the outcome. For me, it makes sense, the actual ending to the movie, not the rejected one. The movie's not as good as ""Sixteen Candles"" (which wasn't great in the first place), but I'm giving it a marginal thumbs up.The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B-",Pretty in Pink
15,Sylviastel,It will leave you tickled pink!,8,13 May 2006,"Poor Alexa Kenin who played Annie's best friend in the film. She was killed in real life and it's dedicated to her memory. Anyway, I love this film. Of course, it's by John Hughes (master of teen angst comedies and dramas.) Again, he picks a great cast like Jon Cryer to play Duckie, James Spader to play the creep, Molly Ringwald to play Annie, Annie Potts to play her strange older friend, Harry Dean Stanton who plays Annie's father, etc. John Hughes always knows how to explain the adolescent psyche. This film is about rich and poor kids living together. There is this shame in the poor students and the rich kids are just spoiled brats. As always, John provides a believable love triangle among Jon Cryer's Duckie, Molly Ringwald's character, and that guy who I forget his name. Anyway, they are all great. I just have one problem and that is the fact we never understand why the mother/wife left the family. Anyway, Gina Gershon has a small part in the film as well. Of course, it's about prom night which is an American ritual to all of us.",Pretty in Pink
16,Mr-Fusion,Subpar Hughes,5,2 July 2015,"I usually take to John Hughes movies pretty well, but ""Pretty in Pink"" was strangely flat for me. Part of the reason is that I saw ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" first (which, despite its faults, is much more effective in its pursuits), this is also a fairly lackluster cast, with Annie Potts being the only real standout (although, the ladies' room scene was some genuinely funny Jon Cryer). But that ending . . . everything points to Andie ending up with Duckie. The way the story moves, everything, it's a foregone conclusion. We know how this will shake out. Yet it goes the other way, and for no good reason. In a movie like this, that's a nonsensical rug-pull. It kinda helps when you know the behind-the-scenes reason for this, but it's still a fumble.5/10",Pretty in Pink
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"While it is just another teen movie, it's not too bad",6,12 June 2005,"My girlfriends at work just told me recently that I am not aloud to be a movie fan without seeing the ""coming of age"" films. So, they have lent me all the coming of age films: Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Say Anything, Breakfast Club, Weird Science, etc. You'll see later in my movie comments soon. So, was Pretty in Pink a good movie? It was average. Your typical 80's romance teen flick. This is a classic though that I will appreciate and see what these other teen movies are about. Molly Ringwald is very entertaining and I loved seeing those familiar faces.

19,Irishchatter,It's OK but it's pathetic...,3,17 November 2015,"I just only watched this because I could see that young Jon Cryer was involved in this. This movie had an OK storyline but I felt Molly Ringwald who played Andie was too preppy to be considered a weakling in this. She was actually not that kind of person who wouldn't be that sensitive. Although I would consider her a whiner at the same time!I found Jon Cryer's character very annoying and distracting to look at. I think his character was way too giddy for anyone to date. I'm not saying Jon Cryer isn't a bad actor, I'm just saying his character needs to be rewritten again because it just was the worst role for his acting career! I would suggest that his character should've been a greaser who doesn't give a crap and doesn't care about anything that stands in his way but only for his love! It's not a good but an alright movie.......",Pretty in Pink

21,digitalbeachbum,"A really good classic movie from the 80's, but not perfect",8,15 October 2017,"Directed by John Hughes, Pretty In Pink (1985) is a movie about an awkward intelligent female teenager (Molly Ringwald) who is colorful and on the outside of the fringe. From a distance she likes a rich likable preppie boy (Andrew McCarthy) who from a distance likes her. This creates the conflict and the goal of the movie, for these two characters to connect.Cameos such as Andrew Dice Clay who was at the time one of the most sought after comedians. Also there is Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank Zappa. Harry Dean Stanton as the father of Andie. John Cryer as Duckie. James Spader as the jackass rich turd. Annie Pots as Iona.Pretty In Pink is a movie that presents an outlandish version of kids from the 80's. The main characters in this movie are a collage of a variety of students in that era. There is a representation of almost all the clicks from my school, jocks, geeks, nerds, rockers, preppies.The most honest thing in the movie is the music store (Trax) with the records stapled to the ceiling. I used to hang out in a music store like this and even the characters who run the store are exactly like the people I knew in my store.I'm not sure if there is a connection, but in the Blues Brothers they were in a music store (with instruments) and Ray Charles shot at the kid as he tried to steal the guitar. Then in Hi Infidelity there is a scene with Jack Black & John Cusack and the kids stealing tapes.Overall it is a really good movie however it isn't perfect. There are a bunch of flaws and inconsistencies in the movie. I do not like the ending, it wasn't realistic. It was also flat. The kissing scene in the parking lot was lacking.Also - The sound track is amazing. The Psychedelic Furs, Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, INXS, New Order, Suzanne Vega w/Joe Jackson, Echo & The Bunnymen and The Smiths show how John Hughes was really hip to the popular music at the time.",Pretty in Pink

23,ebiros2,"Movie, '80s style",6,26 December 2012,"This to me was the quintessential Molly Ringwald movie. It's the typical high school teenager movie that she became so identified with.The irreverence of the movie is very '80s. It's not as serious, but has sweetness that more modern movies don't have. '80s were when US had a strong middle class, and the values were in that direction as well. Although Ringwald's character is from a working class family, the romance of rich kid and working class kid appealed to the mostly middle class teenagers.There were times in American history that teenagers actually resonated to movies like this. In a way it's a wholesome movie that can't be duplicated today.I think this was the attraction of Molly Ringwald's movie. Andrew McCarthy is convincing as usual in his role. This is one of the significant Brat Pack movie of the '80s, and is worth the watch.",Pretty in Pink
24,dee.reid,"Molly Ringwald is ""Pretty in Pink""",8,6 September 2011,"Putting my biases aside (with regard to particular character), ""Pretty in Pink"" is a great film that critiques the need for cliques in high school (and brings back memories of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""). Like any film production associated with the late great ""Brat Pack"" filmmaker John Hughes, ""Pretty in Pink"" is extremely well-acted and insightful into the minds of teenagers. His characters are alive, real, and thoughtful - just as real teenagers are in real life.True to his movies, none of them are dated at all and have withstood the test of time. Sure the clothing and hairstyles have changed, yes, but the subject matter hasn't. And that was Hughes's real novelty as a filmmaker: his ability to make movies about teenagers for teenagers and his teen-aged audience responded rightfully. Even after his heyday (and his untimely passing in 2009), his movies are just as relevant now as they were 25 years ago.My personal favorite is ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985). Hughes always had a way of selecting brilliant and bright young performers in his movies. For ""Pretty in Pink,"" he brought back ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984) alumnus Molly Ringwald. Here she plays Andie Walsh, a bright girl from the wrong side of the tracks - literally, the poor side of the train tracks in her working-class Chicago suburb - with her unemployed single father Jack (Harry Dean Stanton). She happens to have a crush on a wealthy fellow classmate named Blane McDonnagh (Andrew McCarthy), who happens to come from the right side of the tracks.Their blossoming romantic relationship angers people in their respective circles of friends - Duckie (Jon Cryer) on Andie's side, and Steff (James Spader) and all the rest of their rich, spoiled associates. Although there's some of the usual romantic entanglements and hang-ups here, it all boils down to a choice either for Andy or for Duckie.Now here's where it gets personal: This movie was particularly uncomfortable for me because of the character of Duckie. He's in the friend zone permanently with Andie, much as I was once with the most beautiful girl I knew in high school. The reason this didn't sit well for me personally and kept me from enjoying ""Pretty in Pink"" more was because this scenario brought back some painful memories from a time I thought I left behind a long time ago.Moving on, ""Pretty in Pink"" does have Hughes's usual trappings, but the production is firmly in the hands of director Howard Deutch, who would also go on to direct ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" one year later in 1987. He does have a funny supportive cast and well-written characters, like Jack, the fashion-impaired and lovelorn Duckie (Cryer's most well-known performance prior to his time on ""Two and a Half Men""), and Annie Potts as Andie's record store friend Iona.Despite some painful personal memories, ""Pretty in Pink"" is yet another timely, timeless piece of John Hughes fanfare.8/10",Pretty in Pink

26,drqshadow-reviews,Deep in the Heart of the Eighties...,7,1 July 2016,"One last collaboration for John Hughes and Molly Ringwald, whose creative partnership dissolved after this film. Somewhat softer and more self-serious than the preceding teen epics Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, it tackles social cliques and classism from various perspectives. Ringwald and leading man Andrew McCarthy, akin to Romeo and Juliet, find their young relationship stressed by the negative influence of friends who insist they find someone closer to their own status. There really isn't much sparkle to the pairing, though, apart from a few awkward make-out scenes, and they both come off as especially wet noodles in comparison to the vibrant, brash supporting cast. Jon Cryer is most memorable of these as Duckie, a flamboyant mod who's been carrying a torch for Ringwald all his life, and nearly steals the film with an abrupt dance/lip-sync number just before everything gets overly angsty. Most of the third act is wasted on hand-wringing and moping, though, and the ending (changed at the last minute, much to Hughes's chagrin) feels disingenuous even if it does make a better fit for the movie's theme. The window dressings are drowned in '80s flavor, too, from the appropriately synthy soundtrack to the Halloween-grade costume choices. Looks like everyone at this school was either Don Johnson, Sid Vicious or Morrissey.",Pretty in Pink

28,jimbo-53-186511,"Unlikeable, boring, annoying, uninteresting characters and a non-existent plot = a film that's very hard to give a damn about",2,1 June 2016,"Andie (Molly Ringwald) is one of the 'unpopular' girls at school who is looked down on by some of the 'richer' girls at her school. Andie only has a couple of friends - one of which is a guy called Duckie (Jon Cryer) who has a big crush on her. To make matters worse Andie lives at home with her father Jack (Harry Dean Stanton) who is out of work and generally unmotivated. When Andie meets a rich boy who goes to her school called Blane (Andrew McCarthy) she believes that her prayers have been answered, but the course of true love doesn't run smoothly for Andie....I've watched quite a few of John Hughes' films and have liked quite a few of them (Weird Science, Planes Trains & Automobiles, Home Alone), but it seemed that a lot of the qualities that I've witnessed in his other films seemed to be missing hereThe first major problem here lies with characterisation and character development; take Molly Ringwald's character - she's depicted here as the poor girl who just wants a break in life and we're also led to believe that the rich girls are shallow and pretentious (which they are), but yet Andie is perceived as being just as shallow and pretentious as her peers. She openly admits that she's interested in Blane for his money and her viewpoint on Blane never seems to change throughout the film. It's one thing to offer a critique on shallow rich kids, but when the poor kid shows similar traits you're left with a screenplay that seems rather contradictory.This brings me on to the next big problem with this film; the male characters - on one hand you've got Duckie who is obsessed with Andie, but is unable to articulate his feelings towards her. This should create an endearing scenario, but the problem is that Duckie is anything but endearing and if anything he comes across as being creepy and annoying and the fact that he isn't a particular likable character only makes matters worse. Cryer's character is clearly supposed to be the 'funny guy' here and one's enjoyment of this film probably hinges on whether you find him funny or annoying here (well I can safely say that I fall into the latter camp). Next we come to Blane who is virtually the complete opposite to Duckie - given all the bad things I've said about Duckie you may think that this is a good thing, but trust me it is not. When I say different to Duckie, I mean that Blane is bland, boring and uninteresting. When evaluating these two characters one thought came to my head and that is; Why would Andie be interested in either of these guys? One who is immature, annoying and in-your-face creepy and the other who seems to have had a personality exorcism. As well as having many shallow and unlikeable characters the film never allows any of them to develop and as a consequence the story never really develops either; the film could have made more of an effort to explore the world in which the poor kids and the rich kids live in which would have made the narrative a little more insightful, but sadly it never really played out in this manner. James Spader's role as the school jock was interesting, but he's never really given anything to do and aimlessly flits in and out of the story. Going back to characters the only one I felt some pity for was Andie's dad (despite his flaws and the fact that he brought some of his problems on himself) I could see that he really cared for Andie and that one tender scene between the two of them towards the end of the film was probably the only real strong moment in the film.Another issue I had with this film is that it wasn't funny which is really surprising as Hughes can usually meld comedy and drama together really well, but in this film he gets neither element right. Although he didn't direct this film so I suppose it's unfair to lay all the blame at his door.As with The Breakfast Club, Hughes gives us an ending that is presumably meant to be heart-warming, but it just came across to me as forced and unrealistic. I kept wishing that Andie would just ditch both Duckie and Blane and find someone normal!!!! All in all there's very little that's good about this film and it basically lacks the insight, strong characterisation and a light-weighted sense of fun that I'm used to seeing from Hughes. Oh well I suppose all good filmmakers have an off day and Pretty In Pink is clearly a film that Hughes' knocked up on one of his off days.",Pretty in Pink

This movie is about a normal non-rich teen girl played by Molly Ringwald who seeks love from a rich boy, played by Andrew McCarthy while at the same time having an infatuated friend played wonderfully by a young Jon Cryer who can't seem to give her up. The characters are played and written so well in this movie that you can't stop watching despite it's simple premise and inherent sweetness. The movie is really about breaking thru the class snobbery that exists in high schools but has a sweet first-love story intertwined. The movie is played out slowly with some scenes coming across as if they are played off-the-cuff, just letting the actors play it out. The side characters are also wonderfully portrayed -- especially Harry Dean Stanton as the father and Annie Potts as the older friend. The ending was kind of corny and just didn't seem quite right but because the rest of the movie is so good this can be forgiven. This is a one-of-a-kind teen masterpiece by the usually good John Hughes(especially when working in this genre).",Pretty in Pink

31,vertigo_14,Dissecting the class division. (spoilers),8,22 February 2006,"John Hughes has always had the classist themes in his films, and particularly his teen films, with the exception of Weird Science. The most apparent of these being 'The Breakfast Club,' 'Some Kind of Wonderful,' 'Career Opportunities,' and of course, 'Pretty in Pink.' I think the thing to be valued most about these characters is that they are always very much aware of their surroundings and their separations of one another usually more so than the adults (resulting in a teen film that lacks such a condescending and unnecessarily fearful outlook). Within these movies, even if only momentarily (although, we might presume lastingly), they seem to understand enough to transcend these absurd, social demarcations.Molly Ringwald, in what might be her best role yet, plays wise teenager, Andie, who's living with her unemployed, single father literally on the other side of the tracks. Although there are points raised about her mother having abandoned she and her father without explanation, we are pretty much just aware of Andie as being one aspect of class. (As we should, since this is basically the theme of the entire movie, although it is classified first as a love story.) Her friends basically accept that what others have sold them: that it is their lot in life to be subordinate to those with more money, and that education need only be a limited and failing effort, just as anything else will that they embark upon. But not Andie. She's seems to be the most vigilante in breaking through these allotted social roles where others like her might follow.This comes when she meets studly and quiet, Blaine (McCarthy), who is one of those she and her friends have been conditioned to avoid--and vice versa. He is a ""richie"". Although attracted to each other, it is the threat of their friends' reactions to their relationship that threatens to break them up. Andie and Blaine's worlds are conveniently confined to very distinct illustrations using the school campus and outdoor corridors and external social settings (like the club or the party). Duckie (who has seemed to develop into a cult character, along with Annie Potts' character, Iona, the record store owner and Andie's spunky boss) seems to be the most visible in being turned off by the situation, he being the life-long friend of Andie and secretly, infatuated with her. But it is Steff, Blaine's vicious friend, who had been rebuffed by Andie on numerous occasions, who tries hard to persuade Blaine to end things. It is just a matter of determining which who will be stronger in the matter and between Andie and Blaine, it looks like Andie is really the one who proves to be above it.The ending is the result of test audiences who did not like the fact that Andie ended up with Duckie. I'm not sure this would've been an entirely bad thing and I hate when filmmakers acquiesce to the responses of audiences rather than their own inclinations. Nonetheless, despite the ridiculously sappy ending, it has transcended the limits of the time, and become yet another Hughes classic.",Pretty in Pink
32,triple8,better then sixteen candles,8,4 December 2003,"There was something about this movie-I'm not exactly sure what but it just got me. Even though Sixteen Candles is supposed to be the movie many remember Molly Ringwald for and I liked it, I actually prefer this.I think it may have something to do with the whole bohemian flavor to the movie. The characters were so true to life, not that they weren't in sixteen Candles but Pretty in Pink just had something special to it. It was one of those teen movies one could watch over and over, and I think the music had something to do with it too. It really was both fun and touching. I adored this movie back when it was first out and saw it numerous times.This movie was pure 80's but, though I haven't seen it in awhile I would watch it again-it is a pretty simple movie but a sweet one and extremely well-made-just never became quite as popular as sixteen candles and other similar movies.

Guys, don't be afraid to check this out.   What starts out as what seems to be just another 80's boy meets girl kind of movie, ends up being a pretty smart flick about class, family issues, self-worth, and that gauntlet/mine field known as high school. Pretty in Pink is more serious than funny, and has the kind of relatable and likable characters that these kinds of movies need to be successful. I liked the cast, liked the story, and just enjoyed the whole thing, overall. You don't have to have been a teenager in the 80's (though I'm sure it helps) for this to be a worthwhile movie.

35,Howlin Wolf,"Pink for a girl OR a boy, apparently!",6,6 July 2007,"This is a typical teen dilemma story at its heart, one which I somewhat suspect I watched far more often than is healthy when I was a young boy aged six or so. Guys be warned - that's what having a sister who is eight years older gets you when you're growing up... Anyway, I'm sure this film added to my gender confusion as a kid and turned me into the mild-mannered softie that I am today!Having to watch it so often during the early stages of my development might have been far more damaging to me if everything about the film didn't suggest that its heart was in the right place. John Hughes was lucky enough to have a fantastic cast gathered together who help to breathe life into his writing. Ringwald especially was a terrific teen actress to snag for this type of material, because there was no-one who could do 'vulnerable' better than her at the time. If the audience connects with your lead character then it gradually becomes a trickle-down effect, which must be a tremendous help for the supporting players, too. Throw in Andrew McCarthy at the height of his powers before his career went into free-fall, plus sidekick duties performed by a young and zany Jon Cryer, and that's a winning trio you have. It doesn't matter that the crises don't add up to much when you think about it, as long as they're sold to us in a way we can identify with.So far so snug, then. The only glitch appears in the resolution, where our heroine is encouraged to give up her individuality and that of her friend as a way for her to be finally accepted into 'the cool crowd'... What?! That isn't a fairytale ending, it's a graceful swan-dive toward conformity! It's not a message I expected Hughes to be advocating, and it taints the wholesomeness of the tale a little bit. Aside from that blip so close to the finishing line, however, this is an unashamedly feel good movie that won't corrupt impressionable young minds and is a unisex bit of fun.

36,bobsgrock,Taps into areas most films won't go near.,7,19 April 2009,"Although John Hughes didn't direct this film, his steady hand is evident all throughout in this much more serious story about a poor girl and a rich guy who want to be together despite all odds against them. Despite the more serious tone of this movie, it still has some funny and touching scenes, most of them featuring Duckie, the best friend of Andie and perhaps the man that truly loves her. However, she has her heart set on Blane, the rich preppie who claims he doesn't act like his snobbish friends do but it is hard to tell at times.What makes this movie so great is how it is willing to treat all these kids as adults in real situations and real emotions. The acting accentuates these overtones with Molly Ringwald in perhaps her most sophisticated role, Jon Cryer as the lovable Duckie, Andrew McCarthy as Blane, and James Spader in a perfectly devilish role as Steff, the worst of the bunch by so smooth and relentless, it is hard not to be impressed by him. All in all, this is one of the better 1980s teen movies and one that I think people will remember more fondly as it isn't so overtly unique that people can relate to the characters and feel for them. Unfortunately, it was essentially the end of the Molly Ringwald-era, but her memory in these three Hughes movies will always stay with us.",Pretty in Pink
37,baumer,John Hughes knows the 80's!,9,29 July 1999,"It is hard to believe that this was 13 years ago.  Has it really been that long since we said goodbye to the Brat-Pack?  When I watched Pretty In Pink it made me laugh, but more importantly it brought me back to a time that was fun, had less pressure ( in some ways ), and there were a plethora of films that were made aimed at us teens.  The early 80's will at least partly be remembered as a time when teen flicks ruled.  Everything from Fast Times and Porky's to The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink, they were all there and they all tried to do the same thing.  Entertain.  Sure John Hughes always seemed to have some heavy issues in his films, but ultimately his films were there for us to enjoy for 90 minutes.  Pretty In Pink is one of the best at accomplishing that.What makes this film such the standout that it is, is everything really. The actors were fresh and cool.  The dialogue was smart and easy for us to relate to.  The situations of love covered areas that we have probably all been through.  There was the unobtainable love that just seemed like a fantasy.  There was the two really good friends, one male and one female, that just weren't meant to be lovers and the heartbreak that one is inevitably going to experience.  There was perhaps not being accepted by your love interests peers and so on.  Watching this film I could understand how Duckie felt.  I could feel his anger when he watches his best friend, and his secret love interest, date the personification of what ( and Andie ) consider the personification of snobbery.  She has probably complained many a night about how she is tired of being treated unfairly just because she wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and now she dates one.  I could feel Ducky's pain.  And that can be attributed to John Hughes for writing a brilliant script, but also to Jon Cryer for making his character what he is.  You can sense his insecurities and his undying devotion to a girl that he knows he will probably never get.  And when he sits with Andies dad and chats about love, there is one of the greatest lines in the film. Jack ( Harry Dean Stanton ) tells him that you can't force love, it is either goging to happen or it isn't.  You can't control these things.  And that is what makes love so painful.  While you may be perfect for someone, that someone wants the perfection of someone else.  And that sucks, love's a bitch Duck.  Love's a bitch.Pretty In Pink epitomizes everything that made the 80's a great time for teen flicks.  Secret loves, proms, a great soundtrack and John Hughes. What more can you ask for?

39,Beta_Gallinger,I've never been this disappointed by a John Hughes teen film!,4,8 January 2011,"The late John Hughes made a successful series of teen movies in the 80's, and ""Pretty in Pink"" was one of them. Unlike a number of the others, he didn't direct this one, but he still wrote it, and the starring role was assumed by Molly Ringwald, who appeared in more than one of Hughes' previous films. Having seen a bunch of other Hughes teen films and been overall impressed with each of them, and knowing that this one was fairly well-liked even if it's not the most popular of the bunch, I figured this would be a pretty good piece of its type. However, when I finally watched ""Pretty in Pink"" about 25 years after its theatrical release (it came out over half a year before I was born), I was disappointed to find that it wasn't even average in my book! Andie Walsh is a working class high school senior who lives with her single father, Jack. Her mother abandoned the two of them several years ago, which is something Jack hasn't gotten over. Andie goes to a school where she is looked down on and mistreated by rich snobs, so her school life isn't easy. She is friends with a student named Phil ""Duckie"" Dale and an older woman named Iona, the manager at the record store where Andie works. Duckie has a crush on Andie, which means he wants to be more than friends with her, but his way of trying to show it annoys her, and she finds herself falling in love with another guy named Blane McDonough. Blane is one of the many wealthy students at her school, but is far more sensitive than the other ones she knows, and it turns out he is in love with her as well. The two of them begin dating, much to Duckie's dismay. Blane's rich, snobbish friends also don't approve of this relationship.The beginning of this 1986 dramedy, showing Andie's life at home with her father, is far from an amazing start, but it shows that the movie could go somewhere. Moving to the character's school life, I would say it gets slightly more intriguing here, introducing the rich students who give Andie a hard time, and the impregnation offer and reaction that follows certainly made me laugh. However, the film gradually proves to be not so good. The romance can be memorably cheesy, with the first scene showing Andie falling in love with Blane, and then the computer lab scene. I was not too impressed with Andrew McCarthy's performance as Blane, nor was I with Annie Potts as Iona, but neither of them is as bad as Jon Cryer as Duckie. This character is clearly supposed to provide a lot of laughs, and he sometimes amused me doing things such as setting off the alarm at the record store, but his rants are generally not funny, and because of them, the character can sure be annoying! Watching Andie's troubles, including the rich snobs she faces, did not usually grab me, and the ending of the movie is a little abrupt.I've seen ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Weird Science"", and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", all of which I've found to be good high school movies from the renowned John Hughes. For that reason, one might say I should like ""Pretty in Pink"" as well, but I don't! I found this romantic teen dramedy to be weak in more than one department, even if it has received far more praise than criticism in the past 25 years. It came out earlier the same year as ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and sure pales in comparison to that significantly more popular effort. Apparently, Anthony Michael Hall turned down roles in both of these 1986 films to avoid being typecast, and I certainly don't blame him for that, but the role he was offered in ""Pretty in Pink"" was Duckie. No offense to Jon Cryer, but Hall just might have been less annoying in this role, and the character could have been less of a problem. Most Hughes fans might like this movie, written by him and directed by Howard Deutch, but I can't imagine myself ever quite getting it.",Pretty in Pink
40,gab-14712,"Not the Most Original Hughes Film, But Still Enjoyable!",8,23 July 2020,"Yep, another teen romance from John Hughes featuring members of the Brat Pack! In terms of teen romances and comedies, John Hughes ruled the 1980's. Unlike other films, he did not direct it but was rather the soul and mind. He produced and wrote the script with newcomer Howard Deutch taking over directorial duties. Like most of his scripts, Hughes's Pretty in Pink is a very sweet film. Anyone who was once 16 could relate to the film as it authentically tackles class/social division within a school background. Like any of his films, Hughes made his characters relatable whether you like them or not. I genuinely thought this film is sweet and I enjoyed it very much, but there are some issues.As I said, the script itself is sweet. Hughes took his story from a tale that is old as the beginning of time. We have seen this story play itself out countless numbers of time. The poor girl falling for the rich guy who has snobbish friends. And the poor girl does not want to show the world who she lives with or where she lives. Thankfully, the performances do elevate the material but unfortunately very few points could be given for originality. I also had issues with the ending. The original ending would have been something I would have related with, but the producers fear it could have been considered classist. No outright spoilers here! With all that in mind, the rest of the movie worked well.Duckie (Jon Cryer) is a very unpopular boy who is consistently getting laughed at. He also has a major crush on his best friend, the likewise unpopular Andie (Molly Ringwald). Andie has some inconsistent wardrobe choices and heralds from a poor background. Her mother left years prior and her father Jack (Harry Dean Stanton) is often drunk and unemployed. Now, Duckie wants to tell her his true feelings, but cannot seem to do so. While he contemplates his feelings, Andie falls for the rich Blaine (Andrew McCarthy). He seems to genuinely like her as well, but his snobbish friends keep getting in the way, particularly Steff (James Spader). With prom on the horizon, what will happen to these teenagers and their feelings?The performances are really solid as you would expect with a Brat Pack film. What is Brat Pack? Essentially, it is a term that was given to such teen films from the 1980's and are associated with one or more of Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Andrew McCarthy, etc. So, you could include films such as The Breakfast Club. Back to this film, Ringwald worked well with Hughes as he recommended her in the lead role. She delivered once again! Some people found Jon Cryer annoying as Duckie, but can you resist his lip synch to that Otis Redding song? McCarthy and Spader were solid, but Spader definitely looked too old to be a high school student. Also, I must include Annie Potts who played Andie's record store boss, Iona. I liked her words of wisdom and her style choices.The soundtrack is considered to be one of the best of the 1980's and I can agree. Deutch originally wanted to include theme music, but Hughes convinced him otherwise. Most of the songs are from the new wave genre. In fact, the film's title comes from the hit song sung by the Psychadelic Furs. This soundtrack is a staple when you consider films from the 1980's.Pretty in Pink may not be the best or the most original of films associated with John Hughes. The story has been told a billion times over, but thankfully we got good performances out of the script. I liked the dynamic between Andie and her father and between Andie and Duckie. The chemistry is there between the actors. Too bad the film ended the way it did. It could have been a more satisfying film. Still, this was still a relatable, enjoyable flick.My Grade: B",Pretty in Pink

They happened to release a record called 'Pretty In Pink', their only hit, which also features quite strongly in this film (surprise, surprise!). I really love the song, but will the film match up? Let's see. (As usual, summary haters please omit the next paragraph).Andie Walsh lives with her father Jack; they have been alone since her mother left three years previously. She attends the local school where her friend since childhood, the larger than life, Duckie (real name, Phil Dale) vies for her affections. Unfortunately for him he is firmly in the ""friend zone"" and she is interested in another boy, Blane McDonnagh. The problem is that Blane is one of the rich kids at school and they don't mix well with the likes of Andie. Blane's friend, Steff, tried to dissuade him from pursuing her, but he does anyway. Andie works part-time at a record store with her (older) friend, Iona. She is a kind of substitute mother figure, as well as being a friend. Prom night is coming up and Blane has asked Andie if she would like to go. Duckie is upset and steps out of the picture for a while. Will Blane stand up to his rich friends and take Andie anyway, will Andie realise just how much she's hurt Duckie, or will the hall catch fire and kill everyone inside? (Nah, that's not going to happen just seeing if you're paying attention).Although it looks very dated these days, I still kind of like this film. It's pretty well made with some really good performances, especially from Molly Ringwald as Andie and Harry Dean Stanton as Jack Walsh. I also very much liked the performance of Jon Cryer as Duckie. Honourable mentions must also go to Annie Potts as Iona, James Spader as Steff and Andrew McCarthy as Blane.I guess I would have liked this film more if it wasn't for the fact that I didn't believe the relationship between Andie and Blane. Yes, they are from opposite sides of the tracks and, yes, I have seen these things work many times before in movies, but this one just didn't fly for me. It seems to me that she has much more in common with Duckie, who, by the way is the hero of the film in my opinion. But then, hey, what do I know? At the end of the day, although I found it a little far-fetched in places, and the ending a bit of a let down, still, recommended if just for Molly Ringwald's excellent performance.My score: 7.2/10",Pretty in Pink
42,jem132,Why the heck choose Andrew McCarthy?,7,1 June 2009,"John Hughes wrote and produced the follow-up to his great ""The Breakfast Club"", and while it again doesn't hit the mark as the middle film, it's still another entertaining 80's teen romantic comedy. Hughes muse Molly Ringwald is Andie a girl from the wrong side of the tracks with an eccentric fashion sense who falls for a rich guy, Andrew McCarthy. The trials and tribulations of high school life, dating etc are played out in the well-paced 90 minute running time. I find these films fascinating because while I can relate to many of the characters and adolescent situations (who can't!) my high school life was very different from what seems to be the American experience. Maybe it's because my high school only had 350 people, but we never had the cliques. In Australia we don't have the proms (perhaps that is a good thing), the cheer squad, the jocks parading around the school in their football jumpers. It's much less socially demanding.Big question for John Hughes though: why the hell make Ringwald end up with McCarthy? Oh I get that McCarthy was a huge teen heartthrob back in the 80's (he doesn't do anything for me though, yuck) but his character is so lame. Duckie (Jon Cryer) may be borderline obsessive about Andie, but he's much more winning than Blane. is in there too as Steff, the high school rich guy who treats everyone like crap, but is also possibly in love with Ringwald. Come to think, Steff should have got with Andie. 7",Pretty in Pink
43,Superunknovvn,"80's nostalgia, nothing more",5,6 May 2006,"""Pretty In Pink"" is definitely not one of John Hughes' better works. The characters are shallow, the acting is mediocre and the whole thing is neither really funny nor moving. The only reason to watch ""Pretty In Pink"" nowadays is for that typical 80's feeling it exudes. You'll see faces that you haven't seen on screen in ages (Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald, Andrew Dice Clay), you'll hear all sorts of musical gems from the 80's and you'll witness some of the worst hair and clothing crimes ever committed on film. The story itself, however, is lazily written and can't hold a candle to previous coming of age movies by Hughes. ""Pretty In Pink"" doesn't so much evoke a feeling of how it was to be a teenager in the 80's, but rather of how flawed and clichéd movies could be during that period.",Pretty in Pink
44,Isaac5855,One of the Better Entries from the John Hughes Library...,7,24 January 2008,"PRETTY IN PINK was the hip and stylish teen angst comedy-drama where director John Hughes continued his cinematic love affair with Molly Ringwald which blends the expected teen angst with a sharp look the class system in the high school level. Ringwald plays Andy, an honor student from the wrong side of the tracks who falls for Blaine (Andrew McCarthy)a rich kid who goes to Andy's school and the tension that arises from their individual social circles when Blaine asks Andy to the prom. One of Hughes' better efforts thanks to a smart screenplay and charismatic performances. Rock solid supporting performances come from James Spader, at his oily best as Blaine's insensitive best friend who harbors a secret attraction to Andy; Annie Potts as Andy's ditzy best friend/employer, and especially Jon Cryer, in the scene-stealing performance of a lifetime as Duckie, Andy's best friend who wishes he were more, but it is Ringwald's Andy who is the heart of this movie, a character who will melt your heart and arouse instant empathy for the angst she is subjected to here.

45,emm,80s teen classic illustrates some impressive talent.,8,1 May 1999,"PRETTY IN PINK and Molly Ringwald were to the 80s, as CLUELESS and Alicia Silverstone is to the 90s. An excellent cast and some fine acting were guaranteed enough to have branded this a teenage classic from the 80s. They don't make good movies like this anymore! The clever talent from John Hughes doesn't just mean it's a far-out comedy, but he expresses the problems of young love from central character Ringwald that sound dramatic and satirizing. In other words, a girl-meets-boy story that offers a wide spectrum of situations that are confronted in the real world. Like I already said, the cast is exceptional, including the sensational Jon Cryer doing a lip-synching of that familiar tune from THE COMMITMENTS. Annie Potts is a pure delight at changing one wig after the next (what a nice impersonation of Audrey Hepburn!). The movie wouldn't have been anywhere near complete without the memorable hit tune ""If You Leave"" (Orchestral Manoevers In The Dark). While the end has a hard time getting things straight, there is a valuable moment that caresses deeply. From start to finish, this one still holds up against the recent string of teen pictures that aren't as cool or refreshing (CLUELESS and REALITY BITES are the exceptions).

This is sloppy and all over the place. Everyone overacts (even the bouncer).. Molly Ringwald does a good job as the only real human being leading in the entire movie (though she bites her lips too many times). Her father (nice little emotive moment) and Iona, her music-store friend (great support character, like a mother) are both kind, relatable and nice, the kind of people you want around you. I'm glad at least this part of the movie was written this way. Both feel natural.
As for Jon Cryer, he is EASILY the worst part of the entire thing.Forced romance.. And weird teenager behavior. Either way, I didn't feel the connections.

53,renegadeviking-271-528568,Pretty in Pink review,7,26 January 2020,"One of the 80s teen movies and it felt time to finally watch it. Written by John Hughes, also one of the writers of teen movies. Furthermore, starring Molly Ringwald, an 80s teen star. And got to love a teen movie, what's better than going back to the classics of when they first came about, when the teens became dominant in society and they opened up a new audience for the teenager. Sounds stupid, but you can tell this is an 80s film and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Pretty in Pink - Andie'Pretty in Pink' is one quite simple to grasp, but actually has a meaningful concept behind it all. The film's theme is revolved around the differences between poor and rich: one girl from a low-income family struggles as she's bullied and diminished to nothing; one boy born into money and wealth struggles as he likes someone his family and friends would not approve of. Molly Ringwald plays Andie, the girl seen as poor and worthless by the richer students in her school. She's a great character, full of hatred at how's treated, understandably, and stands up for herself, but she's also creative and clever, she makes her own clothes and excels in school academically. She lives with her father (Harry Dean Stanton), a man stuck in the past and struggling with work. Andie's relationship with her father really is something to be admired, even if there's a small moment there could be a different side of her father, this is immediately destroyed and the real reason behind his laziness shines through, making his character more complex. Where Andie becomes most vulnerable is when she meets Blane (Andrew McCarthy), it's through this rich boy that Andie becomes a character to route for, but Blane also becomes a complicated character, just making mistakes and realising that his friends see Andie as ""trash"" for having no money. Next character for me to introduce, Andie's childhood best friend, Duckie, played by a much younger Alan from 'Two and a Half Men', Jon Cryer. Straight from the beginning we know much more than Andie does, because secretly, well not that secretly, Duckie is in love with his best friend, to Andie's unknown knowledge, that's until his heart breaks when she likes someone from the wrong side. Duckie is actually an amazing character, he's funny, he's adorable. He becomes outraged at Andie's new interest as he's always been there.Pretty in Pink - Andie and IonaThe school is divided, and this is one of those Romeo and Juliet films of whether the relationship between Andie and Blane can actually work. Or whether the best friend would be in for a chance, as he sings to himself in agony of how much he loves her. Or even lip syncs to her, because that scene is just great! Ultimately, this is a film that's just leading to prom, but I think it's a great teen film. My first knowledge of this film, was actually Shawn Spencer's 80s constant mentioning of it, and that just made me want to watch it more and I'm glad I did, so thanks to that character from 'Psych'. What I find great about this film is that I couldn't actually predict it, it might have been an obvious ending, but either endings could be argued that way. Watch it and you'll understand what I mean. Looking for a classic romcom, and I mean a classic? I would recommend this one. A teen romcom of a complicated forbidden love, it might be overdone now, but this one is one of the originals!",Pretty in Pink

Funnily enough the 'villain' Brett actually seems nice to them when they arrive to his house party it's just his gal having 'tude he even goes out of the room to let them be there (although it could be he wants them to do it maybe or just this is a cordial thing? romantic crap is always indirect like this.)

55,patriciogl10,Pretty good teen romance.,7,4 November 2019,"Pretty in Pink screams nostalgia with its brat-pack infused teenage romantic plot, one that applies warmly in its gentle purpose to show a sympathetic tale of an unpopular girl in high school who meets a highly popular boy, and romance ensues. Molly Ringwald (Andie) once again leads very effectively a John Hughes production, proving why she was such a popular teenage figure in the '80s. She's charismatic, she perfectly understands her roles and has great chemistry with her co-stars. Jon Cryer is ideally right for his quirky, immature and goofy character, who is good friends with Andie, but nothing more.Andie pursues other romantic interests, never returning Duckie's painfully annoying and obvious affections, instead falling for rich boy Blane, who seems flawless to Andie. What I like about this film is that it takes a lot of time and plot development until Andie is completely sure of what she really wants, so the resolution presents itself right at the very end, which is good because it keeps your interest going all the way to the finish line.Comparing it with other John Hughes cinematic efforts, Pretty in Pink ranks below great films such as Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller and Weird Science.

That scene was so pathetic when she was crying because she didn't want the guy to know where she lived. Also the movie focuses way too much on the prom, who the hell gives a rat's a-s-s about the prom? I sure don't. Also i noticed that some of the students were smoking in the school building, nobody does that, in my school, if you even just hold a cigarrate in the building you get suspended.

In fact, 1985-86 was probably the best part of the decade.  So much fun, such excellent music.Anyway, on to the movie (sorry, the nostalgia thing just wipes me out)... love it.  I do agree with many of the criticisms (who ends up with who at the end, etc) but Molly Ringwald has never been better, and the movie really *does* have a heart.  One of the best teen flicks of the decade, although I too question whether High School really was like that (I suppose nobody's memory is terribly accurate about those years, including John Hughes -- seems like one of those things that just fades whether you like it or not).8/10 for the film, 10/10 for 80's nostalgia (oh where did the 80's go, I hadn't finished with them yet.

59,kingofdanerds,"Overall ""pretty"" standard",7,12 July 2021,"Of the many John Hughes films out there, Pretty in Pink was the first John Hughes film I ever watched. At least one that he wrote. Because in 1986, we got Pretty in Pink which was NOT directed by John Hughes but instead Howard Deutch. The film stars Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, Andrew McCarthy. The film was met with solid reviews and made bank at the box office like any John Hughes film.Andie (Molly Ringwald) is a girl from the poor side of town. She lives with her father who is only on part time job. She has a friend who has a crush on her named Duckie (Jon Cryer). But, she starts to fall in love with a rich kid (Andrew McCarthy) and wonders how difficult it will be to be dating someone rich.I thought Pretty in Pink was a great film when I watched it for the first time. But seeing that there are more John Hughes films, I now realize that this film is a bit of the same old shtick. Compare it to Sixteen Candles. That film was about an unpopular girl (played by Ringwald) who falls in love with a rich and popular kid. Whereas that film was a comedy romance, this film is more strictly romance which is pretty welcoming. Molly Ringwald does amazing (as usual) in her role and there is one scene that I remember while watching for the first time (back when I was just a regular person and not a film fanatic) that it blew my mind because the performance in that scene was fantastic. It is a shame that Ringwald's career never really took off after the 80's. The other performances like Cryer's and Annie Potts are fairly memorable here too. Now I cannot really praise McCarthy here. Physically, he looks like he could be the character he plays. But everything else is poorly written about his character. I don't know much about his character to give a hoot, and I am not even sure why his character is in love with Molly Ringwald's character. Sure, Ringwald is stunning here but there has to be more to it and the film, at least the way I see it, fails to do that. Which leads to the ending where Ringwald's character has a choice to make. Now, there is the original ending and the ending that everyone knows. I can find something wrong with both endings. One works in a thematic sort of way but the other ending would have been better for the character's interest. You'll know which ending I am referring to if you watch the film. Now while the story is about this ""wrong side of the tracks"" love story, the film does ponder on some ideas about prom. I find this fairly relateable. The question being, Is prom worth going to? It is this sort of relateability that does keep me mildly interesting. The film overall is about social cliques and I think the film handles it well (if the romance aspect is taken out). Despite me going to a rural school with only 400 to 500 students, social cliques with the rich and the poor are still present (though not as prominently considering the size of the school). Lastly, the soundtrack is something worth checking out as I fell on love when the first note of the first song in the film hit.Pretty in Pink maybe better than films like Sixteen Candles, but it is still an overall pretty standard film and does not offer too much that is new.",Pretty in Pink

The dress is a mess and not even 'eghties fashion' could excuse it. How could anyone even think....ah well, I digress. Many IMDb-ers agree.Same old same old from Hughes: geeky poor kids in love with the rich kids and the rich kids in love with the geeky poor kids. Was this supposed to be some attempt at crossing boundaries? Hughes was obsessed with the cross-over. Once you've seen one Hughes film, you've seen them all, literally.Ringwald, as usual, plays the girl who has multiple men falling in love with her, despite the fact she is unattractive, dull and miserably self-obsessed. It all works out in the end of course. Even for the geeky boys, who, in John Hughes films, always find themselves suddenly, out of nowhere, desired by the most attractive girls in the school, just to make everything OK at the end. Absurd. Dull. Brainless. Forgettable. Why these films live on is beyond me. I can only assume nostalgic people are still viewing the films thorough their childhood eyes.",Pretty in Pink

I also loved the fact that you got to see some later on famous stars appear in this film like Kristy Swanson and Gina Gershon.  Neither really had any lines but they were in it.

It's set to the magnificent ""If You Leave"" a quintessential 1980s tune, by OMD. Without giving anything away here, as per the DVD special features, the original ending was re-shot when test audiences did not like the finale. They were dead right. Pretty in any color Ringwald portrays a teen-aged girl called Andie from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) living with her broken-down father (Harry Dean Stanton), whose wife ditched them. Andie tries to fit in with her high school peers, which includes a snooty rich dude (James Spader), his also well-to-do friend (McCarthy), who is taken by the engaging Ringwald. Cryer, as ""Duckie"" is smitten with Ringwald, and is also on the poor side. Annie Potts is wacky and fun as a record-store owner, while Cryer shines in a lip-sync act in the store. What scene that I didn't expect and is a true highlight is when Blane asks Andie to the prom after a difficult first date and she plants a big kiss on him and it was amazing; very last scene in car parking lot will still warm your heart. This was written by John Hughes and could be his best film, direction by Howard Deutch is wonderful, musical score couldn't be better, all the leads extraordinary, especially Ringwald. She cites this as her favorite of her films, and can be assured of her place in Hollywood as THE icon of the teen 1980s.",Pretty in Pink

They made the movie come alive.The plot is fairly well re-tread story, told many times since the dawn of mankind. The story relates to a class struggle between the rich and the poor and much like Romeo and Juliet, or Pride and Prejudice, we have two people trying to bridge the gap. We see the difficulties with trying to do that.Finally we get the ending, that audiences picked, but the writer, John Hughes did not intend. They way it was filmed, it looks very contrived and needed a lot more thought in the way it was written. It would be the ending I would pick, but not the way they wrote and filmed it.John Cryer cuts loose with some pretty good performances throughout the movie, and Molly, is very pretty and appears as the perfect role model for her time. We know that her character will not make a choice that is not popular with audiences.The music is very 80s, with three New Order songs, all very synthesized techno-pop and from the portion of these songs that is in the movie, they sound like instrumentals. As it stands, they are not bad songs, but, New Order has much better sounding music. There is a decent Title Theme, played twice in the movie. However, there is an overplayed song at the ending (If You Leave) which just goes on and on and on, endlessly until finally the movie ends.",Pretty in Pink

It's considered a classic by most teens of that age, and even still be many teens today. And after watching it, I have to say it definitely deserves to be.This is a great movie. A story about a poor girl who falls for the rich hunk who's crushing on her, only to be caught between a feud of sorts because of the two sides (rich, poor) disagreeing with the relationship. It doesn't help that her best friend is in love with her too. The film's touching and funny story, superb cast, and great message are all wonderful. John Hughes does an excellent job of creating a film that will last forever as a classic example of American film-making. He owes a lot to his pitch-perfect cast. Molly Ringwald is perfectly believable and understandable in the lead role of Andie. Andrew McCarthy and Annie Potts are good too in the role of the love-struck hunk and Andie co-worker/friend, respectively. But it's Jon Cryer as Andie's best friend Duckie who steals the show completely. Could he be any more adorable??? His character is spot-on, and though I'm sure he wasn't even considered, I really thought his performance was Oscar-Worthy. He leaves a long-lasting impression, even after the screen is black. Really, the only problem with this movie is it's less-than-perfect ending. But really, it only goes to show the real message of the movie: Love isn't perfect. And it only makes you adore Duckie more, which is half of what makes the movie so fantastic. Truly, a great piece of work- A true classic. Watch it! 8/10 stars!!!Jay Addison",Pretty in Pink

68,sunchick116-872-583383,better late than never!,9,5 August 2017,"I was born in December 1985 so for me to see this movie when it came out was impossible. i finally got around to it though, 31 years later, and was so delighted. it's such a lovely romantic movie, told from a different perspective than we're used to. nowadays, we're used to the 'popular girl meets nerdy girl' cliché, but 'pretty in pink' started it. this probably won't be very feminist of me, but I always feel for the male characters in these films. they're torn between their hearts and who they want to be with (in this case, Blaine and andie) and their heads, whether they have to weigh social status, what friends will say, etc. Everyone keeps saying Ducky is their favorite part of this movie. I disagree. he was an awful, awful friend, clouded by his jealousy. Iona was the truly supportive, helpful one. I was so pleased to read the ending was re-shot, because a) ducky did not deserve andie and B) it gave Blaine a chance to redeem himself. i think what a lot of people forget about this film is that these are teenage characters. their hormones are a mess, and they're impressionable. i can't blame Blaine for worrying about his social status when his prick best friend threatens it. the important thing is he finally stands up for himself in the end, and that shows he has the biggest character growth of everyone. I did have a major issue with the story though-we go from a scene where andie and Blaine are being lovey dove and everything's great, to Blaine ignoring her. obviously, by the end of the film, we understand stef and everyone else got to him, but there's a major flaw in the writing that doesn't show how we got from point A to point B. there was something missing there, so for that alone, i took away a point. overall, the near perfect film for a romantic like me!",Pretty in Pink

70,twhiteson,How one character can ruin a movie.,6,7 August 2020,"""Pretty In Pink"" features a winning lead performance, but it's undermined by an awful supporting character that caused the film to be a muddle.The plot: in a socially divided high school, pretty but poor girl ""Andie"" (Molly Ringwald) falls for rich boy ""Blane"" (Andrew McCarthy) much to the consternation of her best friend ""Duckie"" (Jon Cryer) who wants to be more than just friends. Blane asks Andie to the prom. Andie is over-the-moon and Duckie is crestfallen. However, Blane gets cold-feet when his snake-in-the-grass ""friend,"" ""Steff"" (James Spader), tells him that Andie's low income status makes her an unfit girlfriend, but in reality he's just jealous because Andie rejected him. Spineless Blane wilts under the pressure and jilts Andie. Heartbroken yet defiant, she attends the prom by herself in a homemade pink dress.There she's met by her true Prince Charming and one whom she should have recognized as such long ago- Duckie. They join hands on the dance floor and kiss passionately turning their platonic relationship into a romantic one as OMD's ""If You Leave"" plays while the credits roll.Wait. That's not how ""Pretty in Pink"" ends! Well, that's how it was intended to end and how it was initially filmed. Yet, preview audiences hated that ending. They just could not abide Andie ending-up with Duckie. Panicked the studio ordered a redo of the ending. So, it was reshot on the fly with Andrew McCarthy wearing a wig because he had cut-off his ""Blane"" hairdo for another role. So, Blane quickly apologizes for being a gutless weasel, Andie quickly and inexplicably accepts that apology, and Duckie is quickly kicked into the friendzone presumably for good. That slap-dash ending just makes a muddle of the entire film, but still it's better than Andie ending-up with Duckie.What went wrong? Well, the character of Duckie went wrong. Poorly written, directed and acted. It was intended for the audience to go: ""Oh, poor Duckie! He's just so sweet, funny, and quirky. He's so nice to Andie and loves her so much. How could she not know?"" Yet, that's not how it worked in execution. Instead Duckie comes across as an obnoxious dweeb and one of the most of irritating and annoying in film history. An example: Duckie's extended lip-sync and dance sequence to Otis Reading's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" was supposed to make him endearing, but what audiences really wanted to do was to hit him with a shovel to make him stop that cringe-embarrassing scene. And when Duckie doesn't act like an obnoxious dweeb? Then he's a petulant jerk- a seething ball of envy and resentment who can't stand to see a friend happy if it doesn't involve him. He's Steff except without the Miami Vice wardrobe and James Spader's sneer. In 21st century parlance, Duckie is a ""Nice Guy."" Like many so-called ""Nice Guys,"" he isn't very nice. The creators failed to understand that just because Duckie was ""nice"" didn't mean he was entitled to Andie's romantic affections. That's why the character failed so miserably and why the original ending didn't work.As annoying and awful as Duckie is, ""Pretty in Pink"" does have some commendable stuff. First is Molly Ringwald. For a few years in the mid-80's, Miss Ringwald was America's sweetheart and this movie made at the pinnacle of that popularity shows why. Her Andie is endearing and quite fetching. The film features nice performances by Harry Dean Stanton as Andie's heartbroken dad and Annie Potts as her oh-so-quirky-but-oh-so-gorgeous boss. Also, James Spader was typecast for years as unctuous, back-stabbing creeps because of his memorable performance in this film. Plus, the whole 80's vibe of the film is quite nostalgic- ex: Andie works in a record shop!Writer John Hughes was apparently chastened by how ""Pretty in Pink"" had to do a reshoot. So, when he remade ""Pretty in Pink"" as ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" a year later, he made sure that the female version of Duckie in that film (Mary Stuart Masterson's character) wasn't so obnoxious that audiences would be repelled by her getting with her friend (Eric Stoltz in the Andie role) at film's end. Thus, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" retains the ending that was intended for ""Pretty in Pink.""",Pretty in Pink

We have Molly Ringwald as a lower class girl in love with a ""richie"", Andrew McCarthy. Although this romance is cliche' there's a certain charm to it and it works. It appears somewhat of fresh in a scenerio we see here in this film for 100th time. Ducky however, although a sincere character, was annoying in some parts. But I did feel sympathy for the guy when he loses his best friend and secret crush to Blaine. I thought, personally the most interesting character in this film, was James Spader's Steff. He plays Blaine's best friend (rather well), who appears to disapprove of Blaine's choice in women. Although he looked a little old for the part, I thought his character had some intrigue and some interesting sides to him. He wasn't your typical bad guy. He had some depth (guised as a sexual motive for persuing Andie and I'll keep it at that) under his cool and selfish demeanor. But this small spark of interest for her twists to jealousy and it is finally snuffed out by his rejection from Andie. His revenge is almost complete when he nearly talks Blaine out of continuing his realationship with her. But Blaine quickly pulls his head out and realizes what he's got. But even in the end it seems that Steff still wants her, when she enters the prom in all her pink polka-dotted, 80's glory. Interesting characters in an old formula that works.",Pretty in Pink
73,fatcat-73450,Unexpectedly Turns out to be a Story about Males,6,27 October 2021,"While many societies have had all-but-codified rigid social hierarchies where someone from high social strata would not consider having anything but the most shoal of interactions with people of other ""tribes"" or ""social levels,"" (Victorian society was especially infamous for this) let us not forget that most humans today have varying bits here and there of pre-modern human ancestry.Therefore, it's a story as old as humanity itself - two people from opposite sides of the tracks are romantically interested in each other. That's not really what this movie is about, though.Indeed, Molly Ringwald does here play a fairly poor girl being raised by her chronically unemployed single father. She's poor and a bit quirky (makes her own clothes and has some friends from gaudy subcultures).A rich guy takes an interest in her and she reciprocates it, but his rich friends don't approve of her. This becomes a problem for him and he finds it so hard to deal with the social pressure that he falters and disappoints her.Yet there is no extreme difference in their situations. They go to the same school, live in the same city, and have no big problems partaking in the same social events after all. Her friend, ""Duckie"" is the real poor boy here, who, because of his strange personality is excluded from many activities and barely seen as worthy of note by the other characters.On the other hand, she has a strange and very close friendship with an eccentric boy (Duckie) who is openly obsessed with her. She doesn't seem to mind, though, and keeps him as a sort of annoying pet.Oddly, despite the title, this is a story about men. Our main protagonist doesn't change or grow throughout the film but the males around her either change as a result of their interactions with her or are able to showcase their personalities by being near her.Her dad is a nice guy who's having a hard time being a good single father. James Spader plays the usual sleazy rich character he's been typecast for with all the corresponding bad traits on ostentatious display. Duckie learns to let go and put up more of a fight against the society that's stacked against him; in a similar fashion, Blane learns what it means to hold fast to your values even under pressure.To be sure, Molly comes to dislike the world of pomp and wealth she initially admires, but it's not strongly developed either way.Good acting from the main characters, but the story is predictable and most characters are just stereotypes. If you like 80s fashion and culture it's a classic of the era.Honourable Mentions: Breakfast Club (1985).

76,Wwmbrd,A rare miss from John Hughes,4,20 September 2021,"Pretty In Pink is one of those films where, as an audience member, you feel a sense of ambivalence about what you're seeing, but within the bounds of reality. On some level, watching the emotional girlfriend boyfriend crush drama speaks to the inner 17 year old in everyone who actually attended high school. Conversely, the idea that Molly Ringwald is actually this poor girl engaging in some petty tier class warfare and bullying is a stretch. She adheres to the same stuck up attitude in every John Hughes era film, and this is no different. Her wardrobe in the film is source of ridicule from her preppier peers, but in today's world, she would be a hipster guy's (obscure) wet dream. To hammer home her relative lack of coin among the bourgeois Los Angeles youth, we see that she drives a 20 year old, beat up VW Karmann Ghia (which, truthfully was a collector car even then) and lives in a house (a house in a ritzy part of LA, mind you, not an apartment) with worn and old furniture. That's... About it. The shtick wears off about 30 minutes into the movie, and if it weren't for the verbal reminder every 10 minutes about the socioeconomic status of the characters, it never would have mattered. Of course, they want to paint this Romeo and Juliet type picture of the poor girl and her rich, sensitive boy, but it's all a beige backdrop onto which a single spot of white paint was spilled.The dialogue in the film is honestly the only bright spot in an otherwise by-the-numbers teen angst dramedy, and certainly is the weakest of the John Hughes films (though he wrote, and did not direct this. Jon Cryer gives his performance as Duckie everything he's got, channeling his inner Travolta and Ferris Bueller with all the charisma he could muster. He certainly had the best dialogue, even if he gets the worst ending. Annie Potts as Iona is the other brightest spot in the cast, as the Goth record store owner with a habit of dating bad men (who, somehow, despite her no efforts, isn't able to give good advice to Ringwald's Andie). She's quirky and funny in a way that the movie needed a lot more of to drown out a no score in the 14th inning baseball game level dreariness of the rest of the cast. James Spader is completely wasted, and Andrew McCarthy comes off as a moron, not a playboy trust fund kid with a sensitive side.The movie has its moments, but the plot it a bit tired, with no wrinkles of substance except for what seems like a disappointment of a twist ending where the girl ends up with the wrong guy, although she and he seem totally happy with it.

I see a lot of people calling this film cliché. not sure if it was cliché for 1985 but definitely it's cliché for 2015. interestingly enough, this seems to be one of the few films where the 'rich person falls in love with poor person' formula doesn't work. it works in 'titanic', 'a walk to remember', 'the notebook', which makes me wonder what people would think of this movie if it came out nowadays. anyway, on to the actual movie. i actually thought it was really charming and sweet. because i was a floater in high school (hung out with everyone) i could relate to the potential disaster that could be one social group dating another. the thing i can't believe is how people crucify Blaine for how he handled it. he was a TEENAGER. he wanted to fit in and belong as much as Andie. he was scared. It's a shame more people aren't sympathetic to him. better late than never i say and when he finally does tell his best friend, i was proud of him, and i was proud of Andie for forgiving him and taking him back because it was a mature thing to do and i think that's a great, positive message to teens. we're not above making mistakes and we can't hold people on pedastals.",Pretty in Pink
78,sublime501,A cute love story spoiled by a slightly disappointing ending.,7,20 June 2004,"PRETTY IN PINK is the tale of an original, but slightly outcast, girl named Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) who is from the poorer part of her town. She never minded this until one day when the rich, ""preppy"" Blane McDonnagh (Andrew McCarthy) asks her if she'd like to go out sometime. All of Blane's rich preppy friends immediately disapprove, and Andie gets caught in the middle when her own best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer) disapproves as well. Andie decides to go out with Blane anyway, although their first date ends up being somewhat of a disaster. Blane takes Andie to his friend Steff's (James Spader) house party, where nearly everyone snubs her, and Andie is embarrassed to let Blane see where she lives and what kind of house it is. In the end, Andie has to decide whether pursuing potential love is worth the humiliation she receives from everyone else for doing so.PRETTY IN PINK is the last of the three famous Molly Ringwald-John Hughes collaborations, and is also the least favorable, in my opinion. Which is not to say that it's not a good movie, though. While its two predecessors dealt more with status and popularity issues, this movie deals with a more serious topic of class differences. However, I find this to be a pretty unrealistic scenario by today's standards and not very easy to relate to, in my case at least. However, the whole concept of two lovers dating despite their differences and everyone else's disapproval is pretty cool and receives my commendation. The ending, though, is a bit of a disappointment.What I really commend the movie on, however, is its portrayal of what love is really like. It manages to show just how beautiful it can be at times, and just how destructive it is most of the time. Having experienced something similar to Andie's struggle, I have to say that that feature of the movie made it a lot more personable and relatable for me, taking on a deeper meaning than it probably would for others who haven't experienced such a battle.As far as technical aspects go... well, what can you say. The acting is terrific, namely from the always-great Molly Ringwald and the spectacularly wacky Jon Cryer as the film's most memorable character by far, Duckie. Jon Cryer easily delivers the film's best performance, along with most of its best lines. Annie Potts is also wonderful and funny as Andie's coworker Iona. John Hughes was a great director, even though his area of expertise was '80s teen movies--but, let's face it, no one could have done them better.To wrap it up, PRETTY IN PINK is a cute love story with fantastic acting and characters that manages to capture a bit of the true essence of love, even if it is a bit disappointing in the end. 7/10.",Pretty in Pink
79,davidallenxyz,Messy teen romance - just the way we like it.,6,13 January 2002,"'Tis oft said that the older John Hughes gets, the younger his leading characters become.  And it's equally oft said that his teen movies as writer or director - for example, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, or The Breakfast Club - are far superior to his later ""cute kid"" movies (Home Alone, Curly Sue). Pretty in Pink is firmly in the former camp.  Eighties cinema's leading ginger actress, Molly Ringwald, plays a teen ""freak"", who falls for one of the ""richies"" (Andrew McCarthy), who's circle consists of guys who wear pale linen jackets, and drive BMW's.  Obviously, love from the opposite sides of the tracks has a few problems, not least the prejudices of the protagonists' friends.  The slushy moments that ensue are enough to warm the cockles of anyone's heart, even if they wouldn't like to admit it.  Highlights include James Spader, one of the most sinister performers around, as a particularly unpleasant posh boy, and the eighties soundtrack - including the cracking song by the Psychedelic Furs which gives the film it's name.  Lowlights are, well, Jon Cryer's performance as Molly Ringwald's childhood friend ""Duckie"". If ever a lad needed a solid thump, it's him.So while not on a par with Ferris Bueller's..., the Breakfast Club, or Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink will leave you wishing you were at school again (but without the homework and the skin complaints).",Pretty in Pink

81,evancyl,Among the best teen rom-coms - well-played out themes and thoughtful portrayal of non-romantic relationships,8,29 September 2014,"As someone who went through her teenage years in the new millennium, Pretty in Pink provided a glimpse of what it was like being a teen in the '80s and yet was a movie I could identify with. It was about a working class girl (and scholarship recipient) Andie who attends an elite high school. The dividing lines between rich and poor are clearly drawn, with the two groups hanging out in different parts of the school compound and excluding each other from their social events. So when Andie starts dating Blane, a rich preppy boy who despite his background is ""not like the others"", the couple face opposition from their friends, not least Duckie, Andie's best friend who's had a crush on her for years. While he too is a rich kid, he is ostracised by them for his dorky ways. While the themes of overcoming social barriers and girl-chooses-between- her-crush-and-best-friend have been portrayed numerous times in books and films (be it singly or in combination), this is one of the few that struck a chord - great acting, likable and realistic characters, excellent script. While the ending surprised me, I wholeheartedly approve of it.I also really liked this movie for its portrayal of non-romantic relationships. The movie is titled 'Pretty in Pink' because the climax takes place at senior prom, where Andie shows up in a pink dress which she designed and sewed from pieces given to her by two important people in her life. The first is her manager from the music store she works at part-time, Iona, an older sister figure to Andie through the ups and downs of the relationship. Then there's her dad, who despite his failings as a provider, is loving and supportive. To me, these scenes were important as they enabled us to see Andie as a complete person, to see that she's so much more than the object of affection of two boys. The only thing that marred my enjoyment was how ugly and unflattering the pink prom dress turned out! Other than that, I think Pretty in Pink is one of the best of its genre (teenage rom-com)!

When Pretty In Pink came out, I remember being disappointed. Compared to the brave, emotional Breakfast Club, or the just plain larky Ferris Bueller, or even the slightly grittier Some Kind of Wonderful (which was just another version of PIP), Pretty seemed a bit gooey and twee and happy and weedy. And her dress, even at the time, was absolutely hideous and looked better even before she cut it up - something I never thought she had any right to do.But anyway, the years have not been completely kind to all the Brat Pack Hughes teen films. The intensity of the Breakfast Club, while still adorable, does look a little foolish and over-earnest. Ferris's japes and glib richness seem a little smug, and his waistcoat is silly looking. Weird Science is just awful, isn't it? But when you watch the new bunch of teen movies that ape Hughes' best - like She's All That, or even Ten Things I Hate - they seem a little toothless and artificial compared to Pretty in Pink. They're overflowing with cute performances and quickish wit, and nice one-liners, and carefully planned soundtracks... but they don't seem to have the heart that this movie has. And it has a genuine edge to it - the girls who bully Andie, and the dependably nasty James Spader turn all help to give Pretty a hardness that makes its romance seem all the more real.

But sometimes, a movie is so bad that it becomes funny. Is Pretty in Pink a movie like that? In my opinion, no, it's definitely not. If you want to watch a 80's movie, or just a teen movie, don't rent this.""Pretty in Pink"" is full of every stereotypes that you see in the worst teen movies available. The stereotype of the poor original girl falling in love with a popular boy and ending up looking beautiful at the prom is a stereotype that you'll find in several other movies. Okay, stereotypes can sometimes be entertaining even though they're just plain stupid. But a lot of elements of the plot in ""Pretty in pink"" are just questionable.By example, the fact that the main character ends up with the rich popular boy instead of the childhood friend who's in love with her might deceive a lot of people. It's not a ""bad"" ending or a ""good"" ending. If she had ended up with the other boy, it might have been cliché as well. However, there's always a way to make something not seem so cliché. By example, in Rushmore, the main character.. ends up with the girl he's supposed to end up with, but you don't feel like complaining after watching that movie.I don't think an in-depth analysis of ""Pretty in Pink"" is useful, because it's not a very serious movie, and there's no need to take it seriously, but it's definitely not tasteful.",Pretty in Pink

Predictable script, slushy but tempered by humour and quality acting.Don't really go for Molly Ringwald that much - a bit whey-faced and pathetic for me - but just check out Annie Potts!. She and Jon Cryer just are this film! How Molly Ringwwald could have chosen Andrew McCarthy's wormy 'Blane' over the Duck Man is a mystery to me. Stars of the film for me, though, are James Spader and his obnoxious girlfriend, Betty. If he was any more jaded and laid back, he'd be unconscious! If she was any more stupid, she'd be a vegetable! Mind you, on a 'schwing' scale of 1 to 10, Annie Potts' 'Iona' is an 11 for me! Also, check out Harry Dean Stanton as Dad. One of my favourite 'B' movie actors alongside Charles Napier, Jack Elam and Lance Henriksen.

Yet, Hughes brings an emotional rhythm and vulnerability to this film that raises it to iconic status. Ringwald doesn't appear to be the type that would win the hearts of three different men with her unflattering old lady clothes (though I do love the use of pink and her choice of accessories) but her character Andie has a resilient spirit and inner beauty that outshines many of her peers . Duckie is fantastic comic relief and very quotable but also heartbreaking as he endures the coming of age trial of unreturned love and irresponsible dependency. Blaine has a very relatable character arc as he is forced to navigate the choice of peer and family approval versus the bravery of standing by what his heart knows is right.

It is not the references to records, slang or the clothes that date it. Instead the intangible style and attitude possessed by the characters ages the movie.On a more personal level, what makes me want to throttle this film is the is the creation of high school as the summit of life. Around this perceived pinnacle swirls ""adult"" conversations of understandings of life, and particularly love. I watch and cannot help to snicker at the thought that anyone would take Andie and Jack's or Andie and Iona's delving into these matters seriously. Perhaps the most realistic view of high school romance and love held in the film, as morally despicable as it is, is by Steff.

91,MIamiReviewer,Lightweight and a real stinker,4,29 February 2016,"To preface: I love high school movies, feel-good movies, lightweight fluffers, and have a soft spot for several John Hughes movies.But on the 30th anniversary of this one, I was inspired to add my two cents - because apparently I am alone in my unbounded hatred for Pretty in Pink.Problem #1: every character in this movie is unlikeable. Andie is whiny, pouty, and while she's going for the ""quirky"" thing, her droning on and on about being an outsider is insufferable. Blane is obviously a jerk who has little going for him other than his computer skills. He certainly lacks a backbone. He also lacks a personality or any interests. Duckie is grating, obsessive, and like a bad case of eczema that you keep needing to scratch but it never goes away. All three of these main characters are superficial tropes of stereotypes. Yeah, sure, stereotypes are Hughes' forte (see The Breakfast Club, e.g.) but the stereotype thing doesn't work as well when they are all loathsome.Problem #2: And this is my biggest problem with the movie. Andie and Blane's relationship is devoid of any relationship. There is no real relationship here on which to build a romantic plot line. Their interactions are fleeting and, to the extent they have any real conversation, it is almost entirely Andie going on and on about how much she hates the preppie kids. They first interaction is by 80s computer - no real conversation. Blane stalks her in the record store. Not much real conversation. They go on a date and spend literally the whole date with Andie freaking out about his rich friends. She is petulant and unbearable. And every time I watch this movie, I cringe in wonderment that Blane ends the date emphatically telling her he really likes her and wants to make their relationship work. Based on what?? It makes absolutely no sense. If I recall, they hang out once or twice more - but certainly not at school. And then he bails on her. And then we're supposed to believe at the end that it was true love and they just didn't ""believe"" enough? Arghhh! Problem #3: Andie and Duckie. Everyone knows the story was originally written with Duckie getting Andie. Lots of commenters on here complain that it should have gone that direction. I say ""ick"". First, this movie was a different era, but if that character was written in 2016, he would have been the non-threatening gay best friend. He so lacks any charming sexual tension with Andie that it's impossible and almost gross to imagine them as a couple. Further, see above comments about how astoundingly annoying he is. Creepy, stalkerish, obsessive, interfering and rude. The only reason he belongs with Andie at the end is because they're both so unlikeable together.Problem #4: The dress. The dress. Why did she have to take that beautiful specimen of a 1950s prom, so perfect in its shape and features, and turn it into an unflattering potato sack? My mom used to give me old scraps of fabric to craft with when I was a little kid. With a pair of scissors and glue, we used to make Barbie dress sacks pretty much the same as Andie's dress. Horrible.I watch this movie about once a year because I'm a sucker. And every time, I spend the whole thing cringing and annoyed with this clunker.",Pretty in Pink
92,ivanas14,Are you serious?,1,27 July 2020,"Why is this movie ''classic''? Boring naive predictable story, bad actors, (except John Cryer, his scenes were only kinda worth watching), it's hillariously bad! Lead character is annoying whinny and nagging average looking girl, all I think that Ducky is lucky to escape from her! Prom dress is hideous, destroyed by ''fashion genius'' Andie lol!",Pretty in Pink
93,japongt,Watched this thanks to Ready Player Two,7,31 January 2021,"And now that I know Robert Downey Jr should've played Duckie's role and Andie should've ended up with Duckie, I can't help but feel disappointed. Still a good movie so I gave it a 7, but it could've been a 9 or even a 10 had the original story remained.",Pretty in Pink
94,C-Diggety-Dawg,Nostalgia only,6,31 March 2021,"I feel a zillion years old when I say this, but man this plot is problematic when I watch as someone about to enter their vintage years...She definitely picked the wrong guy in the end and oh lord that shapeless pink sack she wore in the end was unforgivable.Still, I can't deny I have a soft spot for 80s nostalgia movies and this one is a total time capsule.Watch for the music and the decent performances of some of the supporting characters.",Pretty in Pink
95,Cress,A girl from the wrong side of the tracks and her complicated life,10,2 December 1998,"This movie set in the mid 80s era of brat-pack movies is a unique shining star. Molly Ringwald is Andie a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who has romantic interests from both sides of the spectrum; Duckie (Jon Cryer) who's puppy dog love for her is both sweet and endearing to watch, and Blane (Andrew McCarthy) the rich guy who has everything going for him. What follows is Andie having to deal with this, the bitchy cheerleader type girls at school, her loving but dishonest father (An excellent Harry Dean Stanton) and through all this will she get an invitation to the prom? This is a great film with both Blane and Andie having to deal with their friends disagreeing with their relationship. Steff (James Spader at one of his very best) Blane's best friend, who tries to make Blane decide between Andie and himself when really he just wants a finger in the pie. Annie Potts as Iona, Andie's quirky older best friend is excellent and her weird and orginal costume changes throughout the movie are a high-point. This is an emotionally raw film a rarity at the time it was made. If you ask me this should have swept the Oscar nominations with Molly Ringwald getting Best Actress, but hey regardless of the miss of Oscars, watch this, it is a powerful film and a great piece of film making",Pretty in Pink
96,sluido,"Lame, Jon Cryer is annoying",5,9 February 2021,"I generally like the John Hughes stories and this one didn't seem much different at first. It's all cute and harmless, very 80s, totally unrealistic to how the real world is like, watchable and I can see how it's sort of popular. BUTYeah, well, I am not a fan of Ringwall. I think she's totally overrated and while I liked her in Breakfast Club she doesn't fit the role in this movie. Worst, Jon Cryer plays the most annoying character in what must be all of John Hughes movies.",Pretty in Pink
97,formatt2007,Viewed it 30 years later and still relevant,9,15 January 2021,"There are many themes in this well written, well-acted movie. Seeing it again in my adult years, a new perspective emerged. The men in Andie's life consist of her dad, her friend Duckie, and a school friend, Blane. Duckie and her dad can't seem to take responsibility for their behaviour, nor their own happiness. Duckie says to Andie, ""I'm not particularly concerned with whether or not you like me, because I live to like you ."" He holds Andie responsible for his happiness and plays the victim.Blane is willing to walk with Andie through the minefields of their respective social peers. He shoulders responsibility and tries to clear the way for a solid relationship with Andie. He cracks under that weight. Later he tells Andie ""I believed in you, I always believed in you. It was you who didn't believe in me."" That's when Duckie realizes Blane is the better man. What will Duckie do about that?",Pretty in Pink
98,Radiant_Rose,Wear pink even if it doesn't suit you,8,28 September 2007,"In reply to two of the most frequent IMDb topics on this film.1 Yes, I think Andie's prom dress looks hideous. It isn't because pink clashes with her red hair. I think it's brave of her to wear a colour she likes regardless. But the shape is horrid.2 Given the choice, I would go for Steff. He is the best looking of Andie's options. But only if I could gag him or get him to drug himself so he wouldn't be able to say horrid things to me. If it's a question of personality, Andie should go for Iona. She is just as loyal as Duckie, but less clingy and with an adventurous sense of style (mostly).",Pretty in Pink
99,TheRagingBull94,"Even Though He Didn't Direct It, Pretty In Pink Is Equal In Poignance To John Hughes' Other Classic Films",9,23 September 2011,"I don't think that this film is quite on equal grounds with what I consider to be the two best John Hughes films (The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off), but as far as teen films go Pretty in Pink exemplifies utmost brilliance that makes it necessary viewing for fans of John Hughes, teen films and 80s cinema in general. On top of that, the film also has a few distinctive qualities that are all worth discussion.The film's story focuses on a lower class teenage girl named Andie who isn't one of the most popular girls in school. She's constantly accompanied by a childhood friend named Duckie who secretly has a crush on her who offers the basic friendly comforts as well as the commonly associated annoyances. She also spends time working at a record shop with her friend, Iona. Shortly into the film she grows an attraction to an upper class boy named Blane and begins dating him, but the real issues involved are whether or not the difference in social classes as well as the presence of both Duckie and Blane will be a problem.The story isn't outstanding by any means, but it isn't the main source of appeal. Mainly I feel that that is rooted in the great performances, exploration of class differences, and the great humour. Molly Ringwald, a teen film regular delivers a great performance that certainly equals her role in The Breakfast Club. You get to see the basic clichéd struggles of a teenage girl, but the film luckily understands that basing drama off of this is not enough. It's great to see the writers made her mother absent, made her father unemployed and gave a decent portrayal of living in a lower social class and being unpopular as well as the associated consequences.I think Annie Potts and Andrew McCarthy give solid performances, but one performance I really like especially is Jon Cryer as Duckie. He seems to remind me of Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day Off despite his nerdy qualities. I think he's the funniest character in the movie, take note of the scene in which he is pushed into the girl's bathroom at school.I may be really off on this next statement, but I feel as though the movie has Marxist undertones. The fact that the film deals with the issues of living in a lower social class and negatively portrays the characters who live in the upper class (Take note of Blane's friends. They're jerks). On top of that, I feel as though this was reinforced by the scene in which Andie and Duckie were discussing the Russian revolution during a study session. Maybe this wasn't intentional, but I can't help but draw the connections. Either way, it doesn't really hurt the movie and in some cases it could even be useful.While some of the issues encountered do appear to be meaningless such as the High School Prom or getting people in other school groups to like you, you have to remember that this is a teen film and it is required to portray these social aspects in a way that can appeal to younger audiences. Luckily though, the filmmakers have made it entertaining for all age groups (or so I've heard). One thing I'd also like to note is the ending. While you can predict the possible endings, I'm really glad they went with the one that seemed the least likely.Pretty In Pink is a wonderful movie. It may not have been directed by the late and legendary John Hughes, but it's so identical to his other films in style it might as well have been. Director Howard Deutch should be commended for replicating this style of teen filmmaking. Pretty In Pink receives a very high recommendation from me. Rest in peace, John Hughes and thank you for writing this great film.9/10",Pretty in Pink
100,wkallao,Molly Ringwald's Best Film,8,3 March 2018,"Molly Ringwald was without a doubt an icon, queen and legend of 80s films. She was in so many notable and culturally significant films, and this one is without a doubt her best work.You might expect this film to be of the comedic likes of Sixteen Candles, but it is anything but. With tinges of comedic aspects scattered throughout, the film takes a more dramatic and serious tone. Molly lives a poor life with her father who is unable to keep a job, and her mother left three years ago. We take a dive into her home life and her sweet relationship with her father, and the toll her mother's absence has taken on the family.This story is truly about ""for richer or for poorer"" as Molly becomes entangled with Andrew McCarthy, a rich kid at school. The plot follows her being ashamed of her financial status, and Andrew's friends taunting him for stooping down to date a poor girl.The story is truly one that will make your heart melt. However, we come to an ending that is as predictable as one could be. A cinematic kiss as the credits roll. Obviously this is to be expected for the ending of a film like THIS, but it's the exact same ending as Sixteen Candles. Save the ending, the film is truly a work of art.",Pretty in Pink

It better than what I remember as the 15 year old me thought it was just okay. Watching it all these years later, I really appreciated the simplicity of the wrong side of town message in the film and the honest way it was portrayed. Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy give brilliant performances as the leads. Annie Potts and Jon Cryer as Duckie are marvelous in supporting roles. James Spader plays his part to perfection as Blane's rich snob friend. His character Steff oozes sleeze and is reprehensible - exactly what was needed and a masterful 80s performance. Even Andrew Dice Clay makes an appearance and manages not to mess up things. It's a quick, easy film that has aged gracefully.",Pretty in Pink

So it was that almost 20 years after first seeing it I sat down to relive those 80's memories and reflect on the time in between. It is billed as a comedy but it's not exactly a side splitter. Romance, OK boy meets girl, boy loses girl due to peer pressure, boy gets girl back by admitting his mistake - standard formula. What I do love about this movie though is the soundtrack - there are some classic 80's tracks here :o) This is one of those movies where I'd love to see the alternative ending where Ducky gets the girl. As I sat through all Ducky's failed advances it reminded me of a recent 'chase' of mine. Seems I'm destined to always be a Ducky! P.S.

I enjoy the work of all of the actors, but frequently found myself looking for the kind of moments and engaging characters I found in Sixteen Candles, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, the Last American Virgin, etc. Perhaps I am mistaking the film as one that fits in that category, but humor should be a greater part of the storyline. The film seemed slow to me, and just didn't have the memorable bits that really make a film a classic. I just wish it weren't so. I did enjoy Molly and Harry Dean, but that didn't carry the day for me. I would have liked to have seen a more memorable sound track as well.",Pretty in Pink

I have now changed my mind about that but I still rate this as a must see film for all those of you who like to delve into a little 80's teen fantasy. One thing I didn't know until recently was as soon as filming had finished for Pretty in Pink, Andrew McCarthy was signed on to play the lead in Less Than Zero and, at the last moment, John Hughes decided he wanted to change the ending of Pretty in Pink to what it is now, but Andrew had already shaved his head for his next role and lost a lot of weight. To solve this problem, Mr. Hughes had him don a wig for the last scene of Pretty in Pink. So that explains the weird hair and gaunt face.If you like this film then you must watch Weird Science, 16 Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Breakfast Club and top it off with the more current Not Another Teen Movie.",Pretty in Pink
109,pessimistic_girl,Very confusing... and a bit frustrating too,8,14 July 2002,"Ok for starters I would just like to break down the summary on the back of my video. SPOILER WARNING:""He's a rich heartthrob and she's a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks...""POOR?! POOR!? She lives in a HOUSE, they have TWO cars and a dog (a big one at that) and still she's poor? Then what am I, living in an apartment, no car and a little cat? Sounds to me like I might as well be on the streets.""...they face the peer pressure...""HUH? There were only TWO people that had any real objections to Blane and Andie and those were; Steff (who was mad Andie wouldn't date him) and Duckie (who was also mad Andie wouldn't date him). Other than that I don't see what peer pressure they're talking about. Betty? She didn't like Andie anyway, and from the looks of it she was no friend of Blane's.But leaving these two facts aside the movie is pretty enjoyable, except for the pairing of Andie and Blane, but that's mostly because I do not think Andie deserves Blane, no way. And that's no being prejudice or anything it's that I'm no fan of Molly Ringwald and big fan of Andrew McCarthy.
Plus I don't think I even have to comment on the fact that Andie was so NOT pretty in pink. What was she wearing to the prom, a garbage bag?The real highlights of this movie are Steff (with Blane) and Duckie. Furthermore Steff seems to be the only one with a smidge of common sense. All in all maybe you have to be American to understand the whole 'peer pressure' 'poor' sorta thing but no matter how cliché this movie gets I still find myself watching it almost once a week. So it must've done something right.",Pretty in Pink
110,rosegirl,Duckie's your man,10,3 September 2002,"John Hughes is the quintessential teen movie king. No one does teen angst better than this tried and true director. Pretty in Pink is a definite classic and among my most-watched films of all time. I can probably recite the whole thing in my sleep. Watching it evokes great 80s nostalgia. I have always loved the music choices in this movie, including New Order, the title song ""Pretty in Pink"", and Otis Redding's tune Try a Little Tenderness, lip-synched to perfection by Duckie.I have to agree though with most reviewers here, that I have always felt robbed by the movie's ending. Blane...NO...Duckie...YES YES YES!!! I have always rooted for him...the most beloved underdog in all of film. Each time I watch the movie I get that familiar pang at the end...it's just not right, and I'm sorry to say, but I don't see what Andie could have ever seen in Blane. I, like many viewers, was never convinced that he was right for her.6/10...great teen classic and the score would be much higher if Hughes hadn't shortchanged us with an ending that belied the film's intended direction.",Pretty in Pink
111,zyzyha,I have mixed opinions of this film,8,23 May 2002,"(CONTAINS SPOILER) There are some things about Pretty In Pink that are very right and some that are very wrong.  I think overall it's an ok, fairly enjoyable teen movie but there are really special scenes, lines and characters (or should I say character) that make it more than that in parts, then there are some things which ruin it for me. There is one character that makes this movie for me and that is Duckie. Without him it would just be average. He's my all time favourite character in a movie ever. He's superbly played by Jon Cryer, incredibly funny and sometimes, like when Blane comes to pick Andie up in the record store, he makes me cry. Sometimes I just skip through the film and watch the scenes with Duckie in. Unfortunately the only  other character I can get interested about is Iona and possibly Steff.Which brings me to what's wrong with it. Like Blane for one. No matter how many times I watch it I can't seem to find his personality. Then there is the tragedy that is Andie's prom dress. But the biggest fault with the film (SPOILER ALERT) is the ending. How can she possibly choose Blane over Duckie? It just ruins the whole film for me. I agree with the person who said they hope a DVD is brought out with an alternative ending. It's just wrong. Duckie is a character you really care about and it seems the whole film is going in that direction and then it's such a let down at the end. I mean the boy's there for her always, he really cares about her and she chooses the dull, conventionally attractive rich kid. Surely the way to a happy ending is to make you care about the couple which frankly I don't in Blane and Andie's case. Ultimatly Pretty in Pink leaves me feeling let down and frankly, a bit miserable.",Pretty in Pink

Sure, it was a good movie for what it was, but it was mediocre for what I was anticipating.The soundtrack wasn't amazing and the script was a bit ho-hum for a John Hughes film.Jon Cryer and James Spader were really enthusiastic and entertaining in their roles, but they couldn't redeem this movie. Molly Ringwald wasn't bad, she just didn't do anything different. Andrew McCarthy was forgettable, which contributed to my mixed feelings about the film. I hated the ending (I suspect I'm not alone in this) and it significantly ruined the whole experience. I'm not saying that every movie should have an obligatory happy ending, it just felt unresolved.

116,weberwhit,"Standard Teen Plot, with Unique Class Focus",7,14 November 2005,"Pretty in Pink is the last and worst of John Hughes three most popular 80's teen flicks (Sixteen Candles is, in my opinion, the best). ""Worst"" is a relative term, however, because this is still a good movie. While the story is rather standard, the actors do such a good job of inhabiting their characters that it more than makes up for the many clichés. Andie is the poor alternative girl whose difficult upbringing has rendered her wise beyond her years. Blane is the preppy rich boy who, unlike his snooty, mean-spirited friends, is actually a decent person. The pair are attracted to one another and, after Blane eventually works up the courage to ask Andie out, embark on an often tortuous, though emotionally honest (especially on Andie's part),courtship. They struggle with disapproval of their friends (James Spader as Blane's best bud Steff is especially odious and Jon Cryer as Andie's guy pal Duckie is unforgettable) and their own lingering doubts. The rest of the movie deals with how the two face these struggles, culminating in an ending that is, frankly, a bit cheesy and predictable. Pretty in Pink is commendable for the simple fact that it deals so honestly with an issue that most Americans would rather avoid, class. Perhaps this is why it feels a bit darker than Hughes's other 2 big 80's films (although The Breakfast Club also deals somewhat with class, its focus is more on cliques and identity issues). Stories about how American teens navigated this treacherous class terrain in the ""greed decade,"" are few and far between. PIP should, therefore, hold a unique place in the ""teen movie"" canon. A good, but not great, film. I must comment on the soundtrack as well - in a word it is terrific. Echo and the Bunnymen, New Order, The Psychedelic Furs, and that Nik Kershaw one-hit wonder song ""Wouldn't it Be Good"" that reminds me so much of the 80's.",Pretty in Pink

Things have been different since Andie's mother left them, and all they have is each other. And, of course, Andie's best friend Duckie (Jon Cryer; Holy Man), who you can always count on for a laugh.Working in a music store with co-worker Iona (Annie Potts; Ghostbusters, Toy Story, ""Designing Women""), Andie meets Blane McDonough (Andrew McCarthy; Mannequin, St. Elmo's Fire), a kid from the rich area of town. To maintain a meaningful relationship, they must cross social boundaries and redefine their other personal relationships, including those with the rich and disdainful Steff McKee (James Spader; Stargate, Sex, Lies, and Videotape).A classic 80's movie, this film will appeal to those who loved movies like The Breakfast Club (starring Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, and Judd Nelson among others) and The Outsiders, starring Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, and Patrick Swayze among others.",Pretty in Pink
122,banana-hammock,Interesting and eye-opening concept for social alienation.,7,17 June 2014,"*SPOLIERS*Very interesting movie, I thought, as it really opened my eyes to the idea of poverty being a form of social alienation. The majority of teen romance/high school movies all tend to revolve around being cool and uncool but in this movie the characters financial situations greatly influence whether or not they are accepted into the various (two main) social groups. Very sweet movie as the main character, Andie, is torn between her friend, Duckie, whom she has know since she was a ""child"" and this new ""richie"" (financially privileged individual). It is had for all three involved as Duckie ""lives to love"" Andie and hence her relationship with rich kid Blaine is hard to accept for him along with the fact that Blaine's friendship group greatly look down upon theirs. Blaine's faces potential isolation from his friends as he risks going out with someone poor. TBH the movie should not have been called Pretty in Pink and i realize that there is meaning behind the colour and i know it was the 80's etc but i find the colour pink in the movie that visually repulsive and it was for me the only drawback of the film however I do understand the significance of it.",Pretty in Pink
123,Nicky-34,One Of The Best,10,15 June 1999,"This film is my personal favourite.  The film centres around two people from the wrong classes, Blane being rich and Andie being relatively poor.  And you can't forget Duckie who is infatuated with Andie.  Does this feel like schooldays? A film for people who have grown up with this movie is Fresh Horses which once again stars Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy all grown up but similar ideas of class problems. The soundtrack to this is well worth a listen as its captured the 80s nicely.",Pretty in Pink
124,c_whitefield@hotmail.com,James Spader...he's so cute,9,28 August 2006,"I love this film..can't help finding James Spader hugely attractive in those days. Lucky girl to have all these men fussing over her considering her unpopularity at school. The fashion is great and wacky, big difference between the working classes and the middle classes. The film is very realistic in that sense and you can still relate to the issues they deal with today. I loved what she did with those clothes, so original and unique. Makes you wanna wish you knew how to operate a sewing machine. The punky and funky mother figure is hilarious, bit of a shame that she ends up such a yuppie square at the end of the film. Ducky is a fun character, but you cannot help feeling for him when the Molly Ringwald character keeps rejecting him. Love hurts!",Pretty in Pink
125,Molly Ringwald,My Favorite Movie of All Time!,10,25 April 2003,"I love this movie. Let me tell you why. First off, the cast: Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy, Jon Cryer, James Spader, Annie Potts, etc all bring their own special something to the movie. Jon Cryer in particular is perfect for the character of Duckie, an angst-ridden teen who yearns for Andie (Molly Ringwald). They had a special showing of this movie in a theater in Orlando that I went to, and Duckie still to this day, had the whole audience laughing.I definitely recommend the soundtrack. It seems like every time I watch this movie (and I've seen it so many times) I find something new about it that I like even more. It's just such a cool movie about being independent and your own person. This is Molly's best role yet. Yes, her fashion is very outdated, but you have to realize that this was the 80's and Molly was trying to show her own uniqueness.I love the fact that Andie works at a record store, Trax, with punked-out Iona (Annie Potts)who is her confidant and funny to boot. The record store seems like a place you would find one day and just feel special for knowing it's there. I love her pink car. I love the club they go to and the Rave-Ups that play on-stage.In conclusion, this is a fabulous movie. Especially if you love the 80's!",Pretty in Pink
126,ohmixmaster,This one nailed the 80's,10,11 January 2005,"John Hughes had his finger on the pulse of what it was like to be a teen in the 1980's. Segmented clique's galore, shy insecurity, shallow rich kids, nerds, and everything in between. What made this film great, as well as Hughes' other teen films was the portrayal of characters and the social stratification of the time. Believe it or not, these films, in a very real way were socially significant. Sure, the stories were a bit hokey, but the characters, and the depiction of their lifestyles were quite brilliant. Hughes also had a knack for including some of the best, non mainstream, music of the era in all his films (of course many of the songs he used were the ones that defined real music of the 80's). I don't believe anyone before him has been able to accomplish such a task with a timepiece during the actual time (read: ""real time"") as Hughes did. The only one to do it since (in a radically different way mind you) was Nikki Reid in Thirteen.",Pretty in Pink
127,papo-64350,Pretty in Pink,10,31 October 2015,"PRETTY IN PINK is a movie about high school life and social discrimination during the 80's. It shows you the way students separate themselves based on their wealth and popularity. It informs the viewer that if you are not rich, basically you don't count or at least not for the popular parties and events that go on at the school. It shows you that if you dress a certain way and with clothes that are handmade by you, you are not cool. It shows you that the car you drive and the house you live in tells a lot about the life you are living and what you are worth. It shows you that discrimination and social segregation still was going on during that time. I am happy to say that all that has changed and high schools students in the present time are less socially discriminating. I work in a high school and I see kids of all kinds of social backgrounds, become the best of friends and they have no issues relating to wealth, image or social status",Pretty in Pink
128,xoxo_ruby_slippers_oxox,Excellent Genre Film,9,19 March 2007,"I was weary about watching this film because I thought it would be a shallow, predictable film like a lot of teen flicks are. But when I sat down and watched it, it didn't take long for me to fall in love. What this movie has that a lot of teen films don't are believable sub-plots. The viewer feels that the story is really happening and that the director is capturing real life. But of course the best thing about this film is it's most memorable character, Duckie. A socially awkward supporting character is nothing new, but Duckie is believably strange but at the same time very admirable. In short this film deals with real life social situations, about love, life, friendship, class disparity, depression, and single parent homes. Virtually unforgettable.",Pretty in Pink
129,renascent-55166,Favourite 80's Movie,10,26 March 2019,I am a huge John Hughes fan and own most of his films. This one is by far my favorite. The only thing that I did not like is the ending as it is not how the ending was in the book. Molly Ringwald wanted her character to end up with Blane. I would have liked to see Andie end up with Duckie. Team Duckie!,Pretty in Pink
130,stanleyvandewalt,For teens in the 80's,5,17 November 2019,"Watching this as a teen in the 80's was fantastic. Molly Ringwald was absolutely charming. However, watching this now as an adult, the storyline is lacking and the film is a little boring. Despite these problems, one can't deny that any John Hughes movie is a classic.",Pretty in Pink
131,g-39652,"Amazing, but guessable...",7,24 January 2020,"Pretty in Pink, directed by Howard Deutch, was released in 1986 and has a run time of 1 hour and 36 minutes. This movie is your classic boy meets girl scenario, what else would they make movies about? Andie Walsh, played by Molly Ringwald, is a single child being raised by her father in the suburbs of Chicago. She attends high school, struggles with her imagery and purpose, and of course, thinks about the boys she's surrounded by and what it would be like to date one of the popular boys. Again, what else would they make a movie about? This movie, although having a very overused and common plot, was a huge hit in box offices. Pretty in Pink generated over $6 million in box offices their opening weekend. Many things lead to the huge success of this movie including this accuracy of the costumes and makeup designs, the outstanding acting, and although repetitive, the plot. The accuracy of the clothing and makeup for the 1980s set film helps create a timeless effect where no matter what year or decade you can go back in time and see an accurate portrayal of that time period. You can see examples of this through the opening scenes of the kids in high school wearing their fashion trends for that time, the scene of Andie designing and creating her prom dress, as well as the clothes they choose for parties or other social gatherings. The acting in this film is especially outstanding. Molly Ringwald playing the main character of Andie was an amazing casting decision. Molly had previously starred in many of screenwriter John Hughes' films. The relationship they developed over working together previously had a positive impact on their ability to adequately portray the plot and themes of the movie through a basis of trust they had created together. Lastly, the plot created the timeless effect John Hughes' had been aiming for. Yes, the plot is overused now in today's date, but in the 1980s was new and exciting. The only critic I had for this film was the plot being overused and guessable. Many people enjoyed the entertainment John Hughes brought to the movie theaters and the cinematic community. Other movies that are comparable to Pretty in Pink include Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Clueless, and Can't Buy Me Love.",Pretty in Pink

She looks good in commie-sympathizer pink.Why this movie might as well have been penned by Bertolt Brecht.Although she ends up with corporate moll Andrew McCarthy, I have no doubt that he will be ready for the Bader-Meinhof after a year with this working class heroine.James Spader is also credible as Mr. Burns and Annie Potts is dressed in her usual counter-cultural splendor.Mr. Hughes declines to resolve such issues as the Kennedy, King, and Lennon assassinations, or the link between the Knights Templars and Skull and Bones.Despite these weaknesses, a big thumbs up!",Pretty in Pink

However, I never imagined I would enjoy it as much as I did. Romance,drama, solid plot.What I found wonderful was that,in the movie, it was so realistic. It wasn't the main character,Andie, sitting home and crying and things be an unrealistic drama. It was this main character fighting back yet still watching the social differences between her and other people. I think that this movie is for most ages.What I also loved about this movie is that it represented the main character,Andie, as: smart,strong,pretty,level-headed. It was the movie that broke the rule: you can't have beauty and brains. This a must-watch for everyone and make sure you,too,take the time to watch it!",Pretty in Pink
136,al_gal93,Best Timeless Theme of a Movie...still in 2011,10,28 December 2010,"***Timeless Segregation***When I first saw the cover of ""Pretty In Pink""...well let's just say that you shouldn't judge a DVD by it's cover. So, with that being said-I didn't have a lot of expectations other than-no dramatic girl mean girl stuff you would typically see in the 21st century. ""Pretty In Pink"" had demonstrated a timeless story of your any generation girl's life at school, regarding your normal ""zoids"" and ""richies"" separation. No matter what the generation my be, there is **always** something that separates teenagers from one another. If you ask any teenager what's the story, assuming they are telling the truth, you will most likely hear: goth, prep, jock, a loner, or even a ""emo"". In this case-regardless of how many people or adults that believe there is nothing to separate teens from one another besides religion, race, background, or color-it's explains **another segregation** that had once been a problem not that long ago in America History. If that isn't enough, most teens will find one thing or another that will find them saying to his or herself that they may not be smart enough, or pretty enough, or in ""Pretty in Pink""s case...""rich enough"" that would establish a ""zoid"" and ""richie"" separation that was Yes involved years ago and Yes is today and Yes will forever be an issue **now** and **forever**. Pretty In Pink has been the most simple prom movie to understand years ago, however still today-there are people who question the differences of young American's today. Regardless of time when it was produced in 1986 or when it is still on air in 2011 or in 50 years from now in 2061... ""Pretty In Pink"" illustrates a message of difference we have all once felt.

138,lauraaustria,Evokes a feeling of the eighties and more,8,29 November 2011,"When one thinks of teenage films of the 1980s, films directed by John Hughes often come to mind. Most of his films from that decade capture teenage angst of the time, as seen in Pretty in Pink (1986). This film, like many of his other works, feature an interaction and clash of social and economic groups and contemporary topics such as dating.Hughes's unique directorial style shines through in his works. Proud of his Chicago roots, Hughes filmed Pretty in Pink and other works, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), in Chicago and the North Shore area. Actors, including Molly Ringwald, often starred in many of his films. Hughes also used contemporary pop songs, such as OMD's ""If You Leave"", and other 1980s music in order to transition into the next scene or change the mood. Much of the music features synthesizers, further emphasizing Hughes's association with 80s pop culture. Pretty in Pink also demonstrates growth made by Hughes. His films start to lean towards teenage angst. Characters belonging to other social groups start to interact. This is especially evident in The Breakfast Club, a Hughes film that features stereotypical high schoolers that become friends after spending one Saturday in detention. Hughes's films feature an overcoming of prejudice and social norms of the 1980s. Hughes uses filmic devices not featured in Pretty in Pink. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off the fourth wall is often broken and also features footage during and after the credits. In Weird Science (1985), the story in the film concludes with a freeze frame before the credits start to scroll down over it.Pretty in Pink captures the mood of the 1980s. It utilizes music of the time; a record shop also serves as one of the settings in the film. Hughes shows the audience teenage life through his own eyes; he often uses high schools and shopping malls in the North Shore area as settings for his works. Many of Hughes's works feature dating and teenage angst. What sets this film apart from Hughes's other works is the focus on love and the many suitors attempting to attract Ringwald's character's attention. What also sets it apart from the others is the use of this conflict to display social clashes. Pretty in Pink demonstrates that love can bring together people of different social groups and initiate an attempt to understand people's mindsets and point of view.",Pretty in Pink
139,kajabrockington,moronic in pink,3,22 January 2012,"This movie is totally watchable, but if you have a brain you can't help but notice what an awful message it is putting out.Similar to John Hughes' film '16 candles', Molly Ringwald spends the entire film complaining about her perfect life and swatting away her weird best friend who is totally in love with her. Her interest in the friend grows throughout the film, but then eventually ends up getting together with the dull characterless hottie which leaves you completely unsatisfied. Blane treats her really badly! Like outwardly badly. Again and again. And she still goes for it. And then there's Iona - a really cool character who owns a record store and experiments with fashion, and then there's this bizarre scene where she tells Molly Ringwald she's in love with some guy who owns a pet store and is dressed all conservatively and we're supposed to just accept that she can forget she has a personality now because she's found her man.This film is sexist and tacky and has disturbing traditionalist and anti feminist undertones.",Pretty in Pink

This is like a Romeo and Juliet movie, where the poor girl is dating the rich guy. The Capulets and the Monrigues never had it so rough! That lawyer from ""Boston Legal"" is very good in this, before he went to law school obviously. This is a pretty fun movie, and Annie Potts has this white wig on, and it makes her look Chinese. What a pretty woman! And the part where Molly dances with Annie, I was so hoping they would kiss! Ah, but that is what a fantasy is for. Now, if you will excuse me...",Pretty in Pink
141,angelface-4,Pretty in pink,10,15 February 2006,I love this movie it is One of my favorite movies in the world. I love 80's movies and this is one of my favorites!!! I love Blaine. i love Dukie. i Love how Andie is a creative girl and makes her own dress for Prom. I'm a young girl and proud to say this is one of the best movies!!! I use to love breakfast club and still do but i saw this movie recently and blew me away. I some times wish that would happen to me. But i think every girl wishes that!! A rich falls for you but so does your best friend who is very loving. I just think it is a movie that will never be forgotten! Love this MOvie!!! and any one who loves 80 movies or songs and a good romantic/comedy will also fall in love with each character too!,Pretty in Pink
142,PatriciaIII,Pretty in Pink,10,28 February 2006,"This is by far the best movie John Hughes made. It is viewed by all ages, even my younger 29 yr old brother regards this as his favorite movie. It is a classic, it will never become dated and it is the type of movie you can watch over and over. I myself have seen it at least 200 times. Sounds crazy, but it takes me right back in time and makes me want to be in High School again. In fact I would do anything to go back to when this movie came out. Literally anything. That goes for Sixteen Candles too. Don't forget Breakfast Club and St. Elmos Fire. If you want a real treat, see this movie, what great fun, what great music, the soundtrack to this day is by far one of the best. You have Psychedelic Furs, The Smiths, New Order, Echo and the Bunnymen, Suzanne Vega, etc. It is great. There is but one heartbreak with this movie, while you adore the characters and find so much in common with them in one aspect or another, the movie does end, and that in itself is the biggest letdown of all, you just want it to go on forever and ever and ever......",Pretty in Pink
143,baylee_3,Pretty for All Ages,10,7 December 2018,"Andie Walsh, played by actress Molly Ringwald, is a teenager living with her jobless father on the poor side of town. She attends an uppity high school with her longtime best friend, Duckie, who is massively in love with her. When Andie is not working at the downtown record store, she is usually creating offbeat outfits scrapped straight from the thrift store. It is no secret that she and Duckie are not apart of the popular rich kid group, whom the non-popular kids deemed the ""richies."" But when richie Blane asks poor Andie out, the divide between the two social groups become clear and difficult to navigate. Although the movie's plot has the typical tale of two lovers being kept part because of some social reason, the movie greatly captures what it is like to be a misfit in high school and being ashamed of your roots.Since the plot of Pretty in Pink is such an overused concept, it is very easy to disregard it as just another one of those typical 80's teenage love stories. A boy loves a girl, but the boy's friends do not approve of her, and her friends do not approve of him. This concept has been done a million different times, making it become quite redundant and cheesy after seeing it reworked so often. Some critics, like Gene Siskel from the Chicago Tribune, offered some improvement of the story, saying ""What would have been a much more exciting direction for the script to take would be for Andie to tell Blane to take a hike- repeatedly. And then Andie should have sought out a member of her own milieu whom she prefers."" Acting on this advice would create an entirely different plot, but I will admit that doing so might just take the cliché-ness out of the film while still keeping an important piece of the movie's heart intact.Although eccentric fashion was a large part of the 80s, several of the main characters in the film are always pictured in quirky, over the top outfits that can often be seen as a little too much even for the timeframe. At times, the attire can appear as if each character is trying too hard to visually display their role in the movie instead of thoroughly communicating it. Duckie wears a bowler hat and suspenders, and Blane, along with all of his so-called friends, wears fancy, expensive sweaters and neatly pressed slacks. Paul Attanasio from The Washington Post further explains this point when he says that ""without even listening to the movie, you know, 'He's poor, he's rich, and that's what's going on here.'"" It is easy to see the clear divide between the two and the background characters of the high school seem to incorporate this type of theme as well, with the more popular kids displayed as wealthy, and the less popular kids depicted as more punk and edgier.Although the roles in the film are distinctly labeled, being classified by your peers is a reality that almost all teenagers in high school know to be true. The film portrays this in the strongest way possible, while also taking on subjects like conformity, peer pressure, and young love. These are a few topics that nearly all people are able to relate to, which creates a welcoming, familiar base that the viewers can build upon and reminisce their own experiences.Beneath the overused storyline and basic plot, I believe that there is a lot of overlooked realism in this great movie. The way Andie tries to hide her broken home life from Blane and the way Duckie gets bullied in school for being a rather offbeat individual reflects a reality that many teenagers have to face every day. As Patrick Goldstein from the Los Angeles Times words it, ""These kids have a bumpy ride, but this is one film that identifies with their passions instead of indulging them, giving us a perfect back-seat view of kids out cruising, not for kicks but for a hard-earned sense of pride."" I couldn't agree more. This film takes a deep look into each character, giving you a glimpse of their personal life when away from school, and also the emotions they feel when conflict pursuits.I believe Pretty in Pink is a top-tier film when it comes to so-called cliché 80's love stories because unlike other movies in its category, you do not feel the dullness of the typical love story plot. Instead, you are given characters who are full of vibrancy, troubles, and most importantly- real emotion. It is more than just a love story. It is a story that people of all ages can relate to and enjoy. It is a story portrayed with incredible accuracy of what it is like to be a teenager.",Pretty in Pink
