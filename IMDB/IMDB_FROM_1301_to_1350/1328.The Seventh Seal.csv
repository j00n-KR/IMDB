0,MartinHafer,Really weird but worth seeing for the experience,9,13 June 2005,"This is a strange movie--period! However, it is also one of the most parodied films and for that reason alone it is worth seeing! Now, on to explain the part that is parodied: A man is returning from war in the time of the Reformation and the plague is about the countryside. The man meets the Angel of Death and is told it is him time to die. The man asks if he can first challenge him in a game of chess--if the man wins, then his life will be spared. The Grim Reaper, not wanting to be a spoilsport, agrees and they play a game that starts and stops again and again. This exact same contest has been used in Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, the cartoon series The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, and an experimental film De Düva: The Dove (starring Madeline Kahn among others). In the Bill and Ted movie, they did not play chess but a series of games including Battleship and Twister! In The Dove, it was a badminton game! I can't remember what the game was in the cartoon series, but instead of their deaths, the children played the Grim Reaper over the soul of their pet hamster! Isn't is weird how this art film has appeared again and again and in the silliest of places! Give it a try to see the FIRST death-match and because it is a good film--with excellent performances all around--from Max Von Sydow to all the supporting players. Also, do not give up on the film too quick--I did and only saw it all years later when my sister-in-law convinced me to give it another try!",The Seventh Seal
1,TheLittleSongbird,Fully deserves its rep as a masterpiece,10,31 August 2012,"This is one amazing film, and in my view Ingmar Bergman's best. Visually, The Seventh looks wonderful, the bleak scenery adds much to the mood, the cinematography is beautifully composed and skillful and the lighting is atmospheric. It also has many memorable images like with the flagellates, the hawk flying in the cloudless sky, Jof's vision of the Virgin Mary and the milk and strawberries in the dusk. Bergman's direction is superb, Erik Nordgren's score is resolutely haunting and the dialogue is some of the most thought-provoking I've heard with some nice bawdy humour with especially the squire that doesn't feel misplaced. The story is like an allegory and meditation of life, death, love and fear(amongst other things), and it is dealt with in a very intelligent and careful manner. Again there are some timeless scenes like the ending, the scene of the girl about to be burnt, Death being challenged to a game of chess and with the jester. The acting is also exemplary, Max Von Sydow gives one of cinema's finest performances, stoic yet always commanding with a face that speaks volumes about what he's thinking. Bengt Ekerot evokes chills as Death, while Gunner Bjornstrand is suitably dry as the squire. All in all, a really amazing film, fully deserving of its reputation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Seventh Seal
2,Leofwine_draca,Thought-provoking and profound,9,6 August 2012,"THE SEVENTH SEAL is Ingmar Bergman's meditation on Christianity and death, told through the tableau of a medieval setting and a mixed bunch of players on the stage. Max von Sydow headlines the cast as the Crusader knight who famously challenges Death to a game of chess, and the film follows his ruminations as well as the lives of others caught up in the same time and place.This is certainly an original film, I can't think of one quite like it, and one that's tough to describe. Stylistically it has the same kind of quality as a Kurosawa film to it, such as RASHOMON. It has an almost episodic feel in places, and there's no real thrust to the narrative; instead it's more of a depiction of everyday life, exploring interactions between various folk. But despite the lack of obvious focus, it's never less than utterly watchable. Melodrama it might be, but it's good melodrama.Bergman has a way of directing that reminds me of Kurosawa; he doesn't do anything obvious but his film nevertheless looks stylish and carefully composed throughout. The Swedish cast members are all very good and there are lots of powerful moments, from a jester being bulled in a wayside inn to the ultimate fate of a hapless witch. The ending employs a classic bit of imagery that left me feeling chilled. The whole enterprise is dark, morbidly so, and yet the depth and maturity of the insight are what makes it a classic.",The Seventh Seal
3,SnoopyStyle,love Death and Max von Sydow,7,30 January 2015,"It's the middle of the 14th Century. Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) is a knight returning to Sweden from the crusade with his squire. The land is ravaged by the black plague. Death approaches him on the beach to take him but he challenges Death to a game of chess. Block can win back his life . He continues on his journey back home playing the game. He is disillusioned and encounters various people.I really love the idea of Death as a character. Max von Sydow has superior presence that elevates his character. The strict Christianity and the intense stuff are very compelling. I'm not as interested in the other characters and I wish the movie stays with Block. It's a bit uneven and slow at times. Nevertheless, it has some fascinating aspects.",The Seventh Seal
4,Hitchcoc,"Ah, the Middle Ages!",10,21 October 2009,"This is such a compelling film. First of all, we have the backdrop around the time of the Crusades and the Black Death. People must live their lives in constant fear. Of course, the ones flourishing are those connected to the church. When people are desperate, that's where they end up. There is no moral sense at work in the land because death is literally around the corner, played by a round faced character in a black cowl. Max Van Sydow's knight is a fine character who manages to play a game of chess with Death and put off the inevitable. During that time he encounters a group of scoundrels and some very nice people who don't deserve their fate. Bergman's images are incredible. He does more with black and white film than darn near anyone. There is a preponderance of religious symbolism. Most of what I remember is that amazing power generated by the church, the burnings and the fear tactics. When Death comes, after the fear has been exhausted, there seems to be a comfortable acceptance because the life on earth is certainly not worth much.",The Seventh Seal
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Haunting as well as entertaining, even if I did not see true greatness",6,3 September 2020,"""Det sjunde inseglet"" or ""The Seventh Seal"" is a Swedish movie from 1957, so this one is already way over half a century old, and it is also in the Swedish language, even if there is some Latin in here too, but really not too much. It runs for slightly over 1.5 hours, but stays under the 100-minute mark, so it is definitely not among the longest films out there. The director is of course Ingmar Bergman, considered by absolutely everybody Sweden's finest filmmaker ever, considered by many Europe's finest filmmaker ever and considered by some the world's finest filmmaker ever. He is also once again the writer. The writer of the play this is based on and also the writer of the specific screenplay. As you can see from the pretty cool poster this is a black-and-white movie, which is not a given for mid/late 1950s, but also not to be taken for granted. Bergman was still under the age of 40 when he made this movie that received a great deal of awards recognition, for example at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Sadly, he is of course long gone now and same is true for almost all the cast members in here. Lindblom is still alive I see, but I must say there are only two names here that I recognize and Bergman fans will certainly recognize a lot more.These two would be Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow. She died in spring last year at a relatively old age and he died in spring this year at an even older age, so he has been dead for approximately half a year now. His character (if not Death) is also the most memorable from the movie we have here I'd say. So von Sydow was easily under 30 at that point, which means not even a third of his life was over then. And even if this is a black-and-white film as I wrote earlier, his bright blonde hair is so easy to recognize that it almost felt like a color movie at times. Or this little snippet of the screen that included his hair. von Sydow went on to become one of Sweden's finest actors of all time, maybe even a contender for Sweden's most popular actor with his breakthrough in Hollywood and Oscar nominations as on the male side I think there was nobody really that reached a star level like Ingrid Bergman. But okay, let's not drift away too far from this film here. It is in the imdb top250, pretty comfortably actually being at 159 right now, so it will stay inside for a long, long time. I cannot really support this inclusion. It is a good movie for sure, even if it needed a little while to get going for me, but with everything after the half-hour mark, there is no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up. It delivered mostly in terms of being a supernatural drama with the two characters you see on the photo here, but there are also some slightly funny moments.I think that people with major focus on gender equality and female rights will not enjoy this movie a lot. But it is justified. It is set during the days of the Crusades when brave knights were around and millions being killed by the Plague. You could actually say that Death, the man you see in the background of this imdb photo, not von Sydow, is symbolic for the Plague and not just for death in general. After all, the Plague is called Black Death too as far as I remember which would fit the man's suit's color. Anyway, what I wanted to say is that there was one scene specifically that was pretty harsh on females. We have the guy who comes closest to being an antagonist being about to steal from corpses, a pretty despicable act, even if not uncommon back then, not only because of the act of theft, but also despicable because he exposes himself at risk to the Plague and also those people he may infect later on when being close to them. It's no coinciende at all that we see him die eventually from the Plague. But now really, during this scene we have a woman approach him and ask what he is doing and next up he is about to kill her, maybe with the intention to rape her before that, but another guy (one of the good guys, yep) shows up and protects the woman from the villain. Quickly afterwards, he talks to her and says something like she can be glad that he did not rape her himself. Pretty charming. Honestly, I could feel that we could get a wave of political correctness there too, just like we did with ""Gone with the Wind"" lately telling us this is no way to speak to a woman. Don't do it, Netflix! Please.Anyway, the humor in here is pretty dark at times for sure. Like in the exact same scene, the man (Jöns I think) says something like he has not been home for a long time and hopefully his wife is dead by now, again not very female-friendly there. So probably a movie like this could not have been made anymore today without being ousted by censorship and white knights, which is pretty sad, but hey, at least they can't (completely) alter those old movies. Another thing here I felt was that the female characters are pretty stunning. Well, not all of them, but several. At least two and that includes also von Sydow's character's wife/partner whom we meet at the very end. Also a pretty haunting final shot as we see the characters being led to death by Death himself from afar, but hey at least those that are observing this scenario seem to have survived. Okay, what else is there to say? Oh yeah, the chess game between the knight and Death is an interesting one. It was almost a bit funny honestly when Death accepted the challenge to play chess and even accepted the offer that as long as the knight does not lose, he may stay alive. Towards the end, it seemed like a smart move because this way, perhaps he saved the lives of the others as they get away, but nobody can get away from Death as we find out and he probably knew exactly what was going on. Still, you may wonder if the knight's getting together with all of them wasn't a bit on the selfish side either as he may have led Death to them this way, so by trying to have them leave secretly, he tried to make up for it. Or actually those who got away were the ones watching the group in the end? I am not sure.One final thing I want to say is that there is some violence in here, but never too graphic. For example we have the villain dying from the Plague, many other people dying from the Plague as well. Or the guy dying up there on the tree. Or the villain getting the mark on his head or wherever else. We know all these things happen and they are haunting enough for sure and we do not need to see them to know that they are indeed happening. Bergman's writing and direction are certainly strong enough to get the message across. So yeah, all in all I give this film a thumbs-up. I have not seen too much from the filmmaker (I know, my loss), so there is not really any point in saying this is among my (least) favorite films from the man, but, like I said earlier already I think, no hesitation for me in giving this one here a positive recommendation. Go check it out, preferrably on a big screen where it is certainly more memorable than on a small computer screen or so and I am glad I got the chance to check this one out today at my local theater. Hope you will be equally lucky. Don't miss out then!",The Seventh Seal
6,Prismark10,The endgame,6,25 November 2016,"The Seventh Seal has been influential to many filmmakers. Parodied in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, inspired Roger Corman's version of The Masque of the Red Death.However I have always been put off by Ingmar Bergman films. Maybe those serious, somewhat dull Woody Allen films where he would try to emulate his idol Bergman; he would even get Sven Nykvist to be the cinematographer sort of put me off.However I felt it was time to enter the stark monochrome world of Ingmar Bergman and his most celebrated film, The Seventh Seal starring Max von Sydow as the medieval knight Antonius Block.Von Sydow looks as young as I have ever seen him before, he is an actor who has always looked old. I find it hard to believe that I am older than he was in films such as The Three Days of the Condor and he looked old in that movie.Block has returned with his squire from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged with the plague. Death surrounds them and pretty soon Death comes for Block but he holds him back by challenging him to a game of chess in the hope that if he beats Death, he cheats death by being reprieved.However Death has few tricks up his dark sleeves and they are non chess moves as he fools Block in revealing his strategy. However Block also has motives of his own, an endgame where he wishes not to save himself but someone else. The story introduces other characters such as the blacksmith and his cheating wife, a lustful theatre manager, a band of actors including a resilient married couple. We have vignettes some comic, some tragic such as a girl being burned on the stake as a witch.The film is episodic and existentialist. It is thought provoking with stark symbolism. I admit I never fathomed what it was all about but to me it was Block trying to do one good deed by cheating Death so others could live.",The Seventh Seal
7,kosmasp,To chess or not to chess,7,8 September 2011,"A road unlike any other road movie, I guess. An infamous scene that you have heard a lot about (I'm guessing, especially if you like and have seen quite a few movies). Characters that are weird (to put that mildly) and strange religious tones that I'm quite sure didn't fare well with the church ...While dialogue is a strong point (as has been said by other reviewers already), it's also the imagery that Bergman puts on display. Not really an easy film to follow (though might still be considered as pretty straight forward), this really has quite a lot going for it. Even if it is only the idea itself you like, there is undeniable attraction to this film. And something you should watch (despite how you might feel afterward about it) ...",The Seventh Seal
8,classicsoncall,"""I live now in a world of phantoms, a prisoner of my own dreams.""",9,26 December 2016,"On the Criterion Collection interview with Ingmar Bergman, he relates that he wrote the chess scene over his own fear of dying. This would have been an immensely interesting idea to explore, but after he mentions it, the interview is practically over. That left me rather frustrated.The film itself may also leave one rather frustrated, as it explores the principal character agonizing over God's unwillingness to show His face and answer his existential questions about the meaning of life and the certainty of death. When Death (Bengt Ekerot) makes his entrance to claim him a victim, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) challenges the Grim Reaper to a game of chess, the winner to exact his own reward. The Knight must quickly readjust his game plan after he unwittingly reveals his strategy to the black clad harvester of souls.The film is set during the time of the Black Plague, following a 'worthless' crusade of ten years that the Knight and his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) participated in. All around them are wanderers half crazed with fear at the thought of the Plague approaching. All the time Death appropriates his victims, he claims to know nothing and hold no secrets. Fearing his own demise, Block (Bergman?) disrupts the chess board, intent on prolonging his existence in a world full of uncertainty.""The Seventh Seal"" is Bergman's stunning allegory of man's search for meaning, but what I've come to understand after many years is that each person must come to terms with himself from within. Attempting to extract answers from a single source is bound to end in disappointment, trapped if you will in a Knight's world of phantoms and dreams more like nightmares. This is the kind of film that presents more questions than answers, as I'm sure Bergman understood and intended.",The Seventh Seal
9,gavin6942,Widely Considered the Greatest Bergman Film,8,24 April 2010,"A story set in medieval times (presumably Sweden), with a knight who faces death (literally), a young couple, and some other characters. Fate is coming for them, as they live in the time of the plague.Film historian Ivan Butler sees elements of horror here (as he does in much of Bergman's work), pointing to the instances of ""death, plague, religious fanaticism, intolerance, torture"" and singling out the scene with Joseph is ""forced at knife point to stand on his head, to climb on the table and dance like a bear."" How much this is horror and how much it is everyday life in medieval Sweden, I really could not say.Ebert, meanwhile, says this film ""has more in common with the silent film than with the modern films that followed it"", and that ""All of Bergman's mature films, except the comedies, are about his discontent with the ways that God has chosen to reveal himself."" On that first point, this is decidedly so; Bergman has strong, stark visuals almost needing no sound at all to carry them. As for the latter point, this is an interesting interpretation and I do not know Bergman's work well enough to comment.I actually first came across this film indirectly, having seen ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" and not being aware of the reference. Next, I came across it in ""Last Action Hero"". Those may not be high culture, but the fact that this film touched such remote genres really gives support to the strength of the work.",The Seventh Seal
10,lee_eisenberg,seven is the lucky number for film buffs,10,25 June 2005,"""Det sjunde inseglet"" (or, as the English-speaking world knows it, ""The Seventh Seal"") is one of those movies that doesn't have any clear purpose; in a way, it's not supposed to. More than anything else, it looks at the questions that surround people in their lives, and shows that they don't necessarily have clear-cut answers. The ever-imposing Max Von Sydow plays Antonius Block, a Swedish knight returning home after having fought in the Crusades. He and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) meet Death (Bengt Ekerot). The not-so-Grim Reaper is of course planning to take the men to the afterlife, but the knight makes a most unusual deal: he and Death will play chess, and he will get to stay alive as long as he wins.Whether or not Antonius wins is not the point. The movie is a philosophical look not only at how the Bubonic Plague was affecting Europe, but probably also at how certain things are always creeping up on us. The final scene affirms this, and the movie affirms Ingmar Bergman as a director unlike any other.",The Seventh Seal
11,jboothmillard,The Seventh Seal,8,24 June 2010,"The iconic image from this film is Max Von Sydow playing chess against Death, or The Grim Reaper, it is spoofed in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, so I was most looking forward to seeing the whole thing, from director Ingmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night, Persona). Basically knight Antonius Block (Sydow) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned home from the crusades, where the Black Death is spreading. Antonius comes face to face with Death (Bengt Ekerot), literally, who tells him his number is up, but the knight challenges the dark figure to a game of chess for his life. This game continues throughout the film as cultural turmoil ensues around Antonius, and there are quite a few dark references to the existence of God and the Devil, and the very essence of faith. Through the film, you see travelling actors doing some weird voodoo play looking as though their praising the Devil, a Witch (Maud Hansson) is burned alive, violence is used to stabilise order and a few other dark occurrences. But the dark stuff is balanced out by a few light hearted and spiritual events, you can see Jof / Joseph (Nils Poppe) and his young wife Mia / Mary - Jof's wife (Bibi Andersson) with their infant son Mikael are meant to represent the Holy family. As far as I remember, Antonius gives away his idea for a winning move, as he knows he is most likely to lose the chess game anyway, and I'm guessing he does. Also starring Anders Ek as The Monk and Erik Strandmark as Jonas Skat. Being a Swedish film, it wasn't easy to understand most of what was going on, but looking back I can understand the religious messages that director Bergman (father of Ingrid) was trying to get across, and it is a most watchable classic period drama. It was number 70 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",The Seventh Seal
12,ccthemovieman-1,Another Favorite Of The Pseudo-Intellectuals,2,18 May 2007,"I just laugh out loud when I read national critics gushing over Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman and his films, particularly this one which they love to label ""his greatest work."" Do you know why? It's because Bergman liked to show God and Bible believers in a negative light. Since almost all critics are Liberals, they love this kind of thought so, like Martin Scorcese, he can do no wrong. It's as simple as that.Basically, this story is nothing but one man's diatribe against faith, and why the man lost it. He lost it - get this - because God didn't audibly answer his prayers. Since he didn't hear a booming voice from a burning bush answering his prayers then, he surmises, there must be no God. Unbelievable. Anyway, all of this sounds good to atheist/agnostic film critics. However, I believe Bergman might have been more of a believer than he let on because God was a topic in a number of his films. At least, he was wrestling about His existence, and that's not unusual. Too bad that in none of his films does he come up with a pro-God answer.Even if all the ""religious"" talks means nothing to you, I think most people would find this film way too boring so the entertainment value is not going to be there. For honest questioners of Faith and those who would find the visuals and direction intriguing, I have no problem with it. I just think it's overrated because of the reasons I stated above, and the fact it IS a boring movie with unappealing characters.",The Seventh Seal
13,rmax304823,"Eat, Drink, and Be Merry.",10,6 October 2010,"I remember seeing this for the first time in Los Angeles and emerging from the theater shocked, scared, and thrilled, as if I'd just viewed my first autopsy. There had never been anything like this allegory before, although there have been imitations and parodies since -- Monty Python, Woody Allen.A thoughtful knight (Max von Sydow) and his tough, cynical squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand) return from the Crusades to find their Scandinavian state in a terrible mess. The plague is sweeping the land. The plagues all seem far away now, but one of them knocked off about a third of the population of Europe. That would be more than a hundred million Americans today. The deaths were horrible.Death comes for the knight and squire, dressed in a black cloak and hood, with a pasty white face. (Only Ingmar Bergman could pull of a cliché like that.) Death is proud of his talent at playing chess and agrees to the knight's challenge to play a game over the next couple of days. If the knight wins, he goes free, and if Death wins, the knight goes with him. Of course, at the end of the game of life, the same player always wins. Or, as Walsh McDermott put it in a slightly different context, ""the dice of the gods are loaded.""Along the way, the knight and squire pick up some fellow travelers, including a family of cheerful itinerant players, a blacksmith and his unfaithful wife, and a young lady of the village who may or may not be retarded. They witness flagellants parading through a village lashing themselves and lugging crosses made of heavy logs, smothered in smoke from swinging iron censers. They watch an insane girl burned at the stake for a witch. Some of the incidents are comic, some are violent, all are revelatory. You know, kind of like real life.What a movie. It begins with a vulture almost stationary against an overcast, and it ends with a dance of death. In between Death saws down a tree in which a man is trying to hide. We see the trunk fall and the camera fixes on the raw white stump, then a squirrel with hairy ears leaps onto the stump and begins to chatter. I can't imagine that you'll ever forget some of these images.But then, I don't know. ""The Seventh Seal"", like the Bergman films that flooded the theaters in the following years, was a product of its time. I'm not at all sure that many of today's viewers would have the patience to sit through a black-and-white movie with subtitles. In the 1960s Stanley Kaufman wrote an article predicting that future students would know the history of film the way that they had always known literary history. Twenty years later, he took it back. Maybe too much MTV, too much immediate gratification, too low a threshold for boredom. In another comment, the complaint was made that Bergman didn't supply any answers, just questions. That's an example of what I'm getting at.",The Seventh Seal

15,moonspinner55,"""You are black."" .. ""It suits me well.""",7,2 January 2017,"Ingmar Bergman's career of brooding cinematic successes was practically borne here, in an amazing study of doomsday travelers in 14th century Sweden confronting their mortality. In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death's clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of faith and the heavy symbolism are often tough to wade through, while the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody. Still, ""The Seventh Seal"" is a must-see film, matching its iconic imagery with themes of the eternal struggle. *** from ****",The Seventh Seal
16,Quinoa1984,The Quintessential Bergman Picture,10,25 July 2002,"One thing that can be certain after watching the Seventh Seal, outside of being thankful for living in this century, is that Bergman knows his film-making- and imagery.  He uses subliminal and not so subliminal techniques to convey a dying, frightened world, where making a living is almost impossible and the debate of god's control over life is discussed like un-rhyming yet fascinating poetry. The result is beautiful cinema, capturing the always foreboding fear and allure of the almighty and for the waiting death, appropriately staged in post-crusades, mid dark age Europe.  Max Von Sydow gives an excellent showing as the opponent of Death (in a clever and meticulous chess game), yet the character of Death, played by Bengt Ekerot with chilling conviction, steals the show, if only for the alluring quality of the character. 
Even if the story veers it veers in good and interesting territory, focusing on people who convey Bergman's point and or style.  I can't reveal what the bottom line point is (many newcomers to Bergman's work won't either, especially if you're not in the mood for soul searching), but one thing is for certain, an allegory on life and death is shown perfectly in the second to last shot of the reaper and his minions following in a dance across the field.  This is one of the most pure of cinema's masterpieces and certainly Bergman's best cine.  A++",The Seventh Seal

Instead of going quietly into the final night, von Sydow challenges Mr. Ekerot to a game of chess. ""Death"" is in a playful mood, and accepts the contest; if von Sydow wins, he and his friends may avoid the Plague.Director Ingmar Bergman had an amazing 1957 (in Sweden, anyway), book-ended with ""Det sjunde inseglet"" (""The Seventh Seal"") and ""Smultronstället"" (""Wild Strawberries""). The latter film definitely has the edge, story-wise. Still, the former is full of beautifully morbid images, killer camera-work from Bergman and Gunnar Fischer, accompanying a thought-provoking script.

18,sunwarrior13,Symbolism-filled Classic Film,10,26 October 2012,"Endlessly imitated and parodied, writer/director Ingmar Bergman's landmark art movie The Seventh Seal retains its ability to hold an audience spellbound.The film features Gunnar Björnstrand,Bengt Ekerot,Nils Poppe,Max von Sydow,Bibi Andersson,Inga Landgré and Åke Fridell. Set during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death, who has come to take his life.

Here the motif of silence refers to the ""silence of God"" which is a major theme of the film.A knight named Antonius Block is wearily heading home after ten years' worth of combat. Disillusioned by unending war, plague, and misery Block has concluded that God does not exist. As he trudges across the wilderness, Block is visited by Death, garbed in the traditional black robe. Unwilling to give up the ghost, Block challenges Death to a game of chess. If he wins, he lives and if not, he'll allow Death to claim him. As they play, the knight and the Grim Reaper get into a spirited discussion over whether or not God exists. To recount all that happens next would diminish the impact of the film itself; we can observe that The movie ends with one of the most indelible of all of Bergman's cinematic images: the near-silhouette ""Dance of Death."" This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.Essentially intellectual, yet emotionally stimulating, too, it is as tough and rewarding a screen challenge as the viewer will face when watching it as it is consist mainly of 90 minutes of iconic imagery, some deep questions and a surprising amount of humor.But nevertheless,this is Art with a capital A, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining at the same time, which only makes its artistry even greater.A symbolism-filled classic film indeed.",The Seventh Seal
19,Doylenf,Death never takes a holiday...,6,5 September 2006,"While I'm not going overboard in extolling the virtues of THE SEVENTH SEAL, I do think it has some striking imagery and had the potential to be the ultimate work of art Ingmar Bergman was obviously striving for. But do I think he achieved it? No...for the simple reason that it leaves us unenlightened on the subject with no new knowledge.Bergman really has no answers to the age old questions we all have about life and death and what happens in the hereafter. And giving Death a human face seems to me the wrong decision on Bergman's part. He should have kept him a hooded spectre and nothing more--faceless and unknown within the shadows of his hood. Humanizing him doesn't work, at least not for me.A cruel streak runs through some of the more boisterous moments, such as when one of the actors is put through some hazing by a sadistic man who later gets his comeuppance. Everyone laughs and applauds as the man is humiliated beyond the endurance of this spectator for the sake of bawdy humor which seems forced and contrived, as does much of the clowning by the group of actors.But there are so many good things about the richly photographed film, that I don't want to give this review an entirely negative impression. But the truth is it offers no new insights into the age old questions of life and death. It's all presented as an allegory with religious symbols (flagellation, the cross, the witch burning) and we suspect that among the many utterances we hear from The Devil will be something to ponder and think about. But no. There's only the hopelessness that Death offers when the plague is rampant over the land and is something which cannot be avoided by man, no matter how clever he thinks he is. The chess game that the Black Knight proposes is a ruse that the Devil sees through from the start. And we suspect near the end that he knows the young couple with the infant have escaped since he says that he knows all that is happening, even behind his back. The young couple will be doomed too, eventually. Death will consume all.But Max van Sydow is excellent as The Knight questioning his reason for being and his reason for dying. The B&W cinematography evokes the Middle Ages with striking scenes that stay in the mind afterwards and the film, while bleak and disturbing, is always riveting to watch.It's a very engrossing film, but there are many weaknesses. I don't consider it the masterpiece that so many others label it.",The Seventh Seal
20,writers_reign,Righters Block,8,20 July 2007,"I don't know about you but there are still several films that everyone and his Uncle Max seems to have seen but me. On the other hand I am gradually making headway via DVD, revivals, festivals, etc. Time was I felt deprived because I hadn't seen Citizen Kane, Casablanca, It's A Wonderful Life, The Wizard Of Oz, for God's sake but like I say they're all now safely under my belt and I feel the better for having caught up with them eventually. In the case of Bergman it's not just The Seventh Seal but practically everything he ever made that, for one reason or another, I haven't seen; in fact off the top of my head I can recall seeing only Smiles Of A Summer Night and Autumn Sonata. Nor, if I'm honest, have I made any great attempt to watch him, most of the films are now available on DVD but I'm not exactly breaking a leg rushing to Virgin, FNAC or HMV but now The Seventh Seal has just opened commercially in London so, along with 8 other people I checked it out, exactly 50 years after it was released. The first thing I noticed was that it's not quite as grim as I had supposed and nor is the celebrated chess game given that much screen time - from all I'd read over the years I'd imagined a fairly static movie with these two symbolic characters trading moves for 90 minutes. Taint, so, honey, taint so. Following some portentous music we find ourselves on a craggy beach where the knight, Antonius Block, is resting. Beside him on a piece of fairly flat rock a chess board has been set up. This is a pretty unrealistic image with which to kick off a non-comedy film because no normal person would set out a chessboard in such an inhospitable place where the more or less constant wind would scatter the pieces every which way in nothing flat. So now Bergman has to get us past this incongruity and I guess that having 'Death' appear in human form and accepting a challenge from Block - who can forestall his date with Death for the duration of the game and even cancel it altogether should he win - is as good a way as any. We then accompany Block and his squire as he returns home after ten years away from his wife - he's been to the Crusades if anybody asks you - which immediately reminds us of Agammemnon returning home to HIS wife after ten tough years in Troy and the Fall of the House of Atreus is as nought compared to the angst that visits Block. The images are striking at times, the acting is more than accomplished and in fact the only jarring note is just that, in fact not just one note but the several that make up the score which has a habit of SHOUTING at us when it wants to underline something instead of employing a more subtle approach. It's nice to be able to cross it off my list but I won't be breaking my neck to see it again and nor am I likely to buy the DVD.",The Seventh Seal

The Knight (Max von Sydow) constantly looks for answers that are not there and, at the end, falls to his knees pleading as the most simple supplicant.Ingmar Bergman has crafted an extraordinary tale of faith and superstition that causes one to reflect deeply into their own knowledge and belief. It is a magnificent allegory set in strikingly beautiful locations with splendid lighting and effects that dare you to take your eyes from the screen for a brief moment to blink. I dare say that I could not. I was captivated by the sights and sounds like nothing before or since.Gunnar Björnstrand was magnificent as the squire who provided the framework for what was happening all around him. Nils Poppe was a joy to watch in his simple innocence. Bibi Andersson, who has been acting almost as long as I have been alive, and is still doing so, was pitch perfect as Poppe's wife.Summaries of the film are available in many places so I will not go into that, but suffice it to say that it is one film that everyone should see.",The Seventh Seal
22,Boba_Fett1138,A beautiful and thought provoking movie.,10,25 April 2007,"Very rarely such a both great looking and thought provoking movie comes around that makes such a powerful and lasting impression. ""Des Sjunde inseglet"" has some great and thought provoking themes in it and is also beautifully made at the same time, by Ingmar Bergman and his entire cast and crew. The movie questions and debates several issues concerning the meaning of life, religion and death. Of course this movie provides no answers to any of that because of the simple reason that nobody knows the answers to these questions and everybody interpret life and belief on their own way. This movie can also be seen as a free interpretation of those subjects and it triggers the mind of its viewers, which is also the reason why this movie can be interpreted in many different ways by many different people. It makes ""Des Sjunde inseglet"" a rare really thought provoking movie.But the movie is not only just about this depressing and heavy subjects, it's also about hope, if you at least look deep enough into it. Also the movie is way more accessible to everyone then it might sound. The themes and entire subject of the movie might sound a bit off and difficult and certainly will scare of a large group of the average movie-watcher but the movie is perfectly watchable for basically just everyone. I think that the great surrealism of the movie is a reason why it works out so way and is perfect to watch for basically just everyone, regardless of age, race or religion.The movie has a great look in which less is more. The movie chooses a simplistic and more warm approach, to keep the story real and as involving and thought provoking as possible. It gives the movie an unique look and atmosphere and also provides the movie with some beautiful images. The cinematography is really first rate and so are the costumes and sets for the movie, that all adds to its atmosphere of the time period the movie is set in.The movie is filled with a couple of beautiful looking sequences that also make a lasting heavy dramatic impression. It's a powerful movie to watch that both provokes and is easy on the eyes.All of the actors also did a great job and the movie features some of the best Swedish actors of that generation. Of course most are unknown today by the general public but the movie also features some 'big' names that are known around the world, of which Max von Sydow is of course the best example. I enjoyed watching him in this early movie role, especially since we mostly only know him as an 'old' man, every since his ""The Exorcist"" role. It was refreshing to see him as a very young man and as a beginning actor. Bengt Ekerot is also perfectly cast as the scary looking 'death' itself. His appearance is the best known element out of the movie and is even known to persons who've never watched this movie. This really says something about the impact his appearance makes in this movie.It's just a movie in which everything adds up; the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere, the directing, the acting, its themes. Everything is first class work and every little element of the movie enriches the movie and adds up to its total brilliance. The fact that such an 'old' European movie is so well known- and is still being watched all over the world should say enough about its quality and universal themes that are of all time that are handled in it. 10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Seventh Seal
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up""",10,4 December 2009,"This is the first film by Bergman I've watched, and I definitely do not intend to make it my last. The plot is smart and interesting, and it is compelling from start to finish. During a game of chess between The Grim Reaper itself and the man he has come to take, subjects like faith, life and death are explored. It's rather compelling, and ought to inspire many a healthy debate about aforementioned broad topics. The open and seemingly ambiguous nature of the movie allows the audience to interpret it for ourselves. This is funny at points, once or twice from absurdity, and it never tries too hard. It comes naturally, the clever and witty material as well as the black comedy. The acting is excellent, not a single performance is off for a second. It's really cool to see Sydow, by all respects a great talent, in his native tongue. This is beautifully shot and skillfully edited, if the sound can be a tad excessive at times. The music does also get loud and over the top a little, though it does not put much of a strain on the viewing experience. There is disturbing content in this, as well as brief violence and a few gruesome visuals. The DVD contains an introduction with Ingmar himself, which is three minutes long. I recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to appreciate it. 10/10",The Seventh Seal
24,evanston_dad,Again with the Meaning of Life Thing -- Enough Already,7,11 September 2006,"""The Seventh Seal"" would strike me as a better film today had Ingmar Bergman not gone on to remake virtually the same film countless times over the rest of his career.In ""Seal,"" Max von Sydow sits down to a game of chess with the Grim Reaper and seeks answers to the meaning of life, existence of God, and so on and so forth. If you've seen one Bergman film, you've seen them all. The poor man put a lot of effort into exploring life's BIG issues but never seemed to get any closer to an answer about any of them. As I've become a more sophisticated movie watcher, I find Bergman's style nearly intolerable. His films are airless and stifling, and hopelessly pretentious. It's been a long time since I've seen ""The Seventh Seal,"" and maybe I would have a better opinion of it on a second viewing, but frankly, I would rather watch ""Snakes on a Plane"" than watch this film again.One of the famous images in this film is the shot of the Reaper leading a dance of death across a stark hillside.

25,StevePulaski,One of foreign cinema's finest films,9,6 August 2012,"If a mainstream film, or any type of film for that matter, were to tackle as many themes and morals as Ingmar Bergman's legendary Seventh Seal, it would most likely be an uneven, unpolished work, and not even come close to the realm of depth this film can accomplish so elegantly and calmly. This is the kind of picture that, when it's done, you want to immediately rewatch it because you know there are things that you missed.Our story concerns a disillusioned knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, who gives one of cinema's finest performances) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), who return home after fighting in the Crusades on an empty, desolate beach. Sweden has been victim to the plague, meaning those that have it are dying right before people's eyes, and those who don't have it are engulfed in fear. It isn't long before Block encounters the personified ""Death"" (Bengt Ekerot), who appears pale - in a black cloak - much like early, vague illustrations of the Grim Reaper character. Immediately, Block, confused about life and death itself, challenges Death to a game of chess, where if he wins, he will be spared his life.Block and Jöns, en route back to their castle, encounter Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son, Mikael, who are stage actors in a play. From here on out, the film takes us on an unforgettable ride, as we follow both Block and Jöns's journeys throughout the middle age time period and what unfolds than is a rousing commentary on religion, life, and death.The film has the look of a period piece, but with the contents of serene drama and utter bleakness with the nice surprising inclusion of black comedy. The Seventh Seal too asks existential questions about the world around us in a manner that isn't indulgent, and offers many assumptions in its underlying text. Frequently, we see our character, Block, as hopeless and seemingly unimportant in life. He questions religion so much, and with all the mentions of death (even the appearance) we begin to wonder if he is inherently godless or atheistic in his personality.Often, the film provides us with tonal inconsistency, but it has to be the smoothest tonal inconsistency I have yet to experience. It isn't abrupt, and Bergman successfully manages to hold onto the flow of the story, never becoming too tied up with one of the underlying contexts over the other, and is fair and balanced in his work, including much of his dialog which is not cloyingly absent or annoyingly expository. It is perfectly handled and structured with elegance and purity.The Seventh Seal is one of the strongest foreign works of all time, and a film with enough on its plate to develop three or four movies. Ingmar Bergman's sharp director, distinct and graphic writing style, complimented by the cinematography of the great Gunnar Fischer bring the energy, sophistication, and true delight that is The Seventh Seal. And even with all of these heavy topics at hand, never is it depressingly grim or overly optimistic.Starring: Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, and Nils Poppe. Directed by: Ingmar Bergman.",The Seventh Seal

27,sol1218,A Game of Chess,9,22 May 2005,"***SPOILERS*** Traveling back to his castle in Scandinavia Christian Knight Antonius Block, Max Von Sydow, has seen enough death and horror in the Crusade that he went on into the Holy Land, where he fought the last ten years. The Crusades took almost all the faith that he had in man as well as his belief in God out of him. Together with his squire, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Block found that his native land as well as the whole of Western Europe is being ravaged by the Black Plague that's destroying even more lives that the Crusades. Block begins to wonder if the plague is God's retribution to man for the evils that he committed over the centuries. Block and his squire have another person traveling with them through the hills and forests and along the coast of Sweden and he was with them throughout their entire journey back home from the hell-fires of the Middle-East Death, Bengt Ekerot. Sensing who he is when Block sees him at the seashore he knows that his time has come but talks him into playing him a game of chess to for stall his eventual demise. Even more to get from Death the knowledge about good and evil and the existence of a God before he ends up at the tip of the Grim Reaper's scythe. The chess game goes on and off throughout the movie ""The Seventh Seal"" and as long as Block stays in the game he stays alive as well as those who he picked up with him in his going back home to his castle where his lovely wife Karin, Inga Lanogre, is waiting for him. Beautifully and eerily photographed and directed by Igmar Bergman ""The Seventh Seal"" show us how we can be deceived into thinking that what were told is good can easily turn out to be evil, by those whom we trust and believe in. Like in the case of the many thousands of men like Block who believed enough to be willing to give up their lives for it. Later in the film we see Raval, Bertil Anderbern, stealing the gold and silver jewelry off the dead to enrich himself. Raval was the local religious leader who's fiery speeches to go to Jerusalem and drive the unbelievers out of that holy city and the entire holy land. Reduced to being a Godless grave-robber and unfeeling liar Raval ends up falling victim to the very horror that he profited from in stealing from the dead: the plague. As it begins to look that Death is slowly winning his game of chess with Block and the end is almost near for him he in desperation goes to talk to this young woman, Maud Hansson, who's about to be burned at the stake for being a witch by the local townspeople. Block trying to find out if it's true that she can see and even communicate with the Devil feeling that if the Devil exists God has to exist too. Since one can't exist without the other. Mercyfully giving her a potion that would ease her pain from the torch and fire thats about to engulf her all Block gets from the woman is a mindless and empty stare as she awaits the horror thats about to end her short and so mournful life. ""The Seventh Seal"" is considered my many to be Bergmans best film and since he made it back in 1956 he never came close to making another motion picture, with the many fine movies that he made over the years since then, as good as it was and still is even now. The movie not only makes you wonder if there's any truth that God as well as good and evil exists but also makes you think about yourself and that final journey into the dark and great unknown that we all eventually will have to travel.",The Seventh Seal
28,Lejink,"Death takes knight, checkmate.",3,9 October 2014,"I suppose one has to view the reputed great classics of cinema to sort of test one's critical faculties against established standards and coming to this iconic film I was certainly aware of some of its famous imagery, in particular that of the soldier playing chess with Death, but nothing more than this. It does make for an arresting start to the film but after that I found it rather heavy going I must say.Once said soldier Max Van Sydow treks after the family of travelling performers, I struggled to make sense of the narrative as the film follows a picaresque trail of incidents such as as the backstage seduction of a fellow-performer's wife, the humiliation of the travelling husband at an inn and the death by fire of a young female witch. Where exactly are they all headed? Well, with Death silently and unobtrusively along for the ride, I think I get the inference; nobody lives forever.Mind you, I guess in all of it there's lots of stuff I'm still missing about faith, relationships, class, superstition and the human spirit, the meaning of life in short, but I'm afraid much of its symbolism passed me by. It is well shot in black and white and language-barrier notwithstanding appears to be well played with the actors certainly giving life to their individual characters, Van Sydow in particular, but I found the bitty, episodic development of the story as mystifying and unsatisfying as the higher allegorical meaning striven for.In fact the only really memorable scene for me was the chess match, which of course I knew about already, so really there was no need for me to watch the rest of it and I'm kind of sorry I did.Not my cup of tea, I'm afraid.",The Seventh Seal
29,ElMaruecan82,"A universal tale of faith and fate, of men hopelessly cheating Death, while insolently cheated by God...",10,5 June 2016,"A knight named Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returns from the Crusades, only to find his country ravaged by the Plague. He meets a strange, black robed figure (Bengt Ekerot) leaving no mystery about his identity, he's Death. Yet Antonius gets himself a suspended sentence by challenging Death to a chess game. Then comes the most iconic moment of ""The Seventh Seal"": the blonde Nordic knight and Death, face-to- face, a chessboard in the middle, and for us, viewers, readings as infinite as the ocean in the background.Ingmar Bergman doesn't just gratify us with one allegory through his personal take on the Grim Reaper, we also have the chess game symbolizing the eternal cat-and- mouse-like battle between men and death. After ten years of exile, fighting the Barbarians, Antonius must have cheated Death many times, but did that gave him all the answers to the meaning of life for all that? Did he perceived gratitude from the very God, in the name of which he expressed his bravura? With too many questions in mind, it is too soon to conclude his journey, a situation calling for a last attempt to cheat Death.The irony of Antonius' condition is that Death plays fairer than God on many levels, if only for its presence. We know Death, and God knew how to inculcate the fear and the knowledge of Death in medieval ages where you could either die by a sword, or a disease devouring your entrails. The context mirrors the pessimism that overflowed Europe after the Holocaust, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War. Being the son of a Lutherian priest enhanced Bergman's quest for answers transcending the rigor of burdensome certitudes, much more at a time that didn't leave much for optimism regarding the fate of humanity or should we say, faith?Indeed, how can be Death so ubiquitous, when the only 'being' that can help you to accept it is absent or expressionless. The absence of God, a recurrent theme in Bergman's movies is the source of Antonius' torment, one that echoes a similar character Von Sydow played in ""Winter Light"". Reviewing the film, I concluded that the existence of God was a part of human civilization, but his absence part of human condition. From Bergman's standpoint, this is illustrated by the way each character's behavior and personality derive from a personal relationship (or lack of) with God. ""The Seventh Seal"" is also a character study, evoking many interpretations of the value of Death and life.And as the cynical relief of Antonius's interrogations, there's his disillusioned squire, Jons, played by Gunnar Björnstrand. Jons is a more disillusioned and careless character, the sight of a corpse inspires no prayer or religious questioning, only macabre humor and what is left of his faith is shaken when he finds a painter drawing scary portraits in a church and Raval (Bertil Anderberg) the very theologian who sent him to the Crusade, stealing a dead's bracelet and about to rape a villager (Gunnel Lindblom). The priest-turned-thief, dies later of the plague, probably infected by the bracelet he stole. Incarnating corrupted religion, as he got a taste of his own medicine, ironically proving that God (or Death) wasn't that senseless.The film features more sympathetic characters: Jof (Nils Poppe) actor and juggler is married with the beautiful Mia (Bibi Andersson) and together they have a little boy. The family provides a much needed escapism from an upsetting reality, and for the first time, makes Antonius smile and forget about his torment. Enjoying the sunshine, the sight of Mia and her boy, he savors some wild strawberries and a bowl of fresh milk. He'll remember that moment, he says, and at this time, it is impossible not to make a connection with a similarly existential Bergman's film of the same year ""Wild Strawberries"", illustrating the cathartic value of good memories. The two films, elevated Bergman's standing as a major international director and were also meant as personal catharsis, curing from self-questioning at least, temporarily.Indeed, even a joyful actors' show is interrupted by a cortege of people whipping themselves, carrying a cross and planning to burn a witch, as purification from God's anger. And Antonius' quest for truth is so desperate that he even tries to find the Devil in the witch so he can question him, but he only finds terror and emptiness in her eyes. That's the most provocative and thrilling irony of the film, for all the supernatural presence of Death, of Jon's visions of Mary and baby Jesus, for our total suspension of disbelief, God remains Silent. The closest to his representation is the very title of the film, an extract from the Revelation, evoking the silence of God after the lamb opened the seventh seal. And that Seventh Seal is the start of what would become the backbone of a colossal oeuvre, a photogenic brainstorm about the meaning of existence. Some would call it 'pretentious'? Actually, Bergman has no pretension to bring any satisfying answer, except that we should enjoy the suspended sentence given by life. Not everyone who encounters Death in the film deserves it, not everyone reacts stoically, some protest, some are scared, others embrace it with an illuminated smile. But even within its haunting climax, Bergman doesn't forget to keep a cinematic effect, and manage to cheat death in order to provide a sort of 'happy ending'.Because ""The Seventh Seal' is also a cinematic journey, whose first and penultimate shots, (parodied countless times, becoming in fact a trope of art films) translated into cinematic language the moral turmoil of centuries, still relevant today in a world of doubts and uncertainty. Actually, the film might be still relevant in a future as distant to our present as Middle Ages is now, if there's still humanity at that time, this is how timeless and universal ""The Seventh Seal"" is. And how essential it is, because it asks essential questions.",The Seventh Seal
30,paul2001sw-1,Death laughs last,8,1 November 2008,"In a land ravaged by pestilence, superstition and death, Max von Sydow plays chess with a personification of the latter; this is what everyone knows about Ingmar Bergman's legendary film 'The Seventh Seal'. What comes as a surprise it that the movie's most iconic image comes in the very first scene; that the philosophical debates take the form of wisecracks; and that Max von Sydow's character is actually among the least interesting in the story. Indeed, with a measure of (deliberate) overplaying, a mediaeval setting and some surprisingly bawdy and direct humour, the film even resembles one of Shakespeare's comedies, albeit an unusually black one. The sub-plot about a group of actors making a play about death, a story within a story, seems especially Shakespearian. I'm not sure this is really a great film, but it manages to be consistently bold and surprisingly entertaining. Even though death, played with superb understatement by Bengt Ekerot, always gets the last laugh.",The Seventh Seal
31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Portentous yet intriguing.,6,24 October 2019,"Death is the major theme of this 'The Seventh Seal (1957)', with the great plague backdrop acting as an apocalyptic omen for almost everyone involved. The piece is dripping with portent, a low-key but tangible melancholy that's almost oppressive. It's bleak, for sure. It's certainly not fun. Of course, it isn't supposed to be. Instead, it aims to tackle its taboo head-on. It doesn't provide easy answers, with the spectre of the grim reaper seeming to exist entirely separately from any from of God. The search for God is also a major theme. Each character has a unique relationship with their faith, which evolves over the course of the plot. No view is ever expressed as 'right'; it's simply what the character believes. The overall result of the picture is downbeat, despite some moments of hope. Though it feels loose and segmented, it undeniably has an effect. It leaves you with a melancholy that's difficult to explain. In the moment, however, it's never hugely engaging. It's not bad, but it doesn't really connect with you on a conscious level. Obviously, it must resonate in some way in order to leave you feeling the way it does. It's just that the cold, meditative discussions that make up its narrative aren't often all that compelling. Neither are the odd set-pieces which actually feel somewhat 'random'. It has its moments and isn't constantly grim. When the portentous stuff gets more overt, it's really effective. A scene of mass self-harm is genuinely rather upsetting, for example. Thankfully, the piece doesn't always deal in overt sadness. The previously mentioned moments of hope help to elevate its dour effect, making for a relatively rounded experience. In the end, its message is about acceptance rather than doom. No matter which way you cut it, though, it's still quite bleak. At least it has the guts to tackle something that most people actively try to avoid. As I said, it's not fun. 6/10",The Seventh Seal
32,gbill-74877,Magnificent,10,20 May 2016,"Few images in film surpass that of the knight Antonius Block playing chess with Death by the sea at the beginning of Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'. Also fantastic are the scenes of him asking for knowledge of God in a confessional, and the danse macabre on the hillside at the end. This film established Bergman on the international film scene, and while it may not be perfect, it will always be one of my favorites.A knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Björnstrand) have returned from the Crusades to find Sweden ravaged by the plague. Under the torpor and ignorance of religion, the people flagellate themselves and blame and burn a witch. Death is all around, even in the form of a mask used by a troupe of circus performers, which include an innocent young married couple (Nils Poppe and Bibi Andersson) and their small child. It's the Dark Ages but the things we find are timeless: cruelty, hypocrisy, lust, and yet also the simplicity of love and the quest for God, however ridiculous His absence may seem. We see the knight faithful to the end, trying to give his life meaning by saving others, and his squire cynical of it all. ""I could have purged your worries about eternity,"" the squire says, ""but now it's too late. But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!"" Death is a certainty and he makes his presence felt, but where is God? Death himself has no answers to this, and wisely, neither does Bergman. Life simply goes on without us, and we must hold fast to sweet memories while they last. Magnificent.A couple of passages This is the exchange at the confessional: Block: I want to confess as best I canbut my heart is void. The void is a mirror. I see my faceand feel loathing and horror. My indifference to men has shut me out. I live now in a world of ghostsa prisoner in my dreams. Death: Yet you do not want to die. Block: Yes, I do. Death: What are you waiting for? Block: Knowledge. Death: You want a guarantee. Block: Call it what you will. Is it so hard to conceive God with one's senses? Why must He hide in a midst of vague promisesand invisible miracles? How are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves? What will become of us who want to believe, but cannot? And what of those who neither will nor can believe? Why can I not kill God within me? Why does He go on living in a painful,humiliating way? I want to tear Him out of my heartbut He remains a mocking realitywhich I cannot get rid of. Do you hear me? Death: I hear you. Block: I want knowledge. Not belief. Not surmise. But knowledge. I want God to put out His handshow His face, speak to me. But He is silent. I cry to Him in the dark, but there seems to be no one there. Perhaps there is no one there. There life is a senseless terror. No man can live with Death and know that everything is nothing. Death: Most people think neither of Death nor nothingness. Block: Until they stand on the edge of life and see the Darkness. Death: Ah, that day. Block: I see. We must make an idol of our fearand call it God.And this while eating strawberries with milk, the sweetest scene in the movie, with Block remembering his youth and pledging to remember this moment with his new friends: ""We were newly-married. We played and laughed. I wrote songs to her eyes. We hunted, we danced, the house was full of life.  To believe is to suffer. It is like loving someone in the darkwho never answers. How unreal that is in your company. It means nothing to me now.  I shall remember this hour of peacethe strawberries, the bowl of milkyour faces in the dusk. Michael asleep, Joseph with his lute. I shall remember our wordsand shall bear this memory between my handsas carefully as a bowl of fresh milk.""",The Seventh Seal
33,Cineanalyst,The Seventh Art,10,1 January 2021,"Quintessential European art film reminding us that we're all going to die while God is silent though it is, ""The Seventh Seal"" is typical of Ingmar Bergman's oeuvre in being visually striking, and it might just feature the most dramatic narrative construction from his career--and one of the most impressive in film history. There's an entire chess board of pieces and game of moves going on in the plotting. It's sublime how all the subplots and themes efficiently come together in the taut journey and every part entangled and multi-layered: the repetition of the titular sevens quotation from the Book of Revelations and even complemented by an emphasis on dissolves at the beginning and near the end; the multitude of Deathly imagery from Death himself and his guises to painted image, mask and skull; cuckoldry and dance on and off stage; the proscenium arch of the stage and shore, the frame of the fresco and prisoner stocks; and the seven plots of the knight and his squire, the troupe of performers, the thief and the mute housekeeper, the cuckold blacksmith and his wife, the procession of flagellants, the witch burning, and the chess game with Death. Largely, all the seven arts are here, too: actors playing actors, song and dance, the danse macabre of the church fresco, as well as all the rest of the architecture and Christian iconography and the Good Book--until it all goes up in the flames of a sight analogy in search of the seventh art that is motion pictures.This is such an all-time-great masterpiece that I don't care to harp on my reason for revisiting it as part of my seeking out a bunch of pandemic-related movies during a real-world plague; that's only part of the religious musings that comprise the trappings of the tale, which is secondary to how that story is told. I also don't wish to get overly into one of my favorite metaphors of film as death, although it is, of life stilled in a series of images reanimated in a projected afterlife on screen. That, even before film, as I mentioned in my review of the Lumière ""Dancing Skeleton"" (1897/98), persisted in screen projections of danse macabre in Christiaan Huygens's magic lantern, the dancing skeleton slide of Beale's Choeutoscope and in the ghastly imagery of Robertson's Phantasmagoria.Because this is Shakespearean, or the Swedish equivalent in narrative complexity of classical 1940s and 1950s cinema of ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) or ""Rashomon"" (1950). Much imitated but never surpassed. Stylistically, there's even the ambiguity of the obscured sunlight here from one and the extreme foregrounding of figures for pan-focused shots from the other. Gunnar Fischer's cinematography is uniformly excellent, aptly and hauntingly in black and white, although the dolly movements on Death and the striking scenery, such as the rocky beach, have become iconic for good reason. The death dance silhouette also gets considerable attention, but I think the most telling moment is of the return gaze upon the cinematographic apparatus that is Death.Two arguments to note here in favor of this film as obliquely about itself as the seventh art involve this final meeting with Death before the dance and that the character with visions and who thus does not need confront the cinematic gaze is an artist, the actor and juggler husband from the traveling troupe of performers. Unlike the knight and at least different from the witch, he sees and is faithful and acts upon those visions--something of the on-screen surrogate filmmaker. We, the spectator, however, mostly identify with the character of Max von Sydow's knight, who as the main protagonist is strongly associated with the camera's gaze. Thus, note that when the camera is finally most strongly associated through Death with our gaze upon the screen that the only character who refuses to return that gaze, to look into the mirror, is Antonius Block. To do so would truly be annihilation--the disassociation of identification with the spectator and an acknowledgement of being a mere flickering shadow on a screen. This is the search for seeing God, the face of death.",The Seventh Seal

Perhaps a film about a man avoiding taxes would have been more amusing. This film is episodic rather than having a narrative flow. It seems Bergman made a checklist of all the important themes and made sure he touched each one: love, marriage, infidelity, family, society, crime, punishment, and, of course, god and death. It is populated with Bergman regulars, including von Sydow as a knight who spews platitudes every time he opens his mouth. The cinematography is impressive. Otherwise, it's tough going for those who are not Bible scholars.",The Seventh Seal
38,briancham1994,Bleak and metaphorical,7,2 April 2021,"This film is the epitome of the European art film, a sombre meditation on a serious philosophical topic. Here we have the personification of death playing chess with a knight, the infamous prototypical scene parodied many times since. Here we have a range of contrasting figures against a backdrop heavily tinged with death. The knight grapples with the existence of God, his squire is cynical about it all, the actors are just trying to get by, a woman is burned at the stake and the townspeople have a variety of reactions, from the dramatic flagellants to the drunken tavern-goers. All of this takes place in the Middle Ages when meaning has eroded and the Black Death is decimating the country. Overall, the film explores the inevitability of death using stunning visual metaphors and suggests that there are not necessarily any answers to be found about God and death.",The Seventh Seal
39,Rodrigo_Amaro,Absolutely and undoubtedly great!,10,22 April 2012,"Salutations from the dawn! Words aren't enough to describe how powerful is the experience of testifying ""Det Sjunde Inseglet"" (""The Seventh Seal"") but I'll do my best. Ingmar Bergman's most celebrated work, admired and indirectly copied by many (the figure of Death created here was imitated in countless productions), remains as an essential work, one of a kind. It's something that will never lose its importance, it'll always be relevant no matter the decade, the century or whatever because it works themes that are the main doubt of the human race since its existence, the issue that few are open to discuss all knowing that is going to happen one day: death. Even though it's not everyone who can admire films like these but certainly no film lover out there can't miss such precious treasure. The Apocalypse is coming or so it seems to be. In a medieval period the plague is devastating an entire population, that part of the world is crumbling to pieces and there's no much love and compassion among people. It's there in this world that also lives the knight Antonious Block (Max von Sydow, brilliant) and his loyal and sarcastic squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), both returning from some hard battles in the Crusades. But when Death (Bengt Ekerot, fantastic and very memorable) appears to take Antonious to the other world, the knight decides to challenge Death into a Chess match, trying to bargain his staying on Earth. If Block wins he'll live longer; otherwise he'll die, the most frightening thing that can ever happen to a living being, his end. Between this game, there's plenty of moments with the knight exposing his doubts and fears, his confusion in trust between God or Devil, to whom appeal in order to stay alive, putting his faith in a complete doubt but still praying, wishing, wanting answers. ""I cry to Him in the dark but there seems to be no one there"" painfully cries this noble knight, trying to believe in something, just as much as when he searches for a so-called witch responsible for bringing the Black Plague to the city. The man is pure agony and he desperately needs to know his destiny (just like we all do since the pre-historic man). Posing infinite questions and providing very few answers, Bergman makes of the first apocalyptic film ever made a remarkable study that resonates like a Shakespeare work whose main purpose is to better reveal our human condition, our anxieties, our fears, our everlasting wishes for a purpose, and our doubts between this and that, all of this marked with poetry, passion and a complete artistic view of things. It's an relevant and poignant work dealing with real issues but perfectly adding supernatural elements to the story. It is an melancholic, dark, grim, somewhat depressive film that doesn't go easy on the viewer. The harder the better, more views you'll wanna do it (and you'll love doing so). The author talks about faith and God without evoking religion or certain beliefs and fanaticism (even though the main characters fought in the Crusades, so there's some Catholic perception here but that's it), and we can't blame this quoting Bergman was an atheist. And if so, he was perhaps the most believer between the atheists (check his remark about God in the last lines of ""Through a Glass Darkly"", the finest description of what God's love is, so far from what priests and others tend to tell people about). In short, ""The Seventh Seal"" works controversial themes without being controversial, without causing hysteria or angered reactions by audiences. About the film as a work of art: splendid from minute one, with that famous opening with Death appearing to Antonious on the shore, where he receives the warning that he must die, evolving to the chess game. The beautiful yet oppressive cinematography of Gunnar Fischer, the way he uses darkness, lighting and effects are a must-see. Also the formidable and very expressive casting, all outstanding. Special credit must be given to Bengt Ekerot and his terrifying (at times very humorous) appearance as the scariest of all presences among the living, very tricky, with soft voice but wrapped in darkness and mystery. The screenplay is fantastic, very enigmatic and very thoughtful, drenched in poetry, lyricism, fantasy. And we all smile at the ending with this wonderful job. 10/10",The Seventh Seal
40,eddie_baggins,A compelling classic that examines life and death,9,3 February 2021,"One of the most well known and talked about films of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's famed career, The Seventh Seal is a contemplative and intriguing musing on life, death and faith as the filmmaker and son of a priest explores his own questions and thoughts around a fascinating battle of wills between Max Von Sydow's knight Antonius and Bengt Ekerot as death himself.A fantastical take on the age old question of life and death, as death decides to verse Antonius in a battle of chess that turns into an examination of many more components when Antonius and his offsider Jons find the land they once knew well changed for the worse after they have battled for years in the vicious holy wars of the era, Seal is a unique beast and one that never ceases to enthrall as we are taken on a cross country journey into the heart and minds of those battling their issues of faith.Most well known to modern audiences for his parts in The Exorcist, Ghostbusters 2 and Flash Gordon, Seal provides the late Von Sydow with his best singular acting performance with the well-liked performer able to provide Antonius with the exact right amount of vulnerability and smarts as he comes to terms with his fears and troubles headfirst during his dalliance's with Death.In one key scene Antonius is confessing his thoughts and feelings to what he believes is a priest only to find out he has been confessing to death, trying to outsmart him and understand his strategy at beating him in their life or death game of chess, its a fabulous scene, brilliantly shot by Bergman but its Von Sydow's performance here that will stick with you long after the film has concluded.As is to be expected from a Bergman film, Seal looks wonderful in its black and white aesthetic and the way in which it captures the Black Plague era in which the film is set makes this a moddy and atmospheric piece of cinema that has failed to be affected by age as its ageless themes and explorations remain so relevant still to this day.Final Say -A film that is served best by multiple viewings, The Seventh Seal is a powerful piece of cinema that is deservedly recognized as one of Bergman's greatest singular feats.4 1/2 crows out of 5",The Seventh Seal

43,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Bergman's depressive, Byzantine and intricate speech on ultimatum of Death",7,18 July 2020,"The Seventh Seal (1957) :
Brief Review -Bergman's depressive, Byzantine and intricate speech on ultimatum of Death. Seriously, Ingmar Bergman scores hell of a philosophy every time that i wonder from where did he get those ideas. The Seventh Seal talks about a terrifying issue like Death which we all fear of, and then it also talks about a Human finding the truth behind death and meaning of his life before meeting the ultimatum of death. It's a story about a Knight who meets death and challenges for a Chess game aspiring that he would escape death. But while the game is on he realises the ultimate truth that ""Nobody Escapes Death"" and finds himself fearing to death and asks God to help whom he never believed. The storyline is quite simple purportedly but has lot of deep discoveries about human life and death inside. It is just a matter of not overlooking them. If you overlook them then there is nothing in this film for you, you don't have wait till the end you can easily quit anytime you want. The narrative of the film is very fictitious and set in religious fantasies so there is no need to take it seriously and feel depressed even thought it looks and feels very depressing. Despite the slow screenplay the film doesn't lose it's context and the dialogues are spiritually allegorised. Performances by Bengt Ekerot, Max von Sydow and Gunnar Björnstrand are notable. Cinematography is of qualifying art nature. Director Ingmar Bergman tried to find out some deatiled and unknown facts of life by providing the theme like ultimatum of death which was a great idea, and somehow he did succeed. The only problem with the film is it is dark toned and intricate which might just cause to lose grip somewhere in the Middle. Apart from that, there's is nothing wrong about The Seventh Seal when it comes to Art cinema so do watch it if such films appeal you.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",The Seventh Seal
44,l_rawjalaurence,A classic that lasts for all time,8,17 September 2008,"I just saw ""The Seventh Seal"" in its original Swedish without the benefit of subtitles. Although I do not understand the language, I found Bergman's tale of religious skepticism, with undoubted echoes of medieval and Renaissance dramas, morality plays and famous western classics such as ""Dr. Faustus"" absolutely riveting. Bergman was the master of the mise-en-scene; his ability to create cinematic pictures using the minimum of cinematic resources was unrivaled. Unlike today's directors of period dramas, he realized that to recreate an historical period was not simply done by spending thousands of dollars on sets and costumes, but rather depended on the selection of individual props and the telling focus on individual images (for example, the horse standing in the background in several scenes, or the moment involving the flagellants singing the ""Dies Irae""). In terms of cost, the film is low-budget, strongly reminiscent of the B Pictures produced in Britain and the US during the middle part of the twentieth century. In terms of style, however, the film is the work of a genius. I confidently predict it will stand the test of time for another half century to come.",The Seventh Seal
45,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Compellingly addresses art's toughest subjects: life, death and God",8,29 July 2009,"""The Seventh Seal"" is a very literary film, one weighted by philosophical dialogue and thought-churning imagery. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman bravely goes where few filmmakers have ever dared to go in their lifetimes: contemplating death and the existence of God. So few would feel comfortable meditating on such heavy subjects, but Bergman does it uniquely and without coming off as pretentious or preachy.Taking place in the Middle Ages, this black and white 1957 Swedish film follows the knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) on his way back from the Crusades in the height of Europe's Black Plague. There might not be a grimmer time in history for Bergman's story, perfect for bringing Death in as a character, depicted in his black robe with scythe in hand. Antonius, who sees Death coming for him, challenges him to a game of chess in attempt to prolong his life and get some answers about existence before he dies viewing life as a complete waste.The film's language is dense, though not quite Shakespearian. All the characters appear to play a critical role and there are many: Antonius' squire Jons, the happy family of traveling actors, Jof, Mia and their baby Mikael, another actor Jonas Skat and the Blacksmith Plog and his promiscuous wife Lisa. All of these characters' lives are in jeopardy from the plague and each brings something knew to the very fragile and contemplative Antonius. Much of the dialogue speaks directly about life, death and longing for knowledge of God -- there's definitely no surprise that Bergman made his story a play first.There are lots of Christian and Medieval Christian tones to the story, with the title coming from a revelation and flagellants whipping themselves in belief that the plague was sent as God's punishment. It's a bleak film with the exception of the young couple with their baby performing musical acts and expressing their love for each other. In Bergman's posed questions about why we exist, it's clear his own thoughts on the answer revolves around love and its mysterious power and eternal optimism.Light-hearted and comical at times as any good Shakespeare will do, ""The Seventh Seal"" offers multiple avenues for some serious and enthralling discussion. It definitely requires attentive eyes and ears, especially for those not fluent in Swedish, because at times it's nearly impossible to both watch Bergman work as a director and soak in the meaning of the words. It is quite easily one of film's more intellectually stimulating movies.",The Seventh Seal

47,jzappa,One of the Most Profound and Important Films I've Ever Seen,10,13 May 2007,"The Seventh Seal has an odd tone. It feels cheery and comical, and yet it's themes and statements are so serious and profound. Bergman's blurring of comedy and tragedy is very effective, because considering what the movie is saying, irony in feeling and mood is vital.The plot seems as if it's a glum farce, as a knight plays for his life in a chess game against personified Death. It is weaved gracefully and mysteriously with symbolisms and metaphors in seemingly very direct scenes of great power, about whether death is escapable or not, and though one can plot against it, the plot may only be a stall for time. The film's tragicomic duality is projected throughout the film, as it has very prominent themes of denial of the prospect of God's nonexistence against the darkly satirical setting: The end of the Crusades in a naive, plague-torn village, a time when faith in God was something stringently and daftly policed.The Seventh Seal leaves a great impact upon me, and the cinematography, as subtle as it is, is one of the things about it I love the most. The silent symbolisms, the quiet effects, and especially the silhouetted dance of death on the hill are quite powerful. This could also be one of the best performances I've seen from Max Von Sydow.It is one of the true deservedly hailed masterpieces of the movies, and I will see it again several times.",The Seventh Seal
48,Vartiainen,"Jag är Döden. (""I am Death."")",8,30 January 2017,"Thus begins Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece Det sjunde inseglet, or The Seventh Seal if you prefer. A Crusader knight Antonius Block has returned to his home country Sweden with his squire Jöns to find it ravaged by the plague. Immediately upon their arrival Antonius meets Death and promptly challenges him to a game of chess with his very life as the stakes. From there we follow his journey across the land towards his castle where he believes his lovely wife to be waiting.The Seventh Seal is an epic. From the very first scene with Death standing on a rocky beach and sitting across from a disillusioned knight, we enter the realm of myths and legends. The scenes in the movie are somewhat disjointed. We might go from a prolonged scene of travelling actors playing roosters on a stage to a march of flagellants, religious fanatics whipping themselves bloody to earn salvation. Yet they all talk about much of the same thing. Why are we here? And now that we are here, what are we doing with the life given to us?The movie also ponders upon the so called silence of God. Why we have to live in uncertainty? Why the requirement for salvation is unquestioning faith? How are we supposed not to fear death when we have no guarantees. Antonius Block struggles with these very questions and the people travelling with him represent the different kinds of answers one might receive. None of them are hundred percent correct. Or perhaps they are, depending on your point of view. The movie lays down the questions and some of the possible answers, but in the end it's up to you.It's also a very impressive film visually, especially given the budget. Death, played by Bengt Ekerot, is especially memorable. His figure with a dark cape and a black cowl, almost monk-like in appearance, is one of the definitive images of Death in popular culture. And for a reason. Every scene he and Antonius share together is heavy, filled to the brim, trembling.The Seventh Seal was not at all what I expected, but then they so rarely are. Most definitely worth a watch for multitude of reasons, from the imagery to the themes to the story.",The Seventh Seal
49,Captain_Couth,Top ten favorites. The Seventh Seal.,10,19 November 2003,"Seventh Seal (1957) is one of my favorite movies. I have to rank it up there with A Touch of Zen, Seven Samurai and Battleship Potemkin. If there ever was such a thing as a perfect film, this one would have to be a nominee. I've never seen such a picture (and I probably never will) that was so moving, well shot, written, acted and directed. The chess game between the knight and death is an all-time classic. Words cannot describe how great this film is. There will never be another one like it. Truly amazing piece of celluloid.A knight and his squire are returning home from the crusades. For the past few years he's been in the middle east fighting for Christ. On his trip home he notices a familiar face, one that he has seen many times on the battlefield. It is death and it wants him to come with him to his new home. The knight strikes a bargain with death, they'll play a game of chess if he can defeat death then he'll spare his life as well as the squire's. Death is amused by this unusual challenge and accepts it. But as long as the game is on the life will continue to live. So he uses this time to look back at life and realizes how precious it is. Along the way he meets a young couple, they're from a performing troupe. They have a baby and are content with life. The husband has visions and can see interesting things like the Virgin Mary and little Jesus. He can also see the darkness that lies ahead as Black Death ravages the countryside. Will the knight defeat Death? Can the couple weather the storm of chaos that lies ahead? To find out you'll have to watch The Seventh Seal, one of the finest films ever made.If Bergman never made another film this one would have made him a legendary film maker. But he continued to make even more classic cinema. This one however is his finest work.My highest recommendation possible.",The Seventh Seal
50,freemantle_uk,Film as an art-form,10,7 January 2010,"The Seventh Seal is considered on of the best Swedish film ever, and Ingmar Bergman is certainly the most famous filmmaker out of that nation. The Seventh Seal is easily a great example of art-house film making done right.The Seventh Seal take place in Medieval period in Sweden with the Black Death is sweeping the land. Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has returned from the Crusades and a black clocked man who says he is Death (Bengt Ekerot) says he comes for him. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess, saying if he resists then lives and if he wins he is free. Antonius is allowed to travel and he goes with strong, clever, but less philosophical squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand). On the way Antonius and Jöns form a entourage, including a husband and wife acting team Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their one-year-old son Mikael, a deaf girl (Gunnel Lindblom) that Jöns saves and a blacksmith Plog (Åke Fridell) whom wife just left him. As the game continues Death watches and tries to trick Antonius, and he takes an interest in the young family. Antonius needs to save the family so their could live their lives.This is a very thematic film, with a focus on the ideas of loss of faith, debates whether God exist and of course, the continuing threat of death. They is excellent dialogue in throughout the film, some of actually a little witty. It also looks at the issues with intelligence and in detail, but in a accessible manner as well. Bergman takes great care with the imaginary in the film. He uses the art of Albertus Pictor who was influenced by the aftermath of the Black Death: his painting often focused on death. He also took great care with his scenes, often using long continuous shots, allowing them to evolve naturally. Bergman also picks the 14th Century as his setting. This is not pretending to be historically accurate film like Braveheart was making itself out to be. But it adds to then scenes of death affecting the world and how pessimistic people were. It also had interesting sub-plots and ideas like Flagellants going to the village. Bergman's direction was excellent through out the film, and shows that he was a real artist.The acting is excellent. This was on of Max von Sydow's first big roles, and he shows the disillusionment in this character. Gunnar Björnstrand was very good as strong, loyal character who didn't think about the grander scheme of live. He just continues with live and had a decent heart, but is willing to use violence. Bengt Ekerot had a good sense of menace as Death.A excellent, tort film that is a must see for film fans.",The Seventh Seal
51,Polaris_DiB,Imaging Death,9,21 February 2006,"This is one of those movies, like Seven Samurai, where you watch it for the first time, following one character, and suddenly not-quite-midway through you realize that every character is important and intricately linked into the progression and exposition of the story and themes, so you know before you've even finished that you need to watch it again.One of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term ""blatant"" as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death. I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.So I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it. Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him. One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, ""I saw it in a painting."" Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD. A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before. Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.Thus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force. By showing that other people ""draw"" Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.Then we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.--PolarisDiB",The Seventh Seal
52,ackstasis,"""I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams.""",9,8 April 2007,"Death is a beautiful thing. He stands upon a rocky beach shore  tall, proud, inescapable  his gaunt face staring expectantly towards his next victim. War-weathered knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, ""The Exorcist"") is not surprised to see him. The Black Death has already descended upon Sweden, killing all in its path, inciting terror in every village. ""I have long walked at your side,"" proclaims Death. ""That I know,"" is Block's reply. He understands that his time has now come, but he fears death. He cannot undertake what he does not understand. Is there a God? Following death, will he experience the rewards of Heaven, or the vast emptiness of nothing. Block likens faith in God to ""loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" His faith is lost; he cannot move on until he has decided upon his beliefs.Desperate for several more days to come to terms with his faith, Block challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a game of chess. His opponent is actually quite a skillful chess player, but the knight hopes to be able to hold him off for long enough to acquire the ""knowledge"" that he so desires. And so Block, accompanied by his brave and loyal squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), strikes off to see his wife just one final time, each day bringing him several moves closer to the end. Meanwhile, a small travelling troop of actors, comprising playfully-natured Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), their one-year-old son Mikael and partner Skat (Erik Strandmark), try to make ends meet through their theatrical performances. The paths of these two parties will eventually meet, and all those who travel alongside Antonius Block will risk suffering the same fate as he, should the fateful chess game prove unsuccessful.This being my first film from Ingmar Bergman, I was immediately astonished at how beautiful the film was. Whether it be the unforgettable close-ups of Death's ghostly white face and captivating gaze, two horses drinking solemnly from the ocean's edge, the ghastly procession of bloodied penitents who haul hefty wooden crosses and sacrificially flog themselves or the distant image of Death leading his followers in a Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) across a grassy mountain-top, 'The Seventh Seal' is brimming with beauty.The acting is absolutely stunning. Max von Sydow, the only name I recognised due to his significant later work in such films as Friedkin's 'The Exorcist (1973)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002),' is superb as Antonius Block, the knight who must decide who or what he believes in before his time runs out. Of the many representations of Death in cinema, Bengt Ekerot's portrayal in this film must be one of the finest  with his icy black stare, his arrogant and merciless manner and all sorts of devious trickery up his sleeves, 'The Seventh Seal's' Death has to be one of the most memorable villains of all time.Though not subtle in its symbolism by any standards, this directness is one of the film's strengths. By regarding good and evil with the same physical simplicity as its hero does, we are forced to make up our minds either way. Stunningly beautiful, endlessly thought-provoking, chilling and mesmerising, Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' is a masterpiece of existential cinema.",The Seventh Seal

The camera keeps zooming in here on actors' faces, but they mostly stand as mute as if they'd been silenced by THE SEVENTH SEAL (as well as the first six!).

On the other hand, while I appreciate the film's importance in cinema history, and the bravery with which it tackles the biggest of issues in a head-on, intellectual way, I find it just that – a very intellectual experience, devoid of much in the way of emotion. I also find some of the writing painfully preachy and on the nose. Yet, in the end, I admire what it accomplished in its time, and how well it holds up 53 years later.

Most of his films have provoked heated discussions from cinema fans regardless of the fact whether they have liked them or not.If one observes Ingmar Bergman's career closely it would be revealed that almost all of his films were based on themes which were close to his heart.No artist in the history of mankind has efficiently tackled death,faith,religion,male-female relationship,memories,suffering etc as it was done by Ingmar Bergman.Det Sjunde inseglet is one of those eclectic films which give hope,joy and trust in human faith.The Seventh Seal has been called an existentialist classic.This is true to some extent but for Bergman it was simply an affair of reaffirming his faith in the influence of religion on ordinary mortals.His influence was so great that even death had been given a human face.",The Seventh Seal
56,st-shot,Death match Medieval,8,8 September 2010,After ten years of futility in the Crusades Antonious Block and Squire Jon return home to be greeted by the plague and Death in its most recognizable human form. He has come for Block and the disparate group he travels with but is held up from this task when Block proposes a game of chess to avoid annihilation. Encountering communal responses to the plague as they travel along Block buys time clumsily attempting to stall the match after unwittingly revealing his game plan. This cinematic milestone may have lost a touch of its lustre over the years with a number of sharp homage parodies by the likes of Woody Allen and The Pythons but on it's own it remains a provocative examination of the meaning of life and ultimate fate seen from a variety of viewpoints. It is a film that begs introspection and while you may not identify with any of the characters it forces one to examine their own fate.Director Ingmar Bergman's script and imagery are rich in symbolism and his stock company of actors (especially Gunnar Bjornstrand's profane and cynical Squire Jon) up to the task in conveying their purpose of character. Bergman moves them like pieces in a game of chess but preserves their humanity through his signature close-ups and moments of occasional frivolity. Over half a century after it and a handful of other exports came to these shores and changed the way Americans looked at film The Seventh Seal today may show some of its age but it still retains the capability of being a very interesting conversation piece.,The Seventh Seal

58,yusufpiskin,Det sjunde inseglet,9,23 March 2020,"RIP Max von Sydow, 1929 - 2020Max von Sydow was one of the finest actors to ever emerge from the European festival circuit. His career began in Sweden but he catapulted to fame with his collaborations with director Ingmar Bergman. He is quintessential male Bergman lead, able to perfectly convey the sorrow and loss needed to fill out the silences in Bergman's simple, stark films. From the disillusioned knight of The Seventh Seal to the suicidal parishioner of Winter Light, through to the despondent souls of Bergman's late 60s trilogy (Shame, Hour of the Wolf, The Passion of Anna), von Sydow brought real legitimacy and relatability to Bergman's philosophical think-pieces.Of course, von Sydow's legacy transcended just being a key part of Bergman's symphony. He was one of Hollywood's greatest character actors for over 50 years. In which time, he played Jesus, fought Pazuzu in The Exorcist, and garnered himself 2 Academy Award nominations. He appeared in franchises like Ghostbusters, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones, and worked with directors like Spielberg, Scorsese, and Lynch. His breadth of work is almost unmatched and his talents almost unequaled.When a great actor dies, there is always a sadness to overcome. But in the case of von Sydow, I find myself particularly attached to his work. His early Bergman films were my first forays into arthouse cinema, they are what pushed me to first explore sites like Letterboxd. And his performances, of firm characters suffering with emotional weakness, are as compelling now as they have ever been. Without his remarkable ability to ground the spiritual films he was in, perhaps there would have not been a stepping stone for the uninitiated to enter the world of high art cinema.Death has finally won his chess match, but what a game it was.Max von Sydow, truly a legend.

59,rooprect,"Ladies & gentlemen, I give you the greatest feel-good movie for realists.",10,30 January 2021,"""Realists"" may not be the right word, but ""cynics"" doesn't fit either. I'm talking about people who are confused, frustrated, or just plain hopeless about the state of existence. Atheists, agnostics and even religious folks who are questioning their faith, yet who cannot be appeased by a Disney flick or a movie that ends with a hot air balloon as a philosophical salve, this movie is for you.Plot summary: Some time around 1350, during the Crusades, a weary and disillusioned knight returns to his home country after 10 years only to find it ravaged by the Black Plague and worse: the madness of men. In the opening scene Death comes for him, but our tricky knight goads Death into a game of chess for his soul. As they play the game over the course of several days, the knight uses this brief time to try to find out if god really exists--something which he believes can be done by accomplishing 1 meaningful act in an otherwise meaningless existence.Heavy stuff, right? It's like Camus' ""The Stranger"" and JD Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" and Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" all wrapped into one--in other words it's a careful balance of existentialism, altruism, insanity and religion rolled into one beautiful allegory. For that alone it's an absolute classic. But here's the part that's often overlooked: there's a lot of humor in this flick.In that respect, ""The Seventh Seal"" is not just a heavy, brooding, beard-stroking art film, but it has almost a playful, comedic Shakespearian vibe through it that keeps you entertained rather than reaching for the sharp metal objects. This wonderful humor is achieved through the use of colorful characters whom the knight encounters and travels with on his surreal anti-pilgrimmage. And if you're paying attention, you'll realize that each character represents a different philosophy with regard to gods, life and death.The knight's squire, Jöns, is completely faithless, jaded and cynical but with a good-natured spin, kinda like that favorite uncle of yours who isn't allowed to drink at family gatherings. They cross paths with a cheerful juggler, Jof, and his equally happy young wife, Mia, and their newborn child, and this trio represents raw optimism and faith--not necessarily in any god but in the idea that life is worth living. Then there is a very cryptic but ultimately pivotal character, a young silent girl (nameless) who doesn't say a word but whose facial expressions convey compassion, yearning and sadness. Then there's the blacksmith Plog, a stumbling, boisterous, drunken simpleton who can't seem to think beyond the moment. There is a terrified girl who is accused of being a witch and set to be burned at the stake, and she comes to represent an interesting delusional philosophy: brainwashed by the priests into thinking that she herself is evil but that Satan will protect her--and yet her ""faith"" is as effervescent as our hero the knight's faith in God.I could go on, but maybe you get the picture. ""The Seventh Seal"" is a fascinating portrayal of each facet of humanity when dealing with the horror of the unknown. The presentation is very heavy but with a lot of humanity, emotion and often humor to keep us entertained as we peel away the layers of belief (and non-belief).I'll skip the wordy analysis of cinematography and artistic presentation, and instead I'll just say: IT LOOKS MAGNIFICENT.As far as acting goes, this film has some of the most gripping performances I've ever seen on celluloid. There aren't really any dramatic, thunderous monologues à la George C. Scott in ""Patton"" or F. Murray Abraham in ""Amadeus"", but here the acting is captured by the camera lingering on the actors' faces. In particular, pay attention to the eyes. In one subtle yet overpowering scene, the knight asks Death what he knows about god. And Death replies ""I know nothing"" ...but pay close attention to the look in Death's eyes after he says this. It's the only time Death shows any hint of emotion, and I think director Bergman saved it all for that one fleeting look. Similarly, the young silent girl, the pivotal one I mentioned earlier, it's the look in her eyes at the end that gives this film its moneyshot. Bergman generously lets us absorb her eyes without any distractions, until there is no doubt as to what she feels and it's the perhaps the underlying message of this whole film.In the nearly 1000 reviews I've posted on imdb (yeah I really need to do something else with my life), I've only given a perfect 10 to a handful of films. Without hesitation, I give 10 stars to ""The Seventh Seal"".",The Seventh Seal
60,JoeKarlosi,The Seventh Seal (1957) **,5,8 February 2009,"Let me make this pretty quick -- a friend brought this Ingmar Bergman ""classic"" to the house last night (on Blu-ray), and it was my first experience with this acclaimed filmmaker. All I can say is, I was immediately struck by the cinematography, and I started getting interested in the idea of a knight (Max Von Sydow) playing chess with ""Death"" himself, as a means of deciding the fate of his own soul.... but that's as far as it went.From then on, nothing made much sense and the noble core idea of the film (presumably about questioning death, and the existence of God) seemed to go out the window, as we spend our time with secondary characters I just could not become interested in. I wanted to focus more on Max von Sydow's troubled crusader and his crisis of faith, especially since I myself am presently going through some personal bouts of despair in my personal life with my own crosses to bear... but he was only sparingly used, and I just could not follow any type of coherent storyline to this thing, for all its pretty picture style. There was no story, just images... and it's not that this approach never works for me in other films, but it didn't connect for me this time. I can't say that this is going to be my last visitation with Bergman, but this is not a promising start, considering this is allegedly one of his greatest works, if not THE greatest.

62,Enchorde,Dramatic,6,15 February 2010,"Recap: The knight Antonius Block and his squire has just returned from the crusades. The country is ravaged by the black plague. And on the shore Antonius meets Death, in person. Death tells him his time is due, but Antonius challenges him to a chess game, during which he is permitted to live. He searches for an answer, he wants to know if there is a God, if there is a reason why. The question haunts him. But on his journey home he meets the actors Jof and Mia, and their little son Mikael. They offer him some wild strawberries and for a few moments he find respite and peace, and when Death threatens Jof, Mia and Mikael too, Antonius knows that his chess game is their only chance.Comments: A legendary movie from a legendary director. This is a movie that created the stereotype of Death that has inspired, been reused and spoofed countless times. This is a must see movie, one you should have seen at least once in life. So I decided to watch it, despite the fact that my previous impressions of the Bergman movies I've seen have been less than favorable.My impression of this can be summarized in one simple word; dramatic. The story plays out in the frontier between life and death, the dialog is dripping with fate, and the black and white is very black and white, the contrasts being very emphasized. It's on the brink of going over the top but manages somehow to stay on the right side of the line. Antonius Block's mindset of the haunting fear and angst is evident throughout every aspect of the movie.I'm not really sure of how I feel about it. The rating and praise from the critics seem to be too much for me. It's not that good. But it wasn't bad either. It was not very entertaining, but it was interesting. It was dramatic.6/10",The Seventh Seal

Death appears, and the knight bargains with him for some more time to make sense of his life and his sorely tested faith in God. They play a game of chess, with his life as the stakes Perhaps Bergman's most famous film, Det Sjunde Inseglet is inaccurately thought of as a terminally gloomy and depressing piece, when in fact it seems to me to be quite a funny, almost life affirming film. It has some dreary moments (the flagellants' procession) and the central conflict between the pious Block and the atheistic Jöns is a little heavy going, but there are also many humorous observations and some outright comic scenes, like the one where Death cuts down the tree Skat is hiding in. As with all of Bergman's work, it deals with love, regret, relationships, a search for meaning and the absurdities of human nature. Each character is profound in its own way, such as the mute girl who can only summon the courage to speak when she knows her life is about to end. Björnstrand is terrific, as he is in so much of Bergman's work, and both Von Sydow (who was only in his mid-twenties) and Ekerot are hypnotically iconic, their chess game surely one of the most powerful and enduring visual metaphors in all of cinema. What impresses me most about the movie though is its seamless atmosphere. Much of it is cold and foreboding, but a lot of it is also sunlit and optimistic, such as the strawberry picnic scene. There are about fifteen main characters, each following a little plot thread of their own. It should all fall to bits and be disjointed, but it's not; under this gifted director's hand it all flows together beautifully, leaving a profound impression. This is one of those World Cinema classics which is essential viewing, and is never dull or a chore to sit through. Note the appearance of the medieval hymn Dies Irae, used to great gloomy effect in many fine movies (for example, Metropolis, Obsession, The Shining). The seven seals of the Bible appear in the Book of Revelations and generally symbolise the end of the world.

64,davidmvining,A plea to the silent Almighty,10,22 November 2019,"Here we have Bergman's best known movie. The one movie that broke through the cultural consciousness to leave an imprint most people take for granted. The vision of death playing chess, as said in the movie itself, was a common enough medieval subject for paintings, but our modern culture's image and the source comes straight from Antonious Block challenging Death to a game to extend his life.Another thing about the movie that has suffused the culture is the idea that the movie is dour. It has dour elements, but it's also surprisingly light and funny at times. Well, surprising if you're coming at the movie blind, but if you're knee deep in Bergman movies like I am right now, the light elements fit perfectly. Bergman was serious, but he wanted to entertain. I'm not just pulling that out of my ass. He said that his first aim was to entertain.Block, a knight just returned to Sweden from the crusades, and his squire Jons have just washed up on shore. The way they are laying there implies the remnants of a shipwreck, where Death arrives. Block makes his challenge in an effort to win his life, or, perhaps merely just extend it long enough to get back home. Along they way, they band together with several people. There's a small troupe of actors, a smith and his loose wife, and a young mute woman Jons takes on as his handmaiden. Along the way, as Block continues his game with Death, tricking and being tricked himself on the board, we see the little lives of these people. Jons is the most entertaining character because his nihilism is delivered so drily and with such wit that he's a joy just to watch. The comedy between the smith, his wife, and another actor (that Death ends up claiming) is a combination of physical comedy and witty repartee that provides some of the most concentrated elements of comedic relief in the film.But there are darker elements along the way as well. The country is in the middle of a plague, and people don't know who to blame or who to turn to for salvation. People scourge themselves in a procession where the leader chastises everyone else about the meaninglessness of their lives. There is a witch that the locals insist consorted with the devil and is the cause of the plague. Block's deepest moment of despair comes when he speaks to the witch, begging her for proof of the devil, for if the devil exists, so must God. But she cannot provide anything beyond crazed visions.Through it all, God is silent. It's a common theme in this era of Bergman's career. Every movie he made from about the mid-50s on touched on it, but The Seventh Seal is probably the most overt and vivid in its treatment of the idea. In the face of massive suffering, Block looks for any answer and sees nothing.But, that's not all. The troupe of actors becomes comprised of only three people, Jof, his wife Mia, and their son Mikael. Jof sees things. He has visions. When we first meet him, he has a vision of the Virgin teaching the Child how to walk as a toddler, but there's doubt about the truth of his visions. He admits to having concocted one in the past, but he insists that he didn't ask for these visions, someone gave them to him. Just before the whole party makes it to Block's castle deep in the forest, Jof has another vision, he sees Block playing chess with Death, and he takes Mia and Mikael away. They flee and hide in terror at the storm passing overhead, which he calls the flight of Death.At Block's castle, the remnants of the party meet Block's wife, and they begin a meal until Death arrives and claims them all. There are mixtures of emotions. Jons looks on firmly, ready to meet his end. The mute girl says her only line of dialogue in celebration of the end. Block cannot even look at Death and remains in profile in the background, his hands clasped together as he prays to God.The movie ends with Jof waking up after the terrible night to find a beautiful day. He begins to pack up Mia and Mikael when he has another vision, the other famous image of the Dance of Death. Death leads the party over a hill, each hand in hand, and they dance behind Death who leads them on. Is Jof a crazy person who just sees things? Or was he divinely touched in a way that saved him and his family from the end the rest of the party shared?Once again, it's Bergman begging for signs from God he can interpret. It's not a rejection of God, but a plea to hear something from the Supreme Being who treats him with nothing but silence.",The Seventh Seal

Again maybe this is a cultural gap issue between me and 1950s Sweden, but I fail to understand how Plog's stupidity can have a good impact to the whole story.

We are playing chess.""",8,4 June 2007,"Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, ""The Seventh Seal"" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: ""There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands"" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, ""Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life. Everything about ""The Seventh Seal"" is extra-ordinary including acting. I especially liked Jöns, Antonius Block's misogynist squire - the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Björnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious: ""Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love, but you don't die of it."" ""Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection."" I know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did (""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Persona"", ""Smiles of a Summer Night"") and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images, abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it, I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. (Not as anything is wrong with that). Woody Allen obviously thought the same. :)",The Seventh Seal

To this day, it is still the most terrifying film in cinema history. The second most terrifying is Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979). I saw both when they were released on the big screen.

70,bandw,Comments based on the Criterion Collection DVD,10,7 March 2012,"This movie has the weight of a Shakespearean tragedy and deserves its iconic status. While the main story line is rather grim, there is comic relief and brief moments of joy.In 14th century Sweden Antonius Block and his squire Jöns are on their journey home from the Crusades after a ten year absence. Their trip is played against a backdrop of the Black Death. Block and his squire represent two very different takes on life. Block constantly anguishes over the question of the existence of God--he looks for signs, but sees none. He makes the comment, ""Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" Jöns doesn't particularly bother himself with religious matters; he comments, ""Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up."" The screenplay contains much sharp dialog, as these comments illustrate. The interplay between Block and Jöns is engaging. Of course the signature scenes occur between Block and Death, incarnated here as a black cowled pasty-faced wraith with a stern visage. The most intriguing scenes have Block and Death playing a life-and-death game of chess, but Death makes frequent appearances throughout and is ever-present in the mind.It is startling how directly and seriously this movie takes on the topics of faith, life, meaning, and death. I was thinking that such a movie could probably no longer be made, but then I thought that ""The Tree of Life"" (2011) could fall into this category, albeit presented in a totally different format.Block wants to postpone his final appointment with Death so that he can accomplish some meaningful act before the end. He is able to do this by distracting Death while a young couple and their baby escape. This made me think about what sort of meaningful act I could accomplish if I knew my time was near.Not being all that knowledgeable about the latter Middle Ages in Europe I cannot judge if this is an accurate representation, but it has the feeling of authenticity. Until further study I guess this will be what my concept of the era will be.Bergman has assembled an admirable cast. Max von Sydow and Gunnar Björnstrand are particularly good. It is hard to believe that von Sydow was still in his twenties at the time--his gaunt body and severe look make him perfectly cast as the knight.The scene at the end where Death makes his entrance into the castle and the diners slowly turn to him is masterfully done.The Criterion Collection DVD contains a pristine print. There is probably no more striking example of high-contrast black and white than this movie. Any lover of black and white films will delight in seeing this work of a master. In addition to a commentary track narrated by Peter Cowie, the DVD contains a wealth of extras: a short introduction by Bergman, an 83-minute documentary containing revealing interviews with Bergman, an audio interview with Max von Sydow, a tribute by Woody Allen, a Bergman filmography, and an afterward by Peter Cowie.",The Seventh Seal

On the beach immediately after their arrival, the knight encounters Death (Bengt Ekerot), personified as a pale, black-cowled figure resembling a monk. The knight, in the middle of a chess game he has been playing alone, challenges Death to a chess match, believing that he can forestall his demise as long as the game continues. Death agrees, and they start a new game.The other characters in the story, except for Jof in the end, do not see Death, and when the chess board comes out at various times in the story, they believe the knight is continuing his habit of playing alone.",The Seventh Seal

Get it at Amazon.)It really is impossible to consider an Ingmar Bergman movie without immediately running to an interpretation. At least for me that is the case. In particular The Seventh Seal seems to demand that we ask what was Bergman's intention. Was it to show that Christianity and superstition are brothers in arms? Was it to suggest a kind of fatalism that allows some to live and others to die without rhyme or reason? The story, set in the 14th century during the time of plague, concerns a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) lately returned to Sweden from the Crusades. Bergman combines realism with supernatural elements, such as the appearance of Death (Bengt Ekerot) with whom Antonius Block plays a game of chess, and the visions that the traveling troubadour, Jof (Nils Poppe) sees that nobody else can see including his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson). Block is haunted by death and has been assured that death is imminent, but hopes to put it off by beating Death at chess.Meanwhile the inhabitants are also in fear of death and seek to blame someone. They seize a young girl (Maud Hansson) and brand her a witch for consorting with the Evil One. They hold her in a pillory prior to burning her at the stake. Notice that instead of denying that she has been with the devil, she tells us that she reaches out and touches him everywhere. The only bright spot in the movie is the family of Jof, Mia and their infant son.Antonius Block goes to confession only to discover that the priest behind the window is none other than his adversary Death, to whom he inadvertently reveals his strategy in their game of chess. Block is searching for the meaning of life. He is trying to find God, whom he complains is always hiding. Instead he finds Death. Can they be one and the same? Jons is able and cynical and sees through humanity's many delusions. Jof plays at life and sings. Mia is filled with love for life. Guess who lives and who dies.But of course the plague was the great leveler. Persons of stations high and low were brought within its compass, but Bergman gets to pick and choose who shall live and who shall die.As usual with Bergman we have the most incredible study of human faces. I particularly liked the close ups of the women. The face of Gunnel Lindblom, who plays the young woman (""Girl"" in the credits) that Jons saves from being raped, is particularly striking and intense. I recall her from The Virgin Spring (1960) in which she played Ingeri, the Odin-worshipping servant. The face of Bibi Andersson is a delight with her quick, pretty eyes and her engaging smile.But Bergman also concentrates on the faces of the bit players, in the mead hall and at the burning and as they watch the traveling players at their song and dance. With Bergman people are intensely real, up close and always personal. And he knows what they think and how they act. He shows us here, as he does in all his films, human hypocrisy and stupidity, human love and frailty. The landscape is bleak, the shadows are dark and life is harsh. Humans take their quick pleasures and then they die. That is the message I think that Bergman is sending to us.No student of film should miss this, one of the most talked about films ever made, and perhaps Bergman's first great work of art. He died only recently in 2007, not long after being voted (In Time Magazine, I think) as the greatest living director.",The Seventh Seal

Though Revelations is a favorite Bible book for many rich people, coupling it with a real-life plague that is killing off the poor and wealthy alike might not be the smartest ploy to win the mogul vote. While the Muggles apparently burn a ""witch"" mid-film, the famous chess match between Max Von Snydow's knight and Death is a big let-down. Even the James Bond series has done chess better than this. The ""medieval"" felt costumes look like they've been put together by a home economics flunk-out mom for kindergarten Halloween. Maybe all the philosophizing about God and mortality here is epic in SEAL's original Swedish. If so, it's mostly lost in translation (which is a significant negative, when less than one per cent of movie watchers are fluent in Swedish). Perhaps SEAL can be enjoyed best by turning off the sub-titles, and constructing a story in your head to go along with the occasionally interesting pictures.

74,frankde-jong,A Scandinavian (and very serious) Don Quichotte,8,7 May 2020,"In my comment on ""The virgin spring"" (1960, Ingmar Bergman) I noticed that ""The seventh seal"" was about Christianity whereas ""The virgin spring"" is about the struggle between Christianity and Paganism.This is true (look only at the title which refers to the Book of Revelations) but ""The seventh seal"" is also a variation on ""Don Quichotte"" (1605, Cervantes). The somewhat pompous knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) is Don Quichotte and the much more pragmatic somewhat cynical Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) is his Sancho Panza.Antonius Block takes himself very seriously and begins a game of chess with the dead. That the film is all about symbolism is proven by the fact that not the slightest attempt is made to make the dead scary. It is just an actor with a black robe and a whitewashed face. That the film is not without humour is proven by the fact that Antonius Block prepares a combination involving a bishop and a knight. As crusader he knows what a deadly combination that can be.His combination fails however and he loses the game. In the final scene he is led away bij the dead in a ""Danse macabre"".There are two characters who escape this dance of death, the circus artists Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson). We are back again in Christian spheres because their names are obvious references to Jozef and Maria. They escape the dead because they are neither pompous nor cynical. They are rather naive and take life as it is.",The Seventh Seal

76,Cosmoeticadotcom,Excellent,8,20 September 2008,"One of the things that separates a great artist from a lesser one is his ability to switch forms, themes, and the like, yet still imprint that unmistakable essence that lets a viewer know which artist they are dealing with immediately. Rarely has there been a greater and more vivid example of this reality than in comparing the two films Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman released in 1957: The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.The first film, which is the subject of this essay, is stark, cosmic, spare, allegorical, and unremitting in its view of life, whereas Wild Strawberries is rich, personal, realistic (even if it uses symbolism), and open to several viable interpretations. Both films starred many of Bergman's 'stock actors from the 1950s: Max Von Sydow as Knight Antonius Block, Bibi Andersson as Mia, the wife of Jof the jester (and utterly gorgeous, as opposed to mere cuteness in Wild Strawberries), and Gunnar Björnstrand as Block's squire Jöns, a pragmatic Sancho Panza to Block's spiritual Don Quixote. While Björnstrand is nominally the third lead in the film, behind Sydow and Bengt Ekerot as the personification of Death, in truth he is the dominant lead character, with by far the most, and the best, lines of dialogue. And while this film is an allegory loaded with symbolism, it is also a very simple story of a middle 14th Century knight's return to Sweden from the Crusades of the Middle Ages. The acting is uniformly excellent. Sydow is utterly transparent as Block. We see every cranny of doubt and belief written on his face. Poppe, as Jof, shows what Roberto Benigni might be like, if he had a dram of depth, Ekerot's Death is frightening only in his pomp and banality, but Björnstrand gives a truly great performance in the most difficult of the roles- treading between comedy and drama, realism and absurdism, as the squire who seems to be the wisest of all the characters. While this film was made at the height of the early Cold War, and many early reviewers took the Plague as an allegory for nuclear war, the film is far more than a simplistic political screed. At 96 minutes it also is not tool long that it batters the viewer with its message, nor too short that it slips quickly by. This film proves why black and white is still a vital tool in film-making. Had it been shot in color its dreamy quality would be rent, for shadows and depth are far easier to portray in black and white, and are far more suggestive of moodiness and inner turmoil. One problem is that the DVD version of the film I have, from The Criterion Collection, errs in allowing the black and white English words to be used, rather than colorizing them for clearer and speedier reading, thus detracting from the visual cornucopia on screen. This is why watching the film, a second time, with or without comments, is recommended, for many visual subtleties are revealed that are lost in a first viewing's necessity to read the dialogueAll in all, it's little wonder why speed-addicted, and Lowest Common Denominator afflicted American viewers have never taken to films like this, of such high quality. Yes, the writing is spare, but it is not meant to be realistic, and some of the imagery, and acting is straight out of silent German Expressionism, which only reinforces the revery-like feel of the film. And while Americans are noted for cherishing their dreams as hopes, how few ever recall their dreams as theater?",The Seventh Seal

78,marcin_kukuczka,Modern Disillusion Confronts Medieval Reality,9,24 August 2014,"Ingmar Bergman's world acclaimed 'masterpiece' as a ""self written and self directed allegorical film"" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times) is among the most discussed movies that provokes controversies. Although more than half a century has passed since its premiere, we can bravely quote Peter Bradshaw (The Guardian) that it is still ""an untarnished gold standard of artistic and moral seriousness."" THE SEVENTH SEAL turns out to speak to the minds of modern viewers even more powerfully than it did in the late 1950s.MEDIEVAL? Set in the Middle Ages, it seems that the film has much to do with the spirit of the period. Yet...this ""piercing and powerful contemplation of the passage of man"" (Crowther), ""Bergman's spiritual quest"" (Roger Ebert), ""a new dramatic idiom of its own"" (Bradshaw), ""Bergman's medieval drama of the soul"" (Steven D Greydanus), ""magnificent and compelling, brutal and beautiful examination of mankind's strengths and weaknesses"" (Carter B Horsley) is not at all a movie about the Middle Ages but, what remains 'medieval' are two supreme concepts the film is built upon: image and contrast. Let me develop these two aspects before I move to performances because most of its power and charm is, indeed, hidden therein.Three concepts prevail in the image of the film: people, nature and death. Actually, all of them are embodied in the characters and stand for their feelings, emotions and varieties. However, all of them are made vibrant by unpredictable, surprising depiction. People carry a wide range of psychological sophistication; nature evokes symbols, manifests the interlocked circle, provokes impressions of different kinds; death is, perhaps, the weirdest incarnate. It is not the Christian 'Mors Porta Vitae Aeternae' (Death as a Gate to Eternal Life) nor the hero of medieval danse macabre but ""an enigmatic emissary of the unknown"" (Greydanus), a gloomy character of certain demonic features, the only real representative of the supernatural world that is, anyway, never made accessible to humanity. Nevertheless, Death in SEVENTH SEAL is the only character personified that leads the movie to the ""uncompromising subject"" that defines in ""Bergman's spiritual quest"" (Roger Ebert). But what would it all be without certain contradictions.Contrast, a basis of medieval thought and reality, seems to be predominantly present in many aspects from the protagonist through the modern vs. medieval (sometimes on the cost of historical accurateness) to the very autobiographical traces of the director, Ingmar Bergman himself. Foremost, however, this contrast is inside of man, outside of man and among men.CHARACTERS: Bosley Crowther basically called the movie ""provocative"" and it occurs to reveal itself most in the protagonist, Antonius Block (played marvelously by Max Von Sydow), an excellent, almost model embodiment of a disillusioned, modern character set in the Middle Ages who embodies the contrast inside of man. He asks questions that could practically never be asked, even thought of in a crusader's mind simply because his vision of the world, of faith, of the afterlife was deeply affected by creed. His character addresses the very silence of God developed in the Greydanus' essay; he is on his way to catharsis but also on the way to the state of absolute nothingness that Bergman himself believed in at a later phase of his career. He is a man of seeming decadence searching for meaning. Here lies his curiosity. He is a man losing his religion because he tries to grasp the supernatural with pure intellect. Here lies his vanity. He is a man locked within the four walls of his 'ghosts and dreams' Here lies his selfishness. Reminds me of Marcello in Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA who cannot fully understand the genuine and cannot communicate with the world of innocence and simplicity (note the aspect of an Umbrian girl in Fellini's movie). And where is this world of innocence in Block's life?BERGMAN'S 'HOLY FAMILY'? Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) with their baby son Mikael have inspired a variety of interpretation from many film scholars. Some found the allegories to daring religious manifestations. The meal they are having together as the 'eucharist of natural products' or the family as the Holy Family of Nazareth. I think that the point is elsewhere. Jof and Mia manifest simplicity, common life, austere joys, pure humanity, heart over intellect. That embodies the contrast among men and, along with other characters like a troubadour Skat (Erik Strandmark), contrast outside of man Antonius Block confronts. THE SEVENTH SEAL with its impressive symbols, outstanding imagery and greatly versatile characters leaves many questions unanswered, many dreams unfulfilled, yet many hopes disillusioned in its doom. Nevertheless...it is an important movie significant in its appeal and rarely understood. Believers will find it, perhaps, too daring; atheists will find it thought provoking; cinema freaks will love its atmosphere and Bergman fans consider it the essence of the director's world. With the unforgettable finale open for interpretations, THE SEVENTH SEAL provokes modern disillusion and its pessimistic silence confront the medieval reality and its mysterious dance.",The Seventh Seal
79,jhclues,Compelling Drama From Ingmar Bergman,10,4 November 2000,"A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's `The Seventh Seal' is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically.  In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home.  For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him.  Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block.  But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released.  And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague. 	Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable.  By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block.  It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block. 	The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat).  Written and directed by Bergman, `The Seventh Seal' is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.  I rate this one 10/10.",The Seventh Seal
80,fwomp,Bergman's Best ...But Very Dated,8,16 March 2007,"Recently returning to his beloved Sweden after participating in The Crusades, young Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, DUNE) finds himself on the beaches of his country, not really safe and not very sound. Death (Bengt Ekerot) follows him and tells Antonius that his time is up. Not willing to go until he finds out the truth about the afterlife, Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess. And it's a winner take all game (life and death).The game takes a few days to play, and as Antonius travels with his trusty squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) they encounter other wayward souls looking for life's meaning. Most notable among these is a band of traveling actors; a man named Jof (Nils Popppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), and their infant child (thinks Joseph, Mary, and Jesus and you'll be right on target). Jof is a juggler, but also a visionist. He can see strange things, and although this is made slight of during the early portions of the film, it is later a pivotal catalyst to the entire movie's machinations.Antonius and his band of vagabonds drift through Sweden as The Black Death sweeps across the nation. Death is very busy, thus giving Antonius more time to make it home to his wife (whom he hasn't seen in years).But once home, Death catches up with Antonius, and he has to come to terms with the afterlife, whether he wants to or not. When Death knocks at the home of Antonius Block, everyone inside has to decide what awaits them on ""the other side"". Antonius prays for enlightenment about God (if there is one) and hopes to receive a sign (which never really comes).In the end, his efforts at delaying Death help Jof, Mia and their infant child escape the unknown of the hereafter, thus giving a sense of meaning to Antonius' life.It is noteworthy to mention that this movie has a seriously stilted screenplay. The actors' lines often seem strange and even out of place, making the viewer shrug in a mind-boggling way. Anybody who's seen an Ingmar Bergman film probably won't be bothered by this, but it is something to definitely prepare yourself for if you haven't.Often heralded as one of Bergman's best films, it certainly was ...up to that point.Being severely dated by today's film standards, the low budget is achingly present but not overly intrusive. The sets, make-up and acting are all well-played. But the biggest star is the lighting and camera angles. Careful use of light and shadow gives a terrible sense of foreboding with a minimal soundtrack. The perching of cameras in trees and on odd angles gives the film its own original look, honoring this film with several award wins (including the Cannes Film Festival's Special Jury Prize ...actually it was a tie that year but we won't go there).",The Seventh Seal

Each scene is just perfection. Having heard a lot of good about his movies and his style I don't have a real explanation of why I have never seen this film or his others, the truth is sadly that I at times can't stand the old Swedish language in movies, it's always over dramatic but here you don't really mind it as you focus more on the excellent camerawork and the visual story telling as almost each frame is perfection.Max Von Sydow recently passed away and Sweden, my country lost a legend. I saw his second last performance (Kursk) at the cinema and now I go back to one of his best acting performances, as the knight in The Seventh Seal. The dialogue are poetic in a way, the characters were mostly interesting, all of them having their own attributes and thoughts on the black death and Christianity. The acting was good, a bit too dramatic. Max Von Sydow was perfect as the troubled knight, whilst Bengt Ekerot's portrayal as Death will go down for a classic performance in my opinion, remembered for 50 more years.I understand why this movie isn't for everyone but I loved it, a piece of art and a masterpiece.

84,jluis1984,True Film-making as an art,10,21 November 2005,"What else could be said about this larger than life masterpiece? The visuals, the acting, the beautiful script, everything connects here and gives birth to the brilliant tale of a knight's quest for the meaning of his life.The plot is well known, a knight who returns from the crusade faces Death, but instead of accepting it, he challenges it to a game of chess. Antonius Block, the knight, will be alive as long as he does not lose. He continues the journey home while he plays chess. Pretty simple.Nevertheless, what Block(played by wonderful Max Von Sydow) will find in the journey home is a long series of questions and answers about life, death & God. With his loyal squire, Jöns(Gunnar Björnstrand), he will be part of a series of events that will serve as catalyst to Block's meditations(and ours). Jöns' particular cynicism and Block's bizarre(for the time) view of life contrasts with the traditional way of life of the age, and the innocence represented by Jof and Mia, a couple of traveling artists who also joins them in their travel.As many critics and historians have pointed out, the visual imagery used by Bergman in this film has become an immortal image of the history of cinema. Since the very beginning, the image of Death(Bengt Ekerot) is at the same time Haunting and mesmerizing. Bergman understood very well the language of images and created a beautifully shocking image.Max Von Sydow and Gunna Björnstrand shine in the lead roles, giving their characters a personality of their own. The mere look in the eyes of Block give a very powerful insight of the man's emotion. Max Von Sydow really gives one of cinema's greatest performances.Finally, I can't stop recommending this movie. It may be boring at first, and maybe difficult to understand; but certainly it's an experience that will stay in the collective mind of humanity for many years. It's a true masterpiece.10/10",The Seventh Seal
85,FilmOtaku,Intelligent and accessible with incredible imagery,8,9 December 2004,"'I live now in a world of ghosts, a prisoner in my dreams', a line spoken by Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) in 'The Seventh Seal' is also a good descriptor of this critically lauded film. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, the film explores, through an allegorical fashion, human relationships and the struggle with ones own psyche. Block is a knight on his way home from the Crusades who becomes increasingly disillusioned while surveying his country, which has been ravaged by the Black Plague. Along the way he avers that he doesn't care about anyone, and questions the existence of a God who could allow these things to happen. In the beginning of the film he meets Death, who informs him that it is his time. Block manages to push off Death for a little while by distracting him with a chess game while he travels home; encountering several different characters, but Death is always following close behind until the inevitable end of the game. Bergman's style is not straight forward, rather quite symbolic and philosophical. The imagery at times is astounding, and I still (a month after seeing the film for the first time) see the image of 'the dance with Death' in my head when I think of the film. However, what I discovered was that this film carries with it a lot of intellectual and philosophical baggage that is not necessarily warranted. Nothing is really spelled out in this film, but it was much more easily 'accessible' than I thought it would be; I assumed I would have to put on my 'Affected Art House' hat on to watch it and nothing could be farther from the truth. Steeped in beautiful irony, the film, while having the pervasive specter of Death hanging over it, really celebrates life through its characters and their unusual circumstances. It is truly unfortunate that the powerful image of man playing chess with Death has become such a cliché, and oft repeated in some ridiculous manner or another. Bergman directed a thought-provoking and beautiful film with 'The Seventh Seal', and I personally look forward to seeing it again, this time not to grasp the story, but to marvel at the incredible images. I would recommend this film to anyone, but I especially highly recommend it to those who consider themselves students of film  it will give you a lot to chew on. 8/10--Shelly",The Seventh Seal

The truth is all around them. The main protagonist used to persistently ask questions to which only he has a valid response. This film reveals some controversial issues.

Antonius Blok (Max Von Sydow) is a knight coming home from the Crusades with his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjonstrand). He starts to question the existence of God after being disillusioned from the war. He comes in contact with Death (Bengt Ekrot) who comes to take him. But Antonius makes a deal with him. They play chess as Antonius is going on his journey, and as long as Antonius is winning he lives. Along the way Antonius and Jons comes in contact with a number of other characters. The most important of which are Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) a married couple of stage actors who accompany Antonius and Jons as they move. The good things about this movie are plentiful. The story is excellent and the way that Ingmar Bergman tells it is also great. The other really good thing is the cinematography. This film has numerous famous stills. Even if you haven't seen the movie you've probably seen the iconic shot of Antonius and Death playing chess for the first time. It's part of movie history.

All his films have been discussed over years by the film students. Analyzing his films will open up a new world of imagination and cinematic freedom.The Seventh Seal, is an intellectual film. But, unlike other serious films, this movie is coated with slight humor. This provides more relaxation to the non-competitive audience. The story is about life and death. The movie makes fun of the humanity, religion etc. There are not of things to be thought in depth. Thought provoking films are hard to write about.

91,RossRivero99,One of the great classics of European cinema,10,27 January 2015,"Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal is undoubtedly a great film that is unlike any other great film that I ever seen when it comes to the story, of which is one of the most fascinating stories ever to be put on film. Bergman's film tells the story of a knight named Antonius Block (played by Max von Sydow) who is trying to get answers about life death, and God's existence, while playing chess with the Grim Reaper (played by Bengt Ekerot) in order to save the lives of the people who are infected with the Black Plague. While watching this film I said that this was not a film that Hitchcock would have wanted to do because it would have broken his suspense guidelines, and that is why I do think that nobody else could have directed this film better than Ingmar Bergman did. One of the directors that I truly admire Woody Allen who did some good films of his own I thought had the perfect choice to select this as one of his all time favorite movies, and the same thing goes with me as well. Also not only that this film made me love movies even more than I ever did before, though the plot is complicated I still completely understood it, and that not only it is one of the great classics of European cinema it also proves that movies from different countries can be worth watching as American movies.",The Seventh Seal
92,Eumenides_0,Human Existence Inside a Movie,10,14 February 2010,"In Ingmar Bergman's classic meditation on God, the viewer follow the return of knight Antonius Block and his squire, Jons, from the crusades. The world they return to is filled with death and ugliness, as the Black Plague rages through and flagellation has become a way of life. Block then meets Death and what follows is the now legendary game of chess between a mortal and the Grim Reaper. While the game lasts, Block remains alive, so he travels on.It's a grey, lifeless world, so much the better captured by Gunnar Fischer's legendary cinematography. It's a humorless world too, in which wandering artists are not seen with kind eyes. In the course of the movie, Block meets the company of Jof and his wife, Mia, and son, and protects them. Block's grim reflections about God and his existential doubts meet their opposite in Jof's wonder at the beauty of the world, in the love he feels for his wife and son, in the pleasure he has playing his art.All the actors are excellent in this movie, in particular my beloved Max Von Sydow. In all the movies I've seen him in, no matter how bad they may be, he's always captured the personality of his character. Gunnar Fischer's black and white images are unforgettable too, and some of the most beautiful ever put in a movie. One need only remember the dark rocks at the beginning of the movie, or Death's first apparition.The Seventh Seal is a movie that will never grow old because it contains all the varieties of human existence: darkness and light, lightness and seriousness, hope and despair. To say that this movie has grown old, to say that this movie no longer speaks to mankind after 50 years, is to say that humans have stopped being humans. If there is a movie that reminds people about the wonder and difficulty of being human, it's this movie.",The Seventh Seal
93,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: aging but of academic interest,5,27 May 2002,"Mostly I use IMDb reviews to decide whether to rent a film, so I feel philosophically that a rating and a review should reflect how the film does in the context of the modern day.So with that caveat, the look & feel of this film -- which is grainy and black & white -- can't earn more than a 5 out of 10, which is my rating.To be fair, I'm an action movie guy. I don't have the sophistication or film school background to be able to enjoy the makeup or sets if the plot and characters are awful. But I do enjoy an intelligent film, and (with the proper mindset that I was viewing a very old film), I found the Seven Seals quite accessible and powerful.Which is to say that it wasn't very, but I can see how when it came out it must have been a wild sensation. It's original, has something real to say about life. If you're going to watch one of the old classics, and want to know where that scene with Death comes from in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"", you should be able to get through this film.Who should see this film:-- art buffs & drama fans with a flair for classics: a must-see-- regular people like me who can see watching a film like this sort-of like visiting Taiwan or South Africa. Fascinating place, not my kind of thing and wouldn't want to live there, but glad I had the cultural experience.I'll give The Seventh Seal a showing its age but still packs a punch 5 out of 10. And if you ever get a chance to see the short film ""The Dove"" (1968) that parodies this film -- it is totally hilarious and worth every effort to see it.",The Seventh Seal

The acting is very good. There are enough characters and sub-plots that this film has lots of life and depth to it; and speaking of depth, the very synopsis of it serves as a beautiful metaphor, not at all pretentious but rather deep in a sober, simple kind of way. The philosophical questions sit just right within the plot and within the veins of the various scenes, never too verbose but yet really saying something, asking relevant questions. The whole idea of the film is excellent, and beautiful, and very well executed. This is humane, strong cinema, with something real and meaningful to convey: purpose. What everything in this life is all about. Purpose. Excellent piece.",The Seventh Seal
95,andrewroy-04316,"Rife with ambiguity and symbolism, The Seventh Seal is a detached intellectual experience",7,29 April 2020,"The Seventh Seal is a movie that seems to be all about symbolism and ambiguous existential musings. It's set in 12th century Europe, as patriarchal Catholic society is the norm and the plague is ravaging the land. Our primary plot line is our protagonist, The Knight, struggling with his faith and plays a chess game with Death to determine whether he can extend his life. He is presented in stark contrast to Jof and Mia, a married couple with a kid who are far less concerned with faith and existentialism than The Knight is. The discussions between The Knight and Death were my favorite scenes in the movie, as we understand The Knight's point of view better and, like the rest of the film, the conversation has deeper meanings. The Knight is frustrated by the silence and absence that God is in his life, and badly wants to know the truth of his nature. Death, however, says that he knows nothing. The existential questions of whether a God exists, whether he cares, and whether there is a larger purpose to life are central to the film, and while there is ample room for interpretation, I think Bergman intended to show that seeking a faith-based connection in life is futile, and the only meaning that exists in the world is that which you impart, primarily from your human connections. The Knight is always shown as completely independent from others, even his traveling partner of 10 years, while Mia and Jof are happy because they value their art and shared bond. While The Knight looks for something greater, they accept their life as it is. The backdrop of the plague adds another layer to the symbolism of the film - it emphasizes the hollowness of the church's claims. The church says that those who do good will be rewarded and sinners punished, but of course the plague is indiscriminating. I still need to grapple much more with the ideas of the film, because it's so dense and layered, but my experience with the film was a purely intellectual one. It had its moments of levity (which could have been inspirations for Monty Python), but for the most part was a detached experience in understanding the complex meanings behind scenes and dialogue, rather than a personal or emotional connection to the story. There's nothing wrong with that, and my thoughts on the film will surely evolve as I interpret more parts of the film, but it did feel heavy in philosophy and symbolism.",The Seventh Seal

99,bsinc,Didn't like it but will definitely see it again in the distant future,6,6 September 2005,"First of all, I have taken the time to read some posts on this movie before writing my review because I was searching for lots of answers. Didn't get many though, the popular thing fans like to say (and please, no pun intended) is that it just takes time to understand and appreciate this movie. To this I quickly reply that my perception of ""Det Sjunde Inseglet"" was that it is a rather dull, if not eventless, movie. It has some really nice moments (and for some reason I really liked the concept of a man playing chess with death itself) but in the end almost nothing is resolved except from the main protagonist who, at the brink of his death, discovers that it's love that makes people want to live ,very roughly put, I apologize, but even this revelation was hidden from the writer of this comment. And this is what bothered me the most, I couldn't read (for the lack of a better word) any of these important details, the movie very coldly rolled in front of my eyes and I just didn't get it! Now the easiest and dumbest thing to say is that this is all the fault of the director for not having a more universal way of film-making, rather the viewer has to decipher such information if he wants to fully appreciate his movies. I've just realized that I could say the same for Kubrick's visionary movies, I didn't like most, scratch that, none of them the first time around, they grew on me after a second viewing. And I dig Kubrick, a lot!!!I was also surprised with the admiration the cinematography received, it did not impact me whatsoever (and I am more so a visual that a sensual movie buff and love this kind of stuff). All in all, as Antonius Block, I am searching for answers, important ones. It bothers me a lot that I don't appreciate this movie, and I ask anyone to help me resolve my problem. What am I missing?

101,michaelarmer,"Good Film, but Existential Pretentious Twaddle from reviewers!",7,24 September 2019,"This film is supposed to be rated as one of the best films of all time, uhh. Not for me. I recorded this recently and read a good few reviews before watching, what a load of sycohphants !! Twaddling about artistry, existentialism and the such. To me it was like a dark Swedish Don Quixote.Don't get me wrong, its a good film, the acting is excellent, particularly Gunnar Bjornstrand , Max von Sydow was a bit out of place but still good, although he should have had a bit more screen time with more dialogue, he is a very magnetic actor, I think they could have taken the Chess game between himself and Death a bit further, made more of the escape of Jof and his family, and possibly had a stalemate so that his Knight could get a stay of sentence either for him or others. The photography is excellent, I hope they convert it to colour, I'm not keen on B&W, but nevertheless I still rate it.However the ending is a bit of a let down, I know what it is supposed to represent but it was a little unbelievable, why would they all be taken by Death at the same time, just because they all came into contact with someone who was supposed to be already dead ? or was the inclination The Plague? no, it would not seem probable, if the Knight were to die, and possibly his squire, the surely the others should have been left to live, there was no reason why all should die, only that the Knight/Squire should die in the first place, i.e. the opening sequence, for the rest it does not make sense in any way you look at it.Ok everyone dies sooner or later but not all at the same time. The story of the Knight looking for answers, trying to understand why he should die should have been taken much further, and with a different ending, the Knight gaining a stay of execution for the others by doing better at the chess and gaining some answers before being taken, with his Squire settling down with the woman he had earlier saved, the blacksmith and his wife sorting things out, the Knights wife getting to spend some time with him before he perished after not seeing him for several years and a son appearing just before he was taken. I know not everything has a happy ending, and I know that is part of the idea, but even a little bit of hope would be better than none, after all that is what life (and death) is all about, i.e, we die with the knowledge that our children continue and pass on our genes.For me the best thing about this film was the Swedish medieval period it was supposed to represent, very interesting and well done.",The Seventh Seal

103,avik-basu1889,The ultimate example of a film that gives an insight into the mind of the filmmaker !!!,9,29 April 2016,"'The Seventh Seal' is probably the first film that made Ingmar Bergman a hugely renowned figure in the art house film circles of Europe and America. It is the film that introduced him to the world. Along with 'Seven Samurai', this is also probably the most renowned foreign language art house film in the west. Even people who don't follow art house cinema are somewhat loosely aware of it as the one where someone plays chess with 'Death'. It has been made fun of and parodied on numerous occasions mostly because of Bergman's overt treatment of his themes. But I consider Bergman's overtness to be an asset for the film. I will echo Roger Ebert's opinion in saying that 'The Seventh Seal' is an example of a film where the filmmaker is not shy to pour out all his fears and angst on screen. I think once someone watches 'The Seventh Seal', he/she comes in contact with Bergman's ideologies and thoughts.Bergman explores some of the most universal and profound questions of life and death. I found no problems in relating with the character of Antonious Block and putting myself in his shoes. We know that he had gone to fight in the crusades and must have witnessed the horrors of violence and war. After returning home he doesn't get any respite from the horrors as he has to witness the effects of the Black Plague. So the fact that he is losing faith in God and life is very believable. He knows that he is facing inevitable death. But he stalls his death by challenging the manifestation of death to a game of chess, just because he wants his questions answered. He wants to know whether heaven exists. He wants to believe in the existence of God, but for that he wants proof. There is a beautiful line where he states 'I want to have knowledge, not assumptions'. But over the course of the film he learns that his questions and doubts will remain unresolved. So, he realises that the best thing to do before his death is to do something that is meaningful.While Block is a very intense, layered and troubled character, Jons on the other hand lives his life in the moment. These questions of faith and death don't bother him at all. He has abandoned religion. He is hedonistic in nature and has a contempt for women.Then we come to the two most sweet and lovable characters in the entire film - Jof and Mia. They live their own simple lives with their baby son. They are actors and move around trying to make people laugh. It is their simple, jovial outlook to life that gives Block some solace and helps to make his mind up about what to do before death gets him. There is a beautiful scene in the film where Jof has a vision of Mia and his son in the form of Mother Mary and baby Jesus which thematically says a lot.Another very important element of the film is the way in which Bergman attacks the church. His contempt for the church and its functionaries comes to the forefront through the way he treats the character of Raval. Clearly Bergman thinks that the church didn't have an answer to the questions that troubled Block, but to somehow ensure that the masses didn't go away, they perpetuated the spread of silly superstitions that involved burning of 'witches' and processions of flagellants. Bergman wants to say that living your life like Block can be very tough. Block carries with him the burden of wanting to have faith in spite of everything. He wants God to come to him and show himself and give him knowledge. But in reality, all his calls to God will probably remain unanswered. So in a way, this film is pessimistic and bleak as Bergman contemplates the thought that maybe there is no God and maybe life has no meaning and maybe death converts you to a state of nothingness. But Bergman gives the viewer as well as Block optimism and a sense of hope through Jof and Mia. Death will take us someday, but the best we can do is to enjoy the little time that we spend on the earth to the fullest and love others and be loved and then 'dance' our way to death.The film as I have mentioned is brilliantly written and directed by Bergman. The cinematography and framing of the film is meticulous. There are multiple scenes that will stay with me always like the very first scene on the beach and the confession scene in the church and the scene of witch burning and the final shot of the film to name a few. The acting is brilliant from everyone. Max Von Sydow is astonishingly good. He was only 26 at the time, yet he exudes the world-weary and tired aura of a 50 year old. Bengt Ekerot also deserves a mention. Even with the daunting task of having to play none other than 'Death', he succeeds to blend comical sarcasm with fierce intimidation. The film would have been 10 in my books, if only Bergman had eliminated the characters of Plog and Lisa. I guess he was trying to infuse some comedy in an otherwise very serious film by using them, but their scenes I felt fell completely flat and didn't work at all.To end, I'll say that although I have a problem with two characters in the film, I still have no problems in calling it a masterpiece. This is an audacious and brave piece of filmmaking. No matter who you are or whatever you do, if you watch 'The Seventh Seal', you will find yourself asking the same questions that Block asks in the film and that's where Bergman's mastery lies.",The Seventh Seal

106,steiner-sam,"Death, doubt, and the meaning of life",8,29 May 2021,"""The Seventh Seal"" is a historical fantasy. A knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire, Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) return after 10 years from the Crusades in the Holy Land during a time the Plague was raging through Sweden. The title, beginning and the ending in the play are all based on the text about the seventh seal in the Book of Revelation.The film follows the knight's travel back to his castle and the people he meets along the way. Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes to claim Antonius early in the film, but Antonius gets Death to delay taking him by challenging him to a chess game. The idea of playing chess with death came from a painting in the 1480s by Albertus Pictor that Bergman chanced to see.In any event, Antonius wants to come to some resolution about his doubts before he dies. There are many references to death and the meaning of life with the many interesting characters and subplots, including a drama troupe, a woman accused of being a witch, a mute woman, a former minister who become a thief, a doomsday preacher, etc.As always with Bergman the film is beautifully crafted. The story is easily followed. What it all means is beyond me, save for facing doubt and death.One observation by a commentator that I read before watching ""Seventh Seal"" that stuck with me was that ""Death"" looked an awful lot like the U. S. President of the day, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Consequently I kept seeing Eisenhower every time Death came on the screen. My favorite character was Jöns the squire, who was the most literate character as well as being a cynical observer of much that went on.This is not the kind of film I normally gravitate towards, but it was easy to see why it became an early favorite of ""art house"" aficionados.",The Seventh Seal

The characters of Blacksmith and his wife have no significance at all. The character of death is not supposed to kill anybody without a reason, why did he kill the actor then ? The most powerful scene is in which the little girl is left hanging on a tree for spreading plague.And the ending didn't go well with me.

110,jackasstrange,A classic of the European cinema,9,10 November 2013,"Seventh Seal is another great work of the excellent Sweden director Ingmar Bergman. Not only it's deep discussions about the fear of the death are extremely interesting,actual themes(the middle age was used as a allegory of the world 'situation' in 1957, when all the persons feared an imminent death, due to the cold war), but is also vastly rich in meanings at every single shot. I mean, nothing in it seems to be there without any reasons or a deep meaning. Maybe i'm reading too much on it, but maybe not. Remember that we are talking about Ingmar Bergman. And technically it is, as well, a very well made film. A beautiful film, in fact. The cinematography is stunning, with some wonderful shots, it has an impressive work in the edition as well, a very macabre soundtrack, which adds a certain dark(even darker) atmosphere to the film. The acting is impressive, a bit over the top, but still good. It may be not 100% entertaining all the time, but I'm sure that it can be an easily watchable experience even for those who don't have that much interest in this kind of films. Also, we have one of the most remarkable moments in cinema history here, when the cross soldier plays chess against the death. Absolutely fantastic.

111,zeekwunlau,Movies like literature,8,6 May 2020,"This film contains very profound philosophical values. Bergman's films were never prepared for audiences without historical experience and background. He defaulted that his audience should adapt to the background of the film. Before we watched the movie, we knew the historical background of the Crusades and the relevant details of the Bible, and we knew the historical background of the black death in the medieval Europe. The saints fixed one on the cross, thinking that she was dealing with the devil to cause this plague. The knight who made a deal with the god of death has been indulging in the pursuit of the truth of God. He longs for the ultimate and the meaning of life, and he gets always nothingness, and reality can hardly satisfy his desire for knowledge. One of Bergman 's scene designs made me feel the originality of this film 's lens language. Several scenes of playing chess with Bleach advanced the strength of the knight and Bleach in the game. At the beginning, Bleach had confidence in the game to outperform the Cavaliers, so the image of Bleach in Bergman's lens is taller than the Cavaliers. After the knight met the actor's family, he seemed to feel the harmony of life and received an unprecedented joy. At this time, his game of death prevailed, so the image of the knight was relatively tall; when the actor's family feared the knight and abandoned him , Grim Reaper won another step on the chessboard, Grim Reaper further up in front of the camera, symbolizing Grim Reaper's further control of the knight's destiny and gaining the upper hand.There are many sarcasm and metaphors in the Bergman film. I dare not say that I have fully understood the film. I can only briefly describe my feelings and understanding of the film based on what I have learned and felt. In the early stage of the movie, the fate of the seven people was hinted, so their knights and their entourage are destined to inevitably die. The strange dance of the seven people on the mountain at the end of the film confirmed the conversation between the painter and the waiter. One of the episodes that I feel deeply is that the knight is asking the girl crucified, where is the devil, I thought I would like to show the existence of the strange power and chaos in the drama when the death appears, but I heard that the girl was brainwashed The next story is that the devil has always been around. This plot shocked me. The victim has been exploited to the point of losing the will to resist, and then believes the slandering words of the people around him and loses the struggle. The conversation between the waiter standing behind the knight and the knight shocked me very much. This unconventional narrative language brought me deep thoughts on the lines and showed a special tension. The blacksmith's wife was derailed by another actor. In the dialogue between the actor and the blacksmith in the woods, the knight seemed to judge them outside the plot, but did not participate in their disputes, breaking the film non-participating scene events The characters should not be portrayed in detail. In my opinion, this has a lot to do with the knight's role setting itself, because he is somewhat dissociated from the world, looking at things rationally and objectively, when he said to the blacksmith ""the common problem of women"" Can be reflected, like a wise man born, the character is more like an intp in mbti personality. The knight 's servant is a strong man who has joined the WTO. The face of the dead on the beach shows full respect, and the girl and the actor who have been coerced have given him a beautiful quality of kindness and bravery, like the character of intj.",The Seventh Seal
112,x_manicure_x,Memento Mori,8,14 August 2021,"""The Seventh Seal"" was probably my worst nightmare during high school. Not just because our teacher would play it billions of times, but especially because it infected me with existential angst a little earlier than I hoped. It's a film that raises many questions but gives no answer. You could be the earthy and cynic squire; you could be the noble knight always seeking spiritual meaning in life - in the end, the only certainty will be death. Still, the ending feels strangely reassuring for a Bergman film, as if he was trying to convince himself that death is not to be feared but accepted as one inevitable part of life, that the world will keep going on after our time has come.Not to diminish the value of the visuals, but the film felt almost like a theatre play in the way scenes and dialogues are structured. It's also quite straightforward in meaning, tight in pacing, light in tone and bawdy in humor for a Bergman film.

This movie does engage the intellect with its intertwined narratives and complex metaphors. I have no doubt that Bergman was totally honest in this act of catharsis, to purge his fear of Death. Yet, I'm left cold. The inspiration is Albertus Pictor's art, who Bergman casts here as a character. Medieval art is typified by certain characteristics (abandoned in the Renaissance): geometric shapes do not have a vanishing point; figures are depicted hierarchically in order of religious importance. If Bergman had played with these cinematic ideas, if he had relocated us in relation to the image, if he'd framed the actors hierarchically, he'd have done something for me. See Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" for a period example of how to align the subject with the visual narrative through perspective.Maybe my own 'perspective' is ruined. I can't look at this without immediately thinking of all the later borrowings I've seen...my personal favorite has nothing to do with movies...Seinfeld's ""The Nose Job"" episode (Jerry's penis vs. Jerry's brain in a chess match over whether to pursue or dump a physically attractive but vacuous actress).*Spoiler/PS*...My own interpretation is that Von Sydow and co. were dead all along, and were only returning to a haunted land...ideas later used in such pop examples as ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Sixth Sense"".",The Seventh Seal

Full of images and iconography from medieval frescos, it tells the story of Knight and his squire returning from the crusades and their journey home across plague ridden medieval Sweden.However, death has come for the Knight, but is challenged to a game of chess.So gloomy and full of despair.....not!!! This is a movie full of life. Life is children, beautiful women, death, pain, evil, sex, singing, fear and so on.This not a movie about death, except to say, death is part of life. The knight has a desperate desire to beat death, but in truth he knows all he can buy is time. This is the great truth of life and of this movie. (Of course Bill and Ted beat death in Bill and Ted's bogus journey by challenging death to a game of twister, me I would go for Rock Scissors Paper).In modern terms it can be seen a good little movie, brilliant in its time, but perhaps nothing too special today.

A complex film with a complex philosophical dialogue.It's set on medieval Sweden and the protagonist is a crusader that is returning to his homeland to find it infected by plague. It doesn't seem to have a well defined plot, besides a protagonist which plays chess with Death himself during the course of the film and in the end finally looses the match and is sent to the next world.The characters aren't complex, they are not emotionally developed, but that's not the point of the movie.

When the confident Killer Number two dies, I think: You're going to die like this after all this time?The car accident also has this idea, the director seems to tell us a truth through the death of the character: life is impermanent, what you have at the moment does not mean that the next moment is still there, everything is so fleeting.

1. The soundtrack and score helps to smother the film in a heavenly and otherworldly atmosphere.
2. The costume and set design is done perfectly and they build up the medieval European world brilliantly.
3. The cinematography is beautiful, especially when the camera pulls back to show the viewer gorgeous shots.
4. The dialogue is mesmerisingly poetic and it flows elegantly.
5. Max von Sydow (Antonius Block), Gunnar Björnstrand (Jöns, squire), Nils Poppe (Jof / Joseph), and Bengt Ekerot (Death).
6. The to-and-fro between Death and Antonius Block is extremely enthralling to watch.
7. The humour is inserted sporadically, but it never fails to induce a chuckle without being overbearing.
8. The movie serves as a wonderful allegory on how humans respond to death, whether that be to sacrifice themselves for others; intensely fearing death; acting indifferent towards it; maybe even welcoming it; or even treating it with a good sense of humour.Cons:
1. Some lines of dialogue are quite clearly dubbed.

From the start to finish I was on the edge of my seat, it was entertaining from the opening quotes and views to the final rendezvous with Death.The most magnificent about the movie is the fantastic mix with all the different stories.

Jöns, the brave knight and all his life-happiness and filosofy, the blacksmith with his cheating wife and the acting-family's life wich Antonius at the end find more worth than his own.When I turned off my video after experience this movie, it took a while to get used to life.

The black and white technique fits perfectly with the theme and tone of the film. The theme is great and always current. Life, death, the meaning of life, the existence of God and the devil. I liked every scene with the protagonist Block playing chess against Death, the literal one that isn't really that important (it's more for visuality and aesthetics) as well as that figurative, life duel against Death trying to find out some life secret during games. Chess here represents life, whatever it may be and however great a chess player it may be, Death cannot be defeated. You may be able to extend the game a bit, but in the end Death always sets the checkmate. What bothered me in the film were the numerous supporting actors who removed my emphasis from the ""main"" stories, even though they also participate, each in their own way. I also sometimes get lost in the film from the numerous symbols that seem purposeful to themselves. At the end of the film, I didn't feel like I was watching anything special.",The Seventh Seal
124,nesfilmreviews,"An artful, philosophical spectacle.",9,24 May 2013,"Allegory is nothing new in film, nor was it new in 1957. However allegory can be handled skillfully, or it can be a heavy-handed exercise in preaching. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece centers on a meeting between Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow), a knight returning from the Crusades, and Death (Bengt Ekerot). Emotionless, pasty-faced and vaguely sardonic, Death is tricked into staying his scythe when Block challenges him to a game of chess. Full of haunting, iconic images and a touch of humanity, ""The Seventh Seal"" is cinema at its most artful, a philosophical meditation on the meaning, or meaningless of mortality. Taking its title from the Book of Revelation, ""The Seventh Seal"" could quite possibly be considered a horror movie. It's set during the Black Death, a Gothic dark age where women are burned as witches, drunken tavern brawls lead to bloodletting, and a lone knight grapples with the slaughter he's seen committed in the Lord's name. Von Sydow excels as the haunted, burdened crusader desperate for a sign: ""I want God to stretch out His hand, uncover His face and speak to me,"" he whispers. In this film, though, there's no God, no Devil... only Death. The indifference of the universe is all that is presented. Bergman has little interest in moving his camera, long takes and static shots adds to the sense of desolate grimness, until it feels like a medieval morality play. Yet for all its starkness, there are moments of warm compassion to be found. Plog the Blacksmith (Åke Fridell), squire Jöns (Gunnar Bjornstrand), and buxom Lisa (Inga Gill) band together, finding comfort in playful arguments, lustful clinches, and snatches of song. Even Death has a sense of humor, sawing away at a tree trunk to claim one victim. The film's ending is inevitable, but there's also (bitter) optimism. The Reaper may be grim--but life's rich parade will go on, with or without us. One of the all time classic films presenting questions and contemplation on our own mortality.",The Seventh Seal
125,carlos37andre,"Stop worrying about what comes next, and start enjoying what you have now!",8,14 March 2020,"I saw this movie in a class about cinema, my prof talked a lot about the movie, and what he thinks it represents, and I agree when he says that it doesn't exactly have one true meaning. And well, that's what movies are supposed to be after all, right?The biggest meaning, I took from the movie is that it talks about faith/beliefs, different kinds of faith that is. The religion belief, the belief in the skepticism (?), the belief that you live in a healthy relationship, and so on.Probably the main point inside that is the knight's arc, and how it contrasts with the actor's arc. The knight throughout the whole movie, is seeking for answer, he wants to know if there is really something after death, and he is frustrated when no one knows the answer to this question, and even though he is a so called religious person, he's actions end up putting him in death's path. At the end, he was so worried about the afterlife, that he forgot to live life while he could, to enjoy the ones around him more, and enjoy life and all the beautiful things inside it.In the opposite side, we have the actor, that represents the innocence, the naivety of not thinking 24/7 what life is really about and what lies after it. Since the beginning he says that he doesn't understand religion, and for most of the movie he is just reacting (most of the time joyful) to what happens to him, and at the end, he is the only one who survives death (saving his wife and kid in the process).So, besides all the other stuff the movie represents, like the relationship between religion and science, the post WWII world, all the Shakespeare-like elements to the story, I believe that the movie tells us, essentially, that reason is an important thing to have on a day-to-day basis, but you can't live your life happily only by using reason, you must have heart as well, you should sometimes just enjoy the company of the ones that are close to you, and the wonderful things this beautiful world provides us every single day. We shouldn't worry about what happens after life, but rather enjoy life when it's still going on.Obs: With this movie I started, for the first time, wonder if the grading system that I use for years is really the right way to think about movies, idk, I like the movie, but my professor's help was essential to open my eyes for what the movie was really about. I'll give the 8, cause I like the movie, it's one of the few ""art-films"" I've seen in my life, and it truly shows why movies can be such a great art form to express yourself.

126,ldavis-2,Iggy Does His Little Dance in Hell!,2,18 February 2008,"I sat through three other films by Ingmar Bergman: the girl in The Virgin Spring was a spoiled brat; the old man in Wild Strawberries was a whiny fart; the adults in Fanny and Alexander were selfish a**holes! Yet the critics' were beside themselves, Bergman had so defty tapped into their egos. Hence, every time Iggy took a dump, the critics raved like a bunch of Pavolvian dogs!So when Death, looking like a Marilyn Manson fan, makes his grand entrance, I wasn't expecting any profound insights from Iggy, and I wasn't disappointed:Block: Who are you?Death: I am Death. (duh!)Despite his claim that he is ""quite skillful"" at chess, The Grim Reaper blows chunks. ""Beating"" Block centuries before ""The Mad Queen""? LOL! And his ""I'm just doing my job"" shtick when asked about the Divine was a total cop-out! When Block didn't bitch-slap Grimmy and give him a weegie, I knew I was in for a long night!The confession scene was a hoot! Block whines about how God doesn't answer him, wishes he could purge Him from his heart. Now you know the ""monk"" is Death, but because Iggy isn't half the filmmaker he thinks he is, he lets us in on it before Block (who's a few fries short of a Happy Meal to begin with) realizes whom he just blabbed his ""brilliant"" chess strategy to!If Block not trying to save the girl was supposed to get us to relate to his world-weariness, sorry, all it did was make me lose all empathy for him. Block's filthy, God-hating sidekick is the real hero of this opus. In his one act of heroism (unintenional, I'm sure), he saves a girl from the man who talked Block into going on the Crusades (huh?), then tells her that she better come with him because he hopes his wife is dead by now and he could have just raped her! How sweet!Jof was just weird, and not because he has a vision of Mary teaching her Baby how to walk. He's a juggler, but can't keep two balls in the air?

128,Sonatine97,Bergman's mastepiece & Sydow's ultimate acting performance,10,6 August 2000,"No argument, no doubts, no reservations! This film is a genuine masterpiece of  the highest quality.Not a particularly difficult story but Bergman adds to the common strand a morality & immorality of God's existence along with the eternal contradictions of what the purpose of man's existence is upon this sacred Earth.After returning from the Crusades hundreds of years ago, Sydow (Antonius Bloc) and his squire return to a plaque ravaged Sweden where people are dying a horrid death and the sinners tour the country pleading to be exorcised of their sins.Bloc is confronted by the Grim Reaper (Bengt Ekerot) on (of all places )a beach. But before Death takes his soul Bloc offers him a game of chess for his life.The chess match continues throughout the film and as we do we see Bloc's tortured mind unravel as his rides between towns seeing the misery the plague (and its owner, Death) is causing. And he wonders why God is punishing these people so harshly.In addition we see other characters living their humdrum lives playing very close to the 10 Commandments, where individual steal,  murder, lie & betray. Very gradually these sad but doomed individuals all gather along with Bloc and end up in a great castle where their ultimate fate awaits them.You really have to see this movie at least twice to unravel the mind of both Bloc & the director, Bergman, for although the story is relatively straightforward, its the intellectual philosophising & existentuality that you really have to understand.Each character is nothing more than a symbol or parody for some human weakness or foible. Each character believes in God but sees him in a different way when it suits them and often don't realise until its too late that Death doesn't just reach out for the old, sick or the sinners of their world.But it is to Sydow's grand Knight that the real pain of human existence is focused upon. Having returned from the many battles of the Crusades, preaching the word of God & righteousness to foreigners he returns to his homeland to find a country ravaged by a plague that knows no social condition: young, old, rich, poor, believer or sinner, they are all doomed.Sydow character is racked with so many feelings of guilt & hatred for both God and Death. Yet he wonders why he should die so soon when he has done God's work and is still left with so many things to do.Bergman is the master when it comes to magnifying our human frailties; his characters are nothing special, just ordinary people and yet they, like us, hide so many sins, that eventually we will pay for our crimes.Bergman doesn't have to hurry the film along, although you sometimes feel nothing very much happens between scenes. But everything is timed & framed for a reason that is not immediately obvious but only becomes clear later in the film.And of course filming in black & white gives the story a very bleak feel, and could also be seen as an allegory of life/death &  good/bad. I was especially moved by one scene near the beginning where Death & Bloc play their first moves with the sea in the background & dark clouds surrounding both of them like a deathly shroud.To some THE SEVENTH SEAL will appear too pretentious to really appeal; and I suspect a lot of the symbolism & reasoning will not be recognised. But its a film to be patient with, it deserves our respect because when we see these poor innocent characters waiting for their Calling, we are in fact looking at ourselves!!!*****/*****",The Seventh Seal
129,brianberta,"This does a lot right, but I was a bit disappointed",5,6 July 2016,"Much like ""Wild Strawberries"", which was released in the same year, both films focus on someone coping with the end of their lifetimes. This movie has a really good concept for a plot, and despite being parodied several times, its plot still seems intriguing today. All it took for me to get interested in the film was by looking up what it was about. There's so much you can do with a plot like this so I was curious what Bergman would do with the film.After a knight named Antonius and his squire return home after fighting in the crusades, he meets Death on a beach who has come to take his life. However, he challenges him to a chess match to thwart him as long as possible since he wants to seek answers on life, death, and God and do one meaningful deed before he dies.The chess game that Antonius has with Death is used as a personification of death. Bergman uses it to show how the knight goes through great measures to avoid Death. At one point, Antonius tries to cheat his way out of death by knocking over the chess pieces, but even that doesn't work. However, Death eventually catches up with him in the end. When Death tries to cheat to help himself win, he prevails. Also, Death is a much better player than any of us, and in the end, he always wins. This is another reason why I think that its plot is very good. Bergman makes the most out of this creative plot.During Antonius's search to do a redemptive act, he comes across many people. Many of them tell him their outlooks on life and death. The conversations he has with them are definitely the high point of the film. Their responses are brilliant, interesting, and thought provoking. Each one of them continuously challenges your perceptions of the world around you. Almost every single line is unforgettable and carefully written throughout the film. Its dialogue gives you a lot to think about long after viewing it. On my first viewing, I just tried to get a basic understanding of what happened in the film. On my second viewing, however, I tried to pay more attention to the dialogue, and I liked the film a lot better as a result.A main aspect of this film is its haunting imagery at some points. The scene when a girl is about to be burned at the stake for supposedly consorting with the devil is one of the grim encounters that Antonius encounters in the film. It's a pretty haunting scene and it lingers with the viewer long after watching it. Another scene is the one where a huge crowd of flagellants interrupt a play of Jof and Mia, and try to convince the crowd that they are doomed. It's very direct in asking controversial and essential questions about the existence of God. Perhaps, the most haunting scene comes at the very end when the film shows a depiction of the Dance of Death. Fortunately, the film doesn't make it too straightforward, and the image at the end gives you a lot to think about long after viewing the film.Since the film's plot was heavily based on the chess game, I assumed that it was going to be a big part of the film. As I got more into the film, however, I realized that the chess game wasn't going to be in the film that much, and I was right. This may not be necessarily a bad thing for some people, but I was slowly starting to forget about the chess game as the film continued on, and by the time it was introduced for a 2nd time near the 60 minutes mark, I felt like it was being underutilized. It was a little disappointing, because Bergman could have done a lot with it if it was in the movie more. I understand that a lot of the movie should be focused on him trying to do a meaningful deed and the experiences he goes through during the time period. However, Bergman could've easily added roughly 15-20 minutes of the chess game throughout the film.The expedition Antonius went through in the film let us know about his questions on life, death, and God. However, I wish that the film informed us a bit more about himself as an individual and how he approaches life. That's not to say that I didn't care at all about him. In fact, his questions opened the film up to some great dialogue. However, that quest did not show us how he approached life on a daily basis. The only scenes which showed a bit of it were the way too brief scenes of him sharing strawberries and milk with Jof, Mia, and her baby. There should've been more scenes like that. Jöns, Antonius's squire, was a character who was more fully realized. I knew a lot more about him as an individual. As a result, I cared about his fate a lot more.In conclusion, this was a pretty good film. The chess game is a really great personification for death, the dialogue is thought-provoking, and it has some haunting imagery which sticks with you long after watching it. However, I was both underwhelmed and disappointed by this film as soon as it started focusing more on Jöns and the other characters he met rather then him. However, despite what I said, I am a bit interested is some of Bergman's other films, and I'll definitely be checking out more of his films in the future.",The Seventh Seal

131,Ziya90,The idea remained abstract,5,19 January 2010,"When I read the plot of The Seventh Seal years years before, I sured that when I get a chance to watch it, I would be definitely impressed. The idea of playing chess with death is very inventive, brilliant, but if you put it in a good story. Ingmar Bergman was the best director to do that in the best way, but this time, impossible to accept, he could not turn the idea to good account. The movie's content is not about playing chess with death, this is very important. This is just a sub story. Yes, the film is not about the fellowship of two chess players anyway, but when I read the man who plays chess with death, I supposed that the story would be like: one day, a crusader encounters death. Death requires a chess game, if the man wins, he is set free, if the death does, the man dies. The chess game continues for months and till the game ends, his questions about life, death and God are answered. In the end, the man loses. The whole movie focuses on this deadly chess game with certain intervals. In these intervals, you also can show us the villagers who are suffered from plague. It might sound weird, but this had been my expectation. After the first thirty minutes, the story is scattered, collapsed, then we loose our attention, because the movie changes its route. As a result of this, the potential of the story gets out of hand. We are forced to forget the crusader, the crusader's situation. Bergman is not interested in this character enough and also the chess game that seems the heart of the movie, but it is not and it should have been. The chess game cannot be named as a metaphor, because, this is not the point, thus the image which the man who plays chess with death exists as just an image. The crowd make a celebration, they start to sing a song, there is a husband and wife, I mean we see pictures desultory from each other. Those pictures are like theater, but in contrast, not dramatic, not impressive at all. This is the story of 'black death' more, not death. As for direction, only one sentence can summarize the film: the way of storytelling is not powerful. By the way, the crusader encounters the death and the death says I am death, look at the reaction of him; nothing. He is like OK, what's that to me? Sorry, but the name of this is not art. It is stressed that he is a nihilist? However, it looks unconvincing at the end. This is not so important, but this scene deserves to be dramatic. I watched The Virgin Spring and Smultronstallet after The Seventh Seal in order to rehabilitate and I did. Lastly, almost everyone writes the same thing: the film questionnaires the meaning of life, death, faith and the existence of God. Some films have a repetitious sentence and The Seventh Seal's sentence is this. Another commonly used word for the film is symbolism. I cannot give a movie 10 out of 10 owing to only its symbols and themes.",The Seventh Seal

A man playing a game of chess while trying to answer philosophical questions seemed interesting enough. But boy, it was a misleading synopsis, because the movie was nothing like that at all.Firstly, this movie has no plot. It's just some random people washing up the shores of something that the movie doesn't tell you about. I'll admit that the beginning looked interesting. But then I was waiting for something to captivate me, or make me curious about what's gonna happen next. None of those. There were just more random scenes with random characters which I didn't get their names... well to be honest I didn't even got the protagonist's name. The only character whose name I got was the Death. That should tell you a lot about how this movie handles it's characters. What I love about a movie is it's characters... characters with whom I can connect, understand what they're going through and care for what they go through. Here were just random characters for whom I care little or none at all, that just died or were tortured because of religion and that should have made me feel for them or ask myself philosophical questions about existence or God?(again the movie didn't have any philosophically believing dialogue that could make me ask myself philosophical questions). No they didn't because I couldn't connect with them. It was so simplistic that maybe that is why all the critics and reviewers here say this is a great movie. Well for me just didn't work at all.PS: I don't have a problem with the movie for being old. I've seen older movies that had quality. Oh, and speaking of quality the score is very good... but that is maybe the only good thing that I found in this garbage.",The Seventh Seal
134,JaydoDre,A philosophical clear movie.,8,5 December 2014,"Seventh Seal doesn't have the strongest cinematography. It was made in black and white in the time when there was color film available. I know it was probably done on purpose but while it may help the message it does not help the visuals. The shots are not grabbing, not on their own.Also, the sound effects are not synced well. Quality of the recording is average. The music consists more of effects than of actual melody, which again maybe works for the message but definitely not for the aesthetics.What this movie has going for it are interesting themes, dialogue and good actors to speak it.The film is raw and direct. Has a feel of movies like Conan the Brabarian (1982), but with realism and intelligence replacing the action. It is about life, death, love, sex and cruelty, all set against the medieval time period. The dialogue consists chiefly out of the discussion of those subjects and has a poetic colour to it but not overly so. However, you must be prepared for a theatrical feel to the whole thing. Indeed many actors in this film are heavy theater performers.What is really good about Seventh Seal is that it is one of the, unfortunately, rare occasions when art is not pretentious or arrogant. You do not have to wonder hard about the spooky imagery. It does not try to patronize you with its poetry. It is perhaps cliché to even mention the scene that is most remembered about this film, that of the protagonist playing chess with death, but it is a good example. What is a more straight forward metaphor than that? This whole film is that way - straightforward.The downside of the story is that it does not have a lot happening in it. The storyline is mostly about the characters traveling through the countryside and meeting other people. There isn't one centralized structure to the story. But this does not stop the movie from being interesting.Max von Sydow is the main protagonist. To start with, this guy has an interesting face. He looks like a medieval knight, in fact almost like a caricature of one, with his underbite and long crudely carved face and short haircut. And he is a good actor on top that.Bibi Andersson who plays one of the side characters is possibly the prettiest woman I have seen in a very long time. She is conventionally pretty, but that is OK. And the film puts her in such poses and in such dresses and her blond hair shines in such light.in short, I experienced a brief crush on an 80 year old actress.But Gunnar Björnstrand, whose name I had to copy from IMDb for fear of getting an aneurysm trying to type it, is the true protagonist as he gets the most lines and gives them his best. Max von Sydow is more of an observer, while Gunnar is the workhorse.Seventh Seal manages to be funny and grim, smart and blunt. It is totally worth the watch, especially if you are afraid of watching it because you got the impression of it being an overly artsy film. It isn't.",The Seventh Seal
135,stimpy_tr,Just a decent movie,7,11 August 2020,"This is a movie questioning the meaning of life, death, god and devil from a christian point of view. It has references to the Bible and to another film of the director (Wild Strawberries) in some parts. The narrative consists of some fragments from lives of different people but unfortunately there is no concrete subject matter. As expected, it leaves all the questions about meaning of life unanswered and ends in a weird fashion.The only enjoyable part is the crusader knight playing chess against the grim reaper for his life which has become an inspiration to many movies. This movie can be deemed ""mesmerizing"" for those who get impressed by disorganized surrealist movies with loads of meaningless conversations -which they think are meaningful- like Bergman's other movies. As for me, it is just a decent movie.",The Seventh Seal

137,dkncd,A snapshot of the Middle Ages,10,31 October 2007,"""The Seventh Seal"" is Ingmar Bergman's film depicting Sweden during the 14th century in the time of the bubonic plague. The film starts with Antonius Block, a knight and his squire returning from the Crusades to Sweden. Antonius is pursued by Death in corporeal form, and challenges him to a high stakes game of chess. From there the film explores the lives of a number of characters within Sweden with the chess game as a recurring element in the film.My favorite of the characters was Antonius Block, the pensive knight in a crisis of faith played skillfully by Max von Sydow. Also particularly memorable were Gunnar Björnstrand as the snappy and cynical squire and Bengt Ekerot as Death himself. All of the performances in this film were first-rate.This film is very effective as a snapshot of the Middle Ages and includes a mix of humorous and somber scenes to chronicle the age. This film covers a range of topics pertinent to the Middle Ages including the effects of the bubonic plague and Crusades, crises of faith, self-punishment as atonement, love, stage performance, the arbitrary punishment of a ""witch"" and naturally, death. One of the film's notable scenes was when a soothsayer from the church bombards a public audience with a message of doom. All of these themes are considered with striking characterizations and sharp dialogue.The idea of having a lingering Death figure to represent the uncertainty of the time was an excellent one. The dialogues between Block and Death proved among the most interesting moments of the film, even though they only represent a fraction of the film. My only regret of this film is that Bergman didn't include more interplay between Block and Death, but overall ""The Seventh Seal"" is very engaging and interesting.",The Seventh Seal
138,arthera09,artistic masterpiece,9,30 May 2007,"To summarize this movie I would say it is not entertaining at all, but as a piece of art is surpasses most movies I have seen in a while. I would describe watching this movie being similar to going to an art museum and studying original van goghs. Not exciting, but still beautiful none the less. I watched this movie when I was really tired and missed a lot so I decided to watch it again. But because it is really unentertaining it took me a while before I could bring myself to put it in my DVD player. But when I did it was one of the most rewarding movie experiences I have had in a while. The only reason I did not give it a 10 because it was not that entertaining and the scenes with the people whipping themselves lost some of its power (because I have grown up so accustomed to violence in movies). So let's try to start from just the substance of the movie. To even tackle such a hard subject with a movie was extremely bold, but the duologue was so good it almost felt as if I was reading it out of a philosophy book. The desperation of not knowing really pushed this movie forward and it was interesting to see how each of the characters dealt with death and not knowing the end. The fact that death did not know was brilliant and on every level in term of substance it was perfect. There were also some really good shots. The shot where Jon approaches the camera in the empty village was very well done and with live animals very nicely done. Actually one of my favorite shots was a simple one of the Joseph and Mia with the baby and the way the camera above them with Joseph in the front left and Mia in the back right on the tree branch. Not to sound like an ass but the shot felt very organic. I actually loved how he did death here and how he had a sense of humor and loved a challenge making him human. The confidence he exudes was perfect and when he says that he does not know the answer it almost feels as if it is because there is no answer. I like how he used a lot of black in shots of peoples faces. It was really well done and gave that sense of emptiness. My favorite point where that was done is the scene in the church with Death and Block. This is also my favorite scene and I feel as if one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The set up where it feels as if death is in a prison cell to see that Block in indeed the prisoner. The shot of him through the bars where you cannot see the back ground was perfect. I loved all the acting and even it was silly at points (by our standards) it was supposed to be. Even the one guys death scene was meant to be that way. It is interesting that I believe that Joseph and Mia were supposed to die, but Block was able to trick Death, but Death did not know he was tricked. So death can go one thinking he is perfect and has never been beaten. Such a great movie and I could go on and on about it, but I am tired of writing this. Everyone should see this movie and keep in mind that movies can be beautiful pieces of art.",The Seventh Seal
139,pontifikator,Bergman's best-known film is not all angst,8,17 May 2010,"""The Seventh Seal"" is one of Ingmar Bergman's best-known films. It was released in 1957 and showcases the considerable talents of Max von Sydow as Antonius Block (the knight), Gunnar Bjornstrand as Jons (the squire), and Bengt Ekerot as death. I'm sure doctoral dissertations have been written about ""The Seventh Seal,"" but I'll see it as a movie. The movie is set sometime in the Middle Ages. Block was convinced to go to the Holy Land and fight for the Crusades by a certain Raval, apparently a monk or cleric. After ten years of battles, they return home, and Block is utterly disillusioned. Jons apparently was never illusioned, so he has neither qualms nor questions. The film is motivated by Block's questions about the existence or not of God. Arriving home in the midst of the plague, Block sees more death even than in the Crusades, where he lost his faith. During their wanderings, Jons comes upon Raval robbing the dead and preparing to rape a woman. The reason for their going on the Crusades is, it seems, a sham.We follow knight and squire on their way back to Block's wife and home; as they travel they pick up various followers, including death. Block challenges death to a game of chess, which they play desultorily in the pauses of Block's travels. The knight's goals are to find the answer to his doubts whichever way it goes (God or no God) and to do some meaningful act before he dies. Block asks hard questions as he sees the panic caused by the plague, the burning of alleged witches, the mud and muck of the best life had to offer back then. Even death offers no answers. The scene where Block confesses to the monk is excellent and telling.* But Block finds no answers. He does, however, manage to sneak in a meaningful act, saving the lives of a couple and their child.If you haven't seen this since your college years, it's more interesting now. Block's questions are very astute, and Jons's answers are funny now that you're old enough to appreciate his sarcasm and cynicism. There's a lot of humor in ""The Seventh Seal,"" but you have to have some history of life to appreciate it. Each character in the film represents some various philosophical and religious position: doubt, faith, atheism; so ""The Seventh Seal"" is in some respects an allegory like ""The Pilgrim's Progress."" Jons is a great foil for the knight. Witty, smart, and sarcastic, his scenes are equally meaningful. Instead of angst, the squire faces life with the assurance that there is no meaning. His songs are obscene and silly, just like his life. The squire is smart; maybe smarter than his knight. It was an act of genius for Bergman to make them equals in merit, so that their differences play off each other more meaningfully.In two scenes the religious overtones become most obvious. Block shares wild strawberries and milk with Jof and Mia** (parents of Michael), and the knight is clearly moved by the loving relationship of the couple and their baby. He speaks at length about what sharing the food means to him. I take this to be a discourse on what may be the true nature of the eucharist and whether the sacrament is restricted to the church and the priests. Block draws great comfort from the moment of sharing the milk, wild strawberries, and fellowship. The second scene is at the end when all the travelers have finally reached the knight's home, and his wife prepares them what is to be their last supper. Once death has appeared and announced the end of their lives, the last line of the scene is by one of the guests: ""It is finished."" The unanswered, and in this film unanswerable, question is whether life is as Block says a senseless horror.*In ancient times, before giving absolution the penitent was required to be shriven or perform his or her penance. Sometimes the penance was a pilgrimage, often a recitation of a number of prayers, but the penance was to be completed before the absolution was given. In extreme circumstances - if the penitent was dying or condemned, for example - the penitent was given short shrift, then absolution. In this scene, our knight was given no shrift, and there is no absolution.**I am confused about who Jof, Mia, and Michael are or represent. Jof is the familiar diminutive of Joseph, Mia is the diminutive of Maria, and Michael means ""who resembles God."" I would assume they represent Joseph, Mary, and the baby Jesus, but Jof has a vision of the virgin Mary and the Christchild (shown as the same age as Michael). And we later see Mia and Michael in exactly the same pose (Mary holding the child as it learns to walk). Jof also sees death, the only one to do so but for Block (at least till the end when death comes to claim the group). Jof says he sees the other reality, not the reality everyone else sees; I take it he means spiritual reality in addition to physical reality. They may represent only simple human goodness, embodied in a loving family. As presented, they have no deep questions, just love and kindness. Maybe they represent the real answer - don't ask.",The Seventh Seal
140,Spartan_1_1_7,A Though-Provoking Classic by Ingmar Bergman About The Big Questions in Life,8,12 August 2021,"The Seventh Seal (1957), wonderfully written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, is a Swedish film about a lot of things pertaining to BIG questions such as What is God? What is Death? What is the meaning of Life? And other philosophical and theological shizz that comes with it. It is told via a Chess Match between a Knight returning back from the Crusades and Death itself, with the Black Death/Bubonic Plague ravaging the country acting as the backdrop.As is the case with allegorical films such as this, one can take away a lot from their perception of reality and their level of consciousness. The film has subtleties as well as in-your-face messages, especially regarding religion. Since the protagonist is on a journey towards his home, we get to see a plethora of people and how they are living under the circumstances they are dealt with along the way and the different types of humans that can exist.Plenty of characters to keep you interested and thinking, especially since the performances by virtually all of the Actors are top-notch. My top favourites being Max Von Sydow as the Knight,
Bengt Ekerot perfection as DEATH, Nils Poppe as the lively artist, and probably my favourite character, Gunnar Bjornstrand as the cynical voice of reason.There's a lot of powerful imagery in the film often accompanied by a good score. There are MANY great moments that can hit a person differently. For me, one of the most powerful was when Death says ""I Know Nothing"" and the camera zooms in with Death's eyes correspondingly bulging.My takeaway is that people spend too much time trying to understand what God is or who God is or how God works yet they forget to actually LIVE, and living in fear of God is not living. Also, fixating on Death is not the way to go either. Acknowledge those things, yes, but carry on with your own journey while keeping love in your mind, heart and soul. If there is one constant we all can agree on, it's Death... and maybe, just maybe, God is Death. The NOTHINGNESS before everything. The Eternal Darkness. The Dark Divine.Who knows, I could be way off base here as I have only begun learning. Maybe if I watch this film after several years, my understanding of it would be completely different. Regardless, I would highly recommend this classic film if you are in the mood to ruminate on the big things in life. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10.",The Seventh Seal
141,pere-25366,Intelligently analytical and thought-provoking,9,6 July 2016,"I will firstly begin by stating that my full thoughts for this film could not be summed up in a review. I am finding it hard to elucidate my thoughts on a film that constantly has you in a moral struggle. In fact, The Seventh Seal is one of those films that can thrust you into a continual cycle of new interpretations and insight into what ""it"" all means. There is a level of profundity and simplicity established that few films prior had been able to capture nor have been able to match since.The Seventh Seal is about a disillusioned man, Antonious Block, seeking to discover answers to life, death and the existence of God as he plays a game of chess against Death during the Black Plague. I found the premise alone highly original and intriguing. Factor in that this was one of the chef-d'uvres of acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and it had sufficed me. This film, while overt at times, is subtle in displaying small moments of beauty – a beautiful shot of a squirrel appearing on the top of a cut-off tree trunk, the moon glimmering as dusk falls rapidly. In a film oozing with metaphysical thoughts, these moments are cleverly placed, perhaps imperatively so, to remind the audience of the consolation in appreciating all the small beauty that arises in life. Akin to the usage of the river in ""Apocalpyse Now"", The Seventh Seal uses the chess game as a setting of both a literal and metaphorical journey – a connecting link that will be able to guide the flow of the storytelling. Antonious will embark on a journey that, like a chess game, will see him analyze, reflect and understand as he tries to approach some kind of closure for his ambiguity. The inherently glacial nature of a chess game will allow Antonious's journey through his past to be broadened and fulfilling.The pacing in the Seventh Seal was slow at times, with many lulls present amidst the storytelling, making it less watchable for some. And yet, often it was these pauses, somber and still, that sparked the most introspective moments in a film that was constantly in pursuit of answers. The film's brilliant cinematography personifies the emotions of its characters and their surroundings – dark, sinister, powerless. It is able to heighten the viewing experience by becoming that much more vivid, thought-provoking and perceptive.There is a very interesting long shot following the death of Raval, the discourteous theologian, where the camera actually stops, without any edits or movements for roughly 15 seconds. It feels like there is a freeze in time for that duration. It is so silent, eerily so, and, in those 15 seconds, a lot can be interpreted. Pauses in the story can be effectively used to give the audience, amidst all of the eccentricities, a moment to reflect about the themes being discussed at hand, something I am sure Bergman was fully cognizant of. Ambient sounds like a crackling fire or the whirling wind can be heard during a monologue. This film masterfully captures the smaller details others would neglect and in doing so presents much greater possibilities of its intended message.",The Seventh Seal
142,quinimdb,The Seventh Seal,9,9 May 2016,"""The Seventh Seal"" is a film that stares death in the face (literally and figuratively) asking many questions but receiving no answers. It's a film not only about death, but life, love, suffering, and faith and how they all relate, and it does it with grace.Antonius Block is a knight that begins a chess game with Death himself, searching for answers. He's lost his faith, and is beginning to think God and Heaven and Hell are only things created in order to give us hope that there is something after Death, anything. He cannot have a girlfriend or get married due to his knighthood and he only has himself and no happiness. The film reveals the fact that death is hovering above us at all times, and it could strike at any moment. As the tree sawing scene shows, even when we believe we're in the safest possible place, death could take us with no warning. It shows that there is happiness and beauty in life through the actor and actress that have a child and genuinely love life, but it also shows that this happiness is only a distraction from their inevitable fate. It shows us that love can be suffering, but at least it gives us purpose. It shows hopeless humans putting themselves through torture for faith to give themselves hope for their coming death. But when the moment finally comes where Antonius stares Death in the face and asks him if he will reveal his secrets, Death responds by saying ""I have none"". Death is final and death is all there is, and if that sounds depressing, just know that the very end affirms that there is still life for those who can truly find joy in it.",The Seventh Seal

Second of all the performances, particularly from Max von Sydow as Antonius, not to mention Bengt Ekerot as the grim reaper, are absolutely superb.But I found the film, even for an Ingmar Bergman direction, very slowly paced, and I think it suffered from bad editing.Otherwise, I found it to be a very interesting premise for a film, albeit not touching, and I think this could have been conveyed better, as the script held great emotional potential.",The Seventh Seal

It feels like a poetic stage play not an epic movie.I see some influence from Hamlet 10 years earlier and would bet good money Christopher Nolan was influenced by this.The powerful shock value is in the form of the grim reaper.

146,Meganeguard,Checkmate,9,6 February 2006,"After spending ten years in the holy land fighting in the Crusades, the knight Antonious Block and his squire Jöns return to Sweden. However, instead of a warm homecoming, a country that is being ravaged by the Black Plague instead greets the two men.While resting at a beach, Antonious is visited by Death who says that the time has come for the knight's life to end. However, Antonious is not ready for his life to end. It is not because he is afraid of death, but because he wants to gain knowledge of God. With his faith hampered by ten tears fighting in the crusades and by the fact that his countrymen are rotting to death because of the plague Antonious wants to discover if God truly exists or not. Therefore, in order to gain some time, Antonious challenges Death to a game of chess that the two play throughout the film.The main struggle within Bergman's film is the conflict one feels when one wants to have faith in God in times of trouble, however, because God is silent and lets his people suffer one truly wonders if such a God truly exists. However, because one has believed in the God for his or her entire life, one cannot extract go from one's heart and mind thereby making one's wavering faith a source of pain and conflict instead of the bastion of hope it had once been.A slow, meditative film, The Seventh Seal brings to the fore the extremes some people will go to in times of strife. With its depictions of flagellates, those who beat themselves in order to repent for their sins, and witch burnings the film is obviously not a very happy film, but it is one that will make one think of the unknown and whether or nor within this vast unknown is there anything there or is it empty?",The Seventh Seal
147,thinbeach,To play chess with death,7,4 July 2019,"On the surface its a simple film - set in the Middle Ages, with the black plague rife, a knight returning from the crusades questions his faith after being approached by the reaper, called death. That much is compelling, relatable for anyone who has questioned the afterlife, and immersive for the historical journey. The cinematography is superb, and atmosphere rich.But under the surface is something much more complex - an allegory full of religious symbolism, much of which is immediately difficult to grasp. It is repressively dark, with plague, rapists, adulterers, flagellants, witch burning, and the ever lingering presence of death. It also misuses Bible prophecy. The opening of the seals are future events, while the Middle Ages are past. People of the time may certainly have mistaken current events for the end times, but they are not the ones who wrote and titled the script!While its outlook is often bleak and pessimistic, we at least get some ray of light. The names Jof and Mia, the travelling jesters, are Joseph and Mary in English. They are often shown in pleasant surroundings and beautiful bright light, together with their baby. Their love for each other is pure and uncorrupted, their manner, unlike the others, is pleasant, and the most joyous scene depicts an idyllic afternoon, where they picnic and play lute. Jof has the gift of seeing visions, and once leaving the forest they are not pursued by the reaper, and are the only characters spared from death. As this charming couple receive the closing shot, wandering off into the light, it is they who provide the direction to be followed, the answer to our knights desperate questions, and there is room for optimism after all.",The Seventh Seal

149,steven_torrey,A tad much on the intellectually presumptupus scale,10,18 November 2019,"When I first saw this film. I was only about 20 or a little older and I was impressed. Of course, in college we read Tolstoy, ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"", Kierkegaard ""Fear and Trembling"", ""Sickness unto Death"", Bishop Robinson ""The Death of God,"" and the poetry of murdered UN Secretary Dag Hammarskjöld, and saw the Movie, read the book, ""Sophie's Choice"", and existentialism was the philosophy du jour.I saw it the other night paired with ""The Naked Edge"" 1961 (both on YouTube) and ""The Seventh Seal"" loses something as one matures. In ""The Naked Edge"" the newly married Gary Cooper has the taint of being a murderer on him, something his new wife is concerned about. And Cooper is concerned that his new wife might think he is a murderer. The movie, being a thriller, by its end the new wife is about to be murdered and the audience is left to wonder until the last moment by whom. Now that is darkness. Considering your spouse to be a murder, the spouse knows that his wife thinks him a murderer...In ""The Seventh Seal"" Death is subject of the film in that over the top way. Or fear of death is the subject; but in the Middle Ages with the Black Plague, who would not or should not have feared death. But the viewer wonders: is this too obvious, too over the top? At age 20, the film impressed; by age 74, it had worn thin.I still give it a 10 for it is an excellent film.",The Seventh Seal
150,kekca,My rating: 9,9,31 December 2014,"Talking specifically about this title we should mention first the serious part, which I see in the deep commitment to God's Word. It is not by chance that the time in which the action takes place is the Middle Ages - as if the only intelligible world of man then was then religious one. And I must mention the burdens finale in which death refers all.Indeed, the theme of death is also central and serious, but as in life - to her we give our last thoughts. The action starts on the beach (a symbol of transition to infinity or origin of life on earth), where the main character causes death, that came for him, at chess. The idea is to win some time to buy someone else's life.Death is presented as a mystery, as the deadline which is pressing and tormenting our conscience. It is difficult to find higher instance before which the protagonist to kneel, to feel guilt. The only time he decided yet to do so, it appeared that confession was before death. So it turns out that actually the manifest was in front of himself, but in his last hour (death).Here eminence is given into the hands of intelligent people and artists, then the religious and finally to the ordinary people. The plague rages in the Middle Ages putting to test the faith of believers and asking questions about the meaning of human existence. However, there are many rays of light, saved young lives, there are people who happily lived their lives.

Sure, its themes (life, death, religion) are pretty serious. But Bergman manages to tell his story in a rather watchable, understandable film of 90 minutes. Which isn't how it usually is. Off course this is not for the mainstream American cinema lovers. But it is worth a watch. Not all scenes are interesting. But the verbal battle between a young Von Sydow (always good) and Death are a great watch and the Swedish language adds to the flavor. A shame there is no more of it in the film.

153,SinjinSB,Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death,9,15 October 2002,"An excellent Swedish film, directed by Ingmar Bergman. A knight and his squire return from home the crusades to Sweden which is being swept by the plague. He is approached by Death who's come for him and the knight challenges Death to a game of chess to spare his life. Not knowing, I expected this movie to be focused on the game of chess, when it's really more telling the story of how people dealt with the tumultuous times dealing with the black death that is killing off the people. I'm glad this was the case as it is what really drew me into the story. So many interesting elements. Seeing how the religious officials were blaming people for their sins and telling them it was punishment from God. The most telling scene in the movie was when they were talking to the girl who was about burned alive for being involved with the devil. There was one scene that amused me, probably more than intended...when Death was cutting down the tree with a saw. I really enjoyed the lighter scenes that contrasted the serious ones in the movie. Ultimately I believe it was never the knight's intention to really try and beat Death, but to try to prolong life as long as possible in hopes of accomplishing something positive...in this case helping the couple and their child. This is my first Bergman movie, but it makes me anxious to explore more of his work. While watching, it was easy to spot many parts that have been borrowed/parodied in future films...it was good to finally see the source.***1/2 (Out of 4) Rank: #3 in 1957",The Seventh Seal

There is the one who has a strong faith and thanks to this is able to be less anxious, there is an artist who has a special sensitivity about life and love, there is an atheist who is the most rational and the one who lives more freely than the others and there's the knight who fought in the crusade and at the time in which he has to confront his possible death loses all of his beliefs to became obsessed with the sense of life and what religion is. And his struggles are amplified by the fact that the Church at that time was corrupted and wasn't a real guidance for the believer's souls. The great thing about ""The Seventh Seal"" is that the answers are not definitive because life does not provide them. These important themes are supported by great cinematography, music, choreography and acting making it a very good movie in all of his aspects.
""The Seventh Seal"" is one of the ancestors of the modern cinema and everyone should watch it at least once.",The Seventh Seal
155,jon_pratt12345,Surprisingly funny and entertaining,7,10 March 2021,It was not what I was expecting! The film had a strong comedic streak and not a great deal of chess. An entertaining look at how people spend their lives and a search for meaning through the lens of the middle ages. There are some very dark scenes and the theme is heavy but it is not a difficult or challenging watch as I had expected it might be.,The Seventh Seal
156,pzanardo,A miracle. The greatest work of art of the 20th century,10,28 September 2007,"""The Seventh Seal"" goes beyond the notion of movie. For me it is a miracle. Much simply said, the greatest work of art of the 20th century. The abyssal depth of this film is stunning. The greatest questions that have shaken the human mind and soul from the beginning of the species, Death, God, Love, Evil, Meaning of Life, Desperation, Hope, are here faced with sound courage and outstanding intelligence.No doubt that the director Ingmar Bergman was a genius. But his other works, though many of them extraordinary, were just movies, while in the ""The Seventh Seal"" he reached the level of the greatest artists of human history. The images are worth of Duerer, Bosch, Bruegel. The script, the psychological study of the characters and the poetry are worth of Shakespeare and Goethe. The depth of the philosophical and theological investigation is worth of Spinoza and Swedenborg. The Middle Ages of Northern Europe are recreated with the accuracy and care for details of a great artist. The monk's sermon on sin and repentance grates to our modern ears, but we realize that it is perfectly coherent and realistic for the Middle Ages. The knight and his squire see the witch executed on the stake. They are disgusted, but they accept it and do not interfere. That's the way people were in those times. And the disturbing scene at the tavern, were, for no reason, the innocent, meek tumbler is abused and everybody laughs at him, is fully realistic, as well. That was people's sense of humor in those ages. The ancient Nordic culture is represented in all its terrible splendor: the plague, the flagellants, the witch hunt, the mystic visions of the tumbler, the encounter of the knight and his skeptical squire with the wandering actors, the fool girl, the reading of the Apocalypse. And, of course, the chess-match with the Death, one of the most powerful symbols in the history of art. Among uncountable instances, I record a wonderful subtlety of the script. The knight says to the Death ""I don't fear to die, but, please, tell me: is there a God?"" But not even the Death can answer. He just knows his own dreadful existence.Since, after all, we are speaking of a film, let me remark that there isn't a single moment of bore in ""The Seventh Seal"", in spite of the profound problems it deals with.Are the above enthusiastic comments somehow exaggerated? I don't think so. Watch ""The Seventh Seal"" and merge yourself into Art at its highest level.",The Seventh Seal
157,kyle_c,An Thinking Man's Film,9,3 June 2002,"The Seventh Seal is a truly unique film.  Few movies have successfully taken such a direct approach to the questions of life and death.  Rather than subtly hide it in some other story, Bergman creates a character who openly wonders about these questions.A knight, Antonious Block (Max von Sydow) is returning to his native Sweden from the crusades.  Finding his land in the midst of plague, and thinking about what he saw in the crusades, he begins to wonder about life, death, god, and so on.  He meets death, who has come to take him. He challenges death to a game of chess - if he wins, he goes free, and if death wins, he takes him.Technically, this movie is magnificent.  The lighting, the camera angles - everything is superb.  It is a masterpiece simply as a period film. Everything from the sets to the costumes is top notch.  The setting of the film - medieval Europe suffering from the plague  - is well suited for to handle the themes portrayed in the film.Most of the film is symbolic and allegorical.  It features little action, but rather contemplation and questioning.  While it is not what I would describe as accessible, it is certainly more accessible and entertaining than most of its kind.  Highly recommended for anybody who questions death and our existence, not for somebody who wants to see lots of blood and explosions.**** out of ****",The Seventh Seal

Amusing in its exaggerations, both visually and in dialogue, but highly artistic, well played, photographed and directed.",The Seventh Seal
159,vishal_wall,Religion Vs Art,8,13 December 2005,"'Seventh Seal' is a complex movie. After having fought for 10 years a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) starts questioning the existence of God itself and decides to go back home. On his way back he meets death. Von Sydow challenges death to play chess with him. If he wins he lives else death can claim his life. While this game is going on Sydow meets a singer, his wife and his son. Singer has power to see supernatural things which even his wife doesn't believe in. Sydow sees the impact of religion on normal people and misery of a common man. By the end of the movie he is shown losing to death. I don't want to give away the end of the film although it's so weird that you might see it in a different light altogether. It's a very responsible cinema. Despite the fact that movie asks an orthodox question ""IS there God?"" It comes out without answering the question but in a convincing way. The whole of actor's track is in layers. My interpretation of the actor being able to see supernatural is that artists have a better sense of life and so they have an ability to interpret regular incident in a more comprehensive way. I am sure there are other interpretations too. Stage performance followed by a Christian procession is a powerful sequence. Bergman has tapped the insignificance of art in Europe in the 14th century in this track. Movie becomes slow after a point but reaches at a well deserved climax. For me actor's track is the highlight of the film. Crusader, death and religion have been talked about in several movies but its one rare movie which talks about importance (rather lack of) of art during the dark age of Pope Mafia. It is a must watch for a person who wants to understand the negative impact of religion on the 'herd' psychology of people. This movie made me wonder what would have happened if Renaissance didn't happen. This is one of those movies where 5 persons come out with 5 different statements about the movie.",The Seventh Seal

The themes are serious and the acting excellent, especially Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand . But the constant philosophical monologues about god, existence, death etc become tiresome. There's also a certain staged quality about a number of scenes. The one with the actor in the tree while death saws it down comes to mind.

162,AbhiMathews,Seeking Light,8,1 December 2013,"Death is an inevitable fate we will all succumb to. Learning to live life joyfully and seeking answers for the innumerable questions we have is what gives life its worth and essence. ""When"" our time ends is out of our hands but what we do with it is something we have control over. It is the dynamic idea of ""freedom of life, yet constraints of time"" that this movie explores. In this film, a knight and his squire return from a crusade. Once back, they begin questioning the purpose of life, the existence of deity and begin a long journey with Death at their footsteps. Life is rough. After visiting home after years of fighting for an unfounded cause, the knight feels desolate and detached from others and seeks for the light in life that he once had. The time at which we pass away will be when we least expect it. Throughout this movie, we see the knight playing Death in chess. He tries to gain time by cheating and evading death, but in the end, we will always lose the battle. This movie does a masterful job in demonstrating mortality and how our lifetime is to realize the significance of our placement here on Earth.",The Seventh Seal
163,zolaaar,"'Whatever You Always See""",10,2 June 2008,"Both plot lines, the knight Antonius Block in search for god and/or Satan and a juggler family on tour through medieval Sweden, were started separately until they meet at a performance in a village. The knight and his squire find rest at the caravan of the family and this is the key scene of the whole film. The woman serves her guests with simple bounties of nature, with strawberries and milk. She takes life as it comes and in her companion with that joie de vivre, Antonius finds deep peace. He explicitly commits that he'll always remember the happiness of this moment, the bowl filled with strawberries, the milk, the conversations he has with this charming actor couple Mia and Jof.I think, exactly this is the quintessence of the film: Such happiness and fortune can't be known as a permanent condition, but answers the question ""What is the meaning of life?"" Because of moments like this peaceful rest in harmony, sympathy, joy life has its value (a concept Bergman also explains in Wild Strawberries and Cries and Whispers). And that is why the closing scene also belongs to Mia and Jof. Jof sees a Dance of Death at the horizon, but Mia wipes off his visions with the words: ""Whatever you always see.""",The Seventh Seal

To me, this was a poorly acted, pathetically directed mess.I'll give two early on examples. The opening scene is of two old timey knights passed out on a rocky beach. They seem exhausted as if they just washed up after an shipwreck and passed out from swimming in apparently with their horses. IF not a a shipwreck, there's no explanation for why two guys in armor are sleeping on a cobble beach.Along comes a guy in a hoodie announcing he's death but he agrees to a chess game on a chessboard that JUST HAPPENS to be set up pieces and all waiting for him. In the background, the horses are seen drinking the ocean water - again apparently.Cut to a few people sleeping in a sheep wagon. A guy wakes up, goes outside, and starts dancing around. Name ONE guy ever who woke up and failed to take a leak. That's what I mean by pathetic directing.There's an overlay narration about some biblical nonsense that fails to give things context because if Revelation did occur in the middle ages, there's be no cinema for this director to screw up.",The Seventh Seal

166,MetalAngel,See it at all costs!!!!,10,20 September 2009,"When it comes to deciding the forefathers of emotional, psychological cinema that deals with potently devastating topics, one of the films that definitely comes up is Ingmar Bergman's utter masterpiece ""Det sjunde inseglet"". We begin by seeing it as a small, independent film from Europe that may be interesting to observe if only for the culture and the obvious linguistic differences. By the end of the last minute, we can't believe how such a seemingly small film has been able to move us, and how it has been able to force us into thinking about heavy and potentially disturbing topics that we've all come to wonder about at some point of our lives...and it does so with such precision and searing accuracy, that we wonder how we couldn't have noticed such a gem before.The film deals with a 14th century crusader (Max Von Sydow) who's returning from the Holy Land after many years of endless battle, and on his way home, he encounters the Angel of Death on a long-forgotten beach. Death has, obviously, come to claim him at last, as He has been known to do so for quite a while, what with the Plague finishing off most of Europe with the pest. This particular crusader, an important and intelligent man, decides to challenge Death in a game of chess: he forestalls his demise until the game is over, and if he wins death will move one and let him live for many more years. If Death wins...well, you'll see.As the crusader fights an endless game of chess with Death, he travels with his faithful but constantly reproaching squire back to his castle. On the way, they meet a number of interesting characters that help (or, actually, make up) the plot of the film. Each character embodies a different take on the religious aspect of the Dark Ages, and provides, each in his/her own way, a particular point of view on the themes of death, the afterlife, and moral correct-ness.The crusader himself has doubts about this, doubts that never let him sleep and that are troubling his existence: What is there in the afterlife? Is there a God and a Devil? Is there even an afterlife or is there simply nothingness once you die? Death is, naturally, vague about these topics and refuses to relinquish any information as he plays chess with the crusader, but the characters he meets provide their own hypotheses to these questions and add to his infinite wisdom. Our crusader decides that he will die only until he has corrected some wrongs in his life and, more importantly, until he has performed a good deed that will finally make his existence on earth valuable.But these are very difficult questions to be answered, and Ingmar Bergman makes a point of heightening the difficulty by placing the moral and emotional struggles smack down the middle ages and their obscurely slovenly society. The dialogue and reflective monologues from the characters establish the ideas that torment the characters, and the images that are presented heighten the intensity of the topics (unflinchingly) to astronomical heights, involving the viewer not only in the story and development of the film, but on the director's point and art as well.The images seen are some of the most famous and remembered in all of cinematic history; they're short episodes the characters witness, and they're burned into the viewer's mind forever: a procession of martyrs who travel around the country in self-flagellation and pleading for God's forgiveness; a woman who has consorted with the devil and has her hands and feet stoned and broken, and is finally burned at the stake; a poor and kind-hearted juggler who dances like a bear to save his life from an amoral and sodomite crowd; the Virgin Mary walking with her naked infant in a meadow; a joyous picnic between newfound friends (the scene that, I believe, anchors the point of the film and upsets the general angst and ""normalized"" horror the rest of the film presents); and, more importantly, the scene where the crusader confesses himself to Death, exposing in a very well-organised monologue the pain and insecurity humans feel towards nothingness and their man-made need to believe in a God that gives sense to our trajectory in earth and our possible entrance to the Next World.I won't go into analyzing the characters the crusader meets. Even though they're crucial to a thorough examination of how the moral dilemma is augmented and supported, I'd have to discuss a large list of spoilers that would do nothing to the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the film. Let's just say that, without even seeming to try, these characters move precariously through these dark and dangerous times, sometimes understanding the supernatural world they live in, sometimes overwhelmed by it's implications and finally being able to do nothing about it.The screenplay is an obvious masterpiece, but so is the photography (which is all-inclusive and treats the scenes with a special ominous foreboding that keeps us on the edge of our seat every single minute), and so is the acting (which, even though is melodramatic to a large extent, always remains balanced and adequate).This is a difficult film to try and explain. It was treated with an exorbitant amount of acuteness and love, and the topics were so well-presented and developed, that I could write page after page about what I learned, what I think, and how each minute of the film could only advance my wonderment. But, thankfully, it is not my job to detail my analysis, but to review the film...and, in conclusion, I find it to be a perfectly made movie that will always be embedded into my memory. See it at all costs! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",The Seventh Seal

168,johnmbale,Bergman's Brilliance Abounds,10,23 April 2006,"What makes The Seventh Seal - an apocryphal and uncompromising fable of medieval Sweden - one of the masterpieces of Cinema ? Ingmar Bergman creates a believable world of dark happenings, wherein Death can play chess with a Knight, witches burn at the stake, with flagellants, and plague ever present. Through superb black and white images, each carefully composed for maximum effect, sets and costumes, his fine actors seem to truly inhabit this frightening world. Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, and Bengt Ekerot lead a marvelous cast. But its not all doom and gloom, as the Knight tries to determine in his quest, the meaning of life, and if God exists at all. There are moments of sheer happiness and peace, such as the sequence of the milk and strawberries at dusk, and a number of bawdy comic moments throughout the film. Which balances the darker side. It is unforgettable and I still remember seeing it on its first release, being stunned by the quality of the photography, and the performances. A restored version on DVD is recommended. Bergman is one of the great film makers of our time. Seldom today do we see such precise and considered images on the screen. Not to be missed.",The Seventh Seal

What happens after we die? The movie question this all but give no answers, I don't really need a movie to make me question this subjects or think about this.

Yeah, lots of really cool looking images but they just don't add up to anything. ""The Seventh Seal"" is the very definition of what's known today as ""Independent Film"". It looks good enough that people believe that there just has to be some substance floating around in there somewhere, but I'll be darned if I'll ever be able to point any of it out. Because of Bergman's recent death, I once again had a chance to see it on TCM. And once again I barely made it past the ""famous"" opening scene with Death playing chess on the beach. I finally do have one thing figured out though. The opening scene is the best known scene from the film because hardly anyone can get beyond it. Oh sure, the Black Leather Art Crowd will tell you they watched the whole film, but don't believe it. They watch that stupid Death plays chess on the beach scene, rate the film a ""10"" and then post a glowing review here on IMDb to prove they know art when they see it! When it comes to Bergman films though, I'm simply too stupid to ""get"" them. So please don't flame me for my obviously ignorant opinion. After all, my misguided views DO give the whole artsy black leather wearing community someone to shake their collective heads at while muttering ""He just DOESN'T get it!""

171,SpaaceMonkee,A Moving Portrait of the Uncertainties of Faith,9,11 April 2021,"The Seventh Seal tells the story of a jaded knight, Antonious Block, retuning home from the crusades (Von Sydow) accompanied by his equally cynical squire, Jons (Bjornstrand), only to find the homeland overcome by the plague. Early on, the knight finds himself in a chess game with Death, with Block's demise tabled pending the result of the game. This metaphorical backdrop sets the scene for the knight's journey back to his castle. Along the way, he is joined by a set of circus performers, Jof, his wife, and their infant son.Beautifully shot, the film juxtaposes the bitter cynicism of those long away at war for a cause that seems lost against the fervent belief of the local townsfolk, some or whom are willing to self-flagellate in the hopes of penance against the plague that has befallen the land.Jons the squire steals the show, in his best performance across Bergman's films, and the movie executes excellently on all fronts. Somewhat surprisingly, it deftly mixes humor with resignation and raises profound questions about the meaning of life.

But as far as the film is concerned isn't death appearing as a person proof of the afterlife? It is not just a bleak film since it has some genuine humor in it.

174,LeroyBrown-2,"Brilliant, a true masterpiece",10,14 January 2009,"This is the kind of movie that requires attention from the viewer. It is metaphoric, not about medieval times but about all human beings, at all times. The story is simple, a Knight (Max Von Sydow) coming home from the crusades to a land ravaged by the plague. He encounters death and challenge him to a game of chess. He is not really seeking to prolong his life instead he is really seeking answers. He has seen death in the crusades and he is facing more death as he comes home.The scene with the Knight and Death playing chess by the seashore is one of the most haunting scenes in this movie. There are many of them. Ingmar Bergman really pulled out all the stops to create a movie which will haunt you and at the same time make you ponder. It's not just about a Knight on a pointless game but about all human beings. The Knight represents all human being asking the same questions.The scene that affected me most is the scene when the knight arrives at a monastery and is confessing to who he thought was a monk or a priest. The questions that the knight asked are the kind of questions that we all have asked and the response that he gets is pretty much the response we will get. The movie delves into the question of mortality and the meaning of existence. Anybody who has thought about it will understand the Knight's frustration and despondency, for the answer is perhaps nonexistent. For me the brilliance of this film is that it asked the important questions early and left us with no real answers. By asking the questions, scenes in this movie are not just images but they have underlying meanings. Meanings that we the viewer then create for ourselves. What was the scene with the strawberries and milk mean? If it had any meaning at all. I find myself thinking that that scene is about joy of simple pleasure and being with pleasant people providing us with good feelings and memories that we will treasure. I have to admit I have rarely seen a movie that affected me as much as this movie. It was one of those movies I personally would like to have seen again back to back. The movies that I frequently would watch back to back were light weight stuff comedies or action films. Rarely do I wish to see serious drama again back to back.Right now I will have to admit it barely missed being in my top ten greatest films. I have a feeling that the next time I see it again I will have to move it very high.",The Seventh Seal
175,AdFin,Unarguably one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.,10,17 April 2002,"My first taste of the work of Ingmar Bergman came late last year, when I first saw The Virgin Spring.  My initial reaction to that film was one of bewilderment; being new to Bergman, I just wasn't sure what to make of it. The second Bergman film I saw was Persona; again I just didn't fully grasp the film and in my naivety, belittled the staggering work of art I now hail it as by saying that it needed to make sense.  I know understand Bergman's work a little better, and understand that The Virgin Spring was Bergman's least personal film, and one that he accepted as a director for hire. Persona on the other hand is often credited as the director's most complex and experimental film, open to interpretation and definitely not a film for all tastes.  Now I have seen my third Bergman film, the classic of art-house cinema that is The Seventh Seal.The Seventh Seal is everything a great film should aspire to be, a joy to watch from start to finish and filled with a mixture if wonderful performances and haunting images.  It was also nice to see a much more simplistic story after the mind bending Persona.  Here Bergman's key concerns are not psychological mind games and disintegrating personalities, instead he looks at the themes that would in later years become synonymous with his cannon of work, religion, and death (or waiting for death, as illustrated in Cries & Whispers as well as here).  The film follows knight Antonious Block (Max Von Sydow) and his companion Jöns as they return from the crusades.  Death has long since walked besides Block, and now the hooded figure believes it is his time to go, Block however has other ideas and challenges Death to a game of chess, if he wins, his life will be spared. This gives us the first iconic image of the film, possibly the first major iconic image of art-house film-making, as Block sits by the sea playing chess with the apparition of Death.As the film moves on, Block and his companion make their way to the nearest town, where a religious procession enter and warn the villagers of the plague.  This is another key sequence in the film, and the way Bergman films the entrance is nothing short of genius.  The cutting and camera angles (together with the naturally beautiful black and white film stock) evoke and convey the growing sense of dread that has been following our hero's from the outset.  The key theme in this film seems to be not only religion, but also loss of faith.  Antonious spends much of his time condemning the crusades for the pointless loss of millions, all in the name of god, and later it becomes more apparent that Block believes god to have abandoned him.  This truly is a classic film, and a true work of cinematic art.  10/10",The Seventh Seal

The film contains great close-up's, excellent acting and hope in humanity by the gateaway of actor couple and their sons.
Not to mention that one of the most powerful finales cinema has ever presented.
Overall, good work by Bergman but the theme of life/death got deeper and deeper in later films and better explored.",The Seventh Seal
177,bhicks56,One of my favorite foreign movies,10,3 December 1999,"Foreign movies can be so cool. Being an 18-year-old film fanatic from America, and trying to rent the best imported movies from the local video store isn't as easy as I wished it would be. Not that foreign titles are hard to find, but you aren't always in the mood to read subtitles through-out a film, no matter how great it is (and I despise dubbing).Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, a sweeping journey into the last days of Max von Sydow's crusader's life as he tries to find many answers before he is taken away by Death (Bengt Ekerot, in a magnificent performance). Among these questions is the reason behind God's rapidly migrating Black Plague throughout the country. Is it a punishment to the mortals, a comeuppance? von Sydow tries to prolong his life in the film's wittiest scene, by playing a game of chess with Death.The medieval landscape is a very romantic quality to this drama, though the dreaded undertones of seriousness keep your feet to the ground. You are always aware that death is around the corner, that the Plague is a serious issue, that people are looking into the skies for answers from a Creator who has supposedly cursed them.The film is shot entirely in black and white, which adds a little whimsy into the tale. Especially in the scenes of the beach (it is always interesting and surreal watching a knight admire waves which the viewer familiarizes with surfers and beach bunnies). There are some other cool allegory scenes like Death sawing a man down from a tree as the man tries to escape him. No matter how hard you try, you can never escape death. But the most magnificent scene is the end, where the troupe of passersby seek shelter in a castle and are approached by Death, who takes them to dance upon the hills. Finally, the Black Death has confronted our heroes, and the game of chess is over.",The Seventh Seal
178,The_Triad,I got something for you to chew over,7,6 June 2006,"The Seventh Seal is a very difficult film to review, it is a very powerful film that raises a lot of questions for the viewer to consider and it achieves that aim very well, but it doesn't really do much else. The Seventh Seal has a large cast of characters who all come together within the film's vague plot (a Knight returning home from the crusades, who plays a game of chess with Death along the way), it does feel as though some characterisation has been lost somewhere as a result of the little screen time given to each one, personally I would have liked to have got to known these characters a bit more, but it is not really necessary for the viewer to do so for the film to achieve it's aims. Which is basically for the viewer to examine himself and ask questions about what will happen when we die. With the main character of the Knight taking to asking most of the questions, as he is desperate to find out where he will go when he succumbs to Death's checkmate. As, ultimately, these questions are not answered in the film, it means that a lot of the impact The Seventh Seal has takes place off screen, in it's prompting of the viewer to ask this for themselves. Can it be that all that's waiting for us is nothing? One of philosophy's most asked questions, and to be honest, one that most human beings have asked themselves from a young age, so most of the dialogue on this subject can hardly be called especially profound. The dialogue is quite philosophical heavy, as you might expect, and does help provide a good amount of interest in the film, the cinematography and acting too, are very good, most notably Max Von Sydow's performance. Not one to watch to entertain your mates, The Seventh Seal is a well made philosophical piece that will give the viewer something to think about, ultimately they have thought about it before so it's nothing new, but more a cold reminder that Death is waiting.",The Seventh Seal

180,adam-may-bower,Masterpiece,10,2 June 2018,"'The Seventh Seal' is a metaphorical masterpiece by Ingmar Bergman. This film is a brilliant artwork that asks big existential and religious questions that every human being as pondered some point in their life. Set in the harrowing and dim Middle Ages during the Black Plaque, Bergman captivates his audience into a world of anger, fear, sorrow and doubt and engages the audience in an beautiful narrative that follows the troubled knight Antonius Block, played brilliantly by Swedish actor Max von Sydow. While the film is evidently dated, it has never lost it's remark-ability. It almost seems incomparable with modern films today. Scene after scene, Bergman's philological film takes it's audience on a journey with it's characters and even though it may ask many questions and leave few answers, you leave the film feeling more knowledgable on your life and where you are headed. The brilliancy of this film is that Bergman does not try to convince his audience to believe his ""protestant atheist"" views, but rather just show them. He presents atheistic views one character, and then a faithful, religious view another leaving this film to be unbiased and essentially encourages individuals of any view to think with an open mind.",The Seventh Seal

I honestly don't think I fully understood it. My initial thoughts were that it was a great film with great cinematography and very well executed it's themes of death and questioning of faith/religion and its meaning, and that's probably exactly what it is. However, I feel like it's more than that. Some of the symbolism that was distinguished throughout this film probably flew over my head, however I am aware that it was there. On a technical level, this is a masterpiece, just like many of the other foreign black and white films I've watched recently. But, once again, this was just not my kind of movie. A tad boring and too artsy, you have to constantly be hooked to something that may not interest you all that much. I COMPLETELY understand everyone's love for it and the high ratings, but art films like this one are just not NECESSARILY my cup of tea. I emphasize necessarily because there are certain art films similar to this that I really like. But some are slightly more tedious than others. However, this is a must watch for film watchers. I definitely do recommend this one to anyone who has a taste for that sort of thing that i mentioned above^, you will absolutely love this one.

As they approach home, Death, chillingly played with conviction by Bengt Ekerot in a scene-stealing performance, appears to them in human form as a hooded, black cloaked pale man with a piercing glance. Block challenges the omnipotent Death to a games of Chess, which he excepts, where If Block wins, he can live. Block will try to cheat Death, but at the end it will Death who cheats him.

183,Teyss,"Macabre farce about life, death and salvation",10,11 November 2016,"""The Seventh Seal"" is a fable and, as all fables, encloses an allegory and a final message.The allegory is: life on this earth is precarious, harsh, aimless. People err, fight against elements and each other, hesitate between religion and profane, look for God. The movie explores different possible reactions: the knight Antonius searches for a purpose, questions his faith and God; his squire Jons became atheist and cynical; the former devout Raval profits from ambient chaos with theft and violence; the silent girl is mystical, as we eventually discover; priests impose a radical version of religion (see below); the artists enjoy a simple life.The message is: enjoy as the artists a life of love and simple pleasures. While the context is pessimistic, the ending is optimistic: Jof, Mia and their son survive and in the last image walk quietly towards the sun. Note the additional religious symbol: Jof's full name is Joseph, Mia's is Mary and their baby appears as the young Jesus. This echoes the vision Jof has the beginning of the movie, when he sees the Virgin with the Infant. The underlying point seems to be: revert to the authentic learning of Christ, do not follow religious propagandists who impose their power with fear, useless crusades, masochist rituals, purification by fire and executions.RELIGIONReligion is omnipresent: scary frescoes, clergy, procession, dialogues, rules and, of course, the biblical quote repeated at the beginning and the end that gives the movie its title. Death also is omnipresent:
At the beginning on the beach, Antonius and Jons appear to be lifeless.Death appears in person (with second degree humour as we will see).People succumb by numbers.Skat's death mask shows at different moments.In the inn there is a live pig, while a dead one roasts in the middle.When Skat seduces a woman, they eat chicken before a live chicken appears.ARTThe artists overcome both death and the drastic version of religion. This opposition noticeably shows during the village feast.
Jof and Mia stage a ludicrous and blasphemous song that is actually quite funny: we are sometimes unsure if animal noises are coming from actual animals or humansThe images of Skat seducing a plump woman, while the song unrolls, add a peculiar comical element.A religious procession then interrupts the song; a monk frightens and insults the crowd; the procession resumes.This moment constitutes one of Bergman's most powerful scenes. We are shocked by the image, impressed by the music, can almost smell the thick incense. Berman's view on this ritual is obviously negative: at the end, the procession is filmed in despising high-angle shot where characters are reduced to miniatures and shadows, then dissolved leaving an empty image on a dusty road.Conversely, the view on the artists is positive:
They sincerely love each other. They are the only family: all other characters are lonely; the knight has not seen his wife since long.They trigger all good moments in the movie.They are generally associated with bright lighting, while other scenes are mostly dim or hazy: the beginning on the beach; inside the church, the inn and houses; the procession; the forest; the execution at night.Even though Jof is somewhat ridiculous, he is the only one to have meaningful visions: the Virgin Mary, Death.Scenes with the artists are of simple poetic beauty, for instance at the beginning or when they share fresh milk and strawberries with the knight. All five senses are fulfilled: the food is delicious; the sun is shining; Mia says the baby and the strawberries smell good; Jof plays calm music; characters feel the evening breeze in their hair. The artists manage to expel Antonius's dark thoughts: when he asserts that ""To believe is to suffer"", Mia proposes strawberries and he relaxes. Dialogues are poetic: ""I will remember our talk and carry this memory in my hands, as if it were a bowl of fresh milk"", Antonius says as he drinks from the bowl.He is transformed after meeting the caring family. Thanks to them he eventually finds a purpose: saving them. At the end he scatters the chess pieces so Death will not notice they are going away. Probably, he even loses intentionally so Death will take his life and not theirs: he is willing to sacrifice his meaningless life for their happiness. Hence salvation is achieved through love and art rather than religion.FARCETo show he is on the artists' side, Bergman does more than exalt them: he adopts their style. Notably, the movie has a burlesque humour that resembles the artists', for instance when Skat elopes with the blacksmith's wife or when he dies. Even Death is ridiculed:
It is outplayed by Antonius at chess and has to use a subterfuge in church to discover his plans.It has to physically saw the tree on which Skat is perched to kill him.It does not notice Antonius's ploy to save the family.When Antonius asks for the truth, it confesses: ""I know nothing.""Another illustration of the complicity with the artists: some scenes are filmed as in a play, for instance when Skat and the blacksmith argue about the latter's wife. The rest of the group is watching and commenting as if viewing a performance.Hence the movie is not tragic as it first seems: it is a macabre farce on line with medieval style, mixing horror and grotesque throughout. Staging the story during Middle Ages allows Bergman to inflate detachment and allegory. As such, it is a unique movie in his extended filmography, and one of his best. (Jungfrukällan (1960) shot three years later also is a medieval tale, but it is much darker.)Moreover, Bergman introduces references to our contemporary world that increase the impact of the fable.
Jons says about the procession: ""Is this what is offered to modern men? Do they believe we will take this seriously?""Deaths and the looming plague are references to WWII that ended just 12 years before the movie and the cold war that was at its height.There is a universal message about finding scapegoats (the alleged witch) in dire periods.Yes, we can prevail in this sombre world, provided we have love, humour and a poetic vision.",The Seventh Seal
184,rtrnt,"Bergman's stirring, thought-provoking take on religion, death and mortality",9,1 February 2021,"Max von Sydow's young knight who has just returned from the Crusades, fighting for a cause which he himself did not understand, let alone believe in, suddenly finds himself in a battle of wits with Death, which turns into a winding journey. The tremendous subtlety with which Bergman conveys this story is a testament to his extraordinary ability as one of the great directors in history. It's a rare film that might warrant more than one viewing to fully appreciate its depth and character.Even though I thought the ending could have been more emphatic and cathartic, it still left me convinced that Bergman intended this film to be his deeply personal take on the excesses of religious dogma and the willful ignorance of those who choose to follow it. It has a haunting feeling throughout and leaves the viewer puzzled and in awe at the same time. One memorable sequence after another. Strongly recommended to anyone, even if he or she is not a film buff.",The Seventh Seal
185,evileyereviews,The Pain of Questions Left Unanswered,10,19 November 2010,"This simple precept for this flick is confounded by the abstruse questions such a subject is forced to face. Fighting in God's name for a decade, our heroes return home only to find that death and despair have infested their homeland. The contradictory nature of man, wickedly intelligent and self-aware on the one hand, a stupid, superstitious and easily manipulated idiot on the other, is what makes the plight of our heroes so simple and yet so profound. In essence, we are asked to respond to God's silence in assured faith, a contradiction to common sense that has somehow has manacled our essence from time immemorial. What is more, this flick flirts with such conundrum by account of the simplicity of not seeking answers but instead a purpose. Indeed! This flick is at times a cacophony of relentless imagery punctuated by wonderful humor and witty dialog. The acting was simply aces on all accounts. Ingmar Bergman's direction hits the bulls eye here, crafting an impossible concept into a convincing and highly enjoyable flick that cannot help but move any human with breathe still gracing his lungs. How our players accept their fate, and the final image of that fate, leaves an indelible stain that only the commerce of celluloid could faithfully employ.

This is not in any way trying to be disrespectful to the great Ingmar Bergman but this movie appeared simplistically subtle on the theme of the human condition. The artie stuff is there but the result seems to be too static, suggesting it would perhaps be more appropriate on a theatre stage rather than on film. The 10 star awards are rather over-stretching the within reason deserved credits but then again it is a matter of taste, like everything else in life.",The Seventh Seal
187,panchodh_12,A rare specimen,7,28 November 2015,"Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Ingmar Bergman profits immensely from medieval iconography, traditions, events and beliefs to draft a wonderful example of existential cinema. It's a pity that Death as a character is so underused nowadays; there's so much strength in the image of the Grim Reaper talking with its victims, trying to decipher the meaning of all of this.The Black Plague provides an excellent scenario for the exposition of the very contemporary questions about the existence of God, the meaning of life, the fear of death. This seemingly apocalyptic event must have really seemed like the End of times, and the horrific images of infected people whipping themselves, of supposedly witches being burnt as scapegoats, do an amazing job in telling without the meaninglessness of life, the darkness that wraps us all once we know we'll eventually die. Unless we have faith, of course. But, as Antonius Block says: ""Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.""This movie is full of memorable quotes. It's one of those movies where the dialogues have no interest in seeming realistic, but rather, like in a theatre play, aim to show the language skills of the scriptwriter. I shall keep many of this movie's lines with myself, ""I shall try to remember them. I shall carry this memory carefully in my hands as if it were a bowl brimful of fresh milk. It will be a sign to me, and a great sufficiency.""",The Seventh Seal
188,bouncingoffwall,"Dark, depressing, and irreverent",1,22 September 2003,"After watching this film I thought, given the praises it has received, the entire production might have been out of my league intellectually --still a possibility. But even those with highly developed intellects have to examine and observe what they have been presented with in order to form opinions and draw conclusions; and, since I really didn't get much out of it the first time, I would have to watch it again. And this is not a film I would watch twice, nor wish to discuss at any length, since I don't feel my life will be enriched by understanding it better. I found it irreligious. I found it to bear a very heavy one-sided agenda. And, now that it's behind me, I don't care to look back.Had Bergman not proven himself already before writing and directing this dark tale, I seriously doubt anyone would have been knocking his door down to produce it. Unlike what many others say, I also found the cinematography lacking, the score at best forgetable, and the lighting as amateurish as a home movie.Let me add that I have great faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, so that definitely affected the way I reacted to this movie. I wish I could understand fully those who do not believe or have faith; but, regardless, what I can say to them is, unless you consider yourself a true intellectual, I would recommend other ways to explore the meaning of life since this film definitely doesn't reach the heights it aims to reach.

189,evandewangga97,Surrealism from Thoughtful Classic Cinema,8,26 December 2014,"""Det sjunde inseglet"" isn't the first movie from Bergman that I watch. It's the second movie, after ""Persona"". I know it too well of appreciate the movie. You can just watch the high-rated movie and feel the beauty in it when you can't enjoy the middle-rated movie. From this site, I know that ""Persona"" rating is lower than ""Det sjunde inseglet"", so at the first I just learn to love the lower one. And from that, I can enjoy the higher rated movies from Bergman more. Imagine a baby, at first it is fed by breast milk, next the porridge. Until its teeth grow, it can eat bread, even meat. There are always some stages in life, and in movie's appraisal too. I just want to grow my teeth first. And then I can ""eat"" the other Bergman's movies. So, if you can't enjoy this movie, don't get too resistant, try to be more tolerant. It's old, Swedish, and very different from the nowadays movie, from the content to the cinematography. Like I said before, grow your teeth first, learn to enjoy unusual movie like this. I recommend this for you who want to takes cinema rather seriously. I mean you can get entertained with all kind of movie when you mastered it. And I limit it only for highest rated movies. I mean, why waste your time watching bad movies. Seems perfectionist, but it's my way.What I can say for this movie is very surreal. Yes, fantasy, enough fantasy combines with the Black Plague atmosphere. I just know the plague from ""Plague"" painting (1898) by Arnold Böcklin. A painting represents thousand meanings. And ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957) by Ingmar Bergman is just another kind of art which also contains thousand representation. The point is the fear of those society face with unidentified disease. That era, when only Bible is read, the book that's the source of all thought, people think of the end of the day. Witch, sins, all have the connection with plague. That is the protagonist who questions everything in that era. Yes, anti- mainstream idea of what actually life, God, and death are. Man that age just accept that concept in the raw. Of course, Antonius Block knows it is inquisition. But, what is the meaning of refusal when his personal idea contrasts with the society's idea, the religion. He just think, all those sins, witches, don't have any significance of plague. He actually thought of philosophy, the root of science. He isn't wrong, but his time is come, the Death. He just extends his dead-time to define who actually God is. And sure that death doesn't have any resemblance of God. A provocative idea, even until now. At the end, he just realizes it's wasting time to question all that thing in that era, he pray and beg the pardon from God who he doubt for. God is true, Death is real, that is the end of his idea.Yeah, that was all I see. What an amazing thought from that movie. The surreal aspects just to deliver those messages in an entertaining way. Of course, I also admire the very natural acting from that time. It's not exaggerating. The idea of Grim Reaper plays chess game is just the seasoning of this great motion pictures. The critical movie for society until this day, classic one. I personally amazed what Bergman try to say from this movie. ""Surreally"" beautiful drama!",The Seventh Seal
190,ACitizenCalledKane,"Ingmar Bergman questions the meaning of life, death, faith, and the existence of God in this masterpiece of world cinema...",10,1 January 2005,"Antonius Block - ""Who are you?"" Death - ""I am Death."" Antonius Block - ""Have you come for me?"" Death - ""I have long walked by your side."" Antonius Block - ""So I have noticed.""The Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind.As the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time.Brilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle.A masterpiece!",The Seventh Seal

In a parallel way we see a group of people that share the same world, exposed to the same risks but instead of giving themselves to death even before being caught, they continue to live their life and worship it. The main character specially prefers to understand it instead of letting himself be scared by it. The entire story, the characters and the scenario make this movie brilliant and a gift for those who love cinema. The fact that it's in black and white gives it a certain mystery that nowadays movies sometimes lose. This movie is a perfect example that aren't big scenes, big visual effects or famous actors that make a good movie.

193,selfparody,Bergman's use of theatricality shoots himself in the foot,2,8 August 2005,"What could have been the best movie of the 1950s is mitigated by not sticking with what it did right. Bergman could have documented the effects of the plague on citizenry of Sweden with a harsher, more real tone and had the religious issues be discussed, but instead he reversed that, and a much weaker movie is the result. (The hideous plague is simply not established strongly enough: one corpse, while a nice quick scare, doesn't establish enough since so many other people just seem to go about their business fine, never mind that roughly one fourth of them are supposed to be dying) The extremely moody opening: waves, rocky beaches, barren, a a knight drained of strength sprawled on the beach, a great attention grabber. And then, the appearance of a dark caped, white faced man, and BANG, the movie hits a huge snag.This death character, which seems to be the most memorable aspect to the movie for most, is a grave blunder. He might resemble some folkish rendition from Swedish tales and icons, but that doesn't make him totally wrongheaded. His face makes him far too human, and too obviously an actor walking around. Concealing his face, if nothing else, until the very end to show that perhaps death is not a thing to fear, works much better, and embarrassingly, the Monty Python Meaning Of Life presents a much more interesting rendition of him, and it's their worst movie. YThis character is also far too clean: death is decay, the rot, often very slow: he shouldn't look like he just took his rob from the store this morning.Also a great problem is the fact that this totally wipes out any ambiguity: death is revealed to be a force that actually takes you somewhere, hitting the audience on the head that there is some aftrelife, as opposed to just a body that doesn't function and decomposes.A voice or a similar device would have served such purpose, since it might potentially just be the Knight's own cynicism working against him.Then the knight and Death begin playing chess. Even if you don't count the fact that Death said five seconds before they start playing that he grants no reprieves, this is a transparent McGovern, just a way for us to know that this movie has a structure and is going somewhere.More problems spring up as more characters make their way into the movie. There's the Knight's Sancho-type assistant, whose character simply isn't as interesting as Von Sydow. We get a travelling troupe, who are supposedly very important because of their biblical names, but frankly, do little more than stop the movie for a painful, irritating performance which is then paralleled with a bunch of wandering, chanting Christians in a scene so staged and pompous it seems to be begging for you to be glib about it. There's Odious comic relief in the shape of a woodsman and his cheating wife, which just goes to show, as good as Bergman is, the man is not capable of putting comedy on screen.There is one subplot that struck me as really powerful: the girl said to be a witch who will be executed. Here is more of Bergman showing the skill that he is so famed of: we (well, certainly I) pitied the girl, and the fact the Knight doesn't seem interested in her except as someone to ask questions makes him seem more like a cold, layered human than just a whining agnostic. She is the only one who doom is believably hanging over her head.If only Bergmna had made more of the movie in this vein....",The Seventh Seal

The scenes with the 'possessed' woman likewise.I watched this film a few weeks ago. I still remember some scenes or episodes from it, which is good. I'm not too impressed with the ending, nor with the general telling of the tale.It's not my first Ingmar experience: I have seen Wild Strawberries (1957) and also Persona (1966). Both star Bibi Andersson, but let's call that a personal interest of mine. I remember Persona as a great film, and especially one scene sticks out in my mind. I'll revisit those films and watch some other Bergman films as well. I'm not going to hype myself up beforehand; that's always a bad idea.I'd still recommend this film, but don't think you're going to be blown away. Hey, maybe you will be, but then you won't complain...",The Seventh Seal

On his journey home, he encounters the physical form of death itself (Bengt Ekerot) and engages him in an intriguing game of Chess to actually buy some time for some purpose of his.In this Swedish masterpiece the director, very artistically, collaborates tragic events of Europe caused by a widespread plague (bubonic plague-symptoms include a Swollen gland) with the ""Book Of Revelation"" primarily focusing on Apocalypse.The main characters have been chosen such that they represent various personalities and mental states of the sufferers. For example, the knight represents a delusional person who isn't sure if his Crusade had any point to it, his squire--a good man at heart--wonders where is God in this hour of need, the priest represents a power hungry man who instills fear in the society for his own benefit. The young actor couple and their child represent a God loving family who will survive the calamity.The whole country is suffering and there is confusion everywhere. People are punishing themselves to achieve absolution.Among all this hardship there still are people who are jolly and enjoying their lives to the hilt. Some of them are realizing their true selves. Even the Knight finds a purpose to his life and saves the young family from the clutches of Death. He eventually, with his wife and followers, dances with the Death.This 'dance' has become an iconic image of world cinema.A definite must watch.8.5/10",The Seventh Seal

I answer death! This is how the film starts with a shocking and breathtaking scene, a scene that critics have rated as the best opening in the history of cinema. Not surprisingly, they brought together people and death together. The film revolves around the return of the crusader Antonius Block to his country, Which leads people to believe that the resurrection has approached and became imminent, and then goes to Antonius great battle with the self in an attempt to search for answers about life and man, and the Great God!
My story with this film is long, and it started two years ago. At that time I was bored to the limit of those classic and traditional Hollywood and European films. I was looking for films about life, dramatic human and philosophical films. , I saw the film for the first time and did not like it, I grew up in Bergman Cinema and watched its greatest movies and then became very familiar with the ideas and films of this man, I saw the film again, and it became the second best film I have ever seen! , This is the Bergman Cinema, the films of this man are different from all the films, and my words are only evidence that Bergman Cinema and others contain a great deal of ideas and novels deep, and certainly will not appreciate his work in just one view.
I love Bergman,",The Seventh Seal
204,lilballa08,Incredible,10,23 August 2006,"With The Seventh Seal, Bergman is taking movie realism to whole new level, something he started with Wild Strawberries, which already was quite realistic movie if you ignore the cheesy ending, and some other bits.The movie does lack some elements which might be considered standard like no comic relief, but it is essential to leave out these elements for Bergman to achieve his vision as to what The Seventh Seal should be, a sexy, sleek, intense action movie that in should no way parallel Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon. Yes there is less action, but all the action in this movie is much more satisfying than in a ordinary movie, I don't recall seeing so realistic gunfights in any other movie. There is no real beginning or ending in this movie, the viewer is just dropped into middle of it, and it's just seamless realistic experience. No vaporous comedy.I'm not sure why there is so much hate in reviews for this movie? This movie takes you on a slow ride, a very subdued slow burn that never goes over the top. If you went expecting over the top, say like some people would think ""BAD BOYS"" you will fail to enjoy this film. This film makes Hollywood action films look like cartoons compared to this its dark and gritty realism - at some points I felt I was watching an uncensored episode of COPS gone bad-ass.Believe the hype, this movie deserves its high spot in the top 250.",The Seventh Seal
205,tomassparups,Bleak beauty.,9,25 July 2013,"I have stated many times that Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite film makers of all time. I, like many others, see him as a visionary, a shining example of an amazing film maker. His films are like no other's, there are layers beyond layers that can only hope to be unraveled in his works. Few film makers have achieved such artistic success as Bergman and few ever will. Though his films may share similar themes, they all bear their own drastically defining characteristics. ""The Seventh Seal"" is a film I first saw nearly a year ago and did not fully appreciate until I revisited it more recently. Bear in mind that this like most or Bergman's films require multiple viewings to even begin a discussion. In the first scenes of the film we see a vast seashore and a knight awaking on it. He is approached by a mysterious hooded figure that reveals himself as Death. The knight, Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) has recently returned from the Crusades to a plague infested Sweden. Death claims that he has come for him and that his time in the world of the living is up. In order to hinder Death's deed, Antonius proposes a game of chess between the two. If he is to win the game, Death will set him free. The film also follows a wide variety of other character's that towards the end come together. When reviewing an Ingmar Bergman film, I don't care to greatly indulge on the plot, especially with this film, as I fear it will take away from the film's charm.Ingmar Begman seems to be very fascinated with God and faith. This is a film that shows you the burden faith can bring. I believe that Bergman directed this film by channeling his own inner struggles into his art, like many great artists have done and still do. The main character of the film is on the verge of loosing his faith in God, he wants to believe, but he does not see any proof backing God's existence. This is something most people have struggled with during the course of their live and I believe Bergman did as well. You don't see film's like these nowadays and I know everyone has been saying this over and over again, but ""The Seventh Seal"" possesses a type of beauty that could only be captured by someone like Ingmar Bergman and it is a rare occasion that someone like him comes around. The lighting and shadows in this film add to the already beautiful black and white visuals. In my opinion the most beautiful scenes visually have to be the opening scene and the ending scenes (not going to spoil it)To take in the beauty and to somewhat understand ""The Seventh Seal"" you have to watch it multiple times. The visuals, music and the overall ambiance of the film added to the already outright fantastic story and powerful underlying themes creates a beautifully eery film. I have praised Ingmar Bergman and his films enough already, all I have to say it ""The Seventh Seal"" is a masterpiece and an untouchable classic.",The Seventh Seal
206,imdbfriend,Bergman! Bergman!,10,15 April 2008,"Bergman along with Andrei Tarkovsky is among few selected directors who engage themselves and the audiences in the deeper search of the soul, meaning of life, being human, and truth and this all through the medium of films and which for them are extreme form of art. In Bergman's own words ""No form of art goes beyond ordinary consciousness as film does, straight to our emotions, deep into the twilight room of the soul"". Through his art he made many thought provoking movies and The Seventh Seal is one supreme example among others. It is a movie about a knight who plays chess with the death king in order to avoid his own death and win life instead. The setting is medieval Sweden hit by the severe plague. So the knight sees death all around him and takes into a journey with his squire Jöns to get answers about God and life. He comes across some people like circus group and finds out how they are dealing with death and life, and witch all of them helping him in some way in his quest. In some way he even helps some to survive the death over them. The dialog's in the movie are really good, thought provoking which engages us in our own journey for answers about god and life, if not for long at least for some duration after the movie ends. I like many dialog's but the one I really love is the one when Jöns tell at almost end of the movie and is ""But feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive."" Everything about the movie is very good be it acting, script, music, dialog's but Bergman's direction is astounding. This Bergman classic is a must watch for anyone wanting to enjoy art in its best form.",The Seventh Seal

Very disappointing ending,as well.I sure don't see what all the praise is about!I most certainly would not pay over $6 for this! It is not a movie I even have any interest in adding to my collection.

210,tha_mongoose,"""Nothing escapes me"" - Death",10,17 August 2009,"Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) has shipwrecked on the shores of Sweden with his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand) having returned from a Crusade in the Holy Land. In these shores he meets Death (Bengt Ekerot) and challenges him to a game of chess. If he wins, he will not die. The atmosphere back home is that of death and decay; it is the 14th century and the Plague is rampant.The Seventh Seal is a meditation on the various philosophical and theological implications of death. As the story progresses, Block's deadly game unfolds, during which time he enjoys a reprieve. Death is a cunning opponent; sneaking up on Block repetitively when he least expects it.Block is tormented with the notion of God, he wishes God to show himself, he yearns and thirsts for knowledge of God. His words when he believes to be confessing to a priest in the church reminded me of the narrative of Kirilov in Dostoyevsky's Demons, when he speaks of ""killing God within himself"", God as fear, fear of the unknown, fear, ultimately, of death. He refers to it as a ""mocking presence that won't go away"". In the end, though, he seeks God (he falls in prayer at the last hour), yet his faith is not gratuitous and without rationale; in this he is like Fyodor himself. His squire Jöns is, on the other hand, a cynic, and refuses to believe the folklore, as he tells the church-painter Albertus Pictor (Gunnar Olsson).We are also introduced to a family reminiscent of the Holy Family: Jof/Joseph (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia/Maria (Bibi Andersson) and their young child Mikael. They are an acting troupe, and are also the only characters in the film that, despite the reigning atmosphere of terror and chaos, remain joyful, calm and kind. The innocence of their child cries similarities with Jesus Christ, ""for such is the kingdom of Heaven"". Jof has visions of the Holy. Through his eyes we see the Virgin Mary teaching the baby Jesus to walk, and the Danse Macabre.An aspect that makes The Seventh Seal work is the fact there is a tangible and believable story, told in the most simple terms - even if every ounce is charged with the most weighty moral questions and ponderings about life and death - with much comedic relief thrown in, and a deluxe set of actors. Not a single performance in the movie is mediocre. There is also exemplar use of lush scenarios and scapes, which intermixed with Nordic chants with low basses create scenes more chilling than any modern CGI-oriented atmosphere with all the high-tech.There are memorable scenes in this movie, such as the squirrel eating at a tree-trunk recently cut down causing the death of one of the characters, and the parading mendicants, lashing themselves and those in front of them, carrying the Ark of the Covenant and the Cross, with raving friars in tow. Even the young girl ""witch"" (Maud Hansson) who is used as a scapegoat ""she is believed to be the cause of the Plague"", a soldier tells Block upon his questioning, is shocking in her look of confusion and innocence, as well as madness. God is not one to chastise, however, as we see in Block's movements, giving the witch something ""for the pain"", that she may not suffer. Another epic scene is that in which the troupe is enveloped in jest on the stage: Bergman is faithful to what is known of the rural acting and theatre of this time, as well as the scene in the drinking den, where Jof, innocent, is made a fool of, and the common folk are seen debating what they believe to be the impending doomsday which ""is at hand"".Some have hailed The Seventh Seal to be a movie denying God - this does not appear to be the case. The silence of God, a recurring motif, leads one to consider the role of faith ""And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour"" (Revelation 8:1). The film is a rumination on matters Godly and surrounding death, and it does not give any one answer to the questions it poses: without forcing any conclusion on us. What it does do is treat its viewer with respect; we are shown both sides of the argument: Jöns and Block, Jof, Death, and left to fend for ourselves in this intellectual dilemma.The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Anyone who considers himself to know film does not until he has seen this. 10/10.",The Seventh Seal

Images so striking and memorable that they linger with you always. Moments of dialogue that fit absolutely perfectly that hit you with a sudden power. This film is one of the most poignant reflections on life, death, and Religion. The mood of the film reflects that, moving very swiftly from joy to dark fear.I will say that some of the scenes come across as slightly ridiculous and overblown, and the costumes too haven't aged quite as well as other films, however these are minor criticisms not difficult to overlook. I don't feel the performances are consistent across the board, with some doing much better than others. Despite these criticisms, where it's at it's best, it's truly astounding.",The Seventh Seal

The film also has a distinct aura that just sucks you in and fills you with this sense of foreboding and dread. I feel it's also one of those rare films that you can enjoy directly or on more intellectual levels.However, for me at least, the film was not exemplary. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in, for after years of hearing film critics rave about The Seventh Seal, truthfully I was a tad disappointed by it. While I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, for some reason it just didn't click with me the way that some other films have. I didn't spend the rest of the night thinking about it. And while I'm sure there is a heck of a lot I missed in my first viewing, I don't feel the need to rewatch it anytime soon. It was good. It made me think. It made me feel things. Once was enough though.I definitely recommend 'The Seventh Seal' to cinema buffs, however I also recommend going in with more managed expectations. Who knows, maybe 'The Seventh Seal' will be a true revelation for you. It just wasn't for me.",The Seventh Seal
213,snazel,A Very Personal Rejection of a Religious Childhood,8,15 February 2002,"The story of Antonius Block is the story of an agnostic who has begun to doubt. Is life really meaningless? Is the only true ethic of life, to simply enjoy the moment? If God is there, why does he not answer? Why does he leave men with kind hearts and noble aspirations to fumble in the dark dying of the plague with no answers? Perhaps, Antonius reasons, the answers only come from Death.No wonder then, that as Death approaches him, he cajoles the spirit to play a game with him. His intentions are to win, but most importantly, to find answers. The little I know of Bergman's youth, the Paladin (Antonius Block) seems to symbolize Bergman's last struggles with his strict religious instruction as a child. Antonius' struggles, Antonius' angst, Antonius' withering agnosticism is a reflection of where Bergman was philosophically at this early stage in his life and career.The climax of the film is of course the final 'duel' with Death. Antonius attempts to cheat death and in the end, death cheats him. This is an especially crushing defeat for Antonius, because the answers Death gives him, about the knowledge within Death itself, is Antonius' worst fears come true.It struck me, that in the final moments, when each character faces there own mortality right in front of them, that the strongest and purest reaction of them all, is the one from the squire, the atheist voice in the film. I think if you are an atheist, this film is going to please you, because clearly the sanest characters in this film are either indifferent or deny God's existence entirely.Whether it was intentional or not, I think Seventh Seal is a very personal film. Bergman deconstructs his father's teachings to us openly. There's nothing sublime here; this is a clear rejection of religion and the notion that death somehow provides 'answers'. The only answers, according to this film, lie in life and not death. A message Bergman delivers to us in striking fashion. A message Bergman knows directly contradicts what he was taught as a child.I think this is why later in life, Bergman disowned this film. I think he saw too clearly, how much of a very personal statement it was and how in some cases it was a vindictive film against his parents. It's why I believe, Bergman, couldn't stand to watch it later in life, after he had reconciled with his parents.While Bergman disowned it, for the rest of us, we can admire it. For us, the Seventh Seal is simple genius.  A dark, but beautiful film, that is pure and meaningful, because it is so very personal. I confess, I am a layman and I know little of Bergman's work and indeed have only seen this film once. But, I loved this film. It struck a very personal reaction in me, however uninformed that reaction might be. That reaction, pure and simple is that this movie is a very personal statement about life, God and death.",The Seventh Seal

217,pratyush,Engrossing,7,31 March 2010,"This is my first full Bergman film even though I have seen a couple of scenes of Cries and Whispers. The Seventh Seal is all about death. The only certainty in life is death and death escapes no one. I have been scared of death in my childhood, wondered even more in my teenage years and now I am numb about it.The question of what happens after death is intriguing. The main actor asks - what happens to those who believe, what happens to those who don't believe, what happens to those who want to believe. In the end, he hopes and hope is all he can do.The narrative style is excellent. A lot of stories are mixed in but you never feel lost. It is perfectly coiled together. You see various people of different levels of intellect, insecurities and lives. Every one is overcome by death in the film except the actor who sees visions and his family.The movie is perfectly edited, with brilliant camera work and shows what a true master Bergman is. I am truly in awe of his direction and the way in which he handles the narrative. The last half hour of the movie is a bit depressing as death encapsulates people.Death itself has no answers for the main actor. Is there life after death? Is there God? Is there Devil? Death doesn't have the knowledge and the protagonist is kept in the dark about what happens after death. The family which escapes death is the part I didn't understand. Is Bergman trying to some how be optimistic in all the pessimism? I thought the film asked a lot of questions about death and areas surrounding it but it could have explored more. Half an hour more with more questions and I think it could have been deeper. I am okay with the length though as the film passes in a jiffy. Well edited as I said.

218,teutonicknight,This is it!,9,1 July 2003,"A masterpiece. No doubt about it.It was my first Bergman film, and I was a bit anxious, as his works are considered difficult, and deeply psychological. And it's true, but this one has such an amazing mood that you're in it within few minutes.Some of the images will stay in your mind forever: the frightening parade of the ascetics, the eyes of the dying witch, empty village. But what is amazing is that Bergman within this dark and pessimistic movie managed to put lighter elements (conversation between Antonius and the actors at the sunset) or even humorous (seduction of blacksmith's wife, Death cutting down the tree), which make ""The Seventh Seal"" more absorbing. He put two opposites: cynical and pessimistic Jons and Antonius versus Jof and his family, common people who live a simple life, and therefore are close to God (Jof has visions of the Virgin Mary); and somehow gives answers to Antonius' questions.If you don't know any of Bergman's films start with this one.

219,ShiiStyle,Disagreed with philosophy but deserves no less than 9/10,9,27 January 2008,"The Seventh Seal tackles death in a fashion which must have seemed horridly confrontational at the time but now seems too specifically Christian to me. The prince is gripped with existential angst about being unsure if he can meet God or Satan. In the world of the film, neither is there to comfort him; Death is the only sure thing. To some this may seem like a cause for despair, but to me it smacked of forcing the universe into small-minded Western forms. God, Satan, and Death are all names we have ascribed to the general metaphysical mish-mash; even the corpse they meet at the beginning of the movie is only ""dead"" insofar as it is clear from context that it was once a living being but is no more. When it becomes a fertilizer for the grass it will hardly be dead anymore. The judgments we make and feelings we attribute to these things are our own invention. If the prince were Buddhist he'd be handling this subject from quite a different approach.Nevertheless, the imagery of the film still earns it the title of masterpiece. The use of black and white is unlike anything else. A lesser artist would simply cover the screen in blackness when Death arrived on the scene. Bergman knows better how to make a contrast a contrast. Death, in his pitch-black cape, stands in the midst of physical scenery. His whitened face is genuinely spooky. The flagellants and monks are also portrayed with overwhelming boldness. The emotions of the characters are starkly real, very Swedish, and never trip up. The fact that I did not find the philosophy engaging will not stop me from recommending this movie to anyone who wants a chilling and powerful experience.",The Seventh Seal

222,rafael_jaramillo_avellan,"Deep, reflexive and thought provoking. Ingmar Bergman's eternal search shaped into motion picture.",10,15 January 2017,"The movie that gave us the Grim Reaper as we know it today. Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (SS) is a profound examination of faith, the searching of God and human will. Ingmar Bergman (IB) was famous for portraying and analyzing in his movies topics such as death vs life, madness vs sanity, God vs nothing... This is that kind of movie I see as a challenge, because it's hard to understand it at first glimpse; unless you're a literate or someone learned deeply in philosophy or art appreciation. IB was from those movie directors that every movie, or at least most, he made presented a point of view or a hard analysis. In this case: Where is God?... He chose perfectly the age of the movie: a time where everything wrong with the world was a punishment from heaven and people's ignorance was the foundation for religion supremacy.Antonius Block (AB) is the protagonist in this search of meaning. A determined and rough man whose face looks wooden shaped. He has trouble believing, his faith has fallen to the height of his feet and can't find a reason to continue living. As he says in one scene, we must believe in unseen miracles. Any person who has had a faith crisis will be immediately identified with AB, and will have no trouble following his journey.It is interesting how IB chose his characters. Jof and Mia stand for Joseph and Mary in English; though their son's name is Mikael (Mike). Was this a coincidence? Some message from heaven for AB? A guide for his journey? This trinity is the merriest thing in the whole movie, a representation of hope in the middle of a Black Death drowned Sweden.AB looks without finding nothing, talks to a witch hoping to speak with the devil. Why? Because if the devil exists, also God. The scene of the flagellant's procession is something short of shocking, and beautiful, and impressive. The heaviness of soul and the masochist relation between man and his maker.Full of metaphors and surrealism, the SS started a more serious look of religion in following years in cinema. Not only that, but immortalized the personification of death in popular culture (pop culture). The chess match between Death and AB is one of the most iconic in movie history. Damn well chosen, from all board games, which else but chess. Well done IB.IB's style is clear. Static camera work, some close ups and skillful use of colors. The grey sea, the whiteness of death and darkness of his cloak, and many other aspects are IB's work. The movie's tone and pace that he delivers are the mainstay for transmitting the very questions from his childhood. Son of a Lutheran minister he lived his first years surrounded by religion, so you can imagine the environment.The movie's very ending is a message for all of us of memento mori, the ""danse macabre"". Our life's are fragile and we must take care of them as the most beloved treasure.A masterpiece in its own right, the SS may prove difficult and boring for some. The movie feels like a Shakespearean play put in front of camera. But the dialogue feels great, and the moments of comedy as well. Squire Jöns has become of one of my personal favorites, a medieval Swedish Chandler Bing.For closure, actual movie lovers may find nothing in the SS. The first time I saw it couldn't find much in it. But for understanding, a second watch and reading about the film, it's worth it. Once you understand the SS, you get why it let and created so many standards, and why is considered a world classic.My final consensus: A classic and masterpiece in its own right, The Seventh Seal is a profound examination from Ingmar Bergman about a quest we all can relate to. A challenge that not all will like to take, but for those willing to, it will be rewarding all its 96 minutes.",The Seventh Seal
223,ajmelck,Breathtaking art with a message of hope,10,18 March 2007,"While I can only echo the fulsome praise that this film has received and clearly deserves, I'd like propose that what makes it so great a work is its perfect balance between on the one hand the knight's grim, existential battle with death and on the other hand the prelapsarian idyll represented by the travelling players. This kind of double narrative is found across art-forms and time of course, with Tolstoy's Anna Karenina being perhaps the most perfect example in literature. In that novel, Anna and Vronsky's journey to hell accompanied by Levin and Kitty's journey in the opposite direction. For all its grimness, with the Black Death and Death himself, The Seventh Seal is a celebration of the life, love and humour which fill the scenes with Jof, Mia and their little child.It's not that death can be cheated or overcome, rather that in life and among people we can find a respite from the cold cruel necessity of a meaningless universe. Whether we do so or not is very much up to us, and not the province of religion, state or other authority figures.",The Seventh Seal
224,enc1no,The Seventh Seal,7,7 January 2004,"Spoilers withinBergman made a movie about himself here, or about someone like him. A man with a very real fear of death who desperately seeks the truth ultimately surrender to the ignorance and sacrifices himself to save others. Although Bergman hasn't surrender himself - or perhaps he has, he obviously has a great fear of death. This stands clear when watching other of his films, 'Saraband' for example. To me it seems that this has been a subject of torture to him. In the film, Antonius makes us understand that he's been searching everywhere for the truth, but hasn't found it. A bitterness towards Christianity, religion and the society is portrayed. It seems as 'intelligents' are quick to answer as to why Christianity doesn't work, but they never dig into it, they never search for the source. This i found interesting.",The Seventh Seal
225,daitran199980,The most boring journey!,6,16 October 2015,"After I watched The Seventh Seal, I think that Ingmar Bergman isn't my favorite director.I said that I never like movies about religion, include Christianity and Islam like The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Ben-Hur (1959), Fanny and Alexander (1982) (another movie of Bergman) and A Separation (2010) because I'm Buddhism.I like the song that described the emotion, the feeling of characters. But I can't understand the ending of the movie: +The girl's feeling and her face. +The appearance of the Death. +The scare of Antonius, the Danse Marabe. +The happiness of Joseph and his family when they saw the Danse Marabe.So, who can explain me the ending of the movie and why almost people love this movie?",The Seventh Seal
226,RWiggum,"Grim, but not entirely hopeless",10,24 January 2003,"Middle Ages: Antonius Blok, a Swedish knight, returns from the Crusades only to find his country dying of the plague, religious fundamentalists taking over and Death himself wanting him to come along. Antonius challenges Death to a game of chess and is meanwhile driven to desperation because of the absence of God. This description sounds like a very serious, philosophical and dour film, and actually it is serious, philosophical and dour; but there is also a little warmth, hope and humor, maybe not for Antonius, but for the viewer.When Blok and Death interrupt their game of chess (due to the plague, Death is very busy), he meets two actors, Jof and Mia, with their little son, the most human characters of the film, and I don't think it's a coincidence that there names sound very much like Joseph and Mary. These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.
But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.Another reason for the impact this almost 50-year-old film has still today is the acting: Max von Sydow's face always seems to reflect what Antonius Blok is thinking, Nils Poppe's performance as the naive actor and caring father is priceless and Bengt Ekerot's Death became a part of film history and survived all its spoofs (the best one being in Woody Allen's tremendously funny ""Love and Death""). But the best performance is done by Gunnar Björnstrand as Antonios Blok's misogynist squire, dryly commenting all their encounters even in the face of death.The Seventh Seal is not subtle in raising it's questions, that's for sure. But it makes you think about these questions nevertheless. It's disturbing and grim most of the time, but at the end it gives you the hope that it might become better.",The Seventh Seal
227,Hereticked,The Search For Meaning,10,10 May 2017,"I like The Seventh Seal more every time I see it. This is a movie that had the balls to flip religion the bird in 1957. It's a perfect tale of revelation and redemption, thrusting a mirror in front of the human condition.A knight has returned from the Crusades, but his faith is shaken and the Bubonic plague spreads across the land. If that weren't crisis enough, death itself stalks him on the shores of his homeland and he finds himself playing chess with the reaper to buy himself a little time. But time for what? Time to do something, ANYTHING, to atone for the chaos and misery he wrought in the middle east; a campaign he now knows to have been arrogant, foolish and utterly without merit.As the knight, his squire and the rest of our characters tour medieval Sweden, we see them confront every horror that the Dark Ages brought to bear. We see opportunistic theft, attempted rape, mockery and scapegoating out of total ignorance, and a mentally ill woman burned as a witch. Everyone is terrified of the black plague, and their inability to cope with it brings out the worst in humanity. As a troupe of bards attempt to alleviate a small town with songs and dance, a Christian passion play comes crashing through the streets, whipping themselves bloody, wailing and begging the sky for relief and forgiveness that will not come. No doubt they will spread the plague further before they drop their heavy wooden crosses and die in agony. Our main characters look on, wondering where the human race went wrong.The knight endures all this while delaying his inevitable loss on the chess board and seeking answers to the questions that tear at his faith. In the end, none are satisfactory, and yet he remains stalwart in his quest for redemption. When death comes for him and his companions, the knight's good deeds have been accomplished and the cynical squire stares his mortality down, demonstrating that humanity can still perform at its best in the absolute worst circumstances.There is virtually no fat in this film. It is clean in its beautiful black and white frames, crisp editing and purposeful dialogue. Although mostly bleak in their humor, there are a few laughs to be had among the 96 minutes of existential dread. We're even given a clarifying moment of hope and joy before the credits appear. This timeless piece is Ingmar Bergman's master work and it's as good as films get.",The Seventh Seal

Some people might analyze each and every scene and dialog and come up with their own interpretations of what Bergman wanted to say. Jacksh*t.Now usually i love such kind of movies. I am not a fan of commercial craps like fast and furious or the recent man of steel. I am a sucker for good stories, script and character development but this movie had nothing.The dialogs were so darn lame a 14 y.o. could have written them. The pace was so slow the movie felt more like 150 minutes instead of its 90 minute run time.This is the second Bergman film i have viewed, the first being Persona which i also felt was overrated but at least kept me interested and concerned with it all along.I am sure this guy knew his movies but one doesn't make movies only for their fans but for a wider audience. How could you call this guy an artist.

The stunning opening with the appearance of Death is one the most impressive ever seen on the screens. The confession sequence is so simple and deep and moving: you feel the essence of your entire, small, brief life vanishing with Blok's words. The arrival of the flagellating pilgrims in the village is visually astonishing, like the unforgettable ending scene with the ""danse macabre"". Cinematography and acting are outstanding, and the transfigured Middle Age renders an angst sensation during all the film.

If you are keenly interested in watching different arts and folklores, you should definitely go for his film ""The Seventh Seal"" . The movie follows a medieval knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) challenging Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life, to a match of chess in the hope that he can survive longer. The plot is set in Sweden during the catastrophic period of the Black Death in the medieval times. I was astounded to see how finely Bergman carved the image of terror and horror into the personified image of Death. The concepts of faith, belief, evil and good are discussed in the movie alongside fright and dismay characteristic to the medieval times. The Seventh Seal is called Bergman's masterpiece and considered one of the greatest movies of all time.",The Seventh Seal
233,samsara761,The existence of God and immaterial life,10,4 August 2010,"Welcome to my blog. It is not without reason that I have chosen this film as the first post ever, certain it will bring good vibrations our way. In any case, what a better way to start, than with a master!The Seventh Seal is Ingmar Bergman's 1956 gem of a feature. I don't think I am really suitable to give an impartial opinion on this movie, because I simply love it in an almost morbid way. Maybe because of its landscapes, barren and desolated; maybe because of its close-ups: paintings, section-views of a human's spirit; maybe because of the beauty, angelical, yet full of vitality and passion, of the female interpreters; maybe because of its hieratic stillness, alternated with the utmost dynamicity, the timeline blurring at the edges, both in the movie, and in real-time; maybe because of Antonius Block and his obsessive quest, exemplar of the struggle we face against fake spirituality, and his all-consuming receipt of the final strike of the scythe.Block is a noble knight, returning to his native Sweden after ten years spent fighting in the Crusades, with his faithful squire, who shares the same whole-heartedness, only to find a country ravaged by the Black Death, and people trying what they can to save themselves from what they think is a divine curse. We come to identify with him, and we come to love the simple goodness of Jof (Joseph) and Mia (Mary), and their symbolic role in this allegoric tale, which grabs us by the throat from the start, with the scenes of desolation in a plague-ridden Sweden. The realism of the small countryside village where the story first develops is proof of Bergman's mastery with the alternation between wider frames and close-ups, between general and particular, between society and inner individual life, and their collision, a theme dear to the Swedish master, as we can see in later films, such as Persona.But I'm digressing now. It's time for you to enjoy the show: whether it is for the first or the tenth time, I know you will...",The Seventh Seal
234,averroes111,"More than ""entertainment,"" a profound experience",10,9 September 2000,"I genuinely feel sorry for people who can only describe this film as ""boring.""  No, there are no explosions, car chases or sappy romantic scenes. `Lethal Weapon 3' this film is not.  But that fact is only one of the many virtues for this film!  I think that people really deny a part of their own humanity when they cannot look past the surface of things.I can't believe that any thoughtful and feeling human being who allows him or herself to recognize the passionate and profound themes in this film can help being somewhat moved by them.  If you have ever pondered questions about life deeper than ""What are we having for dinner tonight?"" or `Should I wear white past Labor Day?' this film is for you.  And the story is told with excellent imagery and symbolism that combines into an overwhelming experience for the senses and the intellect.Of course, some may be disturbed by the ""answers"" this film provides.  I guess for me, I identify strongly with Bergman's thesis, that perhaps everything we utter about what lies beyond death is a mere projection; that, in the final analysis, we know nothing.  But I also identify with the `silent protest' of the squire.One of the lines that sums up the film for me is:""I want knowledge.  Not belief.  Not surmise.

235,spodvoll,"my first Bergman, not my last",10,29 December 2003,"After seeing this movie, I feel self-deprived at having avoided (procrastinator that I am) Bergman films this long.  Although not perfect, this work succeeds on multiple levels; I found the actors and their characters engaging, the cinematography stunning, the plot, the imagery, and the messages therein worthy of deep consideration.  In sum, Bergman gives us a grand treatment of medieval life and existential philosophy.  In the hands of a lesser director, the imagery could easily have degenerated into something overplayed and hokey.  Instead, we have a subtle movie for the ages.",The Seventh Seal
236,Miura88,"Perfect movie, and the perfect starting point for Bergman",8,1 April 2009,"This was the first film I watched by Ingmar Bergman, and in my eyes it's one of his very best. Ingmar loved to ask whether God exists or not, and while he may have devised more subtle ways to ask that question in later films, his directness in ""The Seventh Seal"" is one of the film's strong points. Antonius Block returns from fighting in the Crusades (Max Von Sydow) when he gets a visit from The Grim Reaper himself (Bengt Ekerot). But Antonious is not ready to die, and in order to buy himself some time, he challenges Death to a game of Chess. The Black Death has also taken hold of Antonius' hometown, and the villagers have been plunged into fear of the plague (The Black Death and the Crusades did not occur at the same time in real life, and this film is not meant to be historically accurate) The game of Chess continues throughout the film, and it even manifests itself through other characters in the film (one of the very first corpses found in the film could very well be an early pawn taken during the game of Chess). As Antonius travels through a village, along with his Squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who steals almost every scene he's in), he meets a variety of people, the most important two people are Jof and Mia, a couple of travelling artists very much in love, who also have a young son. Sven Nykvist may not have done the cinematography, but this is still one of the best looking films you could ever see. The dark and moody atmosphere is brilliantly reflected in the dark clouds, sinister forests and wonderful use of smoke throughout the movie. The soundtrack really adds to the mood, and the acting is nothing short of excellent. ""The Seventh Seal"" is only 90 minutes long, and Ingmar Bergman manages to say more in this film than some directors can say in over twice the running time: The existence of God, man's mortality in limited time, the damaging effects of war on a man's faith and an artist's importance to humanity. ""The Seventh Seal"" is a dark, thought-provoking movie on the human condition. Not only is it classic Bergman, it is classic cinema.",The Seventh Seal
237,DarkProfile,A professional surgeon operating on a created body,6,4 June 2021,"I watched this Bergman first time in my college campus during a movie club screening. Hardly left any impression on me at that time, but I accounted the failure to my philistine taste and undeveloped maturity. Years later, I watched Persona and it made complete sense to me on a deep level. But again, I may have overcompensated for my earlier guilt. But I really liked the existential musings and the abstract images open to interpretation in Persona. Rather than creating characters and illuminating juicy ideas through their lives, one abstracts juicy ideas first and then plays them on an intellectual chessboard through cipher characters. So hip are the symbols and the abstractions, that the game looked great in cocktail discussions and pickup lines. But a beating heart was always missing.And then, I discovered Olmi. Oh my, I realized that one can study hard to analyze and understand the human anatomy, learn to perform surgery, and publish medical tomes for the benefit of mankind. But can one create life out of such abstraction and analysis? No! To create life, Olmi showed that if one is peasant enough to ""cultivate"" Nature into his humble studio, faithful enough to ""sacrifice"" his comfortable concepts for an uncertain hope of a miracle, child enough to ""see"" the blooming colors and patterns of contradictory hues, and artist enough to ""reconcile"" the emerging contradictions into a unifying whole, then not only juicy ideas would organically grow out of the complex whole, but it will be alive in the image of Nature, i.e., on multiple dimensions, just like how a tree is alive to a bee, a bird, a worm, and a human.One is a professional surgeon who operates on a created body; the other is an amateur god who creates miniature bodies.",The Seventh Seal

240,luzgannon,It Is Finished!,10,10 January 2006,"OUTLINE. It is the year the Great Plague hits Scandinavia. A seasoned knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) returns from some ten year's long late crusading venture to the Holy Land, to which he went out a Believer, where he became a Denier, and whence he now comes back a Seeker. He is followed by his loyal squire, the coarsely cynical, still brave and righteous Jöns (Gunnar Björnstand), with whom he keeps a strong bond and an implicit debate going on. During the journey, he encounters various people and events, all with a particular bearing on the Knight's all consuming Quest for God's Existence and the Meaning of Life; first of all he meets Death himself (Bengt Ekerot), but he contrives to postpone his end by challenging by his sinister opponent to a game of chess, which he intends to win, though he really can't, as he himself in the final analysis knows. Then, we see, among others, the naïvely charming family of entertainers, Jof (Nils Poppe), his loving pretty wife Mia (Bibi Andersson) and the infant Mikael, later we see the unrepenting Witch on her way to the stakes (Maud Hansson), the primitive blacksmith Plog (Åke Fridell) and his trampy wife (Inga Gill), the silent peasant girl (Gunnel Lindblom). Many join him to a following on the route. Finally they reach his home castle where his noble and faithful wife Karin (Inga Landgré) courteously receives them all. He has by now lost his game; and the same night Death comes to claim his harvest, and in the culminating scene they all confront Death with a display of their respective true personal nature. Then follows a short epilogue, where the juggler family, having escaped Death, moves away in a state of happy innocence.JUDGMENT. This film combines simplicity and complexity in a way never surpassed. The themes, the motives, the characters, they all have a popular and universal quality easy for everyone to recognize and understand; the dialog is simple, terse and exact; but all these general, iconic and ""archetypal"" elements of the story are brought into an interplay producing amazing complexity and subtlety. Consequently, an enormous richness is exemplarily condensed into a minimum of size; in this film nothing is redundant, and one may well argue it's a culmination all the way. It's tragedy; but pastiche and comedy just as well. It's a ""deep"" film if any; and still gorgeous entertainment. In short, this film is, in my opinion, more close to Perfection than any, and the multiplication product of Quality and Interest is simply sky high.HIGHLIGHTS. Many scenes have been famous: those moments at the chessboard, that ""Totentanz"" end procession on the ridge; the frightening appearance of the flagellants. So, I would like to point out a few scenes no one else here has mentioned: the wonderful little absurdist song show by Jof and Mia at the stage before being interrupted by flagellants' arrival; the calm and surprising reply by Death, when queried about the Mystey he hides and represents: ""Secrets? I have no secrets. I am unknowing."" - and the ecstatic face of the peasant girl, kneeling and hailing Death at the end scene in the castle: ""It is finished!"" - it's here the film really, so to speak, explodes somewhat koan-wise into a sudden Illumination, how come so few reckon this??The acting is great all way through, von Sydow (what terrific makeup, making him so statue-like!) and Björnstrand are those generally appraised, and quite rightly so; but in my opinion they are both eclipsed by the brilliance of Bibi Andersson as Mia, here fusing beauty and acting ability in a way just knocking me out; just watch her inspired, perfectly burlesque ""body language"" in that silly song performance, it couldn't be more accurate. She's simply phenomenal. - Inga Landgré is perfect as Karin, and Maud Hansson an unforgettable Witch.DISCUSSION. Some keen observations have been made by other members, but I am surprised finding so many fine points missed. Some dicern an anti-religious tendency, but this is inadequate. The knight Antonius in the end let's it all go spontaneous desperate prayer, at last running into fierce confrontation with Jöns, to the end the staunch Atheist. We must not forget the crucial part played by Jof, the Fool proving the Wise Man when put to the ultmate test, the only one seeing what it's all about, thus being able to save his his family at the last moment, sparing them for that lucid end scene; and Jöns' words to the peasant girl he caringly looks after, winning her confidence: ""Don't you see I give you solace?"" and - again! - this enthralling Enigma of that face, and those words in her one single line in the manuscript. This film does NOT argue Atheism, but a positive Agnosticism tinged with a, though tiny, maybe, still bright note of Hope.MISCELLANEOUS. It's said Ingmar Bergman has ""disowned"" this film. That isn't so. As he himself explains, it's a painful thing for him to recall the agonies of past works, he made this movie as a self therapeutic treatment for his personal haunting fear of death, he probably feels having succeeded striking a precarious balance he is now recalcitrant to jeopardize by some reexamination. Ingmar Bergman himself regards The Seventh Seal as one of his best films, but he does not enjoy talking about it.The story is generally presumed to take place in Sweden - but the two towns mentioned, Elisinore and Roskilde - are Danish, not Swedish.This film is a literary masterpiece as well. The incisive, powerful language used in it represents the Swedish language at a very apogee of it's high potential of purity, clarity and beauty.The film is included in a list of films officially approved and recommended by the Vatican.IN SHORT. Not a few people regard this film as the best ever made. I think I am one of them.",The Seventh Seal

After a long struggle I managed to get my hands on a copy of the excellent DVD.  I started by watching the film with the dubbing on.  Five minutes into the film I got frustrated and put the original Swedish back on and restarted the movie.  After the movie was over I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Its theme and idea paralleled a struggle in my own life.  I love this movie. It is not just another flavor of the week I am praising.  It has already joined my top 10.  It is so good that I have managed to convince my girlfriend to watch it.  She has no taste in movies and this isn't even the kind of movie she would have ever dreamed about watching during any point in her life.

242,The_TJT,Existential angst from Bergman,7,18 October 2015,"Existential angst from Bergman; and a somewhat entertaining story of a knight (Max von Sydow) and his servant returning from crusades. A story which doesn't advance much but merely serves as a medieval backdrop for the protagonist's spiritual journey - in this film Bergman asks if God exists.The film is supposed to take place in 14th century Sweden during bubonic plague (aka The Black Death), which fits the theme perfectly. However the costumes and props are rather low quality which doesn't make the film credible outside of its metaphysical introspection. Camera work is mediocre at best; the scenes consist mostly on static one camera shots focused on narrow view. The lack of production values is quite apparent while it was shot in one month, mostly inside a studio and with a budget of 150k dollars. In other words you can't make great panorama takes if there are only two medieval mock up shacks inside the studio...The story is somewhat entertaining, not as boring as I expected from essential art cinema. The dialogue is often intellectually interesting and some images are very artistic, mainly on the scenes where the protagonist struggles with theological issues. So those are strong points of the film: dialogue and occasionally impressive, haunting, images.On the meaning of grim reaper and chess, the talking point of the film... I wasn't quite convinced with grim reaper following Sydow's knight in first place - he seemed in perfect health to me, as did other characters. Yes, the knight had cheated death when returning alive from crusades but still. Perhaps the point was people seeking answer whether God exists from death while the grim reaper doesn't have the answer either. If this was the meaning then that would make it an atheistic film, or agnostic the very least. 7/10",The Seventh Seal

This movie has an existential quality to it and puts you at odds with knowing most of the people he meets will die, but whom? The movie shows the fears and ignorance of humanity confronted with the unknown and trying to blame it on anything and anyone including themselves.

244,B_a_S_t_A_r_D,A Work of Art,10,9 February 2008,"From the very first frame of 'The Seventh Seal', it is extremely clear that this is a film that successfully strives to be beautiful. The film opens with a brilliant shot of the bleak sky, accompanied by appropriately despairing choral music. The iconography gets better from there. Every single frame is a work of art in itself; from the image of two black horses standing in a wild sea, to the now immortal side shot of Antonius the Knight engaged in a game of chess with Death.'The Seventh Seal', beyond its visual seamlessness, is a profound and incredibly rich narrative. The doomed protagonists are placed in a bleak, death-ridden environment crawling with the plague and religious extremism. Here, director Ingmar Bergman pits them against the metaphysical; Max Von Sydow's Antonius questions the silence of God in a world which needs him more than ever, Jof the actor witnesses biblical imagery whilst remaining secure as part of the most likable, optimistic family ever faced with such relentless misery, and Antonius' squire dryly and humorously provides a commentary on death and the plague-ridden environment.This film is quite literally a masterpiece, both visually and philosophically.

But what if there're no answers? What if even the Death, God or the Devil have no answers? What if questions are an invitation to fear, anxiety and emptiness?

Much more powerful, in fact, than most loud and violent films.There are many strong and emotionally laden scenes in the film, but the ""witch"" burning scene and Antonius' reaction there was particularly strong. It was as if he had seen the futility of intervention with death on his heels, yet couldn't quite stop himself from doing something.All those little moments..Von Sydow is simply amazing, as is all the main cast, strong script, beautiful cinematography, and a very effective use of sound and music (as minimalistic and bleak as everything else in the film).The sad part is that if this film had been released today it would be seen by a handful of movie enthusiasts and would never get a wide audience. Instead people pay to see Transformers 3.",The Seventh Seal

250,nima-azad,Searh for truth,9,27 December 2006,"The Seventh seal is a wonderful movie. A knight's returns home after years. But the most important aspect of his life seems to remain unanswered. He searched for truth and hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen. The question of the existence of god and the relations of human to him is one the most important issues in history. I think this film should be considered as pictorial manifest of the existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our age too, because it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Interestingly, no one will forget the face of death in this movie which was played by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties but no one knows is there any one to order him to do that? The knight never find out if god is out there or not even when he asked death about it. The death is not able or allowed to answers to the knight whether anything really exists beyond life or not. If there is emptiness or something else beyond it? What happens then? He remains mysterious and silent about these questions all over the film. I think Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about these matters and there is no clear answer to them. We are all that knight too who seeking for the truth.It is one of the most interesting movies which I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If some one likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.Also the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are some how similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on",The Seventh Seal
251,Bergmaniac,"Great, but far from Bergman's best",9,4 June 2004,"I find it strange that ""The seventh Seal"" has always been widely considered to be the best Bergman movie and is so much more famous that all the others he made. Yes, it's very good, especially for its time, but compared with the real masterpieces Bergman made like ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Through a Glass darkly"", ""Persona"", ""Winter light"" and ""Fanny and Alexander"", it really pales in comparison. The ideas and the questions asked in this movie are pretty interesting and profound, but I feel that Bergman has done so much better in his later movies on similar subjects. The theme about the God's silence is much, much better developed in the famous ""Faith Trilogy"", especially ""Through a glass darkly"" and ""Winter light"". The theme about how to cope with fear of death is well developed, but couldn't really convince me. Also I feel that the film has too many ""comic relief"" moments.  Many people have praised the cinematography in this movie, quite a few saying that it's one of the best ever. I beg to disagree. It's very, very good, excellent at times, but again Bergman has done so much better in his other movies. Personally I feel that the cinematography in Bergman's movies improved when he changed his director of photography Gunnar Fischer(who worked on this movie and ""Wild Strawberries"") with Sven Nykvist. Watch ""Through a glass darkly"" or ""Persona"" if you want a really stunning cinematography. But even ""Wild Strawberries"", made shortly after ""The Seventh seal"" and looking visually quite similar, is better IMO. Here the settings and the lighting looks too theatrical to me for most of the times. Of course, there were quite a few memorable images, especially the start with Death on the beach, the dance with Death at the end, the procession of the fanatics who whipped themselves through the village,etc. But still, something was lacking in many of the scenes. Bergman had to shoot the whole movie in just 35 days, so it's understandable IMO. After being so critical to the movie so far, it's time to mention its strong points. They are typical of Bergman's movies. Very strong acting(especially from Max von Sydov), amazing dark medieval atmosphere, really makes you think about the important questions. The music was very well and effectively used too. It's a great movie, no doubt, and it established Bergman as one of the all-time greats, which is big plus for a huge fan of him like myself. Still, my advice is: don't limit your Bergman experience to just this movie, watch his others, many of them are even better. 9/10",The Seventh Seal
252,Uther1,A film to make you think,10,31 December 2009,"Ingmar Bergman gave us an incredible film here. A knight goes wit to wit against death in a game of chess to buy himself more life. The movie takes a very philosophic bend, and takes us through the thoughts that every human has thought since nigh on the beginning of mankind. Is there a God? Why can I not perceive him with any of my senses? Yet, why can I not rid myself of the thought of God? No point in this film can be looked at with a glance; every scene is a deep well of meaning, and every character meant to show us a different way humanity deals with the inevitability of death. There isn't a moment to miss. Set in medieval Europe, we are confronted with a world obsessed with the end. Religion is at its peak of making noise; the plague travels the land and leaves nothing but death, boils, and terror. Amid this horror, a knight returns from the crusades convinced that the ten years he spent there at war were worthless, and left with no faith in God. Death comes knocking, but the knight cleverly challenges him to the ultimate game of wits, chess, since he had heard in ballads in tales that Death plays. During a reprieve in the game, Death gives the knight a chance to do one last deed on earth to search for meaning. I feel a bit bad giving out perfect scores, but what really lies at fault here is that I decided to see an amazing movie. There's nothing else to do with Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece than to give it a perfect score. The lack of technology cannot take any points away from it, and the story is both gripping, entertaining, and more meaningful than I care to talk about at any more length. This is a movie you must see, take an hour and a half to sit and consider your own life, because as Socrates said, the unexamined life is not worth living, and this movie forces you to consider your life and how you handle its end. Even the simple painter in the film knew this was important, and you would be completely remiss in not seeing this complete 10/10 classic. This was a snippet from my full review.

So while this film is in many top 100 lists this does not necessarily mean you will enjoy it. This film caused much controversy when it was released, and still to this day, because of its anti-god and anti-religious views. For instance, the only divine being that we ever see is death. The character of death is well written and well acted, and scenes he is in a very memorable. The film can be very boring and seemingly shallow when you are not fully analysing every image, but if you think that it is not a bad film it is just a film that you will not enjoy, no matter how many times you rematch it. The camera-work though is very memorable, and I really like that the camera always still. It makes the world feel more empty, and this is really absorbing. My final impression on the film is mixed. I love the character of death, and I love the isolated feel of the world, but the film does have section where the film just slows down and even lacks memorable images, which is exactly what the film tries to achieve. I also do not like the massive character list, which makes the film feel stuffed and the 95 minute runtime means that each character has virtually no character development. I still recommend you watch it though.",The Seventh Seal
254,samicebergjohnson,A true Master piece of classical cinema,10,23 August 2015,"For its time, Ingmar Bergman's iconic ""The Seventh Seal"" was revolutionary for its blatancy in showing the absence of God but the presence of Death. Much of what comprises this film; is not what those who know of it would attribute to it, visually speaking. Most people can only think about the visual of a knight on a beach, just back from the Crusades, the ocean suddenly silenced when a dark figure reveals himself on the horizon. It is Death, cloaked all in black, his white washed face standing out against the backdrop of pure nature. They play a game of chess for the knight's life, and so the film begins. Past that most people don't know much about this film. For one thing, there is very little chess featured in this film. For another, the knight has a comrade who he travels with. They go through the countryside, where the Plague has laid siege to all peoples. Everyone has become mad and frightened at the prospect of death, and belies religion's influence for some help in the matter of their mortality. A large amount of people believe in the religious fervor that is sweeping the countryside, and lend themselves to self-abuse, crucifixions, and murder. Others try to steal from the dead and help themselves through the devastation of the illness. Everyone seems to be trying to find answers to why there is war, poverty, and illness when God is supposed to protect them from their woes. A girl is captured and confesses to consorting with the Devil, which she says brought about the plague. She is only an innocent, content in turning from her God because of his absence, but not really a conspirer with evil. The film encourages exploration and takes a step back from theology by showing the very evils it inflicted in the past. Still, there is a call for people to also keep their faith in the face of Death, even while he's playing chess across from you. There's also a young couple who are very friendly and giving, and their fates are sealed thanks to their faith and love for one another. Bergman may not have known the infinitesimal questions that come from exploring your own doubt and frustrations with life. Though Bergman continually questioned himself in his later films, there is never an answer, only the freedom to question at all.",The Seventh Seal

The Seventh Seal is about Bergman's inner personal questions and thoughts that he was wondering about during his lifetime. We see as his perspective through the movie seeking for a meaning for everything that been told to us since we were too young to question them. It's not attend to be critical at anything at all, Just the things that a kid or a simple human being would ask to himself about all the meaning and beyond and death subjects. Would it be challenging? Definitely. But who else could have done it in a better way. Characters are so symbolic and all each represent to a form of human way of thinking and perspective. From a knight crusade to a circus clown they got much different ways of seeing and understand things from whatsoever happen around them to the all philosophical questions in life that would cross our minds. But Bergman is the director that could fit them so perfectly in a frame all together that not only it's so meaningful but still enjoyable to watch every minute of it. you can still watch the movie and enjoy it even if you don't seek a meaning or never questioned things or simply you don't care about these stuff. The plot narrate during medieval period that religions were reigning not only the lands but to more efficiently the thoughts and minds. Where every word of the bishop was absolute and the only salvation were in the hands of church, was there any room to question those things?!

257,Blite2000,Contrived and an acting mixed bag,5,5 November 2005,"I went into this pretty excited. After all, it's far and wide described as one of the best, if not *the* best film ever made. Frankly, I didn't see it.The first problem I had with The Seventh Seal was the acting. The knight, Death, and the squire were highlights, but the rest of the cast had an almost pantomime-like quality that is very, very distracting. In fact, this may not simply be an acting problem - many of the set-ups of the film are pretty pantomime: there is a scene with the actors playing out a song involving a cock crowing while, behind the stage, another actor tries to seduce a girl, which is not only sonically grating but completely ludicrous. I tried to work out if it was intended to be satirical but it actually comes off more like the Benny Hill show. In another scene, in which one of the actors is made to dance like a bear on the table in an inn, the camera cuts to reaction shots of the crowd who burst into hysterical laughter in a completely non-spontaneous, false and bizarre manner. It just doesn't work.The second problem I had was the contrived nature of the situations the knight finds himself in: at one point self-flaggelists walk into the village in a long procession waving incense and everyone kneels and weeps. This has been set up in advance by an explanation of who these flaggelists are. And, because of the set up, it, again, doesn't work. Similarly, when the troupe are in the woods towards the end of the film, they are faced with a character (who has previously been shown to be a *not very nice man*) with the plague. Why, other than to have the troupe look death in the face and make the terribly unsubtle point about whether forgiveness should be given to those about to die, is he in the woods miles from anywhere? Once again, it doesn't work.Every question the film is trying to pose is given its own scene, so that the whole story plays like a series of distinct vignettes linked only by the knight character and two or three characters who are obviously set up to take a fall later in the film. *However*, Bergman sets up the film as a linear progression between the knight's knowing he is going to die and his ultimate death. You can't have it both ways - you either go down the vignette route or you go the linear route. You can't have the scene in the bar, the flaggelists, the burning of the ""witch"" all supposedly happening in a linear fashion, since they are all a little too random to gel together.And, for me at least, the result of all this is that this is not a film that could ever be described as ""subtle"". You see every question coming even before Bergman gives it its ten-minute moment of screen time. The only thought left in your mind is what weird contortion of the plot Bergman is going to put us through to get to that question. And, as a result, the film is very boring to watch. At times I found myself begging that Death would show up just to add a little spice. And that's without even mentioning how *excrutiating* the songs are....All in all, I'd say The Seventh Seal is very disappointing and I couldn't really recommend it. That said, though, any film that is rated so highly by so many people is always going to deserve at least a glance. It's clearly not trash.",The Seventh Seal
258,greigroselli,I am attempting to capsulate the best film ever made.,10,1 October 1998,"This film is the best film ever made, be it Swedish or American.  It goes beyond the normal bounds of film making to bring a profound, often harrowing, message to the viewer. The philosophical implication of death and the existence of God is toyed with.  The eerie portrayal of Death with a black cape has become a symbol within itself. When the crusader plays Chess with Death, in the hopes of prolonging his life, so he can do that one good thing--I was on the edge of my seat.  The mesmorizing confessional scene is cinemagraphic genious.  There are many gems, for movie makers, in this film.  It is a great display of cinema art and philosophical ""de profundis"". The Seventh Seal crosses all boundaries.  It is a film both endearing and frightening.  I can watch it again and again, and be blown away by its magnitude.",The Seventh Seal
259,rk176,Man's existential agony,10,4 November 2006,"I love this film. In my opinion it aims at and successfully displays not only man's fear of death, even when some of the characters believe in an afterlife, but more importantly, man's various emotional and intellectual strong reactions of living life with the great uncertainty of what happens after death, and what's more, the meaning of existence and suffering if there is no God. The sensual squire seems to take the question of life (and death) with an atheistic calmness, while others, particularly the knight, agonize over the absolute senselessness of life if there is not God. It must be remembered that the film takes place in the 14th century during the murderous intensity of the brutal Black Plague, which heightens the question of the meaningfulness or pointlessness of life at all. I think all thinking people, including but certainly not exclusive to Sartre and Camus would enjoy this film. Is life and suffering of any value in what might be a pointless and absurd world. ""To be or not to be"" is really the underlying question here and, just like Hamlet, neither answer is satisfactory.",The Seventh Seal
260,jeff_johnston,an interesting note,10,3 July 2001,"There seem already to be a lot of good comments (although some may be overstated). The only thing I believe I can really add is an interesting note about the circumstances of the film: it's one of Bergman's earlier films, and Bergman later almost disowned it (along with ""Wild Strawberries"") because he believed that their subject matter was unimportant. He was ""much happier,"" he said, after he left behind the agony of the quest for God and became a secular humanist.For me, this simply underlines the intense difficulty with which one truly confronts the search for God. It is, I suppose, to be expected that Bergman had to leave his search behind, since it caused him so much pain-- a pain which is beautifully crystallized in his film. But I hope his movie remains popular, if only because I believe the struggle is an important one in the human legacy, one which every man must confront.Few movies can even begin to approach the subject of religious agony without tending either toward the disgustingly sentimental and revisionist (a la ""schindler's list"") or the stupid ""cool"" atmosphere that seems to pervade movies these days. Ingmar Bergman does it in what is quite possibly the best way: taking a minimalist approach, he doesn't veer toward flashy camera techniques that dazzle, nor toward lingeringly emotional scenes. There is just enough of everything: just enough plot to tell us what is going on without confusing, just enough cutting to relieve us from longer shots without jarring the eye with too much motion, just enough dialogue to convey a singular tone that has both focus and depth. This film reaches an ""arete"" that is rare in cinema: its subject meets the medium perfectly, and the stark purity of the cinematography is met by the lonely nature of the ideas which it deals with.",The Seventh Seal

Like other films of Bergman that I have seen, this again is a reflection on death and its relevance to life. Taking the context of plague-ridden medieval Europe Bergman discusses various aspects of human existence - religion, happiness, faith, god - against the backdrop of omniscient death. There's really no point in trying to give you the plot summary and stuff like that because this is not about story or characters or drama, it's essentially an illustrative discussion of Bergman's existentialist philosophies and has to be actually seen and absorbed in toto tobe at all understood in the right perspective. Which is not to say that I claim to understand it completely (I could never feel confident enough to say that about such a magnificently erudite piece) but even the slight glimpses I get of superbly constructed theological questions that Bergman raises through his film are overwhelming enough for this sadly lesser mortal.",The Seventh Seal

I expected that to be the main thing, the main philosophical talking about all the things that movie suppose to be about. You can call it art, whatever.. Maybe I am too dumb to understand.

Practically everybody I meet who is anxious about conveying an image of themselves as culturally minded, praise this movie, but gives few reasons why. The fact is, this movie is much too long, and could have been a much better product had it been condensed to around 3 minutes. It could then contain the shots the self-proclaimed ""cultural elite"" talk so much about: The beach in the beginning; the introduction of Mr Death; the game of chess between Block and him.One could make it even more appealing by converting it into a music video. One would have people in traditional Swedish clothes playing folk music at the summer solstice celebration(midsommar in Swedish), while Mr Death chases Block around the midsommarstång, in the end catching up with him.The great problem with this movie, is that there is hardly anything interesting in it. There's only a number of long, meaningless dialogues without any real connecting story.

How people hail ""The Matrix"" as a movie that is able to do this confuses me(I hate The Matrix FYI)? The Seventh Seal proves that special effects are not needed nor will they ever will be to make a masterpiece. The image of death haunts me, with his pale white face and long black robe. This is picture filled with the horrors of life, the apocalypse, for the black death has come and few can accept that.

Having been forced to watch it, and fearing it would be pretentious art/crap, I was prepared for the worst and surprised by the very best.  It's allegory readily translates to any era, and it's characters are at once both sympathetic and engaging.  Bergman has Francis Ford Coppola's visual sense, (or vice versa... I've got my cart before my horse here!), and therefore, his movies are very artistic to watch.  (I've often said I could turn off the sound on any given Coppola film and just LOOK at it... same goes for this movie.)  Like most hapless folks of my generation, I was weaned on vapid hollywood tripe, testosterone engorged, brain-dead action and the usual bevy of unattractive splatter films.

Thanks to this film, I've discovered other classic cinema greats like Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welle's, Stanley Kubrick... the list goes on and on.  Movies are fine, but give your eyes and your brain something of substance and treat yourself to some real cinema every now and again.

Very often I'll find my admiration for a thematically substantive film tempered by my frustration at how mercilessly the themes are propounded. What impresses me the most about The Seventh Seal is that Bergman's startlingly bold symbolic choices don't result in this kind of excess. We see Death himself - playing chess with a doomed mortal, no less - and yet we (or I, at least) don't at all feel that Bergman has gone too far. The dialogue, even when it deals with such weighty topics as the existence of God, seems honest and natural. (The possible exception is Antonius's musing on how meaningful is his experience with Jof, Mia, and the bowl of strawberries.) Max von Sydow is perfect. He and Ekerot's performance in the confession scene magnificently complements Bergman's masterful dialogue and cinematography.

As for my students, it's more than the usual black and white, strange language problem that all film teachers now recognize.  It seems to me to be part of the post-modern ""understanding"" that all meaning is as random as any other meaning, and that the search for God is a fake.  In many ways I accept that notion, as it does fit in with the way the universe seems to be.  My students watch Antonious Blok, and don't understand what his problem.  (Bergman did understand that view, and created the character of Jons the squire, as a fill-in for the modern cynic.)  Each time I show the film, and see it again for myself, I ask myself if in really is more than my own 60's romanticism, when we were discovering life.  There are some films which I stop showing.

274,gandhi35,Metaphorically epic,10,24 November 2000,"Bergman's 1957 masterpiece, The Seventh Seal, is my second favorite film next to Citizen Kane.  WOW!  When I first saw the piece, I was amazed about how much one filmmaker could make his screenplay and his direction work like sex.  The screenplay is dark, I mean, it only as a character called Death in it (literally, Death is death), and it displays the isolation of the Middle Ages just like Larry McMurtry's book, The Last Picture Show, describes the isolation of the 50's.  So, how does the direction work?  Well, it shows us how human beings cope with death.  All the fears and all the hopes of death are dealt with through this fascinating work of genius. Now, don't use the comparison to McMurtry's book to an extreme.  I mean, with the circus performers and musicians in this film, the characters are alot more cultural than the awfully horny teens in The Last Picture Show. The isolation is within.  Take Jons, the knight, for example.  He's trying to escape his own death, which is like escaping humanity.  Sonny, from McMurtry's novel, is also trying to escape his life, which goes hand in hand with death.  That's where the real epic is in this film, the coping with life and death.  A character study at its finest. The direction is dynamic.  There's a whole lot of still shots, but then there's a few scenes that are like a 50's style of the D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.  There's also alot of Hitchcockian zooms and pans and close-ups, especially the scene when Death confronts everyone in Jons' castle.  Amazing stuff. This is the second greatest movie that I've ever seen and easily one of the most profound.  I can't wait to see other works my Ingmar Bergman (especially Fannie and Alexander).",The Seventh Seal

These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.",The Seventh Seal
276,beerzen,Philosophical With Strong Point Of View,8,30 April 2004,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. The figure of Death on the cover in high contrast of black and white is disturbing yet compelling.While the plot in this movie is rather basic, the philosophical ideas are presented in a very engaging way. This taps into the primal human fear of death and search for answers. Not only the search, but the sometimes seemingly hopelessness of existence.Death plays a literal role as well as being a prevalent occurrence.****Spoiler**** When the young crusader starts talking about how God cannot exist with all the horrible death as a result of the plague it made my spine tingle. Very real and direct observations of faith versus immediate reality are made.For the crusader to do something meaningful as a last chance of figuring it out. However he never does figure it all out. He is content at having tricked death before he goes.The scene where the two characters are talking about women after the one's wife disappeared to cheat with the actor was funny. Here we have two guys talking about how women are useless, how you should kill them after a short period. Yet the men are weak because they are so dependent on the idea of having a woman. Then for the wife to pull it off later by being all sweet to her husband. Then she agrees to have the actor killed. This to me just shows the shallowness of both sexes, at least those two characters as husband and wife. The whole sanctity of marriage throne out the window. One portrayal of ""good"" religious folk being hypocrites.Also the portrayal of the religious fanatics burning the witch. When the ""godless"" crusader has the most humanity and compassion in not wanting her to die. He does not see Satan in her, just a girl hysterical like the men ready to burn her at the stake. ****End Spoiler***I think this movie is powerful in its ideas and not afraid to present them in a ""in your face"" way. The basic plot is rather dull but it doesn't matter because the ideas make you think. Some of the imagery and happenings in the movie are surreal in presentation.I would definitely recommend this movie if you like something different from your standard movie fare.

While the aforementioned are undoubtedly great in their own right, this movie addresses mortality, faith, and opposing world views in an incredibly powerful fashion. Though it is very theatrical for a movie, it works because the ideas are so widespread and perennial. Also, the writing is fantastic.

285,daltongray,Existentialism in The Seventh Seal,7,8 December 2012,"Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal follows the final days of a knight, and an accompanying band of his squire, actors, and a blacksmith, as he plays chess with Death, his life hanging in the balance. Ominous and foreboding, Bergman steeps The Seventh Seal with existentialist philosophy akin to Sartre's atheist existentialism found in ""Existentialism is a Humanism."" Much of the knight's journey through the film mirrors Sartre's atheistic existentialist notions of anguish, despair, and abandonment. Sartre, unlike others, states that the lack of a God is not simply met with mere acceptance; rather, the person experiences these three feelings. The knight exhibits the anguish, which Sartre suggests is a consequence of one wondering ""What would happen if everyone did what I am doing?,"" early in the film when he ponders ""Through my indifference for people, I've been placed outside of their society."" The abandonment, similarly, is shown through the knight throughout the film. Having realized his inability to find God, the knight requests to meet Satan, who the knight believes ""He if anyone"" must know God, via an alleged witch waiting for execution. Despite the witch's insistence that Satan is all around her and easily seen, the knight, alas, sees nothing. Finally, in the closing moments of the film, as Death presents himself to the knight, the squire, the blacksmith, and their accompanying women, the knight tries one final time to beseech God. However, the squire asserts that ""In that darkness where you reside, where we probably all reside, you'll find no one that listens to your complaint or is moved by your suffering."" In addition to showing the knight's abandonment issue, the squire implies Sartre's final feeling, despair, in that the squire understands that, in the absence of God, man must ""limit"" himself ""to reckoning only with those things that depend of (his) will"" and not that of others.",The Seventh Seal

Throughout the story characters contemplate what is the meaning of life in all of the suffering that is going on around them. Jons, as does the character Socrates, wonders what is the true meaning of his existence. He questions the purpose of the war he has fought.

Every scene stands out, but I was really blown away by one showing a procession of flagellants, whipping themselves while a priest shrieks at them, telling them they're worthless sinners, damned to hell. If Brueghel had been born in the 20th century, and made movies instead of painting, maybe this is what he would have created.It's a deeply depressing film. The main character, a knight home from the Crusades, tries to find God. In the end, he learns there is no God, only death. The only happy person in the movie is Jof, and the only time the knight finds any comfort at all is when he contemplates the family life that Jof enjoys. The movie hits you over the head with the message that God will never be found because he is not there. We cannot escape death.

289,gecko-28,stupid and distracting low-budget visuals,7,2 August 2007,"This film has not aged well, doesn't look remotely medieval.

All the actors are perfectly clean with (especially the women) lots of makeup, flawless faces and teeth, perfectly coiffed hair, plucked eyebrows (only the women); the clothing includes 20th-century halter tops. The pigs and chickens are obviously 20th-century breeds. The musical instruments are ridiculous.There's too much of this stuff; it's very distracting. And there are other things that are merely poorly thought out. Why are the horses drinking salt water at the beginning of the film? Why is Jof having trouble juggling with two balls? How do the tavern customers manage to drink out of empty cups (the cups are cracked all the way through, so must be empty)? One commentator here suggested that the story isn't supposed to be literal, that the Knight might be dead at the beginning. Some parts are obviously allegorical - playing chess with Death - and the movie works better if the entire thing is view as an allegory or a fantasy or a hallucination. But it can't be a medieval fantasy; the most charitable explanation is that it's the ravings of a modern (and possibly dying) ""knight"" (whatever that means) about a Middle Ages that never existed outside the movies. A less charitable explanation is that the film was made too cheaply and quickly to make any visual sense.",The Seventh Seal

He searched for truth .He hasn't found it yet and it's getting clear through the film it's not going to happen.The question of the existence of god and the relation of humans to him is one the most important issues in history. This film has deep roots from existentialism. Are we alone in the world or not? Is there any hope to feel the God through our life in any way? This film could happen in our era too it has the same questions yet we haven't found. Symbolically the knight tries to find out some things about beyond life and death from the death which playing by Bengt Ekerot. The death only carries out his duties. He kept his silence and only follows the light with loyalty.Ingmar Bergman let us free to judge about knight's concerns. The film gives us no clear answer. We are that entire knight too who seeking for the truth.It is one of the most interesting movies I ever saw. Ingmar Bergman has many great ideas to talk about. If someone likes to see a movie which could help him to think more about himself and the world around him, I suggest this film.Also the power of humanity is evident in this film. At the end of the film we see that small family comprised of three who escaped the death and saw the others leaded by the death to the end of their destiny. They are plain and good people which don't have complicated ideas about life. They only want a simple life to live. It's clear they are somehow similar to the father, Christ and the holy Mother and this could be one of the reasons why they didn't go with dead. Life goes on",The Seventh Seal

Jof, Mia and Mikael escape death because Antonius sacrifices his game for their sake thereby distracting death while they escape.Death asks Antonius whether he has made good of his respite for which he answers 'yes'.Earlier in the church he confesses that he wants to use his respite to accomplish one meaningful act. Saving them from death was the meaningful act.Central idea:This movie challenges religion. The reason for the crusades is constantly questioned. In the end it is not God that saves them(Jof,Mia and Mikael) but a mortal(Antonius).In the same line we can see a good deal of time being devoted to show blind beliefs in people(people inflicted with plague flogging themselves, the girl who is burnt).",The Seventh Seal
295,herrmanngoldsmithrozsa,"The Seventh Seal: ""A Film of Visual Scope, of Imaginative Concept, of Powerful Content""",10,15 April 2018,"Ingmar Bergman is a director of unparalleled brilliance. Since his first script, 1944's Torment, Bergman has always delivered thoughtful and engaging films that delve deep into humanity. Be it relations between one another, our consciousness and subconsciousness, or any number of various facets of our existence, Bergman cuts to the very core of humanity and bring to light these many layers and elements in exceedingly artful ways. And one of the great tales told by the Swedish titan that demonstrates this well is his cherished and revered classic, The Seventh Seal.The Seventh Seal is a masterful piece of filmmaking that explores man's relationship with religion in medieval times, a time when the Church had a stranglehold on feudal Europe. The story of disillusioned knight Antonius Block, played by the impeccable Max von Sydow, returning from the grueling Crusades to lands ravaged by the Great Plague and taking on Death itself, portrayed by the chilling Bengt Ekerot, in a chess match for his life is one of the most simple yet complex tales captured on celluloid. Alongside this central battle is a colorful cast of side characters, including he blissful pair of actors Jof & Mia, played by Nils Poppe & Bibi Andersson respectively, and Block's squire Jöns, brought to life with delightfully dry wit by Gunnar Björnstrand, who flesh out the dark world of medieval Sweden and provide levity and even humor in the midst of the grim conflict and existential inquires made by Block.Bergman's script, adapted from a play of his titled Wood Painting, is somewhat on the nose in its mulling over of faith, death, and existence. But to a degree, what Bergman crafted was an adult fairy tale. The Seventh Seal is a story you could tell a child as it is simple in its narrative and its developments, but is rich in imagery and allusion, taking its title from and quoting at the outset from the eighth chapter of the Book of Revelations. Block's passionate search for knowledge and constant crisis of faith is engaging on a philosophical and personal level, aided by the impassioned performance provided by Sydow. The premise is a simple piece of high fantasy, but it delves into it themes openly and in depth. British author Melvyn Bragg put it best when he described the film as having an argumentative structure and being ""told as a sermon might be delivered: an allegory."" Adding to these inquiries and the sharp discussions between Block and Death in the midst of their match are characters such as Jof & Mia that bring a certain level of hope to the piece, as both are pleasant and optimistic for a fair portion of the film, with Jof being almost prophetic in a way, being able to see visions of both Mary and a young Jesus, and ominous premonitions of the effects of the Great Plague. And then there is the squire Jöns, an unadulterated cynic who, as described by American author and film historian Gerald Mast in his book A Short History of the Movies, ""treats death as a bitter and hopeless joke."" These supporting roles help to build the world and the themes of death and faith through their interactions with Block. All in all, the script, in spite of its bluntness, is exceptionally articulate and works wonders with its straightforward but fantastic premise.On the technical side, The Seventh Seal is a low-budget marvel, knowing that it was made on a pauper's budget of $150,000. Bergman's direction is inspired in its bleak tone that pairs well with the equally dark concepts presented in the script. He approaches the film rather intellectually, showing chilling images of an ill woman writhing in pain being looked over by a monk, and depicting Death as incredibly callous in a famous scene involving the felling of a tree. Every actor and actress is clearly invested. Sydow, Ekerot, Björnstrand, Andersson, throw a dart, and the name you hit is giving his or her all in the role. The chemistry between the characters is spectacular, with Sydow and Ekerot boasting one of the most impressive dichotomies in committed to celluloid. Gunnar Fischer's expressionistic cinematography was universally lauded upon release, and rightfully so. The gothic and pastoral medieval imagery is elegantly captured with impressive lighting schemes and excellent framing, with the introduction of Death and the ""Danse Macabre"" being the two iconic shots that bookend the film. P.A. Lundgren's production design and Manne Lindholm's costume design go hand in hand in creating the lived-in world of medieval Sweden, with big props going to Lindholm in draping Death with the iconic black cloak. Also of note is the inspired score by regular collaborator Erik Nordgren, whose liberal use of the Latin chant Dies Irae, general implementation of choral passages, and orchestral mannerisms reminiscent of celebrated American composer Bernard Herrmann enrich the film through heightening the grimness and further enveloping the audience in the atmosphere of the period.At the end of the day, The Seventh Seal is deservedly a classic. It is a film that blatantly ponders the nature of faith and death, but does so in an engaging and personal way. Through a combination of Bergman's well-crafted characters and each actor's pitch-perfect execution, you become invested in all facets of this world. You are there with Block in taking on Death, and you too want to know the answers, you want the knowledge he seeks, you too want ""God to stretch out His hand."" The production values are top notch, especially knowing that the budget afforded to Bergman was so small. But at the end of the day, it is a film that has to be seen to truly appreciate. So in closing, go and watch this film. If you consider yourself a fan of cinema, or are an aspiring filmmaker, simply take some time to watch this masterclass of medieval fantasy and world cinema.",The Seventh Seal
296,raul2010,Bergman mixes up but does not err,9,25 October 2000,"This movie shows the society of the Middle Ages in a very exact way. However, I must say that there's a completely forgivably inaccuracy. Bergman mixed up two different centuries: the 11th and the 14th. The 11th century was the time of the Crusades impelled by Urban I; so the knight that comes back from the Crusades can only be placed in the 11th. And the 14th was the century of the plagues in Europe, the plagues that scares so much everybody in the story.

309,bovall73,The Seventh Seal as mainstream,10,4 September 2001,"As has already been stated by numerous cineasts, the Seventh Seal is a marvelous film in many respects. However I find it quite amusing that so many american observers compare it to mainstream Hollywood movies, defining it as being ""...not Lethal Weapon 3!"", and generally referring to the Seventh Seal as an anomaly, almost underground. As a Swedish person, though admittedly co-bombarded by american/Hollywood ""culture"", I see the tradition in which the test-audience screened Hollywood type movies are the epitome as a special class of movies. Investment type flicks which serve the explicit purpose of making money. The Seventh Seal on the other hand represent what real, honest movie making is all about. Something which of course Hollywood is not unable of!A am truly happy for all of you who have managed to see beyond your often highly explosive ""mainstream""!",The Seventh Seal

How disappointed I was to find everything good about the movie happens on the beach or surely thereafter.I was expecting more of a bottle movie, with the entire movie being the game of chess where they debate philosophy and life and whatnot, which could be really interesting if done well.This was not that and frankly I was highly disappointed by the rest of the plot. It was super obvious that the director hated women who aren't happily married mothers and went out of his way to die it. Most of the characters were despicable as well. I actually don't mind unlikable characters but since they were either awful or boring I couldn't care less about their trials. Also i don't see what people see in the main characters performance. He just seemed bored and stale most of the time.Honestly don't watch it. This one really isn't worth it.",The Seventh Seal
313,Mikeheg,Dark honest look into our souls as humans,10,5 June 2007,"This movie has inspired me more than any other to care about cinema. The story of a knight that starts to honestly ask questions about the existence of God, while death roams all around him. Literally, Death (the Grimm Reaper) appears and is actually confronting the knight as the instigator, the opponent, and the helper,so they both sit to play chess. The Black plague is all around and the knight has compassion on a family . It's been a long time since I saw this movie but when I did I new I just witnessed something very rare in Cinema. Satan also reviles the concept of God, and in the movie the Devil shows up to say ""He doesn't exist!"" Most of us think the quest for what is in a mans soul as a afterthought but Ingmar Bergman makes the observer ask, ""Where do we go, after we die?"" Do you believe in a cold god, A Satan. If you believe in the devil then you need to think there is a God, the Judeo/Christian Bible Is the first to mention Satan thousands of years ago. So I'd like to think we are looked after by a God.",The Seventh Seal
314,singlespeedcheetah,"First films were art, then sound was added. Now they are art again.",10,16 November 2015,"The film ""The Seventh Seal"", directed by the fantastic Ingmar Burgmann, is a film that is a long and moody rumination on religion and what occurs, if anything, when one no longer adheres to one's religion. Set in medieval Sweden the main protagonist is Antonius Block, a knight returning from the crusades, an ostensibly religiously pursuit. But this is the return trip and fighting shall not be found. Consider the opening scene: a close up of Block with his eyes closed, seemingly asleep at the coast. This is followed by the camera panning right to his squire Jon who is equally prone but making faint stirrings. Form here the camera is pointed towards their horses, albeit, briefly, only to return to Block who now strides to the ocean. It is this blending of reality and the fantastic that occurs repeatedly throughout the film. Consider the following dialog between Block and Death himself—gendered no less: Antonius Block: ""Who are you?"" Death: ""I am Death."" Antonius Block: ""Have you come for me?"" Death: ""I have long walked by your side."" Antonius Block: ""So I have noticed."" Death: ""Are you ready?"" Antonius Block: ""My body is ready, but I am not. "" Never had so much been said with such succinctness. But here in lies the problem with the film: so little is left out that the audience can become lost or disinterested as this is an art film and not subject to the usual film trope of problem and conflict resolution as is often found. This combined with music whose function is to invoke tension and foreboding in the extreme. All of this for the audience means one thing: work. This is a film requiring effort to view, understand and ultimately fully appreciate.",The Seventh Seal
315,WRVavra,Missing the point?,10,12 August 2002,"Some previous comments have said that the knight attempts to cheat Death, but is ultimately cheated himself.  Maybe I'm wrong on this one, but from the church scene on I never got the impression that the knight intended to win.  When Death takes his knight as they play shortly after meeting Jof and his family, Block replies ""...as you were meant to.""  No one so far has commented on this line, but it seems to me to be talking about a bit more than one move in a chess game.Later on, when the knight attempts to reset the game, I think it was a last-ditch effort to get for time.  Once he sees that he's accomplished his goal regardless, though, the knight finally feels ready for closure.  He still pines for answers, but the fact that he followed through on his deed allows him to rest a little easier and accept his fate.",The Seventh Seal

317,odysseydave,"Harrowing Question, Harrowing Answers",5,14 May 2007,"50 years have passed since Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" was released to worldwide critical acclaim. And after 50 years of cinema; how many films have tried to put into debate these same questions that ""The Seventh Seal"" did before. Some of these films have succeeded , others have fallen on their faces flat. But ""The Seventh Seal"" has not aged or it's power diminished a single bit after half a century. So what differs ""The Seventh Seal"" from other films in the same category and importance, thus making it great? It lies with Ingmar Bergman. Our story is set in the Middle Ages when the Plague was ravaging across Europe. Two men lie in a beach, a knight and his squire (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstand), have just returned from the Crusades. They are scarred from the battles and the knight's faith fading. His search for meaning has not come up with an answer as he lies in doubt. Is there really an answer? While the throbbing of the beach waves subside and degrades into silence and Death (Beng Ekerot) is standing in front of the knight. ""I've been at your side a long time"" remarks Death, as the knight, physically confident yet emotionally and spiritually deprived and frightened, tries to accept his fate. The two shall play a game of chess for the knight's soul. The game continues throughout the film.Bergman has a particularly great talent of representing the world and its characters. And no surprise, The Seventh Seal is filled with many major/minor characters. First of all, the acting troupe comprised of the pleasure-seeker Skat ; and the husband and wife Josef and Mia with their infant Michael. The latter two characters are keenly important to the world of this film; they provide warmth, sanctuary and grace, contrary to The Seventh Seal's cold story. The minor players include Plog , a blacksmith, his wife Lisa , Raval , a seminarist; who sent the knight and his squire to join the Crusades. Raval, a Bergman stereotype of man of God, who is deplorable to the world around him. Also, a witch is included to this big dramatis personae; she casts doubt and anguish to us and especially the knight. And, in my opinion, the most important minor character is the mute girl . She somehow ends up in every scene in The Seventh Seal after her entrance. She remains a big presence (ironically, a presence like Death). This ensemble gives the film a lot more than the original storyline: humor, gentleness, vulgarity and etc. Leaving The Seventh Seal creating its own dynamic setting which we are engulfed into.Going back, I suggested that Bergman has a definite answer to the subject of the film: the meaning of life; which has left many critics to many interpretations. But the answer is said plainly in the film; and tragically this response is somewhat fatalistic albeit pessimistic . Almost in a cruel way, Bergman burdens his answer throughout the film until the end. There is no room for sentimentality . Bergman's film and answer is cold, down-to-earth, and truthful . The Seventh Seal is Bergman's fatalistic , to-the-fact revelations hardlined by some of the most stark and beautiful images in the art of cinema. The best example of this is the scene which in the knight goes to church to confess; a hooded figure is standing waiting to receive the knight's anguish. With Gunnar Fischer's black-white, deep-focus cinematography, the knight's faith in God in balance, he pours out his entire soul to the hooded figure, perhaps, waiting for a response from God Himself. In agony, the knight goes as far as telling the figure about the game with Death . The hooded figure in curiosity asks how will he defeat Death. The knight, forthwithingly, tells his strategy. The hooded figure turns to the knight, he is in fact Death himself. No one is there to hear the knight's confession except nothingness, who is Death. From that point onwards, the knight is doomed, and the film has just passed its 25th minute. This is the beauty of the Bergman cinema, his images are as powerful as the story's theme, mostly about the absence of God. These scenes are Bergman masterstrokes, masterstrokes that are one of the most poignant and poetic in the history of cinema, to depict his fatalistic ideals . These scenes of gloom n' doom like the one mentioned lets the audience carry the film's burden even further. But the knight's quest for the meaning of life has not yet been extinguished. Then... he meets a witch about to be burned at the stake, and the knight ironically questions this Devil's servant about the knowledge of God. She tells him to look into her eyes... the knight sees nothing but terror. The witch goes into bragging about her relationship with the Devil, the knight looks down disheartened. As the witch is being burned at the stake, her eyes, the eyes of terror, open up as she fears for her life and with this sight the knight has given up his quest. It turns out the witch was looking at Death. The knight has come to his second dead end, he has tried to talk to God about his search, instead, Death is the one who answers him. Here, the knight tries to talk to Satan but to no avail. Only Death answers yet again this time through the dying witch. It seems Death is the only supernatural force in this world. From the march of the flagellant to the death of one of the minor characters, this scenes of immense poignancy and the meaningless is what makes up the bulk of The Seventh Seal and Bergman's worldy answer. But what about Death, does he know about any saviors? Like a cruel punchline, Death remains ambiguous to us. He remarks, ""I am unknowing"".",The Seventh Seal
318,johnhirsch22,Do not waste your time,1,13 July 2012,"It actually pains me to give this film a rating of 1/10. It truly deserves a negative number of stars. I did see a lot of potential, but it was simply not executed well. Most of the film is not at all interesting and the exciting scenes of interaction between Block and Death are very few and far between. I suspect that had I been high on every drug known to man during the time when I watched this, it probably would have been good. Perhaps I am not enough of a hipster/artist in order to truly enjoy this. I just thought I should post my response since I felt misled by the reviews, which were overwhelmingly positive. Also, I had issues with the quality of the film itself which repeatedly stalled and became pixilated. This did not affect my review in anyway, however, I want to give a heads up to all the Netflix users out there because I know that I am not the only person who had an issue with the quality of this film. Don't waste your time.",The Seventh Seal
319,mbriana,existentialism,9,10 December 2012,"The events and themes of Ingar Bergman's classic The Seventh Seal show numerous examples of existentialism. Throughout the film, characters blame occurrences such as the black plague on God, helplessly resorting to the idea that they have no individual control over their destinies. Protagonist Antonius Block, however, constantly tries to challenge this belief as he plays a game of chess with Death, his life dependent upon the outcome. He tells Death that he is searching for meaning in life and is frustrated with trying to believe in religion and in a God who ""hides in a mist of vague promises and unseen miracles."" The silence of God is also a recurring theme, as the characters seem to be ever searching for ways to please God yet ever lacking in His rewards. Antonius and others continuously question the existence of God, but, unlike the others, Antonius strives to achieve the existentialist concept of governing one's own future and making one's own choices—as is evident by his request to gamble his life on a game of chess with Death, rather than passively and nonchalantly accepting Death's arrival.",The Seventh Seal
320,joemiller499,Checkmate,8,16 October 2016,"Death, Death, Death. No matter the moves you make, Death will, in time, have you in checkmate. The Seventh Seal is a rightfully highly regarded film. It is a unique film, and unlike any I have ever seen. I have just finished my second viewing of the film. I have watched several Bergman films since I first saw this, but this is the one that has always stuck out to me the most. I would describe it as a dark and powerful film. There is nothing lacking in this film, in my opinion. The soundtrack is perfectly subtle, acting is agreeable, cinematography fitting and well done, etc. My favorite aspect of this film is simply the premise. A game of chess that is a matter of life and death. If nothing else, that concept is enough to make an interesting film at the very least. Death is the most persistent theme throughout the film, and is often juxtaposed to stark scenes of life, often quickly and without warning. This film was one of the first I watched in my everlasting pursuit of classic cinema, and I would readily recommend it as a starting point for anyone interested in classic or foreign films. Bergman will not disappoint in this one or elsewhere in his filmography. This is probably his most famous and accessible films. This is a staple of classic cinema, watch it and find out why.",The Seventh Seal

322,acrjamz,allegoric masterpiece,10,30 August 2015,"A masterful and timeless pondering on mortality and faith produced in the late 50's, Det sjunde inseglet (The Seventh Seal) is undoubtedly one of the most introspective films, with deeply self analyzing characters all coming to terms with the sudden realization of their own death. Block, a knight returned from the crusades, is faced with the imminent threat of death and struggles to find answers to his questions, all deeply connected with faith. His curiosity leads to a game of chess with Death itself. With stunning contrasting visual the allegory comes to life in a very theatrical manner with death itself personified. The eternal and frustrating try of self understanding is at the core of the film communicated by deeply dramatic dialog, aided by stunning medieval iconography and symbolism such as the famous danse macabre. There's also a heavy contrast between characters like Block and Jof. Jof represents the simple minded, uncomplicated, serene, with a certain ease in living and loving. While the other characters are absolutely consumed with the though of death, Jof and Mia remain care free for the most part. This dichotomy presented in so many other characters gives the film a theatrical and allegoric feeling but still accessible meaning. The imagery is remarkable with some of the most recognizable shots in film history, from the beginning to the ending frames.Heavy contrasts both in character, philosophy and cinematography make the film an unquestionable 10.",The Seventh Seal

I have to watch his movies at least 5 times to make sense out of the thinking, metaphorical mess.. He think his stories are 10 times more interesting than they are. And i certainly don't get the quote: ""Are you ready?"" ""My body is frighten. Not I"" THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION YOU .... (Dont know what it is in the English version so i translated it myself..)

325,ash_sea,"""Nothing escapes me""",8,4 October 2019,"""The Seventh Seal"" is the story of a man's quest for knowledge (or guarantees), a man that possesses the knowledge that his death is near. He has postponed it by challenging death himself to a chess match but is well aware of the inevitability of death. The irony of it all is that like Antonius in the movie everybody knows that death is coming for them and nothing escapes it.The strength of the movie lies in its ideology, the dialogues that give words to some of the timeless questions which are deeply buried inside every human.""Is it so terribly inconceivable to comprehend God with one's senses?""""Why does He live on in me in a humiliating way despite my wanting to evict Him from my heart?""The movie has a Shakespearean touch to it, like the ""fools"" in Shakespeare's plays Bergman uses the squire and the blacksmith to give comic relief in some scenes of the movie. The dialogues during those scenes are equally witty and sharp as in some of the darker scenes, consider Jöns description of love.""If all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.""The use of comedy isn't perfect throughout the movie, the story of blacksmith's wife serves its purpose in plot development but pales in comparison with the main theme of the story. But that doesn't hinder the flow or impact of the story at all.""The Seventh Seal"" explores the subject of death and studies it from the perspective of a medieval knight, similar to ""Citizen Kane"" which explores the purpose of life from the perspective of a publishing tycoon.",The Seventh Seal

It's an interesting insight to Ingmar Bergman's mind and it is well done but it is also a bit dragged out and IMO not as incredible as the mass of 10/10 reviews would point towards.If you historically contextualize it, it is no doubt addressing philosophical questions in a far more open and poetic way than many would dare, all while maintaining a dark & lovely feel buttt it's a little rough watching it in 2018.",The Seventh Seal

328,ffinnern,Totentanz,10,1 October 2018,"Middle ages, the age of crusade, black death, and flagellati, comes to live. Not with a big spectacle, like in many other movies, but in an intense, private, and very dense way. The medieval christians' fear of death and of dark forces is always present. And in the middle of all is the fallen hero, the knight Antonius Block. He is a fearless man who wants to get answers on the philosophical questions we all have: What for is life, and what comes after it? Is there an ""after"" at all? Is there a god, or is there just void? On his search for answers, he even tries to resist Death himself by playing chess against him. And he never gives up the search, even after realizing, that he just revealed his secrets to death and is finally doomed to lose. I watched this movie already when a was a teenager, many decades ago. Some years ago, I bought it on DVD. It gave me shivers then, and it still gives me shivers now. Sometimes, I'd like to be like Antonius Block - but sometimes, the insensibility and indifference of Block's squire, Jöns, is even more desirable.The actors play great, and technically, the movie fits the topic brilliantly. This movie is one of my very favorites of all times.My favorite quote as a natural scientist as well as a curious human being:
Death: Don't you ever stop asking?
Antonius Block: No. I never stop.
Death: But you're not getting an answer.",The Seventh Seal

This, and a cluster of films from this era mark one phase of Bergman's inquiries...and probably his best. The film is worth several screenings especially when viewed at a theater.
