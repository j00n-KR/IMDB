0,Leofwine_draca,Solid western storytelling with a great action climax,7,22 September 2016,"Some people say the western is dead, but I disagree; once in a while a good one comes along and shakes up people's opinions and generally impresses everybody. The last time was UNFORGIVEN, now it's Costner's OPEN RANGE, which is not up to the level of Eastwood's movie but is still generally pretty good. The biggest problem is the pacing, which is quite slow, but then for somebody who sat through THE POSTMAN, it seemed to go by pretty quick. Not much to say about this really, other than the scenery, the camera-work, and the music are all excellent, and the subdued acting from the cast is fine – with the exception of villain Michael Gambon, who is anything but subdued when he chews the scenery. I still ended up feeling sorry for him though. Costner is definitely on the back-burner here, giving all the major dramatics to buddy Robert Duvall, who is doing very well for a guy who must be about 110 by now. Then again he always looked old.I usually hate Annette Bening but she was excellent here as the love interest, whilst Abraham Benrubi has a small but pivotal role as a fellow cow poke and makes it really sympathetic. The script is intelligent and, although adding nothing new to the genre – at the heart this is a simple revenge story – keeps you interested throughout. Things (eventually) pick up for the hair-raising shoot-out at the end, which makes very good use indeed of loud gunshots and surprising stunts, so is definitely worth waiting for. All in all a good, solid addition to the genre.",Open Range
1,SnoopyStyle,Duvall great,7,27 May 2015,"Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) leads Charley Waite (Kevin Costner), Mose Harrison (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna) to drive their cattle across free grazing open range. They go into the town of Harmonville and are confronted by corrupt sheriff Poole and land baron Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) who hates free grazers. Mose was severely beaten and arrested. Boss and Charley bring him to Dr. Barlow (Dean McDermott). Boss finds a kind soul in the doctor's wife Sue Barlow (Annette Bening).This is an old-fashion western with a great open landscape and a compelling performance from Duvall. The plot meanders a bit going from romantic melodrama to brutal violence. The violence is brutal and realistic. I think shortening the over two hour running time would help increase the intensity.",Open Range
2,claudio_carvalho,A Contemporary Classic Western,9,14 February 2005,"The cowboys Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall), Charley Waite (Kevin Costner), Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna) are conducting their cattle herd through the fields of the West. Boss and Spearman have been friends for ten years, and they have an special affection and friendship for Button, Mose and his dog Dig. Boss requests Mose to return to a small town nearby and buy some supplies for the rest of their journey. Mose never comes back, and Boss and Charley decides to check what happened with him. They find Moses beaten and arrested in the jail by the corrupt Sheriff Poole (James Russo), accused of fighting against the men of a powerful local rancher, Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon). Boss and Charley bring Mose to the local doctor, Barlow (Dean McDermott), where Charley falls in love for his sister, Sue Barlow (Annette Bening). They return to their camping, they are attacked by Baxter's men and Mose and Dig are killed and Button is seriously wounded. The two old cowboys return to the town looking for justice. ""Open Range"" is one of the best contemporary western, with the characters very well constructed and an engaging low paced story having action, drama and romance. The performance of the cast, highlighting Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner, and the direction of Kevin Costner are magnificent. I believe in the future ""Open Range"" will be considered a classic in the genre. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Pacto de Justiça"" (""Pact of Justice"")",Open Range
3,kosmasp,Kevin loves Western,8,24 March 2012,"You do wonder, what will happen with the Western genre (which was ""medically"" declared dead after Unforgiven) when Kevin Costner isn't around anymore. He tried to revive the genre several times, but even with really good movies like this one, he didn't succeed. Of course western elements can be found in many other genres too, but it's a shame there aren't more of them.Back to this one, that has a really great cast (not Costner, but also Duvall) and some really great action set pieces. Of course there is some real good character build-up first. But when the action kicks in, it really delivers. Great cinematography rounds this all up very nicely.",Open Range
4,classicsoncall,"""Most times a man will tell you his bad intentions if you listen, let yourself hear.""",10,16 August 2006,"I hadn't realized what a consummate actor Robert Duvall was until ""Open Range"". When his character is on screen, one gets the impression that it's really Boss Spearman on display, a cantankerous trail boss with a lifetime's worth of defining right and wrong. His world view is based on honesty and integrity, and doesn't allow for sixteen year old card cheats. Charley Waite (Kevin Costner) is of similar stripe, but he shows it more liberally, by booting his card cheat hired hand into the river.Those who complain that the early scenes move too slowly overlook the profundity of the set up. A man doesn't leave his friends behind or take the easy way out. He can't abide a murdering dog who would murder his dog. Backed into a corner and forced to take a stand, one begins to understand that there are ""things that gnaw at a man worse than dyin"".There's a defining scene for Costner's character as the men lie under the night time prairie skies. Charley's midnight confession about his murderous past takes on added dimension as the camera slowly pulls away to reveal his cartridge belt. It adds perspective to the final showdown; Charley's role as strategist has him lay out the confrontation right up to the part where they might get killed. And then the bullets fly. But it's justice, not revenge, that tempers this gunfight, even when Boss has Baxter at his mercy he defers to his own advice to Charley earlier. Justice, not revenge.Both as a an actor and director, Kevin Costner seems to be a lightning rod for his projects. ""Dances With Wolves"", and ""Field of Dreams"" have been equally applauded and derided by movie goers over the years, and ""Open Range"" follows that pattern. For my part, I found it to be a masterful story transcending it's Western genre formula, finding poignancy in it's tale of men willing to focus on what's right, not who's right.",Open Range
5,jboothmillard,Open Range,6,28 November 2015,"I first heard about this film when leading star, producer and director Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves, Wyatt Earp, Waterworld, The Postman) when he appeared with Little Ant & Dec on Saturday Night Takeaway, I had been interested in seeing it for years, I'm glad I finally watched when I did. Basically in the year 1882, in the Old West, open range cattleman Bluebonnet ""Boss"" Spearman (Robert Duvall) and his hired hands, former Civil War soldier Charley Waite (Kevin Costner), gentle, boy-like cook Mose Harrison (Abraham Benrubi) and 16-year-old Spanish kid Button (Diego Luna) are driving a herd cross country. The cowboys head into the town of Harmonville for supplies, there they are encountered by corrupt Sheriff Poole (James Russo) and kingpin rancher Denton Baxter (Sir Michael Gambon), who through fear, tyranny and violence govern the territory. Boss and Charley find themselves dangerously entangled into an inevitable showdown, after Mose is arrested for starting a fight and is beaten in jail. Mose is released and taken to Doc Barlow (Dean McDermott), there the men also meet the doctor's sister Sue (Annette Bening), Charley is immediately attracted to her, and after, initially assuming she was the doctor's wife, they start a romance. With the help of friendly livery stable owner Percy (Michael Jeter) the open rangers are ready to fight for the freedom and values of a lifestyle that is all too quickly vanishing, before this Poole is locked in his own jail cell, along with his deputies. Gunman Butler (Kim Coates), who shot Buttons and killed Mose, is shot dead, and after an intense firefight erupting in the streets Baxter is mortally wounded and dies, in the end Boss and Charley, with Sue, decide to give up the cattle business and settle in the town. This does not have the same epic scope as masterpiece Dances with Wolves, but Costner does a fine job directing, and acting, Duvall is great being restrained but dignified, and Gambon gets his time being nasty, this is one of those cowboy movies with only a little action and more dialogue, but it does work well as a character relationship story, and it does have beautifully scenery throughout, an interesting and worthwhile western. Good!",Open Range
6,ccthemovieman-1,4 Reasons Why I Love This Film,10,24 January 2006,"They don't westerns that much anymore, at least on the big screen. People in the Baby Boomer generation grew up with them on television. Western films were big at the box office in several decades, too.Well, at least Kevin Costner must have a heart for the genre as he been involved with several major western productions in the last 15 years, this the latest. The best thing I can say about this film right out front is that it may be the best western I've ever watched. I can't give it higher praise than that! Since I've seen so many, for so long, it's especially high praise.I make this bold statement because of the following: 1 - Fantastic scenery and beautiful cinematography. If it looks spectacular on my 24-inch flat-screen, I can't imagine how awesome it would be a big plasma set.2 - Characters you really care about, led by three actors who almost always give solid performances: Robert Duvall (the best in here), Costner and Annette Bening. Duvall, by the way, gives one of the best short ""speeches"" I've ever witnessed in a movie. It was nice to see Bening actually play a wholesome woman for a change. The two men who are out on the range with Duvall and Costner also were excellent.3 - Just the right amount of action. When the action does occur, such as gunfire, the sound is incredible. This might be one of the best movies, audibly-speaking, I've ever heard, which is another reason for ranking it Number One. There are no lulls but not a ton of action, either.4 - Just the right amount of romance. It doesn't get sappy, it doesn't overshadow the basic story, but it adds a nice, soft touch to what could be a very rough and unpleasant tale. And, in a different twist, it's the romance, not the usual climactic gun battle, that ends this film.I can't say enough about this movie except that I'm sorry more westerns like it aren't made today.",Open Range
7,rmax304823,Shootout at Harmonville!,6,14 May 2011,"It's a reasonably well-done, naturalistic Western about four men (including Boss Duvall and chief hand Costner) herding cattle to the free range of Montana. Once they get there they find the land that is legally open to them is in the possession of the evil cattle baron (Gabon) and his henchmen. The evil guys are really evil in this one. They have no sense of humor at all, and not one of them has a wife or even a pet dog. They kill one of the four men and horribly wound another. Duvall and Costner object to this, and it leads to a final epic shoot out in the streets of Harmonville. Costner gets the requisite girl, Bening.When I said the film was naturalistic, I didn't mean that good and evil were so easily separable in real life, but that these cowboys live in the mud so much that they're practically part of it. It rains often, floods sometimes, and is never dry and dusty, never picturesque. Seeing these four cow punchers trying to dislodge a wagon that has sunk into the pasty sludge up to its axles is enough to leave any fan of the Wild West disillusioned.The shoot out, sprawling though it is, is nicely handled. Everything that's happened before has led up to it. The participants sneak around, shooting through doors and from windows, while the terrified residents stand on a distant hillside and watch. The shooters even have to pause from time to time to reload their weapons, always a sign of true naturalism.I'm not sure that the movie will satisfy the fourteen-year-olds in the audience. There are extended pauses while people talk about things like cattle, love, principles, horses, and what their real names are. There is considerable pain but little blood. And there is not an Uzi or a Glock in sight among the weapons.It was directed with competence by Costner, only I wish he hadn't opted to drop into the cliché of slow motion during the final lethal encounter between Duvall and Gabon. And it would have been refreshing if Costner had turned out to be something other than a gunfighter trying to hang up his pistols and live an honest peaceable life, though nothing much is made of this cliché either.Seeing Duvall and Costner all dirty and sweaty -- well, you know, if I were to have lived in those times and under those circumstances, I'd have preferred running a General Mercantile Store, whatever that is. The hell with all those bright stars under the prairie skies.",Open Range
8,Tweekums,An impressive recent but traditional western,8,22 July 2019,"This western is set in 1882 in Montana; the era of the open range where cattle could graze freely is coming to an end as wealthy ranchers take over. ""Boss"" Spearman along with his friend Charley Waite are two open range cattlemen who are driving their herd across the range with the help of Moses and Button. When Moses fails to return from a nearby town Boss and Charley investigate and find he has been arrested and badly beaten by the marshal, who is in the pay of local cattle baron, Denton Baxter. After Moses is treated by the local doctor they return to the herd. The next night Baxter's men ride close by; Boss and Charley ride to confront them but when they return Moses is dead and Button is seriously injured. They will have to return to town to seek medical help... confrontation with Baxter and his men is inevitable.For a while in the late twentieth century it looked as though the western genre was on its way out; having seen several made in the twenty first century I suspect the genre will survive as long as people watch films. They may be mostly set in a specific time and place but the themes never grow old. 'Open Range' is a fine addition to the genre. The theme of people holding out against those who are violently trying to stop their way of life might not be new but it is hard for any viewer not to sympathise with our protagonists. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner are great as 'Boss' and Charley; Michael Gambon is delightfully menacing as Baxter and Annette Bening impresses as Sue Barlow, potential romantic interest. Some may feel it is slow at times but I felt this gave the viewer time to get to know the characters and for the tension to rise before the final, thrilling confrontation. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to any fans of the western genre.",Open Range
9,ma-cortes,Excellent western film magnificently performed and directed by Kevin Costner,7,16 July 2004,"¨Open Range¨ is a classic western. It's spectacular and riveting. The movie centers about facing off between settlers and cattlemen.In the cowboys group we find an ex gunslinger(Kevin Costner), an old man (Robert Duvall) and a younger (Diego Luna). They'll have to fight against a landowner (Michael Gambon), a corrupt sheriff( James Russo), an assassin (Kim Coates), among others . Meanwhile the ex-gunfighter will fall in love with a spinster (Annette Bening).The final showdown between the contenders is breathtaking, gunfight is likeness to ""O.K. Corral duel¨.The film is awesome , sets are extraordinaries and landscapes are wonderful.The movie blends action, violence, a love story ,drama ,shootouts and is a fascinating film.Direction by Kevin Costner is of first rate as ¨dancing with wolves¨. Cinematography by Michael Muro is glimmer and Michael Kamen's musical score is atmospheric. Runtime film is overlong however is neither tiring , nor boring but entertaining.Rating: 7'5 /10 above average. Well worth watching.",Open Range
10,michaelRokeefe,Bitter revenge. Wide open.,8,21 March 2004,"Some won't let a man do a little bit wrong. Kevin Costner directs and stars in this action packed sagebrush tale of the cowboy way. Charlie Waite(Costner) joins up with Boss Spearman(Robert Duvall), Mose(Abraham Benrubi) and young ""Button""(Diego Luna)driving cattle across what is destined to become the last of the open range. Each man is trying to escape his own past in the freedom of riding the range.Mose makes a trip to a frontier town for supplies and the peaceful life becomes a trip to a dusty Hell full of gun smoke and flying lead. The town is being ran by a tyrant of a rich rancher(Michael Gambon) who is ruling the town as well as the law. Mose is about beaten to death just for the fact he is part of the open range crew. After his death Charlie and Boss Spearman are forced by their own conscience to avenge the death and beatings of their partners. The gun fighting is worth the price of admission. Just the sound of the shots seem so different from any other western in your memory. Impressive is the realism of the victims shot down in revenge. Soon both Charlie and Boss face the urgent assessment of changing their way of life.Costner is back...very notably directing and filming. As well as sharing the spotlight with veteran actor Duvall who is also damn near flawless. Also in the cast are: Annette Bening, Dean McDermott and Michael Jeter who possibly turns in the most memorable role of his lifetime. With a running time of almost two and a half hours it is easily noticed that the first half sets up the last half and action part of the movie. This film will be remembered for long time. It's that good!",Open Range
11,hitchcockthelegend,I ain't going to meet my maker without knowing your real name.,9,4 March 2008,"It's purely my own opinion of course, but Open Range is a modern day genre classic that stands up to repeat viewings. It's not a flawless Western the Western historians will tell you, and some will pick out the hats or the impact of a rifle to mark the film down, but really we should be embracing a genre piece in the modern age that is clearly being directed with love and respect by the director.It's story is of course a simply structured tale of the underdog rising up against the fat cats who want it all in the name of tyranny. But on its side is the fact that its characters are so interestingly engaging. Within a short time frame I feel that Kevin Costner manages to put us in the saddle with the main protagonists, we understand these guys without actually knowing them, and that is quite an achievement I feel. The film does flesh them out to enhance the film without boring the pants off the viewer, and it's only come the final reel that you realise you have been engaged in a very human and honest Western film.Most of the cast do great here, both Robert Duvall & Kevin Costner bounce of each other with moody and world wise aplomb as the two main leads, while in the sole female role of note, Annette Bening is gusto beautiful personified. Sadly it's hard for me to write that Michael Gambon as the villain of the piece is not only underused, but also something of a let down. Such an accomplished actor should know better than to overdo it in the context of this particular story. Yes we get the need for villainy, but gurning and frothing doesn't quite make the grade here. It's a little surprising that director Costner didn't utilise Gambon more wisely.Still, I say the film is a wondrous experience because it is, a film to have you cheering and booing in equal measure, and in the main the work on it is top dollar. Some of the shots are gorgeous, the framing that Costner uses in close ups is excellent, and the final reel shoot-out ranks as one of the best in Western genre history. So all in all it's a modern day genre piece that actually sits nicely with the best from the golden era. 9/10",Open Range
12,Theo Robertson,One Of Costner's Best Films,7,26 September 2005,"It's probably well known that Kevin Costner once had Republican party sympathies , something that wasn't to fashionable in the Hollywood of the late 80s/early 90s . What might not be so well known is that he switched his allegiance to the environmentalists / greens at the turn of the millennium . This perhaps isn't so surprising because if you watch a film either directed by or starring Costner there always seems to be a running theme of the characters existing in a wilderness away from civilisation such as DANCES WITH WOLVES , PRINCE OF THIEVES and WATERWORLD alongside the philosophy that guns don't kill people , people kill people , or to be more accurate bad people kill people then good people kill bad people as seen in THE UNTOUCHABLES and THE POSTMAN with PRINCE OF THIEVES and WATERWORLD also coming into this category also OPEN RANGE continues this Costner philosophy as we're shown men or horseback against a breath taking panorama of the untouched American wilderness . You can't help thinking that Costner would like nothing better to see the end of industrialisation and when landscapes are this remote and beautiful who can blame him . The story itself may be rather old fashioned almost in the vein of John Wayne but that doesn't stop it from being the best film with Kevin Costner for a very long time . The cinematography helps of course but the director's best idea was to employ Robert Duvall as co-lead Boss Spearman . Duvall of course is the type of very rare actor who can make a shopping list come alive and Michael Gambon is memorable as bad guy Denton Baxter Some people might be put off by the fact that it stars and was directed by Costner and therefore expected a three and a half hour epic about nothing in particular . I also had these reservations but was glad I saw this . Duvall's performance and the bloody shoot out at the end had a lot to do with my positive opinion",Open Range
13,Hey_Sweden,"A top notch Western, well made and well acted.",8,16 June 2020,"Co-star / director Kevin Costner has certainly done his part in keeping the traditional Western alive with this fine film. It's a heartfelt, poignant picture (based on a novel by Lauran Paine) in which men known as ""free grazers"" make their own way and live off the land. Ranchers such as the evil jerk Denton Baxter (played by the great Irish actor Michael Gambon) represent progress, and it's people like them who have nothing but contempt for old-style cowboys like Charley Waite (Costner) and his boss / pal (Robert Duvall). It's Baxter that sets the story in motion by mobilizing his hired thugs to intimidate Waite & Boss & their young friends (Abraham Benrubi, Diego Luna) and force them to make tracks. By going too far, he motivates Waite & Boss to try to obtain some frontier justice.Filmed in the beautiful Canadian countryside, ""Open Range"" is fairly epic in scale. It clocks in at two hours and 19 minutes, but never feels like it's going on too long. It has nothing but reverence for traditional Western settings, and it looks just gorgeous. Adding some resonance is the potential for romance between Waite and Sue Barlow (Annette Bening), the doctors' nurse in the small town nearby. While the story is predictable in the sense that it leads to an outburst of gun violence, Costner raises the action to an almost operatic level. (The squeamish should be aware that things DO get fairly bloody.) The characters are actually fleshed out quite nicely, and are all engaging in one way or another: the heroes are effectively principled types, and the bad guys are all suitably loathsome.The acting is superb all the way down the line. Bening is luminous, Costner gives one of his best film performances (as a man with a very violent past), Benrubi and Luna are appealing, and Gambon, James Russo, and the great screen heavy Kim Coates are among those playing classic Western villains. The delightful character actor Michael Jeter, in one of his last roles, is the grizzled stable proprietor. As could be expected, Western veteran Duvall is the standout, showing a quiet strength throughout.Among this films' highlights are an atmospheric rainstorm in which Waite rescues a dog, and the sight of the townsfolk casting aside any prejudices they might have had to give Waite & Boss a hand during the climactic shootout.Screenplay by co-executive producer Craig Storper.Eight out of 10.",Open Range
14,LeonLouisRicci,The Director's Best Effort,8,12 April 2013,"Maybe a bit too long, this authenticity piece is Costner's best Directorial effort. That's not saying much, but here it is. There is some tendency here to plod along with vanity scenes and extended expositions that might have been better with some restraint, but most of it can be overlooked because of some better realizations.With the help of the natural Acting and Personality of his Co-Star the Film solidifies itself in the genre as a well done modern incarnation of the Western. As an Actor Kevin Costner could never and has never carried a Movie. Here it is the period Setting and Action, the fine supporting Players and the Cinematography that makes this work.After the showdown there is more needless, indulgent padding, and story extension that showed up earlier, but overall this at the very least might help freshen up the stench that was left over from Dances With Wolves (1990). For that it was all worth it.",Open Range
15,Boba_Fett1138,A 'modern' western made great by its performances.,8,27 March 2005,"""Open Range"" is a slow western with little to no story. Yet the movie knows how to keep your attention thanks to the wonderful performances by the cast.Robert Duvall really is wonderful and even for the most hardened Kevin Costner hater this movie is watchable. Costner pulls of surprisingly well and is believable in his role. Michael Gambon is the perfect rotten villain and Diego Luna truly is a name for the future. The young Mexican actor already was in big movies like ""Frida"", ""The Terminal"" and the leading man in ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights"". Sad thing is that the deceased Michael Jeter makes his last movie appearance in this movie. He was a great actor that will be truly missed.Visually this is a beautiful movie and it has a great atmosphere that also in a way is original compared to other western movies. Some of the cinematography however is 'pointless' (when you've see the movie, you know what I mean, I hope.). James Muro is a beginning cinematographer that normally works as camera and/or steadicam operator on big Hollywood hits. A name to look out for in the future? Perhaps...Michael Kamen delivers a worthy, one of his last musical scores.The stereotypical shootout at the ending was truly wow! It's easily one of the best movie shootouts I've seen in the last couple of years. It also might very well be the most realistic western shootout ever made. The guns, the sounds, the blood! Truly impressive and memorable.The movie has all the typical western clichés present but the way it all is handled is truly original and professional and that all combined with the acting is what makes ""Open Range"" a very good and memorable 'modern' western.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Open Range
16,view_and_review,Alert the media.... I'm starting to like Westerns,10,29 January 2007,"I am not a Western buff nor a person who is particularly fond of Westerns, or so I thought. What I'm finding out more and more is that I actually LIKE Westerns. I have now seen ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Tombstone"", ""Unforgiven"", and now ""Open Range"", and I LOVED each of these movies.Firstly, the acting in ""Open Range"" was superb. Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall were excellent. They play two free range cattle owners, Charley Waite and Boss Spearman, just trying to cross the Western Plains without incident. Their relationship is all male, meaning that they don't talk to each other much and they keep things nice and simple between them.Secondly, the story was great. The story was simple yet effective. It boiled down to a tale of revenge but with a ""fight the power"" aspect to it. Mixed in there was a bit of a love story between Charley and Sue Barlow (Annette Benning). It wasn't your traditional Hollywood romance, this was romance cowboy style. Charley was a cowboy and that meant being stoic, expressionless, and curt. But through that you could see that he had feelings for Sue Barlow.Finally, there was a fantastic showdown. The entire movie was preparing you for a good ole western showdown, and it didn't disappoint. It was one of the best gunslinger sequences I've ever seen on film (not that I've seen many or that I've seen any in real life). Charley was an ex-gunslinger, and it all came back when it was time to go to blows.Cumulatively this was an excellent film. Everything came together so nicely. The acting, the story, the directing, the action sequences, etc. I think if any of these parts is sub-par then the whole movie goes down with it. This movie was just so well done you had to love it.",Open Range
17,neil-476,Excellent western,9,2 March 2010,"Open Range is a fine western directed by Kevin Costner, starring Costner and Robert Duvall as a trail hand and trail boss, a relationship with strong elements of father and son.The story is very much a traditional western - good and bad are drawn clearly, particularly wicked rancher Michael Gambon who controls the local town with a gaggle of hired guns. Costner brings modern sensibilities to the story without compromising those traditional values: despite their flaws (and Costner's character turns out to have some skeletons in his cupboard), the two main characters remain resolutely heroic in nature.There is an unusual love story woven in, with Costner and the doctor's sister (Annette Bening, superb) finding love late in life. All the cast deliver excellent performances.The action sequences are well-staged and credible.And it is a beautiful looking western - Costner appears to have spent at least as much effort in making sure that every frame is gorgeous to look at as he has in telling his story.Highly recommended.",Open Range
18,HotToastyRag,Great modern western,7,21 July 2017,"I wasn't really sure if I was going to like this movie, mainly because I didn't know what it was going to be. It started out as a slow, rancher movie, but then it became a western rivalry revenge movie, and then a romance showed up! Turns out, Open Range is a lot like its title. It's a mixture of different western elements, and the hodgepodge totally works.Kevin Costner also directed this one, and he gives the same slow, steady hand to this movie as he gave to Dances With Wolves. The beautiful open country is captured with a realistic touch, and the small western town Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall travel to looks very authentic. Nothing is painted out to be more than it is, a theme in the filming as well as the storyline. Revenge is revenge, murder is murder, and love is love.Even if you're not really a fan of Annette Benning—it's okay, I'm not, either—she won't ruin the movie for you. Her character is written well, and even though her acting chops are better shown off in American Beauty, she's easy to root for here. I liked seeing Michael Gambon playing an unmistakable bad guy. I've never found him likable, anyway, so being able to root against him guilt-free for a change was very fun. And his Irish accent was really good! So, if you like westerns, shoot-outs, Kevin Costner, or Robert Duvall, watch Open Range during the next dusty fall afternoon.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, there's one scene in this movie that won't be your friend. Kevin Costner has a nightmare, and the camera gets a little fuzzy so it might make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Open Range
19,Wuchakk,Now THIS is a Western,8,14 March 2021,"Four cowboys & their cattle are traveling through the Hammondville, Montana, region in 1882 when they discover that the leaders of the town don't like free grazers. It escalates into a life or death situation. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner play the two main cowboys while Annette Bening appears as a doctor and Michael Gambon a land baron.""Open Range"" (2003) automatically brings to mind ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) because they're the only two Westerns Costner has both starred in and directed. While not quite as good, this one is still a great modern Western and nigh epic. The theme revolves around how noble Westerners like the protagonists don't seek violence, but it's sometimes necessary to make a stand for justice, even if the local law is bought and corrupt.I like the way the movie confidently takes its time and fleshes out the characters with insightful bits here and there. It feels like the way it was in the Old West and the characters speak the way you know they spoke back then. The mood is increasingly tense, but most of the action is saved for the last act when everything explodes, reminiscent of the real-life gunfight at the O.K. Corral, just longer. As such, viewers who need quick-editing and constant thrills to be entertained will likely find it boring. Mature-minded viewers, however, will appreciate the realism and the slowly developed characters, as well as the well-done romance angle.The big rancher is pompous because his arrogance has built up over the course of decades and he thinks he owns the town. But does he? In his own mind he's King Sheet because he's gotten away with injustice due to his power and influence. But what happens when noble citizens say ""Enough""?While ""Open Range"" deals with dark, challenging things, it has a warm, redeemable heart, unlike ""Unforgiven"" (1992), which wallows in ugliness (although it's still a worthy Western, as long as you can stomach the ugliness).The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot at Stoney Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada.GRADE: A-",Open Range
20,deloudelouvain,Nice job Costner,7,16 February 2015,"Well I just finished watching Open Range and I have to say I am pleased that they still can make good westerns. It's nice that this genre comes back a little bit. I always liked westerns because most of the time the scenery and nature shots are good. In this movie the scenery is spectacular. Kevin Costner did a good job with this one, as director and as actor. To me Robert Duvall gave the best performance with his role. I always liked this actor a lot, he always delivers. It was not the typical shoot 'em all down western, in fact there is only one gunfight in the movie, but the storyline was very good. It's sure a good movie to watch if you like this genre.",Open Range
21,whpratt1,Realistic Western,7,27 June 2006,"The actors made this Western very realistic in the situations that people faced trying to move cattle from one place to another without the railroad. There was always the mayor of small towns who had power among the local people and they hated cattlemen who grazed their stock on their property. This is a story about a group of men who just wanted to travel with their animals from point A to B and ran into all kinds of horrible problems. Robert Duvall, (Boss Spearman) was a very wise cattleman who was very calm about situations that would arise on a daily basis. Kevin Costner,(Charley Waite) gave a great supporting role and was the sidekick to Boss. Annette Bening,(Sue Barlow) plays the role of a doctor's assistant and has a charming way about her that makes Boss very comfortable when he is around her. Sue even gets out her mother's china and serves these men tea. This is in many ways a different Western because the actors put realism into their characters.",Open Range

You'll still see guns fired without reloading, men knocked ten feet by a bullet, a woman making nice with a wounded man as though his wound didn't exist, etc. Nice stuff if you're into big sky scenics, bigger than life heroics, and the ""Unforgiven"" approach to western film making.

23,MovieAddict2016,Kevin Costner sticks to his guns.,8,26 September 2005,"I have more respect for Costner after having seen this. I've never really liked him very much as an actor - sometimes I criticize him too heavily just for fun, but once in a while he'll surprise me and deliver a good performance. This is one of them.What's even better, though, is how Costner doesn't cater to the teen audience with this film. It's an uncompromising, intransigent film. Costner spends two and a half hours chronicling the story and it's very much character-driven, bringing to mind ""Classics"" of the genre such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in terms of operatic appeal.On the commentary he says some critics and audience members criticized the film because it was too slow. ""Carts really got stuck in mud,"" he says, referring to the five minute scene where his character tries to get his horse to pull the wheels out of the wet ground. ""This stuff really happened."" That's kind of daring given the fact that teenagers today have five-second attention spans...if that.He even packs on the R-rating for good measure. Great stuff.Robert Duvall stars as Boss along with Costner as Charlie Waite, Abraham Benrubi as a cook, and a mangy dog as The Dog.Basically this 16-year-old kid gets shot and beaten by a local rancher's men. They get thrown in jail for confronting the guys and the corrupt town sheriff (James Russo - bringing to mind Gene Hackman from ""Unforgiven"") and, most importantly, the rancher himself (Michael Gambon).The rancher practically owns the town so when the men are released from jail they decide to go on a revenge spree by raiding the town and killing the rancher. (Except it takes them about two hours to decide upon this course of action.) I know my plot summary's a bit brisk and bitter but I'll be honest...I really enjoyed this movie. I loved how slow it is - it's not purposelessly slow but rather takes its time to focus on the characters, and as such their final decision seems more real and intriguing, rather than becoming another standard deus ex machina/cheap ending where they all blow each other to smithereens. The violence is handled well, too, and the final shoot-out is surprisingly tasteful. (The R-rating is something of a shock because Costner implies violence rather than exploits.) The performances are all on-key and Duvall and Costner both come across as normal everyday ranchers who have experienced a lot in life.This is a very good film and a testament to the fact that Kevin Costner - now fatter, balder, and less egotistical - makes better movies when he's not high on his own self-esteem. I see a new side to his artistic vision with this and I hope he continues to express his individualism in this way, rather than resorting to acting in films like ""Waterworld.""",Open Range

I really enjoy western films, with it's touch of outlaws, survival and people trying to stand their ground in a lawless land. And it does a pretty fine job of integrating those elements. For viewers that can't stand long drawn out simple plot about how some cowboys did their jobs to get by. This film might not be for you. But if you like traditional western, that seems to be out of a dry and yet traditional novel. This is actually a pretty good watch. But I can also see how people that aren't fans of westerns can get really bored with this. What kept me focused was the partnership between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall.

26,lost-in-limbo,More than just a bang.,8,16 November 2009,"This one had me thinking of Clint Eastwood's highly regarded western ''Unforgiven (1992)'' with its powerful storytelling and deeply portrayed character arcs. Although in the end it's almost as great as Eastwood's western, but not entirely there. Still I would definitely have it down as my favourite Kevin Costner film. ''Open Range'' is a steady, but sprawling western epic that's beautifully framed with richly detailed backdrops, meaningfully written with a mythical edge seeping in and confidently performed with humanely multifaceted characters. Kevin Costner, Robert Duvall, Annette Bening and Michael Gambon are magnificent in their roles. Duvall (who seems to feel right at home with the material) and Costner working together was boldly engaging with an acute script that truly brought across a genuine sense of trust, openness and the honour to see things through to the end. No matter what it costs. Justice over corruption, be it death to see it done. Costner's remarkably accomplished direction features an accommodatingly earthy style, building upon the characters and circumstances to draw you in, than letting it simply slide in and out of the gung-ho violence. This could probably be attributed to the complexity facing Costner's character. However the final gunfight is downright brutal, but dynamically exciting and stirringly staged. While it's a long movie, it sure doesn't feel it. Notably grand entertainment on the wild frontier.",Open Range
27,Cineanalyst,Details of the West,7,14 February 2004,"Filmed upon the lovely Albertan landscape, Robert Duvall plays Boss and Kevin Costner plays Charley--two open-range cowboys. They run into trouble with Harmonville's Sheriff (played by James Russo) and local rancher (played by Michael Gambon), who hate ""free grazers"". It all leads to a climactic shootout. Additionally, there's some romance in between.Boss is the wiser of the two cowboys. He provides the old-fashioned, atypical Western values to defend in the rising conflict. Charley is the gunslinger fighting against his shady past. Duvall, once again, embodies his character; he's convincing. But, as the climax nears, Boss gives way to Charley and his warrior skills to guide them. Boss says at one point, ""Nobody works for anybody here, Charley."" Indicating, now that their lives are at great risk, Boss's philosophizing leadership on the frontier is no longer supreme.Besides the scenery, the relationship of the two main characters and the shootout finale, the details make this a quality Western. Charley trying to dig and push a wagon wheel out of a hole after a rainstorm, the townsfolk running to the hills before the showdown and the battle cleanup afterwards--these are the sort of details Costner commendably gives attention to. Yet, Costner again makes obvious mistakes in directing. All three of his films are in need of editing (including ""The Postman"" in its entirety); the film goes on for too long after the shootout. Moreover, the romance doesn't fit with the main plot. Although Annette Bening and Costner do well to make it work within itself, the subplot interrupts the flow of the rest of the movie.",Open Range

The build up though has a number of elements of a martial arts subplot that audiences have seen in many Asian films.This epic, big production, full screen version however does provide a decent, above average western drama with a tinge of romance (done with particular effectiveness by Annette Bening and Kevin Costner (all done with expressive, implicit acting).

KC turned down the role of Bill in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 to do this movie, and I for one am glad he did. I'm also glad Robert Duvall took the role (within 24 hours of reading the script) as he was the only actor that Kevin Costner wanted for the role of Boss Spearman. He said if Duvall had turned down the part, he might not have made the movie at all. And that would have been a travesty. I can't praise the cast highly enough especially the two leads. Robert Duvall is perfect and KC fits this movie like a glove. It's beautifully shot and has a great score too. I'm not sure how many here will have seen it, but I love it!! At a little over two hours, this is the shortest of any movie KC has directed.

30,sol-,Justice and vengeance... them are different things,7,19 May 2017,"Targeted by a corrupt lawman who detests ""free grazers"", an elderly open range cattleman decides to take action - a decision that forces his younger partner to reluctantly rekindle his violent past - in this Old West tale directed by Kevin Costner. Clocking in at over two hours long, the film drags on occasion (particularly in the scenes with love interest Annette Bening), but for the most part, the pacing is spot-on with much time dedicated to the leisurely lifestyle that cattleman Robert Duvall and his three underlings lead until their peace is shattered by the anti-free grazer attitude of a town they cross. The film additionally benefits from a rousing Michael Kamen score and Costner's directing eye when it comes to untouched natural landscapes; his performance here might not rate among his best, but it is hard to deny how good-looking a film he has crafted. What truly elevates 'Open Range' above other revenge tales though is Duvall's firm moral stance and Costner's quivering one as the man with the violent past; ""justice and vengeance ... them are different things"" as Duvall reminds Costner at a key point. In fact, were it not the Bening love interest subplot, this would rate as an extremely tight and tense filmic experience. That said, Bening does serve some purpose as she helps Costner's character to remember how human he is despite his checkered violent past.",Open Range

33,howard.schumann,Entertains but does not break any new ground,7,29 March 2004,"Kevin Costner's Open Range is an old-fashioned Western that does not break any new ground but does provide solid entertainment with some fine performances, especially by Robert Duvall and Annette Benning. The film is replete with all the appropriate attributes of the genre: a wealthy rancher that has the town terrorized, the corrupt lawmen who do his bidding, the kid who lost his parents, and the good guys who only kill because they have to. Based on a novel by Lauran Pain and a screenplay by Craig Storper, the film works when Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) is the focus, but stumbles toward the end when his partner Charlie Waite (Kevin Costner) takes center stage. Costner, whose career has been in free fall since Dances With Wolves, turns in a workmanlike performance but his air of weighty solemnity undermines the film's energy, especially in the love affair between Charlie and the doctor's sister Sue Barlow (Annette Benning).Set in Montana in the American West in 1882, Boss belongs to a dying breed of cowboys whose way of life is simple, yet authentic. He moves with his herd through the open West, allowing his cattle to feed wherever his travels take them, sometimes on land claimed by big business ranchers. His traveling group includes Charlie whose been riding with him for ten years, the heavy-set Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and a sixteen-year old boy they call Button (Diego Luna). After Mose does not return from an errand, Boss and Charlie ride into the town of Harmonville and find nothing but trouble. Mose is in jail and they are threatened by the town marshal (James Russo) and a menacing Irish-American landowner named Baxter (Michael Gambon) who actively dislikes free-grazers, though we never find out exactly why.
After freeing Mose, their camp is attacked by thugs hired by Baxter. Mose is killed and young Button is seriously wounded. Boss and Charlie bring Button to the doctor in town and vow to exact revenge and, in the process, to clean up the town from Baxter's pernicious influence. Both Boss and Charlie hint of troubled pasts and, as in Unforgiven, the film is a paean to their redemption and the end of an era. Charlie is the silent, sensitive type who does not show much emotion or even crack a smile for the full length of the film. Boss exudes kindness as expressed in his concern for his wounded men. He says that an excessive amount of violence puts them on the same level as the Baxter boys and he would take the chance of future harm rather than kill someone unnecessarily. His fight is over principle. ""Cows is one thing,"" he says, ""but one man telling another man where he can go in this country is something else."" After the good guys who moralize about killing do their killing anyway in a well-executed showdown, Open Range neatly ties up all its loose ends and its upbeat message leaves us with little ambiguity to ponder. Boss' character and values lift the film out of mediocrity but its undue length and persistent grimness test our patience. Open Range has some nice moments that pay tribute to the rugged individualism of the prairie but, sadly, it also glorifies its eye-for-an-eye vigilantism that dares to call itself justice.",Open Range

36,bsmith5552,The Western is Alive and Well,9,27 January 2004,"""Open Range"" is the first good western to come along since Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" (1992). It is also one of Kevin Costner's better films of late, comparable to his earlier ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990). Costner who served as producer/director as well as star gives us a well paced beautifully photographed ""wide open spaces"", ""final showdown"" type western, the likes of which you hardly ever see nowadays. The story centers on a group of ""free grazers"", a term describing cattlemen who had no home base but roamed the open ranges grazing their cattle where ever they happened to be. The group is led by Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) a grizzled old cattleman, and includes Charlie Waite (Costner) a mysterious drifter who has been with him for 10 years, Mose (Abraham Benrubi) a gentle giant of a man and the teen aged Button (Diego Luna) whom Boss has taken under his wing. All is going along well until Boss sends Mose into town for supplies and he fails to return. Boss and Charlie ride into town to find their friend and discover him in jail having been badly beaten. The boys then encounter the powerful local rancher Baxter (Michael Gambon) who orders them to move on, that this is no place for Free Grazers. The boys manage to obtain Mose's freedom and take him to the town doctor (Dean McDermott) for repairs. There Charlie meets Sue Barlow (Annette Bening) whom believes to be the doctor's wife. Though he is attracted to her, he keeps his distance. Back at the camp Boss and Charlie discover some of Baxter's men watching their camp and herd. While they go out at night to drive the intruders away, other Baxter men attack the camp and kill Mose and seriously wound Button. Boss and Charlie take Button back to the doctor's house and plan their revenge on Baxter and his men. Charlie also discovers that Sue is in fact the doctor's sister and begins to show his feelings for her. The middle part of the movie deals with Boss and Charlie's preparations for the ultimate final showdown. They are befriended by the livery stable owner, Percy (Michael Jeter) who decides to help them. The shootout occupies the final part of the film. It is a well choreographed sequence with plenty of blood and guts. It puts one in mind of the various versions of the Gunfight at OK Corral. Unfortunately Costner chose to tack on a typical ""happily ever after"" Hollywood ending which I thought was a bit of a letdown. Duvall and Costner are great in the leads and the deglamourized Bening nonetheless still makes a beautiful heroine. To his credit, Costner doesn't try to hide the fact that Charlie and Sue are not as young as they used to be. One complaint I have is the fact that we really don't know or see much of the Baxter character and that of his chief gunman until the finale. I would have liked to have known what was driving Baxter. Minor criticisms aside, this is an excellent movie which I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope that Costner is motivated to make more westerns.",Open Range
37,dfranzen70,All the pretty people. . .,8,7 March 2004,"Open Range doesn't have the grandeur of Dances with Wolves, but it's still a fine flick. It's about four free-range cowboys who run afoul of a local landowner. There are plenty of cliches in the movie, but evening the odds a bit are a trio of outstanding performances by Costner (the antihero, as always), Duvall (his boss and eminent sage), and Bening (as the woman with whom Costner falls in love. There's a showdown with the bad guys in the middle of a muddy street, and even the saving of a lost puppy as it's about to be washed away by a flood.Costner was meant to play roles like this, roles in which the character doesn't say a whole lot and hides his emotions well; see Dances, or Field of Dreams, for example. The quiet-on-the-outside, conflicted-on-the-inside is his idiom, and here he pulls it off marvelously. And, unlike some actor-directors, Costner doesn't spend an inordinate amount of time with closeups of himself. A plus, to be sure.Bening is a strong counterweight to Costner here; she's the sister of the town doc (initially mistaken for his wife), and she proves to be every bit as commanding in her performance as her character needed to be. It's beautiful to see her and Costner's characters fall gradually in love (well, as gradually as a two-hour movie can get).Duvall is a real rock, too - and at past seventy, he often looks tougher than most men a third of his age.

Following in the tradition of Ford and Hawks,two alpha males set out for revenge after an evil rancher and a corrupt lawman in concert who rule a town by terror kill one colleague and leave another for dead.
Mr Costner makes wonderful use of the familiar frontier town location,bars that are merely drinking dens rather than glitter palaces with waistcoated piano players and girls with fancy garters,dirty muddy streets without drainage that flood after a storm leaving people unable to cross the street,livery stables that look as if they actually hold horses but - above all - a population of people anxious to put roots down and ""civilise"" the west but are in the thrall of 1880's ""Big Business"" in the form of the powerful rancher Mr M.Gambon,all hissing and threats with a good Amerirish accent.
The plot is familiar enough,but,as they say,there is many a good tune played on an old fiddle.
The battle itself is superbly choreographed(and I use the word advisedly ).
It is bloody,brutal,noisy and indiscriminate,much,I imagine,like the real thing would have been.
Eventually the townspeople turn on their oppressors and wholesale slaughter follows.They gleefully pursue one unarmed and fleeing gunman and shoot him down like a dog long after the main action is finished.
An interesting subtext on the subject of ""the first kill is the hardest"".
Mr Duval,Mr Costner and Miss Benning are exemplary,the cast as a whole has no weaknesses,the psycho killers look like psycho killers as they tend to do.

39,CubsandCulture,A welcomed return to form-a neo-classical Western blessed with a great cast,10,10 May 2021,The Western genre has gone through a wide ranging and nearly complete evolution. The classical Western of 30's-50's have all but died out. Usually when a Western is a hit today is it some form of a genre deconstruction or genre mash-up. Even Costner's prior entry within this genre-Dances with Wolves-is fundamentally revisionist and that film is a gentle rebuke of the classical form. That is not the case here. This film is so traditional and classical in its concerns that it could-with a mild editing to blunt the violence-been released in the 40's and it would fit in perfectly.That is the film's best feature. It is a compelling example of its genre; there is a comforting simplicity-nearly an elegance-to the film's storyline and characters. The film has a leisurely pace-it takes a long time to build up to the shootout but this leisure makes the final sequence all that more compelling. The story goes precisely where you expect it to go but with such an assured hand by Costner as director and the cast that the film fulfills your expectations completely.Now it is also true that the cast is really good. Costner is a very compelling Western hero; Duvall is a compelling curmudgeon. Together they a duo that is hard to forget. Luna is delightful and sexy as immature Button. Benning makes her character much more than what the script gives her. But in my mind Gambon-as the slimy Irish rancher-is the best performance of the film. He only has a couple of scenes but the character stays with you.The final shoot out is rightly praised as one of the best-technically and for realism- shoot out for all times. The sequences is very good but I think it is so effective because the rest of the film is so assured. The action is incredibly visceral because we have come to care about these characters. So yes the final sequence is a tremendous piece of crafted cinema but it is exciting and engaging because of its context. I wish more films like this were made.

For actor/director/producer Kevin Costner, it seems to have been a labour of love and one that has paid off handsomely. The characters are well fleshed out, it has plenty to appeal to adults (men and women) rather than being just a boys-with-guns film. The qualities of the main heroes are likeable - they value the trust, respect and confidence that is given them and realise the value of these things. Open Range is no high and mighty moraliser however; there are plenty true-to-genre one-liners, such as ""You're nothing!"" (grim-faced, cornered bad guy) - ""Maybe so,"" (good guy pointing a gun at him), ""but I'll still be breathing in another minute!""

They drive their herd of cattle from a vast prairie to another with their two young helpers: the giant Mose (Abraham Benrubi), a gentle fellow who mostly works as wagon driver and cook and Button (Diego Luna), a teenaged orphan eager to prove himself to his elders The plot is launched when the four free-range cowboys encounter the town boss, the merciless Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon), a menacing Irish immigrant who actively hates free-grazers, and wants their herd vanished from the territory one way or another To make his feelings known, Baxter and his henchmen severely injure the two young cowboysBoss treats the boy's wounds himself, and then takes him, with Charley, to the town's doctor where Sue Barlow (Annette Bening), the doctor's middle-aged sister, cares for him There, in their confusion and anger, the duo realize that they're now on their way for a high noon gun battle, not only for revenge, but to protect their way of life as wellCostner's character, Charlie Waite is an enigmatic, sensitive type who does not show much emotion He has been taking orders from Boss for a decade, but their coming confrontation with Baxter and his thugs begins to reshape their relationship Charlie has a troubled violent past of which he's not proud, but it's a past which will help him in the bloody fight to comeAs the story goes relentlessly toward the clash between Baxter's brutes and the two cattlemen, Sue unexpectedly catches Charley's eye She is a strong capable woman who discovers exactly what Charley is when she first meets him Charley was more than a little worried What if Sue sees his malicious side, it might scare her offDuvall is exceptional as usual He is strong and flexible He steals the show with a charismatic portrayal of a man who exudes kindness as expressed in his concern for the wounded young boy In one of the movie's few striking moments, Boss buys an expensive Swiss chocolate from the town's general store and then offers the storekeeper a piece of it when he finds that he has never tried it himself because he can't afford it Duvall handles this scene relaxed and with all the graciousness and warmth The film's cinematography is superb, due in part to the green, forested mountain slopes against the stunning snow-capped peaks, marked with occasional torrential thunderstorms",Open Range
43,yusufpiskin,One of the best modern westerns I've ever seen,8,28 March 2020,"Thematically this harks back to the westerns of the 40s and 50s and to the revised westerns directed by the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sam Peckinpah. There's no pretensions here this is simply a tale of frontier justice, right & wrong and love. It's arguably one of the finest westerns from the last 20 years and director Kevin Costner keeps the film rattling along and when it bursts into action it's gritty, brutal and exciting without falling in gratuitousness.
Robert Duvall stars as Boss Spearman, a small time cattle owner moving his small herd across country with his crew of Charlie (Costner), Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna). Their fortunes take a turn for the worst when when they come up against cattle baron Baxter (Michael Gambon) who runs the local town and covets Boss's cows. Outnumbered Boss is forced to fight for what is right and Charlie happens to have a gunfighting past.
This is just a great, almost humble film that deliberately sets out to be a classic western and succeeds. Annette Bening co stars and Duvall and Costner are a perfect pair. If you've not seen this then it's well worth checking out.",Open Range
44,Kdosda_Hegen,"Pretty good film, but very flawed.",8,13 March 2021,"This film starts full of gorgeous nature footage and stunning cinematography, the whole first act is just so calming and relaxing and beautiful, but then on the second act the film takes place in the town and it is quite dragged out. For the last act it has some awesome action scenes, very intense and violent.
The huge flaw with the film is the characters' moral system which is just plain flawed. So basically at first Boss and Charley both claim that they are going to kill everyone and that they both have done terrible deeds in their lives so they aren't afraid of more killings, but when they have a chance they just chain their enemies and leave them alive... It goes even worse, so instead of running away they decide to fight, so they wait until backup frees the chained ones and then the heroes fight them back killing a ton of them, but when one of the villains falls dows wounded yet still alive, Boss forces Charley to spare him, because of morality, but then himself goes and kills more men and even shoots the main villain to death even though the villain was wounded and would have bled to death but Boss said ""I ain't waiting."", so Boss shoots him a couple of times more to kill him, but then decides to leave him alive to die from wounds because his morality does not allow to kill him on spot...
It probably sounds complicated so I'll just say this in short - the villain was already wounded and would have bled to death but Boss shot him a couple of times more to kill him but did not finish him with last shot because of supposived morality...
Why chain villains and leave them alive if you're going to kill them later anyways? Why not run away and stay away from any killings like you were told? Why Why Why! Both Boss and Charley are extremely hypocritical with their moral system.",Open Range

While most people would agree ""Shane"" is better, that may because we saw it first, or it was made first. It would be interesting to hear people who saw this movie first compare it to Shane. That said, the movie involves interesting and believable characters in conflict in the old West. A baron tries to impose his will upon others, then Duvall and Costner try to change things for the better. The conflicts and characters are well defined and thought through. This becomes both a believable story and an exciting one. We have drama and action well intermingled, and the sequence of events is logical. Costner plays the ""Shane"" character, and he, as well as all the other actors, does a splendid job. Well worth watching.",Open Range
46,aharmas,brilliant western,9,24 August 2003,"Westerns don't always impress me, but this film has certainly reached levels rarely seen in this range.  We get full characters, in situations where people don't necessarily show off to entertain.  The plot flows naturally, and we listen to their conversations attentively because the characters feel and act like real people.  I loved the richness of detail in the visuals and unobtrusive score, unlike a recent horse movie's, where we're not told what to feel; instead the mood is enhanced and the overall product is superb.As usual, Duvall does amazing work, and Benning and Costner are an incredible match, with great chemistry.  The photography is outstanding, the sound has rarely been better in the movies, and the final 30 minutes of the film are unforgettable.

48,Samiam3,The best in the west,9,20 July 2009,"Powerful, heartwarming, well written, well acted, and with excellent sound, Open Range is my favourite western. With the exception of good triumphing over evil, the film is virtually free of Hollywood clichés. Kevin Costner may not be the greatest director, but this genre is his cup of tea. He knows what he is doing, and he does it splendidly.The year is 1882, Boss Spearman and Charlie Waite have been free grazing cattle for ten years together, a peaceful life in which no one disturbs them. One day however a strange turn of events brings them to the town of Fort Harmon, which is run by greedy rancher Denton Baxter who doesn't like free grazers and he threatens their lives. After his men ambush their wagon one night, the two angry cowboys are forced to take up arms again.There are a couple of sub-plots which I have not mentioned, but I don't want to give away everything. You really have to see this for yourself. I first saw Open Range in the theatre when it came out. and I remember the climax blew me away, and I think it parallels The Wild Bunch; brutal and brilliant, with gunfire so powerful that it shook the theatre. I have to give credit to the sound editors for that one. This is a must see for sure",Open Range
49,RatedVforVinny,A Major and Epic Western.,8,11 October 2007,"This is far and away Kevin Costner's best picture. Usually his own ego demands to be in almost every frame but here he seems to have resisted and taken a relaxed back seat. With 'Open Range' K.C has directed a very intelligent and accomplished work. Also has handed the main role to the gritty Robert Duval and I have to say the picture is a lot better for it. Reminiscent of Eastwood's own 'Unforgiven', this is a major, epic western, that has to be considered by any followers of this genre. The climatic gunfight is as good as anything I have seen and all in all 'Open Range' is a very satisfying experience. One of the best examples of a modern Western, reflecting some very old fashioned (but sound) values.",Open Range
50,ctomvelu1,None better,8,8 January 2011,"I have reviewed this film here before, and that review is now missing. Or perhaps I reviewed it under a different email address. Reading about the remake of TRUE GRIT and how the Coens have resurrected the western, I am moved to write a new review of OPEN RANGE. If any film resurrected the western, it is this 2003 film. Actually, westerns never really went away; they just turn up these days largely as TV movies. Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall are herding cattle when they run across a crooked lawman and his cohorts. Costner is a former shootist, naturally, so his gunfighting skills will come in handy when tempers boil over. Which they most certainly do. The battle at the end is a beautifully choreographed variation on GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Everything about this romantic western feels right, from Costner's reluctant gunfighter to the clothes everyone wears. It certainly is not the real Old West, but the Old West of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, where the hero is stalwart and even godlike. A must-see.",Open Range
51,rosscinema,Old fashioned western with heart,7,16 September 2003,"Why studios don't make more westerns is beyond me. Some of them are downright unwatchable like ""Young Guns"" and its sequel but there have been some extremely well made films like ""Unforgiven"" and ""Tombstone"" so I'm at a loss as to why more are not made. Thank you Kevin Costner! This story is about four men who are herding their cattle through a certain area and they stop near a town to get supplies. The crew is headed by Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) and his second in charge is Charley Waite (Costner). They send Mose (Abraham Benrubi) to get supplies and after a day or so he doesn't return. Boss and Charley go to find him leaving Button (Diego Luna) to watch the herd. In town they find Mose beaten badly and locked up in the local jail. A rich rancher named Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) hates ""Freegrazers"" and tells them to take their man and keep moving. Baxter controls the sheriff (James Russo) and also has many thugs on his payroll. Back at the herd some of Baxters men have been following them so Boss has an idea of going after them instead of running. That night they confront them and smash their rifles but when they get back Mose has been killed and Button is wounded badly. They take him to the local doctor and meet his sister Sue (Annette Bening) and Charley takes a shine. Boss and Charley don't like to be told where to graze their cattle and they want revenge for the death of Mose. A final gunfight in town is inevitable and Charley reveals that he killed many men in the war. This film was directed by Costner and its very well made. He seems to have found his mark as a directer with this genre. Costner allows the story to unfold on its own terms and the pacing is deliberate which is welcomed after watching so many Hollywood films and their quick edits. The film should be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. The scenery is beautiful and their are so many shots with skylines and mountains and wide open prairies and these shots help tell the story in the film. The scenery is important and gives the film a look that helps you relate to the characters when they speak of not wanting to be told where they can go. The characters are well written and they let out things about themselves little by little as the story is told. Duvall's character is a man of high pride and also a stubborn side and he's not afraid to stand up for himself even if it means he might die. Costner plays a man with a hard past and he seems to be living his life and coming to grips with his experiences in the war at the same time. Charley states that he doesn't have a problem with killing and we believe him. The romance between Costner and Bening seems forced and Bening looks a little to old to be a woman that never married. The film goes on about 15 minutes to long and Costner has not one, but two goodbye scenes with Bening. This is a minor complaint because this is a very entertaining film and after a summer of watching hyper-kinetic Hollywood junk, It's a movie that is very welcomed. Hear that Hollywood?",Open Range

Robert Duvall is good in every movie he's ever been in, this one included. Annette Bening should be in more movies. Kevin Costner, well, he does Kevin Costner well enough. Good supporting cast, including some reliable Canucks. 
The plot is 100% paint-by-numbers, from the bromance to the romance to the Peckinpah-level of killing. How did America come to accept all this blood as normal? No wonder it's a country where crazies are shooting up schools on a weekly basis.",Open Range
53,TheUnknown837-1,My favorite Western,10,20 January 2006,"Open Range is definitely one of the best movies ever created, in my opinion. It just works out great on every level that's required to make a good Western. It took all of those masterpieces from the past and rolled them all into one hit movie. I just love this movie and the novel it's based off of. Kevin Costner definitely needs to keep going on as a director, because he definitely has the talents for it. And I'd like to see Robert Duvall get on the saddle again one more time.One of the first things I love about Open Range is the location. As with most Westerns made now days, this movie was filmed in Canada in order to get the kind of scenery we would have seen in the 1880s. And Costner and his team chose the right spot. The landscape is just so beautiful and Michael Kamer's superb music score blends in with it majestically.Character development and acting is great as well. Our stars are Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, Annette Bening, Michael Gambon, Michael Jeter, James Russo, Abraham Benrubi, and Diego Luna. Along with several others who did a great job. I thought James Russo as a perfect role for the corrupt town marshal. And Michael Gambon definitely has the talents for portraying vicious killers. Each character has his or her own great development so that we understand them. Duvall's character is an old-time range man with nerves of steel and prefers to avoid trouble lest someone else calls for it first. Costner plays a man with a terrible killing-filled past and the first thing he wants to do above all others is forget all about them and move onto a more peaceful life. Those two men really stole the show in this movie.Another thing is the realism of this story. The violence we see is the most powerful next to what we saw in Clint Eastwood's epic ""Unforgiven."" When men get slammed with the butt of a rifle, we hear the heavy sound of metal striking against them and they sink down realistically. But this is nothing compared to how powerful and realistic the gunfire and shootouts are.This movie definitely has the most realistic and powerful gunfight I've ever seen in a Western. Or any movie for that matter. The guns are LOUD at the greatest level. Horses now panic from the shots because they're so loud. For like the first time, the characters involved in it all, even the skilled ones, miss most of the time as would happen if it were a real gunfight. It shows how hard it is to really hit your opponent while you're busy trying to evade bullets they're shooting at you. And what's even better is how Kevin Costner showed us how powerful guns really are. The real effect they have on the targets they strike. Characters don't just scream and fall over when they get shot, they are jerked backwards as blood sprays when they get shot even by the common six-gun. And when they get hit by a double-barrel shotgun at close range, they go flying! The intensity of the action is also great. And what Open Range also shows us is how long it really took for tension to build up before the guns would get fired. We don't even hear a single shot until the movie's half over and when it is, we are blown away by its realism.Open Range definitely has the best gunfight in any Western yet.Overall, this movie from Kevin Costner is a great epic masterpiece that everybody should check out. Some may not like it, particularly if they don't like Westerns, but many will. It sure astounded me and instantly became my favorite movie from the Western genre.",Open Range
54,brchthethird,"Decent, but traditional to a fault",6,8 April 2015,"I've been on somewhat of a Kevin Costner binge lately, and I conclude that here with OPEN RANGE: his first directorial effort after the disaster that was THE POSTMAN, and a return to the Western genre. Although the plot reminded me a little bit of Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN, the tone was not elegiac, with the characters and themes hewing fairly closely to traditional archetypes instead of subverting them. While it's not a bad film, per se, its sincerity dips into corny territory and I didn't exactly like that too much. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner gave great performances, as one would expect. This type of film is also not new to them, with Duvall previously starring in LONESOME DOVE and Costner starring in SILVERADO. I felt like their characters were developed enough, but they could play these roles in their sleep. Annette Bening gets probably the biggest supporting role, but the romance that develops between her and Costner's character seemed out of place and contributed greatly to the sappiness which brings this film down. Diego Luna and Michael Gambon also have supporting roles, but they weren't given too much to do. What the film does have going for it is the cinematography and score. Say what you will about Kevin Costner's films, but all (three) of them look beautiful. He has a great eye for bringing out wonderful visuals of the American West. I also liked the non-intrusive score that accented the imagery quite nicely. However, the best part of this film is undoubtedly the epic shootout that serves as the climax. It was extremely well-shot, realistic, and hard-hitting. No kidding, the sound design here was incredible and you feel every bullet hit. Sadly, that was the pinnacle. Not a bad one to have, but I would have liked the rest of the film to live up to this awesome sequence. Overall, OPEN RANGE tends towards the traditional way of doing a Western, complete with outdated codes of honor and superfluous romance. It's a perfectly decent film, and a return to form of sorts for Costner, but it ranks pretty low in the pantheon of great Westerns.",Open Range
55,FightingWesterner,Two Man Range War,10,15 March 2010,"An excellent movie, this does a great job of slowly building suspense, creating unbearable tension that explodes into an incredible, well staged climax that should go down in the history of great cinematic western gun battles.This has a fantastic, spirited performance by Robert Duvall, full of warmth, humor, and American spirit.Whatever he's in, Kevin Costner always seems to be playing the same guy. Still, he's great at playing soft-spoken, salt-of-the-earth tough guys. His character here is no exception.Also worth watching is the collection of nasty villains, led by Michael Gambon and James Russo, who's a great under-appreciated character actor and frequent heavy.The other star of the show is the spectacular, fluid cinematography by James Muro, longtime steadicam operator and B-movie director, whose first time as director of photography this is.Open Range is an immensely satisfying movie and is highly recommended.",Open Range

Costner & Duval doing a Western. What's not to like? Well I was right. Very enjoyable even flowing and unfolding story line that pleases and teases while exposing us to beautiful scenes and vistas. It has all the Western ingredients like shoot-em ups, cattle, horses, ""open range"", saloon and good versus evil just to name some. It also adds one of my favorites which is filming in the rain and storm (real or not) as it just lends credibility and atmosphere not to mention real life as it was in the rough wild West. Plenty a guns a blazing keep us on the edge with plenty of bad guys to catch bullets and comeuppance. Good movie to eat dinner while watching. Highly recommend a snack and tasty drink. Popcorn, sunflower seeds is very compatible and of course some good beef jerky if you really want to go the distance. This movie adds up to a worthy ten. Mount up and lets ride....",Open Range
57,marcin_kukuczka,Well made at multiple levels! Pleasure to watch!,8,19 December 2004,"I have not been particularly interested in western movies and went to see the film mostly for the sake of Kevin Costner. I have always appreciated him as an actor and wondered how he did as a director. From the very beginning of the movie, I was surprised. I expected something good. As a matter of fact, it occurred to be VERY GOOD! The movie is a pleasure to watch throughout.The content is interesting and smart, though typical for this very genre. A band of friends, men of honor, live a careless life driving cows in the countryside. However, all changes entirely when they enter a town ruled by the corruption and decadence of Sheriff Poole (James Russo) and his companion Baxter (Michael Gambon). Charlie Waite, ex Charles Postlewaite (Kevin Costner), together with his friend, Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall), decide to take revenge when their friend Mose is murdered, Button severely hurt, and their sweet dog Tig killed by some Sheriff's bad guys.A very typical thing for westerns which Kevin Costner beautifully showed is the fact about cowboys' lives. People who want to forget about the past, put aside their lives as they were brought up, and start something new (it also has its resemblance in American lifestyle). They even change names. It is particularly noticeable in the scene where Charlie talks about his bad past, how he learned to kill. On the one hand, he would like to forget about it, but, on the other hand, it always stays at his side and never leaves him.The story is also supplied with love between Charlie and Sue Barlow. Charlie falls in love with her from the very beginning, even if he thinks that she is the wife of Doc Barlow. His love gets stronger when he finds out that Sue is his sister. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job here as a director as well in portraying the main character. Love is showed not so much on the sexual level but rather on the spiritual one. The woman is not only the subject of desire but someone, a person who brings back to life the faded values, and consequently, makes a life worth living. I particularly loved the scene where Charlie tells Sue that before he met her, he had not cared whether he would live for long or not, but when he got to know her, he had this desire to live and see her again. Love between a man and a woman is showed in a very honorable way.Violence? Of course there is shooting in the movie. But that is the spirit of westerns. It has to be there. I think that no one has a right to accuse Costner of violence. If there is any, it is a different sort of violence, not for the sake of it so that people stare at the screen watching someone being tortured to death, but violence for retaining honor and fulfilling revenge. The main characters have a clear distinction between good and bad. Boss Spearman says: ""Stop these bad deeds. Enough!""And the locations! Canadian countryside, the beauty of Alberta or Longview are a great choice for shooting this movie in. The technical way of filming is also perfect. The scenes showing the mountains, flowers, meadows. Someone who loves nature will also get something for him/her in this movie.Open Range is a very good western at multiple levels. Thanks be to God that there are still people like Kevin Costner who show the triumph of honor, so much forgotten in today's world. Do see it. You may dislike this genre, but after seeing Open Range, you will surely change your mind.What is the pleasure of watching the movie? Mmm... A bar of Swiss chocolate and a good smoke of the Cuban cigar.",Open Range
58,KnightsofNi11,Uninspired western,5,9 August 2012,"Back in the day the overrated Kevin Costner decided that he wanted to be a director as well. He gained a major confidence boost when his directorial debut, Dances with Wolves, scored seven Oscars, one being best picture. Thirteen years later Costner decided he would dabble in directing a western flick. That flick... Open Range, the story of two free grazers who are forced to take up arms against a corrupt lawman who threatens their cattle crew. The film captures the look and feel of an old timey western film, but not the spirit.For me, there just wasn't much to like about Open Range. As a western it looks pretty cool and the sets and costumes are high quality period piece material. But as far as feeling like a true western goes, it completely lacked the gung-ho spirit of a classic western adventure from John Wayne. This is in part from the uninspired storyline and characters that don't make this a very exciting film. The story is pretty dull and nothing big happens in this film until the final shootout, which even that is sort of a let down. The characters are all terribly one dimensional and it's near impossible to become invested in their lives. Open Range just isn't an engaging film in the slightest. It lacks any emotional backbone and leaves you with zero interest in anything that just happened.Even the performances from this star studded cast lack any real enthusiasm. Like I said before, I find Costner overrated, and this flat performance was no different. Annette Bening, who I'm a fan of, put forth no effort in her uninterested and bland performance. Supporting cast members like Diego Luna, Abraham Benrubi, and Michael Gambon bring nothing special to the table here either. The only performance worth mentioning is that of the always superb Robert Duvall, who is working in a territory that he is all too familiar with because of a little masterpiece by the name of Lonesome Dove. Duvall fits into his character perfectly and gives it his all, something the rest of the cast fail to do. They all seem out of place and unfit for this western genre.Open Range is a big production that obviously had big ambitions to be much better than it turned out to be. I didn't hate this movie and it didn't make me miserable while watching it. But, in retrospect I found nothing positive worth mentioning about the film. It's just not a great flick and it lacks the true essence of a good western film. It tries to go a much more classical route with the genre, something many modern westerns don't do. Sadly this doesn't work in its favor. Open Range is, overall, just a waste of time.",Open Range
59,TOMASBBloodhound,"Vengeance is a terrible, beautiful thing.",8,10 September 2003,"Spoilers to follow:I'll start by saying I really liked this film, and I expected to. Most of the other comments here seemed to indicate it would be worth a look. Some observations:It's good to see Costner do well again. It had been a while. The guy really is talented as both an actor and a film maker. He did some things a little differently this time around and it helped him out quite a bit. The main thing you notice is that he pulled himself back considerably from the forefront of this picture. He is one of the main characters, but the entire universe doesn't revolve around him like it usually does. He looks pretty scruffy (like a cowboy should) and his face isn't the focus of every shot like we are used to. Robert Duvall and Annette Bening steal this film right away from him. I'm sure  he planned it that way, but it's good to see this happen anyway. Duvall has NEVER been better. (I don't always like his work!) He has a grasp of every aspect of his character like he has actually lived this man's life. Will he be rewarded at Oscar time? Probably not. Seldom does the Academy reward someone for being in something so many people have seen. Oh well, it happened to Russell Crowe, didn't it?Technically this film is a dream. Great cinematography in a western is an absolute must. The landscape is so bold, that you have no choice but to take advantage of it. Costner does just that. He knows how to make nearly every scene look perfect. I loved the way this film showed the damaging effect that torrential rains can have on a town with no sewer system.
The plot is certainly nothing we haven't seen before in this type of film. Someone wrongs someone else. Vengeance is sought after. People die. The fastest gun usually wins. The guns, by the way, are loud as heck in this film. That was pretty cool. I hope this effect isn't lost too much when the DVD comes out. One other thing this film does that I found interesting was it pulled us way back from the villains. A lot of films (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) get us up close and personal with our bad guys. The James Bond and Die Hard movies come to mind. Not here, pal! We only catch passing glances of most of the baddies for much of the film. In some scenes, they wear hoods over their heads with eye holes. Kim Coates is supposed to be the baddest of them all, but I hardly remember seeing his face until right about the time Costner sends a bullet between his eyes! The only bad guy we see a lot of is the corrupt local lawman played by James Russo. He is really just a metaphor for the law-for-hire theme of the film. His character is mean, but hardly intimidating.Overall, this is a good tale of vengeance exploding from within our protagonists. Duvall (the good guy) and Costner (the good guy who hasn't always been a good guy) whip up on the men responsible for shooting up their buddies. The final gunfight is spectacular. After it ends, you get the feeling that justice has been served. Your eardrums will be ringing from all the gunfire on your way home. Conflict plays out between men who look very tiny in that vast expanse of prairie. All because some men marched some cattle too close to another man's territory. Everything settled in one big, bloody, beautiful gunfight. Vengeance is theirs.8 of 10 starsSo Sayeth the Hound.",Open Range

During the night, one man disappears. But what has happened? Does anyone know? A few nights go by, and the man is found dead.

61,gregsrants,One of the better westerns in quite some time,7,29 May 2004,"Westerns have run their course in Hollywood. Gone are the glory days of Sergio Leone's The Man Without a Name films or Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch. In the new age of film, it now seems we run years before we get mediocre films like Young Guns they seem to do enough harm to put the genre in a back room for another lengthy stay. It's not that any western produced within the past 20 years has been incredibly bad, it's just that the new generation of moviegoers don't seem to care. Kids on the street now play spaceman and aliens rather than the cowboys and Indians that we used to partake. Then in 1985, Clint Eastwood tried again with Pale Rider, which was a moderate hit grossing in about $41 million dollars domestically. But still Hollywood did not jump on the chuck wagon to exploit the genre. Over the next few years, there were a handful of good western films (Dances with Wolves, Silverado) and a whole lot of bad ones (Trigger Fast, Bad Girls). It took Clint Eastwood to come to the rescue again in 1992 with the critically applauded Unforgiven. The story about a retired gunslinger went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and many people, including myself, thought that the flood gates for the western/frontier film was wide open. But a funny thing happened on the way to the local saloonyears passed and no one studio seemed to greenlight any further westerns. Were there no good stores? Were they too expensive to make? Or was it simply that Schwarzenegger would just look stupid in chaps. Who knows? One thing I do know for sure is that Kevin Costner's Open Range is one of the better westerns to be produced in many a Dakota moon. Starring Costner, Robert Duvall and Annette Bening, Open Range tells the story of two free grazers who take the law into their own hands after members of their posse are shot and left for dead. Sue Barlow (Bening) is the sister of the local doctor that cares for the harmed ranchers and soon finds herself the affection of Charlie Waites' eye (Costner). Together, they stand up to the sheriff and his local henchmen in hopes of seeking revenge for their fallen comrade and ensuring their right to free graze in the open country.What made Open Range so unique is its honest depiction of the wild wild west. When a gun battle is about to erupt in town, the townspeople flee to the treeline rather than sit in their homes and become victims of stray bullets. And when the gun fighting begins, people actually don't get hit with every bullet leaving a gun. Even just ten to fifteen feet from each other, bullets fly by from the hands of nervous gunmen which is a far cry from the every bullet has an owner movies to which Eastwood has made famous.Even the characters are more realistic than portrayed in most westerns. Our heroes are conflicted individuals whose actions are sometimes less than acceptable recourse. When Charlie shoots the bar mirror after being denied service, it reinforces the notion that in a lawless time, everyone just looked out after themselves and went to great lengths to see their own form of justice handed out.Maybe most refreshing however was in the simple casting of the film. Costner and Bening as love interests are far more an acceptable possibility than having an almost 50-year old chasing down a twenty-something like we see in almost every other movie out there. And Bening, to her credit, also uses very little make-up to hide the fact that she too is in her forties. This lead to a more plausible affection, all do respect to Jack Nicholson and his harem of high school costars. Kevin Costner had to put up a majority of his own money to get this film made, and although not a breakthrough success, the movie did make back its $40 dollar budget with a few extra coins for everyone to put back in their pockets with DVD and video rentals. However, this will do nothing to get the western back in our local theaters on a regular basis. Unless someone can produce a western with Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, Keanu Reeves and Leonardo DiCarprio directed by Steven Spielberg, then I am afraid we are in for another long drought before we get to see our heroes ride into the sunset to cue the credits.",Open Range

63,EijnarAmadeus,Costner's ultimate comeback!,8,1 August 2004,"spoilers. OPEN RANGE is a classic western with revolvers, hats, boots, dust and horses. The movie stars Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall as a couple of ten years-experience-together ""cow-hunters"" as I like calling them. Together with a kiddo and a big fella, and a dog, these four men work together on the praire gathering cows. But, a guy named Baxter who's a local landsowner hates these folks coming into their town and therefore starts treating them badly. Both asking for trouble it all has to end up with a brutal battle...and in all this a sister to the local doctor has feelings for Costner...OPEN RANGE gives you really well made western. And that's the pure brilliance about it, it's all about cowboys and their guns and stuff, and the movie doesn't have a insane deep or freaky original story, no it's really just based upon its characters and drama. The drama upon romance, respect, honour and strength keeps the mood in this movie really a chapter for itself. Kevin Costner does a huge performance with acting, producing and directing this movie, playing the rough cowboy that's having mental problems but still remember how to fire a revolver makes his character truly great. The movie is a fine drama with classical western sequences with saloons and stuff, but the defining moment really appears on the movie's most wonourable. The finale is truly a masterpiece of action. Brutal shootings, crazy made sounds and top-notch excitement fills the entire scene that truly ends the movie with it's head raised high. Starting off at the end it shoots bullets for about 30 minutes and when it's all finished; you're truly a cowboy. STARS: 4/5",Open Range

Michael Gambon, as it becomes clear early on is the chief villain and he isn't at all nice, complete with irish accent. Annette Bening is the real star of the film in my view. This is about 4 guys taking cattle across from one US State to another with the animals eating grass wherever its available for free, which Mr Gambon doesn't like when they turn up in his territory. Given the skulduggery of him and his hencemen Duvall and Costner choose to stay and fight despite the odds on the basis that the landowner is thoroughly evil and needs to be stopped. Lots of blood, lots of unpleasant demises, which if you can stomach it (don't let the kids watch it) makes for an interesting film with, for me, a surprising conclusion-which you have to watch to find out for yourself. Truly a very good western but not for the feint hearted",Open Range
65,MattyGibbs,Excellent western,9,10 November 2015,"Open Range is an excellent modern western. Although at times a little slow moving it's so beautifully filmed and full of character this matters little. A small group of free grazers fall foul of the local sheriff who rules the local town with an iron fist. The main leads Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall are outstanding and unlike many westerns from the golden era aren't painted as whiter than white, though of at heart decent men. Annette Bening is great as the love interest. The film covers a number of themes about the Old West, revenge, loyalty, setting down roots etc. Although there are sporadic bouts of violence this film relies more on the characters to drive it along. That is until the brilliant final scenes which give a terrific pay off. Open Range is a fantastic western and well worth watching for anyone with a love of the genre. Highly recommended.",Open Range

Costner and Duval gave powerful, authentic performances. Annette Benning played her role perfectly. This film was very engrossing. The story of vengeance was played out and was very gratifying. The climactic shootout was something to behold - it may have been the greatest shootout I have seen in any Western. This movie is very similar to Shane and Unforgiven in that it was all too real - no cliché dialogue or hammy acting. The bad guys were hateful and evil. The pace was slow and the tension mounted with each minute. Truly an unforgettable masterpiece.",Open Range
67,virek213,Costner Revives The Western Genre With Fine Results.,8,23 August 2003,"For as many hits and misses as he has had both in front of and behind the camera, with OPEN RANGE, Kevin Costner makes us realize how precious the Western film genre is to Americans.  It is the ONLY one that is unique to our country.  And as this film shows us, it is a genre in need of a serious revival.Costner is teamed up with veteran Robert Duvall as cattlemen on a drive across the Rockies with their two sidemen (Abraham Benrubi, Diego Luna). When Benrubi is killed in a small Montana town and Luna is himself nearly killed by the hired guns of a rancher (Michael Gambon) bitterly opposed to free-grazers like Duvall's outfit, Duvall and Costner go into town for retribution.  Costner also begins to fall for the local town doctor's sister (Annette Benning), and he sees a more perfect life that he never was able to enjoy as a cowboy.If not necessarily at the level of Costner's 1990 masterpiece DANCES WITH WOLVES, or the films of Ford, Hawks, or Peckinpah, OPEN RANGE nevertheless displays great story-telling gifts on Costner's part, not to mention his ability to get the best from his cast.  In front of the camera, he turns in a grizzled performance right for the film.  And once again, Duvall is a wonder as his boss and mentor, a cattle drive veteran out to make a living but who is forced to kill.  Benning is also quite good as the heroine of the piece.Blessed with exquisite on-location photography, done in southern Canada, and with a fine score by Michael Kamen (DIE HARD), OPEN RANGE proves that there is a lot of life left yet in the Western if only Hollywood would stop and take notice of the fact.  There are endless stories to be told in this most American of film genres, and Costner and his cast and crew have proven that in spades here.",Open Range
68,ctomvelu-1,"""Unforgiven"" 2",8,16 November 2008,"Kevin Costner crafted a near-perfect western in OPEN RANGE, from an otherwise standard story about cattle drovers threatened by a corrupt lawman who is in the pay of a nasty land baron. Costner is a retired shootist who hooks up with aging cattleman Robert Duvall, who dreams of retiring after this one last drive. Unfortunately, they run smack into a small town sheriff (James Russo) who with his henchmen manage to kill one of their cowboys and viciously injure a second. Russo answers to land baron Michael Gambon, who strikes the only false note in this near-perfect movie. Gambon is out of place as a boisterous, bellowing Irish émigré who has clawed and killed his way to the top. He also lives far too long in the script to be believable. Along the way, Costner also meets the town doctor and his shy sister (Annette Benning) and is immediately smitten with the sister. I would have trimmed some of their encounters but hey, what do I know? People love romance in their movies, even when it isn't warranted. Costner lets the movie build gradually to the big shootout, with some violence scattered along the way to keep us male viewers interested. Besides the incredible gunfight near the end, the best parts of the movie are those devoted to Costner and Duvall getting to know each other. Costumes, sets and location photography are incredibly detailed. And for those who loved him like I did, the late Michael Jeter has a small but significant role as a feisty stable man who sides with Duvall and Costner. Jeter, who clearly was not well when he made this, died shortly after filming. A must-see, especially for those who enjoyed UNFORGIVEN.",Open Range
69,lawprof,A Conventional Western Redeemed by Some Real Good Acting,7,6 February 2004,"In the year 2104 the western film will still be made (although the word ""film"" will probably be a sentimental, anachronistic reference to a long bygone medium).  ""Open Range"" is one of a number of resurrectionist westerns that invites viewers to step back into a time of manliness, honor, the ability to meet challenges and - not least - the vision of a powerfully expansive America that met its interior challenges without reference to a larger world.  Reassuring in these times - at least for as long as the movie runs.Here's the recipe:A wizened, wise older man who's seen it all, done most of it, set in his values, deeply loyal to his men, not afraid to die.  Robert Duvall, one of America's finest actors.His younger but not young companion (in this case also a ten-year), a taciturn, laconic cowboy who hints at his bad past and who's on the cusp of a major character change occasioned by the challenges he'll confront.  Enter Kevin Costner, who also directed ""Open Range.""Next, the purdy as all get-out, tender but strong gal, pretty as a newborn heifer. She can stand on her own feet but is ready to be swept off them by the fella who rides in from the endless skyline. That's the beautiful and talented Annette Bening.And the bad guy-in-chief.  Here it's Michael Gambon as Irish emigre Denton Baxter, a man who knows how to get ahead in America, especially when he has a tough gang of killers and a paid-by-the-crime supine marshal.To which add breathtaking western scenery that in a hundred years will probably have to be computer generated for movies.  And, for good measure, throw in two really appealing pooches.So what we have is cow herding Boss Spearman who with Charlie Waite is among the last of the hard men who depended on accessible open range to feed their cattle on the soon-to-end drives. Boss Spearman has two helpers, one fat and dumb, the other young and callow-we've seen them before.And Baxter hates open rangers with a passion and his method of dealing with them is murderous.  Spearman and Waite won't lose their honor to a bad guy whose forces outnumber them many to two.Sue is her M.D. brother's paramedic and her services are soon needed.  Old Spearman doesn't turn her on.  Guess who does?Directors of contemporary westerns have a problem: they can't use the latest killing machines and explosive devices that inhabit every third rate techno-thriller.  They're stuck with whatever the West of the late nineteenth century had.  So the solution is to try and have the best and biggest gun battle ever and Costner comes close to succeeding here.  It's a heck of a fight-makes the exchange at the O.K. Corral look like a minor street incident.Duvall, Costner and Bening work very well together.  I think they really liked making this film.  And because of the fine acting the pace is quick, the scenes interesting.  The resolution is hardly surprising.Now released on DVD ""Open Range"" comes with a second disc of special features.  Included are a number of deleted scenes and a ""making of..."" documentary with Costner largely engaging in self-congratulation as well as praising his cast.  But one segment, how a huge gunfight was choreographed, held my attention.  I often wondered how gut-shot characters flew backwards with such violence.  The reason?  There's a rope around the actor's ankles and someone's pulling hard at the right second. I hope that kind of scene didn't have to be re-shot too often.A short documentary tells the true story of the demise of the open range as barbed wire, one of the truly pivotal inventions of the nineteenth century, encircled larger holdings and doomed smaller ones.I won't buy this set but I'm glad I rented it and if you like westerns you'll want to see it too.7/10.",Open Range

As a film, boredom.",1,26 December 2017,"First I would like to congratulate Kevin Costner for beating John Malkovich and keanu reeves, as best out of 3 of the worst highly paid actors in Hollywood. These 3 are so monotone in their performance, it's like watching a guy reading the yellow pages for 12 hours. Seriously, who thought that they should be in acting. Who was the jerk who thought that yeah your good at acting, stick with it, you'll make people cry, laugh, etc. If they were the only 3 actors left on the planet Costner would be king.Ok, now to the film. This movie had the bare minimum of plots. Basically couple of guys trying to do business on someone else's land, one of them get's into the most boring courtship with an older woman, they kill all the bad guys, and free the town from an evil emperor. Garbage.Best part of the movie was Robert Duvall acting. But the dialogue given to him was garbage. He did the best he could. Annette Bening was just barely ok, mostly boring looking, and the dialogue was hilarious, just plain stupid, and comical. Michael Gambon did ok, but not much of him, at least we got to hear some silly Irish accents. Kostner was garbage, and his dialogue was even more hilarious than Benings. Everyone else might as well been cardboard cutouts, literally! They should just have some stagehand moving the cardboard cutouts to emote motion. The kid that got shot and in the doctor's office was in a coma, later starts a gunfight, ridiculous, and the acting, painful. The gunfight was ok at best. Who the hell would walk up to a couple of guys with guns. Why not use snipers? They're just standing there in the middle of the street. Then the bad guys all get killed except for the big guy. Bad guy rounds up some more bad guys and the town people and the good guys start blowing them away. Duvall, after being shot in the gut, walks across the street and in close quarters gets into a shootout with the big bad guy. Duvall is still ok, the bad guy is still alive, and Duvall doesn't want to waste a bullet on him. Cliché good guy. While watching this, I thought ok, this is watchable, but the dialogue was ridiculous and funny. Then after reading some reviews on IMDb (by the way, made very difficult by the new changes from IMDb), I fully realized that what I watched was amateur filmmaking. Costner cannot act. He cannot direct. He has no business being in movies. Maybe he's a decent guy and he can devote his life to humanitarian causes. If all his film royalties go to helping world peace, great.

71,WriterDave,"Mature, Old-Fashioned Western Audience Pleaser",8,18 August 2003,"""Open Range"" is a great film because it takes a neglected genre and reminds you how entertaining it can be, and it takes all that genre's clichés and makes them meaningful through great attention to detail and character development. This is a loving, mature film that isn't ashamed to take its time with big beautiful shots of the old west and long conversations amongst endearing characters. There's some humor, some romance, and some great action (the logistics of the shoot-out in terms of physics and sound effects are the best I've ever experienced in any action film) as well as some timely morality.Costner has made a lot of crap since winning the best director Oscar for ""Dances with Wolves"" (a movie that gets a lot of flack these days but still plays beautifully if you take the time to watch it patiently), and there hasn't even been a watchable Western since Sam Raimi's warped Sharon Stone vehicle ""The Quick and the Dead"" (and a lot of people dismiss that film as garbage) so its nice to see such an old fashioned Western (""Unforgiven"" was essentially post-modern) connect on so many levels. For the first time in a long time Costner reminds you why he was a movie star in the first place and why he won that Oscar (even though Scorcese was robbed that year!). Duvall is perfectly cast as the grizzled cattle ranger and Benning is stunning and wholly natural in a beautifully understated role as a classy frontier woman. She deserves an Oscar nod. The rest of the supporting cast is all top notch. More kudos to the production crew (it's hard to believe this was made for only $20 million) and a nice score that peaks quietly and poignantly in all the right places without ever hitting you over the head with its epic swell.

72,dr_foreman,Best film of the year,10,23 January 2004,"Sure, it's a dirt simple story - nasty land barons beat up on nice cattle men, and revenge ensues. But Westerns are almost always this simple, drawn in stark good guys and bad guys terms (even the really famous ones are often based on such stereotypes). What really matters is, how good is the execution of these old Western clichés?Here, the execution is just about flawless. There's beautiful camera-work, nicely measured pacing (it's good to see that at least one director still knows how to hold a shot), and some great stylized action at the end (I'm sure Costner knows that people don't really go flying when they're shot; it's a movie, guys, go with it!). Duvall is superb, and Costner plays exactly the kind of role he's good at - a nice, low-key, honest feller. Before I saw the film, I dreaded the romance with Bening, but it turned out to be quite sweet and sensitive, a real highlight of the story.A few reviewers on this site claim that ""Open Range"" is too familiar... well, maybe it is... but there's precious little like it in the movies now.

Push comes to shove. What I like so much about this ""western"" is it's focus not on action (although that is inevitable in this story) but thought, it's patient look at stoic men trying to do the right thing with the least amount of consequence. It's a very strong, accurate description of the classic American male, still alive in this country, but much less appreciated now. The photography is beautiful, the scoring is huge yet somehow not overwhelming (often used to remind the viewer that a simple moment has an epic point), the dialog is everything from funny and dry, simple and elegant, to deep and moving. There IS a ""love interest"" in here, but it is kept to a minimum, does not overshadow the larger issues of this story, and it has a non-glossy realism to it that was a GREAT relief.

79,jackasstrange,"Great climax, poor build up",6,26 November 2013,"Open Range is unnecessarily long and way too slow. It was an OK film at best. My complaints are mostly about the introduction of the film. The build up of the film takes like almost one hour. You see, is never fine when you took like sixty minutes or so to really understand where the film is going. And the worst part is that the villain barely appears or does something until the great climax, which i'll mention later. I mean, we have literally to wait to the only conflict in the film, that only comes after 2 hours of boredom. The great detail which differs the good westerns from the bad westerns are the capacity of the greats in keeping the viewer entertained with a good story, which really don't happens in that film. Not that i am asking for every film to be on par with the Howard Hawks and the Sergio Leone's westerns, but entertainment is fundamental if you can't make a film without a good plot. The climax, however, is really great. The shootout is realist, and a lot of stuff happens during this event, which reunites thriller, action and adventure elements masterfully. The climax itself is much bigger than the film, and it(the film)really deserved a better build-up. The ending is disappointing, to the well of truth. It's way too cliché, but i couldn't see this film escaping from the cliché anyways. It would be either the sad and predictable ending, with the death of the protagonists, or the happy ending. I don't recommend this film, but highly recommend you to watch the conflict sequence. 6.3/10",Open Range

Well I saw it on DVD and Kevin Costner finally is back to form. Though it is not the classic that Dances With Wolves is, Open Range shows that Costner knows how to make a good western. I have always thought that he is at his best when he plays more ordinary characters, here he is an old gunslinger that works for a grazer played by Robert Duvall. Costner gets in trouble when he plays outwardly heroic guys, here his character is conflicted and 3 dimensional. The film is basically similar to Unforgiven in that the good guys aren't so good at times.

Costner took a plot page from ""Unforgiven"" and tried somewhat ham-handedly to make his character somewhat flawed.  Although it's a good plot it has been done to death.  This is the plot of vast majority of every western genre movie made.

This is a bad guys versus good guys formula-type film featuring interesting characters and fine performances by Costner, Annette Bening, and particularly Robert Duvall. However, Duvall seems to have dug into the bag of tricks he developed for the excellent 'Lonesome Dove' mini-series (1990's and highly-recommended), and recycled some facial expressions and assorted idiosyncrasies he used then. Costner is a darker version of his Silverado character: this time, he is haunted by the guerilla-type tactics in which he engaged during the civil war -- not proudly. Why have I rated it 7, instead of the glowing 9-10 other Western-lovers assigned? To begin with: the premise. I don't doubt that, historically, smaller herders of cattle encroached on the fenced-off ranges set up by powerful cattle barons in a growing number of areas (lol-this 'device' was parodied effectively by the Andy Griffith character in 'Rustler's Rhapsody'). It's just that Duvall, the itinerant here, has such a measly herd of cattle. The cattle baron in this case (portrayed with dark cynicism by the English veteran Michael Gambon) threatens, murders, and throws a fit over a handful of cows that would hardly be noticed in such a wide-open area! I mean: Duvall only needs 3 guys to care for the entire herd - why bother? Mitchy the kid (City Slickers-Billy Crystal) had a dozen guys on his modern-day fantasy cattle drive -- what size herd can be handled by 3-4 guys when one of them is the cook? Next: Annette's character: Sorry-- a 40-year old single 'pretty' women in the old West was rare. You went from being someone's daughter to someone's wife (or someone's widow, hopefully a wealthy one - see Anjelica Huston in Lonesome Dove) - or you were doomed to life as a hooker above a bar. This was so realistically shown in Lonesome Dove: there were no pretty girls who moved out of Dad's house and rented a flat with a female friend. You needed the security and protection of some guy with money and muscle. It was the Wild West, after all. OK- Annette is a doctor's progressive s-i-s-t-e-r -- so, you could make a case. But why ain't she married? A pretty, well-educated lass with a good family background would probably marry a teacher or another doctor, before age 25, or she would end up as an old maid. I'm not saying it was fair - I'm just saying it was true. In my script, Annette would be a widow pining for a great guy she lost in death - who takes a shine to Costner's rugged character.Finally: the ending drags on for several minutes. What Magnificent Seven did in 2 minutes takes Costner 15. My wife actually got up and left the room! So, my problem is not with the general plot, nor the action, nor the cinematography (note the small river running through the middle of town during a driving rain storm - wow!) -- my problem is with the setup or premise, the 'draggy' ending, and how A Benning's character was scripted. 7/10",Open Range
85,pinkliz41,A waist of time,1,30 May 2008,"Boring, tedious, Corny and cheesy. Those are my words to show what i thought of this movie. The whole tone of the story is slow and inconvenient, and definitely NOT what a western should be. In my view, westerns in general should be a mix of action, adventure, suspense, good acting and directing. This is definitely not the case in Open Range. Sure it's got a good cast and good choreography, but thats all there is. The build up to the main event is so slow that even a donkey could get their faster. Then, when you think a shootout is coming up, the film seamlessly drags onto more talking. My main point is, theirs not enough going on to convince me i should enjoy this film",Open Range

87,WubsTheFadger,Open Range,8,11 February 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the story is very simple. Some free range cattle farmers are told to leave because the owner of the land doesn't want these filthy free folk on his land. Things turn violent when the farmers want to settle things diplomatically. The story is told in a very slow fashion but is extremely powerful.The acting is the best part about the film. Kevin Costner delivers a stunning performance as a man torn between what he truly is and what he want to become. Michael Jeter also delivers an amazing performance. Robert Duvall, Annette Bening, Michael Gambon, Abraham Benrubi, and Diego Luna also perform well.The pacing is very slow until the end. The film wants us to connect and study the characters as real people. But the pacing can be seen as slow nonetheless. Also the runtime is overlong. Pros: Simple story, great ending, amazing performance by Kevin Costner and Michael Jeter, good acting, and great character studiesCons: Very slow pacing and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 8.4",Open Range
88,Ronin47,"Really drags in places, but good (***)",7,19 October 2003,"As a general rule, I'm not a big fan of Westerns, but when I see a good one, like ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", ""Silverado"", or ""Unforgiven"", I know it. Kevin Costner's ""Open Range"" isn't quite in that league, but it's good.
Robert Duvall plays Boss, a ""free-grazer"" who travels constantly, grazing his cattle on the open range, and Kevin Costner is Charley, his long-time employee. The other two who travel with them are gentle giant Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and a scrappy Mexican kid named Button (Diego Luna, from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"").They run afoul of some nasty authority types in a town owned by this movie's Big Bad (a repellant Michael Gambon), who doesn't like free-grazers and wants them out. Even if you haven't seen many Westerns, you probably know this is leading to a big, bloody gunfight.""Open Range"" certainly takes its time getting to that gunfight. It's very light on action until the climax, but makes up for the sometimes slow pacing with solid character development and some beautiful cinematography. The relationship between Boss and Charley is especially interesting. These are two men who've known each other so long they can anticipate the others' every move, but know almost nothing about the other's life prior to their working together, and it's a fascinating dynamic.There's also a love story between Charley and the town doctor's sister (Annette Bening) that is sweet but feels extraneous, and too much screen time is spent on it.""Open Range"" unfolds its story and its characters slowly but surely, and if you have the patience, you'll probably enjoy it.",Open Range
89,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,They used every cliché in the book,6,10 July 2006,"Not much new here - a similar theme to what was used in Shane and countless other westerns where the ranchers or farmers or cattlemen fight each other over land use. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner are a couple of free-grazing cattlemen who get on the wrong side of the local land baron. Lots of silly talk about how ""a man has to pull his own weight"" and how ""that really sticks in my craw"" and how about ""we pay our own way, ma'am.?Kevin Costner really shines as (shades of Shane again) the former gunslinger who's trying to escape his past. 15 years ago Costner was starring in silly movies like ""Dancing with Wolves"" and was getting a rep as an Alan Alda ""sensitive male"" type. He escaped that potentially career-ending stereotype by playing hardbitten loners in movies like ""waterworld"" and ""wyatt Earp"". He does a similar thing here as his Charley Waite character is a good man but a killer and not very likable.Robert Duvall Plays Boss Spearman who's supposed to be the leader of the duo but comes across as just a meddlesome old man.Despite its faults, i rather liked the movie cause it's a western and the scenery is gorgeous.

91,senortuffy,Modern western doesn't quite make it.,7,17 March 2004,"This was an interesting film, part ""Shane"", part ""The Unforgiven.""  You have a basic setup - a group of good guys are set upon by the evil rancher who thinks he owns the range just because he's big and powerful.  With a little better pacing and some better dialogue, it could have been a very good film.My main fault with the film was that it moved at a glacial pace for about an hour and a half.  You have the conflict established in the first twenty minutes, then it just crawls along at an excruciatingly slow pace.  The director was trying to establish a mood, that of slower times in the late 19th century, but he overdoes it.My other complaint was the insertion of a romantic interest in the person of Annette Bening.  The theme was about ""free rangers"", cowboys who roamed the great plains and made a living for themselves off the land, conflicting with big business in the form of the rancher who claimed the land for himself.  A little romance might have been OK as a thematic sideline, but Annette Bening is the best actor in the film so her part swallows up what it took an hour to establish.Other than that, this is a pretty satisfying film.  Kevin Costner is very good as Charley Waite, an ex-gunman riding along with Boss Spearman, played ably by Robert Duvall.  They play off each other fairly well throughout the film, though the dialogue is so stilted at times that the flow is destroyed. Annette Bening is excellent in her part, despite some funky dialogue she must have had trouble saying with a straight face.  Her romance with Costner's character takes over the film midway through, which renders Duvall's character to a secondary status.The climax at the end between Duvall, Costner and the rancher and his gang is exciting and makes the film worthwhile.  The bad guy, played by Michael Gambon, is a bit cartoonish, but he's sufficiently evil that the viewer savors his demise.Not a bad effort, but certainly not in a class with either of the two films I mentioned earlier.  Westerns depend on moral certitude, and with the relativism we live with nowadays, they're really hard to pull off.  This one succeeds partly.",Open Range
92,skoyles,A rewarding Western,8,16 October 2007,"When the DVD of ""Open Range"" began I felt as though I had a PBS documentary based on the excellent Ogden Tanner historical book ""The Ranchers"". Soon the town appears with a great presence despite the main street being a trifle narrower than most 19th century Western high plains hamlets. So much of the movie depends on the credibility of the portrayal of the Old West. The land and scenery are perfect; I would have to think so since I live where this was filmed and see those valleys, hills and mountains almost every day. Living in the West and being a lover of 19th century history gives me a certain extra-critical approach to Western movies but in ""Open Range"" my carping is restricted to a few possible errors, nary a one significant. Are there anachronisms? Perhaps a few. Do any grate enough to distract the viewer? Probably not. I was reminded of ""Unforgiven"" and frankly prefer ""Open Range"". Not long ago I watched ""Silverado"" again, one of the best fantasy Westerns. ""Open Range"" is less fantasy and more rooted in both time and place. Westerns fall into two categories analogous to the science-fiction categories. There are fantasy sci-fi such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Flash Gordon""; there are nuts-and-bolts sci-fi such as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"". ""Open Range"" is a nuts-and-bolts Western, no less imaginative for that but rooted in 1882 reality. It must be much more difficult to do a Western of this sort than a fantasy such as ""The Magnificent Seven"" or all the ""oaters"" of the mid-twentieth century, firmly set in a West that never was. ""Open Range"" succeeds on all fronts, as a Western with some accuracy and as a character study, good drama and good action. It is not set at a frenetic pace but has a certain measured 19th century pacing, a studied pacing. Rich in texture of all kinds, well written and well acted, this is a movie that will reward many repeat viewings.",Open Range
93,jmorrison-2,Superb Film,9,19 September 2005,"An engrossing, well-made film. This movie takes it's time to make it's points, and that is genuinely appreciated by a certain segment of the movie-going public. The film takes it's time to develop the characters, and develop the circumstances that lead to the climactic showdown. Maybe the only complaint I might have is the sometimes overly stilted diaglogue, but it works, for the most part.The story of prideful men, living a hard life in the latter days of the American frontier. These are men with regretful episodes in their past, but they believe in moral good, trust among men, and living life with dignity. They are willing to stand up when these things are breeched, and take men to task for trespassing.Robert Duvall has probably never been better as Boss Spearman, a trail boss who has learned to live life the hard way. One of the best lines in the movie is delivered by Abraham Benrubi (Mose) about Robert Duvall's character. After a storm, Boss goes out looking for the crew's horses. After a time, Boss comes riding back into camp with all the horses rounded up. Mose looks on admiringly, and says ""Ol' Boss...he sure can cowboy, can't he?"".Kevin Costner is excellent in his role as Charley Waite, a man still haunted by a somewhat murderous past. It is Boss's moral courage, coupled with Charley's underlying explosive violence, that keeps you spellbound as the two confront the brutal town bosses and their henchmen.Annette Bening, James Russo and Michael Gambon are excellent in their roles, and makes this a very entertaining western.A fine movie; well-acted and well-made.",Open Range
94,Casablanca3784,Back in the Saddle Again?,5,22 August 2003,"Back in the saddle again? I'm talking about Kevin Costner's big comeback movie. It was supposed to have put him back in the saddle etc.but I didn't see it that way. No siree..no way. I mean it was better than ""Water World"" which was one of the biggest of all Hollywood losers but 'twasnt close to ""Dancing with Wolves."" Mr. Costner hasn't had a hit in how many years? Seems like decades and this one ain't it, pard. To begin with, Robert Duvall steals the picture because that man is so great at what he does, he outdoes anyone teaming up with him. Costner is a little boy compared to him. Then there's the problem with DANK, DARK and LIFELESS. Holy smokes, it seemed that the whole thing took place in a basement with a night light on. Rough on the peepers, to say the least. There was nothing original about the film. The same old same old. Cattle grazers versus ranchers.Big deal. Corrupt lawmen. Big deal. A gunfight at the not O.K.Corral. Big deal. If you thought you had seen a lot of rain in ""Road to Perdition,"" watch out.

95,tubby1,Zzzzzzz,3,2 October 2013,"You certainly see a lot of fields in Open Range. Fields in the sun, fields in the rain, fields with cattle in. Oh, and in the foreground - a woefully spurious film concerning freegrazers and their conflict with the authority of a small town called Harmonville. How did this film get made? Over two hours long and it proceeds to step on every stereotype. There are no shades of grey it is good versus bad. The villagers of Harmonville are but playthings - they are 'good people'. The good people utter indignation at the 'bad men' - the authority. However, we never see the bad men ill-treat the populace but we have to accept such things. Oh, and the authority are just utterly bad men no conflict there.Open Range tries measly to bring a moral string to proceedings. Charley Waite (Kevin Costner) conveys a sense of past ill-doings in conversation with the prim and proper Boss Spearman (David Duvall)but this is mere snippets in a vast emptiness of narrative - it is a very weak pretense to setup a redemptive arch. The necessary love story? This seems to be an afterthought to fill the vacuum left by the expansive running time. Squimish, utterly laughable at times it treats the audience as prehistoric beings with the most toe-curling narrative I think I have seen, and the most soppy score in tail.

96,CihanVercan,A Sour Taste of Unforgiven at an Eastern-style Western,5,24 July 2008,"We've watched Open Range at a movie theater in Turkey, with my campus buddies in my past university years. Then after a couple years, I found myself renting the DVD version to have some rest at my apartment in Canada. Staying lonely at my place, I thought to get some team spirit from this western. From my second view of the movie, I thanked God that I was not living in country; for Open Range has implicated metropolitan suburban solitude to a such good story.Despite the storyline is worthy to get satisfied a little, the audience of Open Range must not have any technical and performance-based expectations. Cinematography and camera movements are low-class for a western. Plus, I am not pleased to find a silent-western. This silence has some remembrance from Dances With Wolves or Wyatt Earp, if you have expected to see Kevin Costner as the Kevin Costner we know. Even though, there is no heroic elements nor any sensational piece of news. Moreover, there was no harmony between Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall. It seemed to me, they were sullen to each other as long as the movie goes. We can count up the number of times they look at each other in the eye, being under-oath mates; that makes us remember the duo of Clint Eastwood & Morgan Freeman in Unforgiven, who were speaking the silent language of the friendship glances. Basically, the cast was not in the mood to make a Western, if their main purpose is not to make an migration-to-country Eastern.Out of the duo of Costner & Duvall, there is a successful joint named Annette Bening. Sadly confessing am I, that she is the only contribution to the movie to make it worth-to-see. So by the acting aid of Annette Bening, I gave Open Range 5 out of 10. Because, every sketch and every mimic of her; bonds us back to the story at the point where we got lost and fell into sleep as I did each time I saw this movie. It is incontestably evident her self-denial rises up the dramas to the industrial Hollywood standards, clearly acceptable since her magnificent effort from the 1999 masterpiece American Beauty.",Open Range
97,colonel_green,"Ride on, Mr. Costner...but not into the sunset.",9,17 August 2004,"I've always felt that Kevin Costner takes an unnecessarily hard rap, and that the derision that greets his work these days is wholely unjustified. Many actors have made far worse films than ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"", and are still making movies.  For the record, I haven't seen ""Waterworld"", but I enjoyed ""The Postman"". In the summer of 2003, Costner's newest Western arrived, heavily financed with Costner's own money.  It was a quiet release, earning back its budget and then some, and earned a small following amongst those who had seen it. If you asked me, it deserved to be much more widely seen.  It deserved to resuscitate Costner's reputation and career.  But Mr. Costner must be content with satisfaction of having produced a quality motion picture. Costner directs and stars in ""Open Range"", along with Robert Duvall, and Annette Bening, with supporting work by Diego Luna, Michael Gambon, James Russo, Abraham Benrubi, and Michael Jeter.  Costner does not admittedly have great range as an actor, but he's is quite good at playing the stoic, troubled loner, which he does here.  Duvall and Bening are excellent, with Duvall getting the livelier of the two cowboy hero roles, and Bening doing a lot with a little material as Costner's love interest.  Gambon plays the lead villain, although he has so little screentime and speaks so incomprehensibly that he isn't particularly memorable.  Diego Luna and Abraham Benrubi are the other two members of Costner/Duvall's ranchers, and James Russo play's Gambon's privately operated sheriff. The story involves a conflict between Costner and Duvall, who are ""free-grazers"", and Gambon, who is a stationary rancher.  The conflict escalates, and the townspeople are caught in the middle. The film is carried by the actors, and by the strength of the production staff.  The cinematography is excellent, making the Canadian province of Alberta look beautiful on the big screen.  Music is also good, although not on par with the music in Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"". The highlight of ""Open Range"" is the climactic shootout, a small war that is unlike any other Western gunfight ever committed to film.  Costner can film action, and he doesn't shy away from blood.  The denouement could perhaps have been speeded up a bit, but that is a minor complaint. Perhaps the best decision that Costner made was to allow the film to be a straight Western, rather than mocking the genre's cliches.  Here, Robert Duvall gives an heroic speech without a single trace of irony or self parody, and phrases like 'partner' and 'I reckon' are used in a similar fashion. I give it a 9/10.  Let's see more work like this from Mr. Costner.",Open Range
98,bjones,Great Film,9,25 August 2003,"I had high hopes this wouldn't be yet another disappointment going in and I was very happy with the result by the time I left the theater. Costner has directed another film to rival ""Dances With Wolves"" and I couldn't be happier. This story is smaller in scope but not in story or impact. It's the classic tale of good versus evil done with realism and shepherded through by a cast of wonderful actors and actresses. I would place it along with such classic all-time greats as ""The Searchers"", ""True Grit"", ""Wyatt Earp"" and his ""Wolves"" again.Kevin Costner himself plays one of the major characters as a man who has been hiding from his own personal demons and has to finally come to grips with them and life. He then uses his past experiences to fight against evil, scoring solidly on the believability scale.His employer is amply played by the marvelous Robert Duvall who almost steals the movie. He plays a simple yet insightful man with hidden secrets of his own.The always fetching Annette Bening plays a wonderful part as an old maid of a woman who is still waiting for a good and kind man to come along. She does a terrific job of injecting just enough of a classy feminine counterpoint to give the film the needed touch of humanity and tenderness and keeping it from being just another paean to brutal violence like so many action movies. Instead it gives us characters we can cheer for, including her. She is, as Costner puts it, ""one handsome woman."" She has rarely been presented simpler or more beautifully. She is truly one of the world's most beautiful women and a terrific actress (unlike some who like to neutralize the gender identification of the job title, I personally think there is not a thing wrong with being female so I like to acknowledge the contribution women make in a more deserving way.) Her role here is at least worth an Oscar nomination, if not a win.Several superb character actors lend their huge talents to this effort, most notably among them being Michael Jeter. He does an outstanding job with a likable, sympathetic character. Look for Oscar to give him a gift. Of the rest of the cast the other most notable performance was the turn from Abraham Benrubi as Mose. His character is a lovable bear of a young man whose trouble precipitates the action in the film.Not to be left out from deserving praise is the selection of the wonderfully beautiful location for the film in Canada. It is truly one of the world's most beautiful places and the film uses it to great advantage to establish just the right mood of space needed as the backdrop. Next in order are the costumes and sets. Not the usual glitzy Hollywood of the past but the newer age of those striving for more realism. Even the weapon selections was well done and accurately presented, with one possible exception: in the opening scene of the showdown between good and evil Costner apparently fires about 12 rounds from his 6-shot pistol. It did appear at that point that he was carrying only one pistol, although a few seconds later he was clearly seen with 2. Perhaps he had 2 and it just wasn't clearly shown. It was the only maybe in an otherwise masterfully done action sequence.The final dressing, the music and sound were first rate. The score was a great addition and set a perfect yet unobtrusive mood. The sound, especially in the gun fighting sequences, was just about the best I have ever seen put on film. In all reality, the sound level was likely artificially done and set a touch louder than normal for an enhanced feeling of realism. But, in point of fact, in real life, close range gunfights such as were depicted here are extremely, deafeningly noisy. The associated special effects, though well done for movie effects, were almost too over-the-top compared to realistic gunshot wounding. One that many people might think was bad but was actually extremely realistic was the final shooting sequence with Duvall against Michael Gambon as Baxter, the evil rancher. It really does happen like that folks. Superb touch Mr. Costner and thanks for adding yet another fine film to my Christmas list.",Open Range
99,Captain Ed,Oddly bright film doesn't completely fulfill its promise **SPOILERS**,7,6 September 2003,"'Open Range' is certainly successful as entertainment even if it doesn't completely work as intended.  There are some fine performances to be seen, notably Robert Duvall's work as Boss Spearman.   The cinematography is artful, especially in the first part of the movie where the action stays on the 'range'.  But the plot doesn't entirely add up, Costner's Charley Waite doesn't entirely add up, and the ending is so oddly upbeat you wonder what Costner & Company was trying to say.The problem with Westerns is the pressure filmmakers feel to connect the film to a greater ethos of vanishing America, and Open Range tries this through the somewhat arcane issue of free-grazing.  Baxter's [Micheal Gambon] fierce opposition of free-grazing and his corruption of local law enforcement represents the decline of individualism and freedom during the American Industrial Revolution.  The film never does play fair in this dispute, however -- after all, to a large extent America won the West based on building towns, farms, and ranches, and free-grazers infringed on all of those who invested in these, and besides, property rights are a cornerstone of American freedom.  (If the producers don't believe that, I wonder how they would feel about all of us bootlegging this movie?) 
Also, it was the towns that served as bases to clear out Native Americans -- in fact the town in the movie had been an Army fort before.  These tribes would also have been very hostile to free-grazers, but by this time Charley and Boss don't even worry about them.  In other words, Charley and Boss are exploiting the security that townspeople, farmers, and ranchers provide without giving any compensation at all.  In this context, you can see why Baxter would act the way he does, and then you could show that without him being the stereotypically evil b*****d rancher so common in Westerns.**Spoilers**During the movie, Charley alludes to a dark past during the Civil War of which he is ashamed, which leads you to expect a meltdown á la Unforgiven or The Ninth Configuration, but nothing ever really comes of it.  Even during the brilliant gun battle at the end of the movie (one of the best I've seen on film), he doesn't do anything but react like anyone else would in combat. You keep expecting a reckoning with the dark past he keeps talking about, but all it really does is impact the love-story subplot with Annette Bening in a way that winds up feeling more contrived than anything else.There's a bit of High Noon too, although the townies eventually decide to help out, and the ending will satisfy the die-hard cheery optimists in the audience but leave the rest of us scratching our heads, wondering what it was the filmmakers were trying to say.  If it's that freedom is worth dying for, well, that doesn't happen here.  If it's that freedom is worth killing for, I can buy that, but then the film should have been framed that way, and Charley's attitude about his past doesn't make a lot of sense.  If the point of the movie is just that the good guys win with no real consequences, then the gun battle becomes more of a cartoon than anything else.  And if it's just that Kevin gets Annette ... <sigh>However, I still think it's the most entertaining film from Costner since Tin Cup, mostly because he manages to stay within his own limitations as an actor most of the time, and it's well worth seeing in the theater.  If you're expecting another Unforgiven or even Hang 'Em High, you'll be a bit disappointed, but otherwise you'll enjoy it.  7/10",Open Range

102,Ben-Hibburd,Open Range Review.,7,12 September 2017,"Open Range is written by Craig Storper and directed by Kevin Costner. It's an affectionate throwback to classic Westerns of the 1950s. The film stars Robert Duvall as Boss Spearman, an open range cattleman alongside his hired hands Charley Waite(Kevin Costner), Button(Diego Luna) and Mose(Abraham Benrubi) as they travel the west free-grazing with their cattle herd.After an altercation with ruthless land owner Denton Baxter(Michael Gambon) in a near by town. Baxter uses his hired guns to force them off his land, resulting in a fatal casualty. Launching Boss Spearman and Charley Waite into a quest for justice against Baxter, and the corrupt sheriffs on his payroll.There's a-lot to admire with Open Range. Firstly the cinematography by J. Michael Muro(who'd previously worked with Costner on Dances with Wolves.) is beautifully shot. Using natural landscapes, and a fully realised town, the film feels authentic in its setting. Robert Duvall also gives one his best performances ever, and at times he carries the movie(He should've received an Oscar nomination).The film does have some scripting and pacing issues though. Midway through the second act things slow down considerably for a under- developed love story between Waite and the town nurse Sue Barlow(Annette Bening). The acting and on-screen chemistry from both Costner and Bening is fine. This sub-plot however felt rushed, and only there to raise the stakes in the films climax. Also Michael Gambon is completely wasted in this film. He's barely given any material to work with, other then to just snarl at the camera which he does with joyous vigour.However as the film enters into it's third act and the showdown begins the film kicks in high gear. Costner directs a thrilling shootout in classic Western style. The geography of the shootout is excellent, as Boss and Waite navigate through the town, as they fend off the corrupt officials and Baxters hired guns.Open Range is a love-letter to classic Hollywood Westerns. It's a beautifully constructed film that's largely held up by fantastic acting and its thrilling climax. In the end the film suffers from pacing issues, and has too many side plots that are under-developed which stops the film short of greatness. The film doesn't quite have the depth or introspective stoicism of a film like Unforgiven that it thinks it does, to elevate itself beyond being a well crafted genre film.",Open Range
103,Mickey-2,A western that can be called a triumph for the industry; Costner and Duvall hit on all the marks.,10,8 February 2004,"""Open Range"" is a film that is to be a monument to the true talents and abilities of Hollywood to get something right.  Kevin Costner stars in, and also directs, the film, but the real performance comes from Robert Duvall, who portrays the leader, or boss, of a small cattle drive.Duvall, playing Boss Spearman, is a man that has refused to change with the times around him, he has his own ways of doing things, and they have worked for many years.  He's a good man, even though stubborn, has a sense of decency and fair play about him, and refuses to compromise, or bend his principles.  Costner plays his partner, Charlie, a former gunman who has made it a quest to put the past behind him, and make a go of life with Boss as his guide.The cattle herd is driven on open range, and allowed to graze freely by Boss and Charlie.  However, there is a rancher, Denton Baxter, played by Michael Gambon, who feels that ""free-grazers"" are a blight upon his range and should be exterminated like the varmits they are.  One of the four cattle drivers, Mose, is sent to town to get some supplies, does not return, and when Boss and Charlie go searching for him, they find that Baxter's paid for sheriff has him locked up, and has also been part of a group that beat him up. Upon paying some fines, and told by Baxter to leave the area promptly, Boss and Charlie decide to make a stand and oppose the lawless elements in the town, including Baxter.  The occurring gunfight is more realistic than many others that have been staged in previous westerns, but it is well worth the wait.""Open Range"" features powerful characterizations, some tragic scenes, and some parts that simply lift the viewer's spirits to a high level.  The cast members, besides those already mentioned, include Annette Bening, whom Charlie falls for, and Michael Jeter, in sadly, his last performance. There are also touches of humor; one classic case comes before the final confrontation, Boss wants some candy and some fine cigars.  He asks the local storekeeper for the finest chocolate in the store, two bars of bittersweet chocolate are produced, came all the way from Switzerland, Europe, and according to the storekeeper, ""will melt in your mouth.""  Boss asks how he knows that, has he tried it himself, and when he learns that the storekeeper has not, can't afford it, Boss gives him a piece of his just purchased candy.This film is simply a fine addition to the DVD collection of western fans, and it shows true acting genius, combined with a great story, and epic action on screen.  10/10, but wish I could go higher.",Open Range
104,LouE15,"Lovely to watch: a big, generous and sedate Western for almost-grown-ups.",9,14 December 2007,"I really, really like pretty much everything about this film: it's what Kevin ""I AM middle America"" Costner was made to create. Never mind the turgid and chaotic ""Waterworld"", even cast aside sympathetic revisionist ""Dances with Wolves"": this is the ""The Untouchables"" of his directing career. Taking the time-honoured Western theme of a greedy cattle baron clashing with honest citizens in the late nineteenth century as the backdrop, love of many things is explored, in a way that is more subtle and tender than you'd expect from a major film from a major star. ""Open Range"" takes its time, and isn't unnecessarily violent or brash in its love of the gun (though there's plenty of this to be seen). It's a conservative film, with a small, pleasingly honest 'c'.Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner are ""Boss"" and Charley, long-time cowpokes who travel with a small outfit (including big man Mose, the cook, and young foundling Button), bringing their cattle great distances, grazing the prairie, and living rough, lonely lives. The film takes its time showing you their relationships, and how their life is lived; until they stumble across the wrong town and the wrong man: cattle baron Baxter, played by Michael Gambon, who pulls the strings of the corrupt Marshall, and the town.(small spoilers from here) Costner's flat delivery for once works well here: yes, Charley's a hero (of course), but he's no orator, and he's not always a happy man. You understand clearly that in taking the stand that he comes to take, he feels himself to be going back in time, to a darker version of himself. The excellent Robert Duvall is the faded but still stubborn and strong ""Boss"" Spearman. He inhabits the skin of a real man – sometimes more so than Costner's character, forced to play too constantly the part of the heroic lonely warrior – and you understand, watching Duvall's face, his speaking eyes, and his steady movements, that he is constantly weighing up the consequences of everything that happens. He won't start trouble, but he won't avoid it if it's coming. Weather or gunmen, death or a future: it's all the same to him.The men encounter femininity in the form of Sue (Annette Bening), the sister of the doctor they approach for help. She's absolutely wonderful. Not only Bening's acting, but the character she plays, fit into the whole like fine dovetailed wood. She's gentle and beautiful and not young – much like the film, like the land. She isn't playing a woman ten years her own junior, and she isn't slathered in makeup. Her hair isn't magnificently braided by a team of stylists; and her home, while beautiful, isn't lavish. Some of the metaphors in the film may be a bit obvious, but it doesn't diminish the effect overall. Sue is represented nicely by her beautiful delicate china tea things: when she says of them ""they're the only thing of my mother's that survived the journey here"", she could just as well be talking of herself. Charley's encounters with this tea set are echoes of his encounters with Sue, a well drawn visual counterpoint. It's a good idea and works well within the film.There are more than a few nods to Kurosawa's masterpiece ""The Seven Samurai"" in the drawing of the central characters, and particularly in the fearful townsfolk who just want a quiet life, and who are finally roused to indignation and activity when their champions are set upon. There are one or two elements that are a teensy bit 'pat' (e.g. I didn't like Gambon's cartoonish Northern Irish baddie). Europeans don't necessarily share the vision of America as a place fighting through muck to glory (perhaps why they often make such interesting Westerns - see ""Eagle's Wing""). However, this very American film is a hugely enjoyable film experience. I have a lot of respect for ""Open Range"": it takes its place quite rightly in a tradition of 'quiet' Westerns (see also ""Will Penny""), and Costner should be proud of his achievement, soppy old liberal that he is, bless him.",Open Range
105,Critical Eye UK,Out of range,3,4 January 2005,"Contains some spoilers.With a plot that could've come from any early 60s Bonanza episode, 'Open Range' needs more than wide-screen photography and a Michael Kamen score to escape its own self-imposed limitations. And there is more: the attention to detail, to place as well as time bespeaks of a thoughtfulness entirely lacking in TV and movie westerns of a half century ago. But. . .It's not enough. Though screenwriter Craig Storper tries hard to bring a new perspective to some of the oldest clichés in the book, there are, after all, only so many dead dogs, saved dogs, murdered innocents, love-lorn women, brave doctors, cowed yet ultimately redeemed townsfolk, lovable old rogues and mad, sad bad men that an audience can take before fatigue sets in.As a director, Costner once again shows himself to be capable of handling sweeping landscapes and beautiful vignettes with a competence as least the equal of Eastwood (and that's praise indeed). What he hasn't got, however, is a theme of equally epic sweep: 'Dances With Wolves' had it, as did Eastwood's 'Unforgiven', but unfortunately what 'Open Range' has is Michael Gambon.If there's been a worst screen performance by any major actor in the past year, lead me to it, because Gambon here is spectacularly awful. The script may not have given him much to play with  one-dimensionality is the hallmark of 'Open Range'  but he surely had ample opportunity to decide which accent he wished to deploy before going in front of the camera.Costner, too, is awkward: there's a lightness about the voice, and an intelligence about the face, that militates against the notion of the stone killer he attempts to essay. In truth, you need more than a back-story clumsily told (as is the case here). You need Charles Bronson.Duvall, as ever, is excellent, just by being Duvall: Ben Johnson managed a similar feat, and the results are always a joy to watch. But even that joy is marred by the climax to which 'Open Range' improbably heads: a gun fight almost as well choreographed as anything by Peckinpah, and equally as absurd as anything by Peckinpah.What makes it even more ludicrous is the film's previous insistence on getting its history and its facts right, and begs the question as to why those involved even bothered with credibility: there never was as violent an outcome to any dispute in the West as that chronicled by 'Open Range' -- nor so high a body account in any shoot-out. (Even Cimino's unfairly maligned 'Heaven's Gate' had more authenticity, and a greater reverence for both literary and cinematic truth).'Open Range' is thus a disappointment in almost every respect, an attempt at an epic which never once flies as high as its own aspirations.As a genre, the Western isn't dead, yet one is increasingly left with the feeling that 1967's 'Once Upon A Time In The West' did it all, and said it all, and that until another film-maker emerges of the same calibre as Sergio Leone  unlikely: genius is the most rare commodity of them all  then it is Leone's masterpiece which will continue to serve as the last word on the myth, the magic, and the mayhem of an era as fabulous, in a literal sense, as any fair story told before or since.'Open Range': 3/10.",Open Range

It is similar to Unforgiven, brought to you by Dances With Wolves. Awesome scenery. Perfect pace. Top-notch acting. The story is (mostly) western-worthy.(Fun fact: M Gambon, the Irish bad-guy in this was a flashback to R Harris, the English ""Duck of Death"" in Unforgiven. Well, Harris was the original Dumbledore in HP&... films. Then Gambon followed Harris as Dumbledore when Harris died. Interesting: Open Range must have been casted just after Gambon was announced as the next Dumbledore, giving Costner a clear choice how to give homage to Unforgiven.2 nit-picks:1. The Irish bad-guy & specifically Gambon stand out as a bad idea.2. They (esp Boss) talk aggressively about killing people. Then Boss goes around with some strange code of when it is or is not ""OK"" to kill people. The entire discussion is twisted & wearisome. IN the end, most of their killing is shown to be passive-aggressive, as if that somehow makes them more noble. YAWN!",Open Range

So, briefly  good film; very 'modern' western, in a meaningful, paced kinda way. Good performances, pretty cinematography, good gunfight and, pleasingly, an actual storyline of which the gunfight is part (as opposed to a series of events designed to get from fight to fight). I enjoyed the film and it is worth watching. However, here's the moan  why does nobody make light westerns anymore? Has there been a western since Young Guns II that wasn't slow, deliberate, lengthy and intent on demystifying things? OK, I get it now, Hollywood. The west has been demythologised enough.

110,GHCool,Very Well Done,9,1 September 2003,"OPEN RANGE did a pretty good job of showing what life might have been like in the western United States circa 1882.  I'm not a big fan of Kevin Costner, but here he gives what I think might be his best performance. In fact, all of the actors in this movie were pretty strong.  Special praise goes out to Robert Duvall who created a really likable and interesting character.Some people didn't like this film because they thought the pacing was too slow.  I agree that at times, the film dragged a little, but if you're willing to stick with it, I think OPEN RANGE is ultimately a rewarding film. That shootout sequence at the end was pretty exciting.",Open Range
111,winopaul,Great solid Western,8,25 April 2017,"What a great simple straightforward story, told well. No time-line chopping, just a nice linear story. No tragic hero that dies in the end. Just good guys and bad guys, and a happy ending, the way a Western should be. Can you believe the Hispanic kid was not killed off? What is remarkable is that I like the movie but I dislike Costner. Not as bad as I hate some other actors, but if you watch the bonus feature, he is almost as narcissistic as Tom Cruise in his bonus interview in The Last Samurai. It helps that Costner wears a beard so he is less recognizable to me, and his voice is not too obnoxious.Another really stunning thing is that they used an older Annette Bening instead of some barely-legal fluff babe as the female lead. Bening is at the height of her power as an actress. Small things she did were really expressive, it was a joy to watch. All the talent was great, as was the camera work and editing. Yeah, it moved slowly, but I didn't care, I so enjoyed being transported back there, watching something that seemed based on believable human behavior, not Hollywood action-porn. This was obviously written before the time of first-person-shooter video games and I love it for that.I still put True Grit as the best Western. After that, I used to put Tombstone. I never liked Unforgiven that much. So this was a great pleasure, as I would slot this in ahead of Tombstone, a solid #2. The voice-over in Tombstone makes it more like you are looking at the period. This movie immerses you in the period. You feel like you are living there back then.Last week at the library I was cursed by my selection of Child 44, Atonement, and Cowboys and Aliens. Now I knew C&A was a stinker, that is why I took it it out, but the other two were a real disappointment. So this week its this flick, Breach, and the X-men future passed movie. This movie alone was worth the trip to the library, and Breach was darn good as well.

112,paradux,Even the nuances are nuanced,8,11 June 2017,"First of all this is piece of film history.Costner was just coming to the end of an extraordinary run where he was so popular with audiences that he was even playing parts which, with hindsight, were way beyond his range. (Like for example Robin Hood.) Here he was both in front of the camera and behind it. And doing great work in each position.Duvall had been working in films since the 1950s and was still carving out his legacy with extraordinary roles like this one.And Bening also was reaching the stage in her career where she would no longer solely provide the ""love interest"" for an entire film.But all that was yet to come. In 2003 these actors were the peak of their craft and they picked up this film and carried it to the finish line.The script is to die for. The sub-texts of loyalty, secrecy among men, and respect for your employer are rare, and to be treasured. The revenge theme is wonderful and deeply nuanced. The chocolate bar scene is unforgettable.An amazing movie and highly recommended.",Open Range
113,Pamsanalyst,Nothing great,5,2 November 2004,"I saw the beginning several times on cable; with so many things to do in the world it was hard to hold my interest. Then one day ladyfriend and I saw the gunfight which made me want to see the entire film, which I did last night. It seemed like it was filmed in real time, like it would take forever to get to the climax, and then when it did, we had to be dragged through a drawn out wrap up.The story is a slight reversal of homesteaders versus ranchers, for in this part of the world the cattlemen are the heroes, at least the men who want open spaces for grazing. The most positive thing I can say about this chapter is that it is not Heaven's Gate. Other thoughts: 1. Bening has never been lovelier. 2. Saw a History Channel documentary on the invention of smokeless powder which they said happened in 1882, the year of the film. The gunfight is smokeless when clarity is needed, but shrouded in the fog of war at other times. 3. Costner gets to deliver the Eastwood lines: he robs them of any emotion with his flat voice that lacks conviction. 4. It would have made more sense for Duvall to rescue the drowning dog; Costner shows not one element that such acts would occur to him. 5. Michael Gambon and the rest of the bad guys just don't cut it. There is no all pervading evil in the sheriff; he is a lazy man simply drawing his pay in the service of a greedy one. He is more like Nottingham in the Errol Flynn Robin Hood, not Little Bill of Big Whiskey. 6. Did towns simply spring up like flowers in the old west? There seems to be no reason for this one to exist: no railroad like there was in Big Whiskey. 7. Who was guarding Duvall's cattle while the boys settled up in town?Summing up: Unforgiven this is not.",Open Range
114,rbsjrx,Very much a traditional western,8,4 April 2005,"Open Range is every inch a traditional western, which is both good and bad. Its central theme is freedom vs. corruption, its protagonists the prototypical strong silent types with deep convictions worth fighting and, if necessary, dying for. There are grand vistas and many scenes play out just as they have in countless other westerns, e.g. the climactic gunfight.[..minor spoilers ahead..]So, how well does this film work on its own merits? Pretty well, actually. Kevin Costner (admittedly not one of my favorites) plays much the same sort of role as Clint Eastwood played in his most recent westerns (""Pale Rider"" and ""Unforgiven""). His is, by turns, both taciturn and morally conflicted. From quite early in the film, we suspect that he has the requisite fighting skills to level the playing field against the villainous rancher's army of henchmen, yet his past is only slowly revealed. Robert Duvall offers up one of the best performances of his career as his equally taciturn boss with a few darks secrets of his own in his past. The supporting characters are uniformly excellent and the plot reveals itself at a deliberate pace which matches the escalating violence leading to the inevitable showdown. Annette Benning does a great job playing the strong frontier woman who gradually becomes Costner's love interest.So what doesn't work? As with most things, the devil is in the details. In following the formula of so many westerns before it, it falls into some of the same traps. Its tone of gritty realism is broken by some obvious lapses common to a traditional western. One of the most obvious is when, during the climactic gunfight, Costner the director never bothers with details like how many shots you can get from a revolver before you have to reload. In one particular scene, you can clearly count Costner getting off 7 shots from his Colt revolver in rapid succession - this even though he'd obviously just been firing it without reloading before the string of 7 began. There are other examples, but I won't nit pick just in case the reader doesn't find them as obvious as I do.Without these lapses, I would have rated this a 9 or 10. With them, I still only dropped it down to 8 since it does tell its tale well.One thing does perplex me, though... The film is rated R when it really deserves a PG-13. The language is certainly cleaner than many current PG-13 films. The romance between Costner and Benning develops slowly (at least by movie standards) and is chaste as befits the characters and the time period. The violence is there, but hardly on the same scale as many other films which have received a PG-13 rating. Again, this is in line with its classic western genre - westerns didn't begin to get R ratings before such films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and Eastwood's spaghetti westerns.",Open Range

With his directorial results, it's hard to imagine how Kevin Costner gets the backing to make the films he does - until one remembers ""Dances with Wolves"" (1990). So, I guess it's true that one success will pay for five failures. Unfortunately, must we endure two more attempts before investors will give up? I just hope there's no confusion with directorial vs. acting success - otherwise, we have lots of mediocrity to look forward to.After ""Unforgiven"" (1992), I thought there would be a rebirth of the western genre, but Costner evidently believes in tradition.

High in character development (we really care about these people) and rich in authentic Western movie action (people get BLOWN away!), Open Range delivers on almost every level. Even before I saw the movie with my own eyes, I declared that it would win a Best Picture Oscar. And now, after having seen it, I'm still 90% sure that it will. Undoubtedly, it will receive a WELL-deserved nomination.One cannot help but to be reminded of ""UNFORGIVEN"", another movie that allows us to see the human, emotional, thoughtful side of having to kill. (Perhaps people really DID think twice before they gunned folk down. And maybe not EVERYONE was a crack shot and WANTING to get into a gun battle every 10 minutes.)My only beefs: 1) we never see this huge herd that we hear so much about.2) After we see Costner riding off into the sunset after promising to come back and marry Annette, we see him in short order, back at the house, but we aren't told how much time has elapsed until he tells us. A mistake in direction. 3) Too much whining from Buttons. It made it kinda hard to like him, and to understand why Duvall likes him.Will it win Best Picture? You bet.

There are a number of made for TV movies and series, as well as the infamous ""Deadwood,"" but as a whole this is a genre from a different time. It is therefore hard to compare ""Open Range"" to any other recent material, so it will need to stand on its own merits.Strong performances and actors with genre experience are always necessary for a good western. Both Kostner and Duvall have considerable western experience and it shows. I was particularly impressed by Duvall's performance. He is in his 70s by this point and can still play a very believable, rough and tumble character. Very impressive. Kostner also holds his own as well and looks like he hasn't aged a day since Dances With Wolves (at least until he takes off his hat), over 13 years ago. Both actors have remarkable chemistry.The story set up is fairly original - the protagonists are neither lawmen nor loners/drifters but hard working cattlemen. The antagonists are all relatively one-sided and unlikable if not downright despicable, as are most western villains. It's a time tested formula that almost always helps the story, even if it is cliché.I am a bit of a biased lover of the western, so I cannot find too much to fault here. Although the set up is not something I've seen in a western, the development of the story is not very original and the progression predictable. This is more of an observation than a flaw, since I was interested the whole time and in the end more than satisfied with the experience. Recommended for any who enjoy the genre.",Open Range

This time the photography and editing and sound and so on are so good that you can ignore the old-school dialogue and still follow the satisfyingly conventional story without any trouble. And it's fun to see an old-school Western (though they all do this now) with proper period costumes, hair, furniture, lamps, vehicles, typefaces, muddy streets, misfiring weapons, etc., and also with women who don't wear eye liner and shadow. Like all of Costner's films, it's unexciting. There's nothing really mean-spirited in it, which also means there's also nothing really funny in it. But it's politically neutral, in the style of most of the big Westerns made since the '80s, being neither mythic nor agitated. Rather like Bill Clinton, it wants to do good yet sell tickets; the impulses cancel one another out, leaving only a highly entertaining show behind. Amen. And Costner had the sense this time around to stay out of the way and let Duvall do a lot of the work. It's as if he's finally accepted that he's never going to be Richard Widmark, let alone John Wayne. The man can't carry a movie in the big traditional way (ROBIN HOOD).

How can any professional actor/director actually allow such a line?Scene about 1/3 into the movie:  Costner and Duvall standing right outside of the cafe after run-in with the Marshall, Costner stands in the rain and the camera shifts to an angle shooting from the alley to show Costner, Duvall says come in out of the rain, they talk some more, then both of them walk and the camera angle again shoots from the alley...its as if something sinister is supposed to happen, but nothing does in that scene.Last 20 minutes of the movie (thought it would never end), Costner is shot in the leg, Bening is summoned to a tavern where Costner is laying on the bar, he starts to get up, she says ""you don't need to stand up"", then he goes on to say he will be leaving.  Then later he comes to her house and asks her to marry him, then she and him and Duvall all ride out of town, then she decides to go back, but he and Duvall are going to buy a Saloon, and he might come back, end of movie.Its like they couldn't decide what ending to have, so they just did them all.

Big fan of Duvall and a huge fan of Kevin Costner, particularly when Kevin is in this kind of role in which he plays a deadly workmanlike gunman as well as a very convincing cowboy, at least as convincing as I can imagine. The chemistry between the trail boss (Duvall), his segundo (foreman or second, Costner) and the drovers (Benrubi who doubled as cook and Luna) was perfect and the interplay was spot on! Kevin you did a great job as director but how could a gut shot man 
ride away shortly after the shoot out with no apparent disability? This unreality almost ruined the film for me and I'm glad it was at the end cause had it been in the beginning I probably wouldn't have watched any further. By the way I was pleased your character didn't settle down as it would have been completely out of character for the character! All in all a very good film and well worth 140 minutes of my life!",Open Range
127,obiwan2005,Hopefully this will revive the Western genre,10,14 September 2003,"Kevin Costner's Open Range has given me a new love. Western movies. The movie is so quaint and simple, it reminds us we don't need exploding astroids and car chases to enjoy a movie. Charlie and Boss (Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall) are cattle drivers who come across a band of cattle snatchers, who are also corrupting a small town. After their partners are attacked, Boss and Charlie take it upon themselves to liberate the town from the evil Marshall Denton Baxter (Micheal Gambon) and Sheriff Poole (James Russo). Also, Charlie is finding himself falling for the town nurse, Sue Barlow (Annette Benning). She really does have an old fashion beauty, like Mary Steenburgen had in 'Back to the Future Part III'. The whole time watching this, I wanted to go back in time, to the simpler life of the old west. Costner really paints a beautiful picture of the past. But Costner is not the star, Duvall (or Bobby D) owns this picture. He is really good as the hard ass old timer that knows how to rough a feller up. He should be nominated for an Oscar for this. He is certainly a man's actor. This movie should open the door for more good westerns, like the ones back in the 60's. Ones with A-list actors. All and all, a great epic of a movie.**** out of ****",Open Range
128,compi24,"Review Of ""Open Range""",6,13 January 2012,"""Open Range"" is a 2003 film directed by and starring Kevin Costner. The movie tells the story of two cattle ranchers (Costner, Duvall) who are forced to take up arms when threatened by corrupt lawmen. The movie to me looked like it was gonna' be a slightly boring film about life on the. . .wait for it. . .open range. I was half right. A very large portion of this movie's beginning 45 minutes is about just that. However, past that point the movie picks up with a fairly plain, but still enjoyable plot. The characters in the movie are pretty good. Duvall's portrayal of Boss Spearman is the best in the film, by my opinion. I thought Costner's performance was a little stoic, but not bothersome (makes me think that that was the intention). The script was standard in terms of dialogue I guess. Then again, I wasn't alive during the 19th century, so I have no frame of reference. The best and most entertaining point in this film is the last hour where the film's most impressive set piece is set into motion - a really incredible gunfight happens. It's shot spectacularly well - a worthy testament of Costner's directorial aptitude. Through and through I found ""Open Range"" to be a fairly entertaining film with a great climax.",Open Range
129,wgingery,Duvall & Costner Revive the Old West,9,2 June 2018,"With Westerns coming along so seldom these days, it hardly seems fair to bring up a sometimes clumsy screenplay or a bit of sentimentality around the edges. The setting, photography and score work beautifully, and Costner on screen is like having an old buddy hangin' out with you.

131,the-evil-cult,"Pleasant, Well Crafted, Exhilarating Movie",8,1 March 2008,"Today I watched Open Range. It was a pretty good movie. Many may not like it because it is a Kevin Costner movie (Costner seems to have many haters).Open Range features a very explosive and action-packed climatic showdown near the end. Guns fire everywhere and bodies literally fly (which according to Mythbusters is not realistic). Before and after this showdown, the film develops the characters and plot. Free-graziers go through a town led by a tyrant whose men manage to kill one of them. Two of the free-graziers, played by Costner and Duvall, vow to head into the town and take down the tyrant to avenge the death of their friend. In true Western style, morality is settled by violence. However, in this Western, violence is used against the ""state"" and against the law, which goes against Biblical principles as well as putting the protagonist's actions into the realm of terrorism. Nevertheless, the American Constitution claims if government is corrupt then the people are to overtake it and that is why citizens bear arms.To conclude, Open Range is a great movie. It is violent but there is nothing too gory, gruesome, or shocking. There is a romantic element to the movie attached, which is pleasant and satisfactory.",Open Range
132,mike3386,A Fine Western Like a Fine Wine,9,30 August 2014,"I'm just getting around to writing a review of this fine 2003 movie, not for any lack of interest - love actually - but because some things are just too precious, too special to be talked about. Like that first love, a sick friend, or an outstanding Western. Not for want of something to say about the movie, the plot or the fine actors, but for fear of saying something wrong, something unworthy. It's not lost on me that Kevin Costner has done much to keep the Western genre alive; maybe something I say here can help a little also.So I better start right there - my bias. I love Westerns, always have always will, never saw a bad one, and this one sets a very high standard. Like Lonesome Dove, we FEEL rather than see the relationship between Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) and Charley Waite (Kevin Costner). It warms our hearts to EXPERIENCE the nurturing these two grizzled cowhands give two young cowboys, Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna).And like only Westerns can do, when the chips are down, we see the inner character of what a few good men - and women - can muster. And it is refreshing to see a female lead a little older than the usual Hollywood chippies; Annette Bening is so perfect for the role of Sue Barlow.Westerns seem to draw out good actors, and this is certainly true for Michael Jeter as Percy. One of Michael's last roles and it certainly did him proud. Other fine performances by James Russo as the totally vile Sheriff Poole, the shop keeper tasting fine chocolate, and hired gun Kim Coates as Butler.And the best for last - the gunfight. The SOUNDS of the gunfight, i.e., some of the most realistic sounding shots ever heard on screen. And the missing - more missed shots than ever seen in a duel in the street gunfight at sundown Western. Probably way more realistic and representative of what actually occurred.And what is a Western without at least one thunderstorm? You can almost smell the downpours, the wet wood of the new construction, the soaked dog, the drenched horses and cowboys. Much of this Western is eye candy - just sit there and savor the look of a fine pistol, the expanse of a western prairie, the soft glow of Sue Barlow's face.This is a movie to be enjoyed over and over again. A movie to help us remember what a fine cowboy Robert Duvall could play in this and other fine Westerns. The respect Kevin Costner showed for both Duvall the actor and for Boss Spearman the character . . . and the respect Kevin has for the Western as a still viable Hollywood movie genre.",Open Range

138,PrairieCal,Open Crock,1,18 August 2003,"I love westerns.  Perhaps that's why I found ""Open Range"" to be such a crock.  You've seen it all before, folks, and usually better done.  This is one long, slow moving cliche ... nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing even very interesting.When directors with aspirations of making a cinematic classic set out to create ""art,"" they can't succeed if they forget their number one obligation... to entertain.  ""Open Range"" will never be a classic and it's not very entertaining either.I'd heard the scenery and photography were breathtaking; they were average. If you want breathtaking cinematography, watch Sam Elliot's ""Conagher"" instead.  I'd heard that Robert Duvall was outstanding; he's not.  If you want to see him play the grizzled old cowboy, watch Lonesome Dove instead. Then it was a fresh, new, and vital portrayal; here it simply gives one deja moo.  I'd heard this was a story of a small band of good guys against a large band of bad guys. Watch ""The Magnificent Seven"" instead ... the characters are actually interesting.For me, perhaps the most aggravating aspect of ""Open Range"" were the several nose to nose dialogue scenes between Duvall and Costner.  It was obvious this was improv ... trite, lame, improv you can hear in any high school drama class.Although the performances of Annette Bening, Diego Luna, and Michael Gambon were appealing and extremely well done, nothing could save this tired, hackneyed plot.  I left the theatre disgusted.",Open Range
139,gravity3,Meandering and Lengthy - but Finishes Strong,6,27 February 2006,"Kevin Costner likes to make long movies. Offhand, I can't think of one he's directed that was under 2 hours. At approximately two and a quarter hours, OPEN RANGE is no exception. Too bad, because with some trimming in the first hour, he could have had his best film in years.That first hour contains so much exposition it's tough to sit through. When not explaining characters, there's a lot of sitting around, riding horses, and other scenes that just seemed like Costner trying to catch a little of the flavor of SILVERADO, but without success. Scenes go on too long, and others really could have found the cutting room floor without me missing them. The only fortunate thing from this is lots of screen time for Robert Duvall, who at least keeps many a scene watchable. It often feels like Costner divided the film in half, gave the first to one screenwriter and the second to another. Whatever really happened, it doesn't work.But if you can tough it out through that first hour, you're in for a pretty good western. The dialog becomes crisp, the action picks up, and the lengthy exposition of the first hour finally plays itself out in Western fashion. I actually forgot how long I had to wait to get to the good scenes once they arrived.I can't say the film is unpredictable, but quite enjoyable once it gets up to speed - at least as modern westerns go. (Think very much about any one plot point and you might get frustrated.) There's always a feeling that OPEN RANGE wants to be like one ""from the good ol' days"", but doesn't quite have that kind of movie magic. Although Michael Gambon makes his presence known, some of the other bad guys don't quite have enough lines or screen time (like Kim Coates' gunslinger) for us to get a sense of threat from them. Still, Bening, Costner, Duvall and the great Michael Jeter all turn in good performances. It's not John Ford, but if you're looking for a modern western, you could certainly do worse than OPEN RANGE.",Open Range

I enjoyed it and thought it was good, but it could have been great.  Some of the important and dramatic scenes seemd a bit silly and out of place to me.  I also thought the love story, while plausible within the basic framework of the plot, was underdeveloped and thus seemed a bit forced and unrealistic. I am willing to accept that people can fall in love sometimes without long courtships and without spending months together.  But the premise of a lonely attractive woman in a small Western town and a free-grazer who has a dark past falling in love so easily just because they are both so desparate for an opportunity to fall in love, seems a bit shallow and forced.  If Costner had tweeked the love plot and tweeked the key scenes a little, this movie could have been Great.

145,MartianTom,"You're unforgiven for this, Kevin...",1,23 January 2019,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and not being very impressed. 16 years later, though, I came across it in a random search on YouTube and decided to check it out again. The high rating on iMDB, plus the fact that several reviewers made comparisons to Clint Eastwood's fine 'Unforgiven' - a truly original Western, the finest since 'The Searchers', and one that (for me) revised and redefined the genre - made me wonder if I'd been a little harsh with my earlier verdict. Maybe there was something I'd missed.Sadly, the only thing I missed on second viewing was the over two hours of my life that I can't have back. I was right first time. Flat characterisation. Thin and ludicrous plot. Cliche after cliche. And the script is dire. How on earth did it get the green light? There's hardly a line that doesn't drop with a heavy 'clunk'. On top of all this, it's far too long, badly edited, and not a single character was believable. We're meant to accept that the two main protagonists have worked as partners for ten years, but haven't found out even the most basic information about one another until now. That the local doctor has a beautiful, but ageing sister who's been on the lookout for a 'good man' all her life, in spite of the fact that the town seems to have plenty of good and available men. We get characters introduced, then almost immediately dispensed with. And there's no real background or substance to any of them. They're like ciphers - even the main ones. All we get is hackneyed expository dialogue. Nothing to demonstrate the true depth of a person.Kevin Costner has proved his worth as an actor and director in the genre with the wonderful 'Dances with Wolves'. Whatever possessed him to think this could measure up in any way?There have been a few Westerns over the years that haven't lived up to the promise of the talented people involved. 'Appaloosa', 'Seraphim Falls' and 'The Proposition' are three such. This takes the cake, though.Please... no more comparisons to 'Unforgiven'. Just go watch that movie again instead.

But it's directed by Kevin Costner, and he is not every ones idea of Hollywood stuff, in particular he's not Hollywoods idea of Hollywood stuff.However, this film draws you in, its pace is perfect, building to a stunning climactic finale that has at its heart one of the best gun fight scenes ever shot. The acting is superb and I need not mention the actors names individually, because they all gave class leading performances.See it on as big a screen as possible with the volume on loud and immerse yourself in an old school Western.The saying that ""they don't make em like this any more"" comes to mind, except, on this occasion, one seems to have slipped through the net, because not only have they made one like it, they have made one that defines the very epitome of the genre itself.",Open Range

I can certainly see why the critics panned it tho. Two-dimensional bad guys oppress an entire town until two fearless heroes come along to brave hopeless odds in the name of freedom & justice. It's as simplistic as a Roy Rogers movie, tho the inevitable shoot-'em-up is a lot more gory.Each of the heroes is wounded, but the two of them — with minimal help from the townsfolk — manage to slaughter all the bad guys. Why is it in films 20 or so bad guys can never manage to take out one or two heroes? Is it because the force is with them, or is it just that bad guys have notoriously bad aim?Then comes the interminable denouement, an utterly anticlimactic waste of time in which Kevin Costner rides off into the sunset, only to ride back again to live happily ever after with Annette Bening, as we knew he would all along.

151,mcgriswald,Five movies for the price of one,10,12 February 2007,"Open range is a Spaghetti Western, a romance, a buddy film, a samurai flick and a classic western rolled into one. And Kevin Costner balances each genre within the movie and creates an unforgettable classic.Coaxing first rate performances out his entire cast, Kevin Costner hits a much needed home run after his recent run of stinkers. Bening and Duvall and the supporting cast play it low key but sincere--the only bad note is the cattle baron played by Michael Gambon, who is not one of my favorite actors.As the film plays out, we first get the sense of an old Sergio Leone classic in that there are moments punctuated by extreme violence with a slow buildup in action during the rest of the film. Costner is the nexus upon which the other genres build. He is in a romance with Bening that never overburdens the action, he has interplay with Robert Duval that rivals the greatest buddy films. His resurrection of his old warrior ways reminds one of the samurai film where circumstances force a character into action long abandoned.Finally, the elements of the classic western are all there, battles with the weather, the sappy rescue of a puppy from rising floodwaters, a goofy character in the livery man.Through all of this Costner maintains the level of authenticity similar to Eastwood's turn in Unforgiven. People get cold and wet. A guy gets chloroformed and stays groggy and helpless long after he comes to, instead of springing right into action. Townsfolk show a level of righteous indignation instead of being cowed by the power base in the town. They act reluctantly, but they do ultimately react.Spoiler below!!! In what I think is the most climactic scene, Costner approaches the top hired gun for the cattle baron and asks him if he shot his friend. After the gunslinger replies that he had indeed shot his friend, and that he did it in a cruel manner, Costner walks towards the guy and blows his brains out and kills a couple of the gunslinger's buddies before you can count a beat. I found that scene both shocking and refreshing. How many movies do you wait as the two antagonists jawbone about the situation, there is a suspenseful pause and ultimately the good guy is faster on draw? Pretty much every single one.In Open Range, Costner is revealed to be a killer, a machine that simply acts without remorse or pause. That he is in the right is secondary to the fact that he is every bit as violent and ruthless as the bad guys when it comes to killing.What is very satisfying about Open Range is that all the subplots and loose ends are tied up. Costner's relationship with Annette Bening has a satisfactory resolution, as does the windup of the cattle drive business. The injured boy gets better, and no detail is left alone.Technically, its very well done, the camera, editing and cinematography is all first rate.",Open Range

However with ""Tombstone,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Dances with Wolves"" and now ""Open Range"" we see new life being breathed into the genre.  The really memorable Westerns have been few and far between.  The secret is to develop characters just as in any other drama. ""High Noon,""  ""Shane"", and ""Red River,"" for example, did just this.  These westerns are of a different fabric than the standard fare because the characters are brooding, reflective, scarred and yet still hoping that life will meet out justice--kind of like us all.Costner creates just such a character with Charley Waite (or Postlewaite--his pseudonymn).   This is a scarred man whose kind heart and character is his salvation in spite of what he has been forced to experience. Duvall and Benning add so much to this story.

155,rumbleinthejungle,Mostly great but almost painfully earnest in parts,6,20 June 2009,"I'd heard great things about this film and for the most part I wasn't let down when I finally got around to seeing it. I think that Costner is capable of great things and, although I've not seen the reputedly awful The Postman, I'm one of the few people I know who rates Waterworld as being a decent flick. The film works because of the great scenes between Duvall and Costner's characters - some of the dialogue is really quite poetic and very well written. The corrupt rancher, played by Michael Gambon, as well as his right-hand man possibly aren't as menacing as other western baddies that I could think of. This is mostly due to the fact that they hardly feature in the film as opposed to poor acting on their part; they don't get enough screen time to establish much of a presence at all. Annette Benning is the other major character and she's really good. The love story between her and Costner plays out in a very quiet and dignified way. Benning is really gorgeous, too! There's a tone of almost painful sincerity and earnestness that underpins certain scenes and I put this down to Costner wanting the film to have the old school western feel. The relatively long build-up to the final showdown is also very much in keeping with the traditional western film format. So, much better than the 'Assassination of Jesse James' but maybe not quite as enjoyable as '3:10 to Yuma'.",Open Range
156,tightspotkilo,A Good Western,8,13 October 2005,"Robert Duvall is what makes this movie as good as it is. The man is a national treasure, and, sadly, I suspect, he won't really be fully recognized as such until after he's dead and gone. But in the meanwhile he just seems to just get better and better with age.But this movie isn't Robert Duvall's movie. Actually, and in truth, this is Kevin Costner's movie. Costner is the director and he's the top-billed star. In any Kevin Costner movie he brings certain things to the table. The problem presented with that is the simple fact that not all the things Costner brings to the table are good things. Left unchecked, Costner is apt to come across as a self-absorbed ham. But when there's someone else present --a strong other actor-- to act as a counter-balance on those undisciplined Costner tendencies, a force to filter that stuff out, a force to help Costner sublimate his ego, Costner is fully capable of turning in a decent performance, blending his performance seamlessly with the rest of the cast. For instance, in A Perfect World that countervailing force was supplied by Clint Eastwood, and Costner did well there. Here, in Open Range, it's Robert Duvall that keeps Costner reeled in, and as a result Costner delivers the goods.The third major player in this film is Annette Bening. I must say that this is my favorite Annette Bening performance. She was quite fetching, in her 45-year old way.The whole cast delivers the goods, good performances all the way around.The story unfolds methodically, almost slowly, but not so slowly as to become boring. By unfolding in this way, we are given a chance to get to know the characters. The movie is essentially a character study as much as it is anything else, and so then, when the climactic scenes are finally reached, where all the conflicts are resolved, literally and figuratively, we have the benefit of knowing and understanding these characters, making that climax all the more entertaining and satisfying. As is customary among classical westerns, the climax is achieved via a gunfight. In Open Range it's a full-blown shootout, and as depicted here is as realistic an old west shootout as you'll ever see.Duvall's character, Boss Spearman, is a good man, a principled man of integrity, hardworking, polite, and fair. A man of few words who doesn't mince words. He says what he means, and he means what he says. He's kind and he's loyal. They didn't use the terms ""role model"" or ""mentor"" back in the days of the old west, but that's what Boss is to the men under him, and Boss takes the responsibilities that go with that seriously.One gets the feeling that Sue, the Annette Bening character, might actually be interested in Boss if their ages weren't quite so far apart, but she recognizes that Charlie (Costner), a man with a dark history, is seriously working hard to be a better man, a good man like Boss, so Charlie thereby becomes a viable option. But if it weren't for Boss's influences on Charlie, it's hard saying how good a man Charlie would be. Or whether his demons from his past bad acts would eat him alive.Good and kind man though he is, don't make the mistake of wronging Boss Spearman, and especially don't hurt his friends or ones he cares about. Those were the mistakes that Baxter (Michael Gambon) and his ""bought and paid for"" sheriff Poole (James Russo) made.A very good western, maybe the best western since Clint Eastwood's The Unforgiven. I'd say it's a good ""old-fashioned"" western, except I don't think they made very many of them this good, or in this way, way back when either. It goes down as one of the best of the genre, and it is a source of hope --hope that Kevin Costner can and will grow and evolve into a first class director and actor, and hope that the Hollywood western isn't really dead after all.",Open Range
157,thrillhouse678,Great movie.,9,23 August 2003,"""Open Range"" may not revive westerns or Costners career, but it should. That's the way one reviewer put it, and I completely agree. Open Range is a spectacular looking western directed by the man who knows them better than anyone actively directing today, Kevin Costner. Costner hit his highest peak of success with ""Dances With Wolves"" and now after a string of failures returns to form with his best film since that oscar winner. Open Range tells the story of Charley (Costner), a Civil War veteran who learned to kill in the war and made it into a career. He has a perpencity for violence but has been kept calm for 10 years by his boss, Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall). Charley works for Boss helping him drive cattle on the *open range* of Montana, hence the title. One day, Boss sends one of his other employees into town to fetch some supplies, when the man doesn't return, Boss and Charley go looking for him. They find out their friend got into a fight and was beaten by the marshall and put into jail. Charley and Boss find out about all this from Baxter, a rancher who runs the town, who also informs the two that he and the rest of the town ""don't take kindly to freegrazers"". Charley and Boss collect their man and take him to the town doctor, where Charley is struck with what can best be described as love at first site with the doctor's sister Sue (Annette Benning). Boss and Charley head back to the heard where they are confronted-in a manner of speaking-by four hooded men who presumably work for Baxter, and from there the story builds.""Open Range"" is not imperfect, I thought it dragged on too long towards the end, but found everything before then to be so enjoyable that it made up for the length. Costner knows westerns, and he knows how to film the landscape. If Open Range doesn't win for best cinematography come Oscar time, I will lose what little faith I have in the ceremony. But the real high point of the film is Duvall, in an Oscar worthy performance as a grizzled old man who has a hidden past of his own. The whole performance consists of back to back oscar clips, and there isn't a moment that he isn't fantastic. All in all,Open Range is a great western that fans of the genre will love, and all others can enjoy also.***1/2 out of ****",Open Range
158,RHKLWK,"Not Shane, But Highly Entertaining",8,14 February 2004,"First, I wish to thank Kevin Costner for making Westerns.  Although long out of favor, they tell America's ""story"" better than any other genre  (and even if you don't like the story, there's always the cinematography -- have a look at ""Legends of the Fall,"" when you can).It's not ""Shane,"" but it isn't bad.  Unlike Shane, here is a real twist: the Free Grazers are the good guys; the sod busters are the bad guys.  Very interesting.Many of the movie's parts appear elsewhere:  Silverado and Lonesome Dove come immediately to mind.  Who cares . . . .I wondered whether I would look at Robert Duvall and his character and see Texas Ranger Augustus McRae.  Indeed, sometimes I saw Gus (for example, in the bar room scene where he delivers his lecture on good vs. evil), and at other times I didn't (for example, during most of the gun fight).  I think Duvall has a hard time living down Captain Gus, and he knows it.  So what .. . .The gunfight is extraordinary.  The weapons were historically accurate, the sounds were right, and the poor marksmanship was realistic. The re-created town is a masterpiece.  This long scene is a work of art.The relationship between Costner and Bening isn't really developed, the evil sheriff and the maniacal rancher don't have enough screen time, what motivates the last-minute heroics of the townspeople is unclear, and the movie, itself, with the exception of the gunfight, could have been made for television, but everything considered, it is a highly entertaining film.Rent this movie and enjoy it.",Open Range

(All the way back to Darlin' Clementine.) But time, and watching it a couple more times has altered my opinion of it, and now I consider it one of my favorites. I guess that ""Gus"", in Lonesome Dove was still on my mind, and Costner's outstanding performance in Dances with Wolves when I first saw it. Didn't realize either that Costner had directed this one. He has become one of our best actor/directors in his long career, and I really love his films. He just has that special screen presence, that makes him so watchable, and pairing him with Duval, what more could you ask for? Terrific cast, locations, photography, this one has it all. If you like westerns, or even if you don't, this one is a must see. Really enjoy it the more often I see it. That scene with the late Michael Jeter, as he reads Charlie's note about the tea set is priceless. And the script is first rate. Highly recommended.",Open Range
160,runner-15,Kevin Costner hits the bull's eye with this one!!,9,31 January 2004,"Wow, I loved this movie. While the pacing of this movie is somewhat slow and talky, this fact detracts absolutely nothing from the overall quality of this movie. This is a cerebral western, although the good guys and bad guys are black and white the movie itself makes you think. I found the characters and story to both be very believable. And the cinematography was UNBELIVEABLE. I found myself wanting to visit Wyoming and Colorado after watching the movie. (Too Bad the movie wasn't filmed there.) The gunfight scene at the end was one of the best gunfights I have ever seen put on film, it was chaotic and confused, just as real gunfights are, very realistic. I watched the DVD version and the deleted scenes fill in a few details. Also the short featurette  on the real history of the open range included with the DVD is very informative and enjoyable. I highly recommend this movie.",Open Range
161,sergicaballeroalsina,Too indebted to 'Unforgiven' but well done,8,23 March 2018,"This is an important western. Although it is classic, it avoids at all costs the cliches of the genre, both with its characters and its narrative. The script is fresh, which makes the film develop without shrillness.
The cinematography is excellent, portraying the landscape as well as the action scenes. It is also an entertaining movie, a lot of things happen.
It is very remarkable the realistic way in which violence is treated, probably the most believable I remember in a western. The staging includes casual, unseen actions that make the movie dynamic and credible.
The main characters are charming; two tough guys but with a message, with a past and a couple of convictions, rich in contrasts and witty dialogues. Explicit but not rude; the old-fashioned way. Two guys with whom it is easy to sympathize, for their values and their sense of humor.
Open Range is, in short, a very good film that deserves an opportunity because it technically and narratively brings new things. And if it is not a masterpiece it is for two reasons: it is too indebted to 'Unforgiven' and that kills originality and has a deliberately self-indulgent, unnecessarily sweetened end.",Open Range

His latest film, which he has also directed and spent a good deal rewriting, smacks of the same talent he showed when he won an Academy Award for directing ""Dances With Wolves.""Showing a simple and subtle style, he has created a classic Western that focuses on a romance of two aging characters. Costner managed to convince world-class actors such as Annette Bening, Robert Duvall and Michael Gambon into what is considered a ""dead"" genre in movies -- Westerns and make them good, very good. ...and talking about the casting!! Annette Bening rocked again in another great role. Free of botox and make-up she looked great and her on screen romance with Mr Coster was pure Hollywood heaven. Sweet and romantic without going over the top. & the chemistry was there all they way til the credits rolled. This small but suttle role might just get Ms. Bening another shot at Oscar gold.The movie does its main thing, its raison d'etre, brilliantly: It tells you how the West was won.",Open Range
163,brettlu,Costner doesn't suck anymore...,9,7 November 2003,"First off let me reiterate that Kevin Costner has made some of the worst crap I've ever seen in my life. A lot of movies I see are so terrible that they become funny, but Costner movies go beyond even that kind of bad. They go to the ""make me want to tear my eyes out and jam a hot poker in my ear"" kind of bad. Here are some examples:The Postman - Does anyone else remember before this came out that there was actual oscar buzz about it? It was long, boring and almost as entertaining as dog crap. Waterworld - What a colossal failure. One of the most expensive movies ever made, along with a very original story somehow got turned in a steaming pile of poo. And numerous other Costner movies have sucked, he even tarnished Sam Raimi's career with For Love of the Game.So with all of that said, my expectations weren't extremely high for Open Range. I had read some good reviews, but I still was skeptical. After I saw it what was the end result? One of the best movies of the year!
This is by far one of the most compelling and original westerns since Unforgiven. Sure there have been good westerns since then, but Maverick was more of a comedy and Tombstone was more of an action flick.
The acting is first rate, coming mainly from the central Duvall and Costner characters. This is a movie about the characters, and the plot follows the characters, so the story doesn't have that epic feel of a Sergio Leone western. But unlike some of Leone's work, this is not a cookie cutter, Clint Eastwood shoot 'em up, spaghetti western (even though it does feature one of the best shootouts I've seen in a long time). One of the main things I also noticed about the film was the realism. The sets, the dialogue, the characters, the gunfights, everything seemed to bear more resemblance to the actual ""west"" than most people like to imagine.Most of the complaints I have heard about the movie revolve around the love story. Many people say it seems forced and unnecessary. I did enjoy most of the love story aspect of the movie, but I do agree that much of it seems tacked on for the sake of a well rounded story. And without revealing anything about the movie I will also say that I didn't think the ending really fit with rest of the movie, it seemed a bit over the top.Despite the shortcomings, this is by far one of the best movies I've seen this year. I give it **** out of four stars.",Open Range
164,tetractys,Self-absorbed hack cliché fest,3,22 April 2007,"Ever since becoming popular with Silverado, Costner has had a fixation on being the brooding, haunted hero. Sometimes, he does a passable job, but more often he appears self-obsessed, humorless and preachy. This film is one of the latter.There is a significant lack of motivation to the love story contained in this hack western. Why does Annette Bening fall in love with Costner, because he knocks over her furniture and smells bad? Hard to tell.The dialogue is awful, just awful. Costner mumbles lines like, ""We better rustle up some grub,"" as if there is a bet among the producers that he can't get away with it. He can't. There are a couple dozen of these howlers, delivered with deadpan camp, I hope, or worse, seriousness.The plot is pure formula, the villain lacking only a handlebar moustache and the deed to Bening's house for the film to devolve into pure melodrama.There were some good scenes, scenery and acting, but few, and I don't count Duvall's performance among them. He was the Lonesome Dove ranger all over again, and simply a recitation of the patented hand signals and homey suckmouth delivery he's used dozens of times. He was also so fat he wasn't believable even as an old trail hand.The clichés in this movie were uncountable (doggie, Mexican kid, fat cook, stable hand), as were the direct and indirect steals -- from Shane (cattle war), High Noon (showdown), Unforgiven (haunted hero), Silverado (leg wound, gunfight, corrupt sheriff), Yojimbo (townie helper, dog).Costner proves once again that he's capable of serious self-absorption.",Open Range
165,stedrazed,Not bad enough or good enough to please me.,6,3 September 2003,"Well, Kevin Costner has made his ""comeback"" with his favorite material: a rugged, haunted hero story containing a plethora of cliches. The man clearly loves the Western genre, apparently as formulaic and by the book as possible. Every hack genre moment imaginable is included in OPEN RANGE, though the roles of Robert Duvall and Costner are switched; here we have the younger man being the more experienced and combat-weary, but this hardly makes up for the stiff, wooden dialogue that borders on self-parody (but doesn't quite push itself over the edge, which would have been much more enjoyable). Much of this dialogue is so forced and cliched it seems to ""stick in the craw"" of even a great actor like Duvall, especially in the beginning of the film. The story (minimalist is a kind way to describe it), or rather the action, of the film does pick up a little steam as it moves along to the gun battle that is the only reason to sit through the incredible predictability leading up to it. In fact, this gun battle and Michael Gambon's excellent performance as the villainous landowner barely manage to raise this film above the level of Hollywood detritus. The shootout is the one place Costner manages to break away from the tedious traditions he embraces throughout the preceding 120 minutes; very little slow motion is used, and the strategy of the fight is realistic and original in many ways. The love story involving Costner and Annette Benning (as underused and uninteresting as most female characters in Westerns) is so much pointless detritus, leading to Costner's decision about the ending of the film: the predictable happy ending or the predictable sad ending? I won't ""spoil"" it, but, in my opinion, his choice was the greater of two evils.",Open Range

The mud and rain are relentless, the wood looked aged, even the scene with the thousands of flies surrounding the herd looked real.  The best are the EXPLOSIONS from the firearms.  Some people feel Kevin Costner is a wooden actor.  He does have a definite style; for this movie that style fits perfectly.  Robert Duval is wonderful as the elder cowboy.  Both Duval and Costner made you believe. And what western doesn't have a love interest.  Annette Bening is pretty without makeup.  I don't think they knew how to end this movie, though. Talk about long goodbyes!  Another small problem is that Costner's six-guns seem to each shoot about ten shots between reloads.  It's well worth the ticket price, however.  Best movie I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.",Open Range
167,Axel-9,A film of true integrity,9,23 March 2004,"Kevin Costner has got a lot of stick over the years, wrongly as far as I'm concerned, both as an actor. a director and quite often personal abuse. He's a much underrated performer, purely because he has chosen not to be flashy or in your face, but he's a master of the understated, knowing his limitations and often giving very good, heartfelt performances. His role in Open Range, as freegrazer cattlehand Charlie Waite is no different, and it is all the better for it. In fact it's a very good performance, easygoing and tough, bringing a very real hint of danger to the party.The movie itself is laidback, Costner as director likes to develop characters and let them live. So we have his character Waite, Boss Spearman (Robert Duval) the worn down man in charge, Button (Diego Luna) the happy go lucky kid and Mose (Abraham Benrubi) the big guy with a good heart, living their lives in the beautiful green praeries of the west. We pick up with them retrieving some cattle who have lost their way during a storm, and are treated to some fabulous cinematography, bringing the scene wonderfully to life.This picture of life is rudely broken by trouble from the town in the form of Michael Gambon's landowner, who don't like guys passing through his land, nor their cows eating his grass. After an incident with his men, Waite and Spearman are thrown into confrontation with him, and it's their destiny to do what a man's gotta do, and sort him out.This is situation brought vividly to life by the fine performances. Duvall probably just shades it, his Spearman is a good man, and he imbues him with true feeling. You know he'd die for Charlie or any of his team. He also gets to deliver one powerhouse speech, which pretty much made me stand up and cheer, because it was delivered in quite an understated way, yet packed a punch, inspiring the townsfolk to action. Costner gets to attempt a romance with Annette Bening's doctor's assistant and sister, which doesn't entirely work, but his character's awkwardness with the situation is well described.The film builds to the climatic gun fight, which is punctuated with some ear shattering gunshots, the sound effects boys have given this a real go. It's tensely fought, and all the better because of the pacing, as in knowing the characters as you now do, you care whether they make it or not. There are spurts of minor violence, which whilst not graphic, are strong enough to emphasise what killing is about.And before I finish it's worth saying Michael Kamen has written a fine score for this movie, which is a great credit to his fine legacy as a film music composer.In all this is a strong package, maybe a bit too slow for those more used to the bombastic MTV style of most recent action pictures, but all the better for those who like a solid film, with well drawn characters and actions that count.

Don't get me wrong, I love Westerns, and Rob Duvall is incredible as an actor, but there is no way that this over-long garbagio deserves to be classified anywhere near to good. Whoever created the film score has succeeded in pioneering a new method of aurally torturing my inner conscience. Whenever I hear this music, I want to kill myself...not out of depression, but solely for the reason that I need to end the intense agony that this miminalist b.s. puts me through. You wanna hear good Western-movie music? I've got a whole of letters for you...E.N.N.I.O. M.O.R.R.I.C.O.N.E. Try those out for a change, you Hollywood-douche-bags, or at least try something similar.

Please...for the love of God! But then, there's the rest of the movie. Total Crapola. Bad dialogue, horrifically bad plot, bad structure, bad movie poster, bad promotional campaign, bad acting all packaged for the adult American audience to deem as high art. Just because a movie is long and dramatic and because it references other movies, does not in any way make it good. Dances with Wolves was alright, I don't enjoy seeing Kevin Costner's buttcheeks, but I guess girls need to get some sometimes too. I got my copy at McDonald's 15 some odd years ago, and have enjoyed it. I've never wanted the main characters in a film to get axed more than I did watching this. The only way to make this one better is if you reduced the whole thing to 30 seconds, you could easily summarize the plot in that time, but then it would be overpriced.

This film is way above average in many departments including the direction by Costner. The actors all turn in wonderful performances, even the ones with bit parts. The true joy of this film, however, is the writing. It is a very tight script that avoids so many common pitfalls.; the dialogue is believable, there are no b.s. subplots and the flow of the storytelling is right on. The audience gets to know the characters through the story itself without it beating us over the heads with cliché'-ridden monologues. I put this film in the same ranking as ""Pale Rider"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven"", three of the best westerns ever made. The characters stayed 'in character', their motivations were believable and their actions all made sense. It takes a real pro to make an entertaining film with virtually no special effects, no car chases and no gratuitous sex. I wish that more film makers would focus on good storytelling and only use CGI to further the story instead of relying on it to 'wow' the audience whilst letting the plot a a back seat.

But I will write that this is a wonderful film, I have seen it twice and was thoroughly engrossed and enraptured both times. Excellent cinematography and music. Costner, Duvall, Benning and the irascibly great Michael Gambon are perfectly cast. Duvall is a real treat to watch, he chews up the dialogue like the cattle on the free range. Though I would classify Open Range as a neo-western, it is not as nearly as dark as Unforgiven or The Missing, just as it is not charmingly fun like the Sergio Leone epics. But like Unforgiven, it is a tale of morality, honour, honesty, loyalty, and ultimately, the end of the western age. Thoughtful and moving, I found it to have quite an authentic tone to it. Without the grandiose moralistic philosophising of Unforgiven, the simplicity of the characters and their dialogues contain the essence of their time and setting. The relationship of the two leads is as good as an classic Buddy Film, really giving the viewer the sense of the necessary camaraderie of cowboys ""lost"" in the openness of a fading society of violence and a rapidly closing vastness. The extended gunfight at the end, is one of the best ever, with Costner choosing new and unique camera angles (no closeups of eyes) giving the realistic p.o.v for today's sophisticated viewer. If you are lucky enough to watch this with digital home theatre sound, the gunshot foley effects are tremendous! Though sadly overlooked at awards time (Costner is no longer to power player in Hollywood he once was), this is definitely one of the best movies of the year, and a classic in the genre of westerns. This movie represents the true essence of Midwestern America in the late 19th century, perhaps more than any movie, since Dances with Wolves and Unforgiven.

Filmed in wonderful Alberta Canada, the marvellous backdrop is food for the eye as veteran actors Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall give fine performances as the longtime business partners drawn into a feud over their right to free graze their herd in the remote cattle country of western USA of 1882. The story unfolds with a steady pace, an eye to detail and a realism that isn't marred with crass violence or gratuitous acts. Michael Gambon plays a really good embittered hard as nails Irishman. Good support is provided by the rest of the cast and romantic interest told in an understated perhaps more old fashioned way is carried on between Costner's character and Annette Bening. A really worthwhile film to view with a impressive shoot out at the end better than that in 'unforgiven' of which I was reminded by the production values and the darkness of the Costner character, but Open Range is a lighter movie to view and will make the viewer chuckle at times too. 10/10",Open Range

176,lhseaglerunner,Home on the Range?,8,21 August 2003,"Occasionally, there are the movies that truly transcend time to take the audience to places where they have never been. You could find yourself in a grittily authentic medieval court or an opulent English manor house or, in the case of `Open Range', on the expansive American West before the true impact of man was made evident.	The times were changing in the West in the middle of the 1880s. What once was as wide and open as one could imagine, now landowners, with the application of barbed wire, controlled fiefdoms of territory that they could run however they saw fit, and in the case of the movie, this antagonistic character would be Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon).	 What Baxter has done in his sphere of influence, Harmonville, is close it off to free-grazers, or cow herds that roamed the West without a base of operations. This heavy-handed treatment conflicts with the values of Boss (Robert Duvall) and his right-hand man, Charley (Kevin Costner), the protagonist free-grazers.	Our two heroes are not typically violent people, but when Baxter's men attack their herd and kill one of their men (Abraham Benrubi) and severely wound another (Diego Luna), the two head into town for some old-fashioned Western justice. But while in town, a complication arises, as Charley falls for the town doctor's sister, Sue (Annette Bening). Now that he has something to stay alive for, he is about to be embroiled in a gun battle for what he sees as right versus the wrong of Baxter.	While Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall might be billed as the stars of the piece, the real `star' would have to be the visuals. With an unusual (at least in this century) minimal reliance on computer graphics, the story could have been done back in the heyday of Westerns, the 1950s. But in lieu of computer work, the scenery takes over and manages to just be jaw-droppingly beautiful. If you are not amazed by what you see, well then you don't know true beauty.	Not everything is as beautiful as the scenery though, as there were two things that were rather bothersome, in my opinion. Firstly, in every `true' Western, at least one protagonist needs to fall in love with a nice lady from town, so there was precedent for the Charley-Sue romance. But something about it just was jarringly discomforting-it wasn't so much the `square peg in a circular hole' but more like `an oval peg in the circular hole'-it wasn't quite clicking.	The other thing that wasn't as I would have liked it was the pacing. At times, the movie seemed to go by way too slowly as the dialogue wen t in a circuitous manner around the main points (something I've been occasionally guilty of-five dollars of writing for fifty cents of content). But everything reeked of authenticity, so I'm inclined to give this the benefit of a doubt.	`Open Range' is not your typical movie. Instead of all of the modern gilded trappings, it has an old-school reliance upon detail and natural visuals that make it a quaint and rather enjoyable film. 8 out of 10.",Open Range
177,roset60,Mixed feelings,6,21 August 2003,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Some of the acting is great (the immediate communication of a love interest between Kevin Costner and Annette B) some is not so good. Some of the movie moves along nicely, other parts drag. Annette B has a nice face to look at and the first moments we see her wrinkles we understand that she is older - but it does get tiring to linger so much on her face so many times. There is no character development of her part - just in one line do we find that she has been ""disappointed"" by other men. We get the point that cowboys don't talk much and say important (but cryptic) things when they do, but here the dialogue is almost always awkward and stilted.  The bit about what the gunfighters' names really are was silly. The scenary was beautiful, the details in the sets and costumes were interesting, although few things in the movie besides a deck of cards looked like they had been used at all - real Hollywood.",Open Range
178,semaj-95339,Modern Classic,10,14 June 2018,"This is a beautifully shot movie, the scenery is sublime it truly does take you away.
The story is a simple tried and tested formula good guys trying to get on with their life bad guy throwing his weight and power around and drive them off.It does capture the flavour of that time and decent attention to detail. I've watched this movie a few times and watched it on DVD with directors commentary which a rarely do, there one thing that Costner said at the end of the commentary something along the lines of "" if this is the last film I ever make then I'm quite happy with that and I mean that sincerely "" I might not be quoting exactly but it sat with me as it was heartfelt. He knows he made a good job of this movie and I for one am glad he made it.The gunfight at the end is one of the best you'll see in a western albeit infinite ammo time, it's well orchestrated and encompasses the whole town, eventually the townsfolk grow a backbone and get involved, just epic.",Open Range

It had the potential to be an ""Out of Africa"" experience on a somewhat smaller scale, but it just didn't grow enough to satisfy me completely.

Conagher might have made it except for the dust billowing up from a cattle drive trail during a ""rainstorm."" All failed in the horse apple test. Hundreds of horses on dirt streets, no horse apples ever. Horse dung ground into dust by hooves created a choking dust in New York City before the automobile, but never west of the Mississippi. According to Hollywood. But back to Open Range. The amazing thing is Robert Duvall commanding a leading role at age 72. That has never been done in Hollywood to my knowledge. Open Range is the only Kevin Costner movie I have ever watched that I wanted to see again and again. Costner deserves credit for a fine role. He may never equal it. He may never again have such a fine (better than fine) supporting cast. Not since Shane have I seen such a memorable bunch of low life bad guys. They are all great. I could have done without Costner firing his six-shooter TWELVE times in rapid succession.

182,vmarthirial,A western with class and art.,10,22 August 2003,"Western days where simple, they had nature, sincerity, fairness, struggle and redemption.  They also had doctors instead of lawyers; therefore, justice was not a money-making activity, but a matter of life or death, and that exactly is what this Film is about.Since the beginning you can tell the film was made with respect and admiration to the nature, the culture, the men and women and to justice. The story is beautifully simple, the acting, simply perfect, and that is way difficult when you have two starring actors 80% of the time together.
Although the movie is loyal to the classical western plot (I'm not messing with anybody - somebody mess with me - Confrontation - Justice is made), it doesn't have any cliché, overdone scenes, unnecessary gore or over-sizing of the villain so the hero looks more brave.  Rather, it is a movie with the rare quality of inviting you to `understand' everybody, theirs circumstances, how things worked those days (and maybe how they should be today), at the same time it keeps you expecting an ending that, by the way, is one of the best in westerns.A word of warning with the already famous shootout: Don't think you are going to see extras falling on air mattresses from a cardboard-made balcony; this is very real, a must if Mr. Costner planned to maintain the authenticity showed in every single moment of this marvelous and poetic Western.Go see it as you would go to see art in a museum, because that's exactly what this movie is.",Open Range

I won't spoil the movie at all but I will talk about aspects of the film. First Open Range tells a story and treat the audience like intelligent human beings . The movie is not slow at all but builds the momentum slowly , the wait is worthy. The music by Michael Kamen perfectly fits in the great western tradition. The cast is great but specially Robert Duvall give one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in film (and I as I tell you I have watched so many) . Costner and Benning are perfect in their roles too,amazing performances. For me the great achievement of this movie is that you see all the characters as human beings, Kevin Costner as director makes you care for them . The story have logic and sense . The photography work is great and we're talking about excellent movie making.This kind of movie is the one that make one feel proud of watching it. I'm sure this movie will be considered a classic some years from now among with ""Dance with wolves "" . Don't miss it !",Open Range
184,melinda2001,On second thought the moral of the story is questionable,7,11 December 2010,"I liked this movie a lot. Costner never really tries to get accents right but his normal voice is fine in this case and he turns in a pretty good acting job. The story was fun, engaging and satisfying.Still I found myself wondering days later about the moral of the story which seems to be that redemption is possible through courageous acts. I realized that the ""good guys"" who liberate a troubled town might have been able to achieve the same end without so many people getting killed. They wanted to remain free-grazers which the power brokers in town despise because they were nomadic and interfered with their ranching by grazing as they go.After all the dust settled they decide that settling down in that town seemed like a good idea but if they had decided that at the beginning nobody would have had to die. Instead they fought for a freedom they didn't want anymore. Sure, they didn't deserve the hatred, and if they hadn't killed the haters, they would have had to have worked out their differences politically and as neighbors, but isn't that a better way to solve differences in lifestyles and politics? I don't know. It was a fine movie but maybe not such a good message.",Open Range

Robert Duvall is too fat and old to be believable as a range rider ready to kick some butt.  He looks real stiff like he might have arthritis.  Kevin Costner has a surfer guy accent and is not the ""hunk"" anymore people used to think he was (wow, that bald head!).  Speaking of haircuts, they were too up to date.  The marshall with a buzz cut?  How about the doctor with the gel-spiked look.  The women's lib stuff was out of place too-watch Annette Bening try to get tough with the baddies and stradle a horse (women rode side-saddle). The love subplot was unneccessary and corny.  The shoot out scene was waaaay too long.  All that said, it has gorgeous scenery and was a Western.  I wish Hollywood would make more, but better ones.

188,requiem1896,Well made western...but with problems,5,31 August 2003,"Overall, Open Range is a well made western.  All the elements of film come together successfully enough to create an interesting story about settlers of the West vs. the nomads of the West.  But, this does not save it from critical story problems.    First and foremost, the relationship between Sue and Charlie isforced.   The odd conversation ending in Charlie's line  ""I meant everything I said to you""  (or roughly that)  seems to suggest a scene that the wholeaudience slept through.The dog is a good idea to create a ""softer"" character for Charlie...sadly, Costner and the dog share so little screen time together the connection is failed and the shots of the dog in the ""rolling, flowing, fields"" seems redundant and awkward.  (The cinematography seemed to be lacking in this and other scenes.)Robert Duvall does a good job, but nothing Oscar worthy (unless it is aREALLY light year.)   Costner, Gambon, and others are acceptable. . . thoughthe parts are flat and the dialogue is not inspiring.  Bening seems out of place, and I would almost think that she would agree.  A disappointing performanceout of a good Actress.In summation, with obvious story/screenplay problems aside, it is anacceptable enough film....but I would be surprised if it faired well during the Awards season.",Open Range

190,Bobster36,Nice and understated.,10,28 March 2005,"Westerns have a way of hitting the viewer over the head with heroism and villainy. And while there's plenty of both here, it's done in a refreshingly understated way. The dialog feels very natural, as does the way Costner and Duvall play off one another.The story is well-told. You can see why some of the local ranchers wouldn't want free-grazers like Duvall's Boss Spearman to bring a herd through. But they go too far in opposing Spearman. Duvall and Costner are so good in their roles that you can feel their anger. The gunfight seems disjointed. It starts. It slows down. Then it picks up again. Not your Randolph Scott type fight. But probably more like an old west gunfight really was.And there are a lot of little subtleties that add a nice touch to the film. You can see the affection Spearman and Costner's Charley Waite have for dogs. And for chocolate. And Waite's embarrassment over breaking something valuable and his effort to replace it. And there's a scene in the gunfight when Waite is standing only a few feet away from a foe who angered him by endangering the woman he loved. Waite doesn't just shoot the fellow. He thrusts his revolver toward the guy with each shot as if shooting him wasn't enough. It was if he practically wanted to poke the man with the gun with each shot. Thus, while it can be seen merely as part of the gunfight, that scene beautifully and subtly captures the feelings Waite has for Annette Benings' Sue Barlow. Because by endangering her, the man had made it personal and Waite's wrath was clearly evident. That scene is particularly meaningful because the dialog between Waite and Barlow expresses their affection for one another in very minimal terms.Open Range is an interesting story and fine character study that looks and feels real. Very well made and very entertaining.",Open Range

The economy in dialogue and enough 'justifiable anger' provide a smooth movement through the plot and emotional setup for the final conflict.",Open Range
192,reporterman2000,An excellent Western,9,17 August 2003,"I do not understand the resentment many people hold toward Kevin Costner. His harshest critics seem to react personally to ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman;"" many go so far as to trash ""Dances With Wolves."" Costner does have some bad movies on his resume, but so does every major American star. Simply put, I would rather watch Kevin Costner in almost any movie (OK, with the exception of ""Postman"" or ""Revenge"") than sit through CGI junk like ""Hulk"" or ""Matrix Reloaded.""I loved ""Open Range,"" and was sorry to see that it debuted at a mere No. 3 at the box office. This is a real movie, with real characters, real structure, and a real story to tell. It builds slowly, carefully, so that we're emotionally involved in the violence at the end. I don't think any other movie in the sorry summer of 2003 can say that. Certainly not the ""film"" that bested ""Open Range,"" ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" which no one will be watching or talking about 10 years from now (the true test for any movie).While I enjoyed Costner's performance as the lonely, conflicted, violent gunman/cowpoke, I especially admired his direction. It was clear and focused and quickly paced. The movie fits well within the same genre as ""Unforgiven,"" but is its own thing, not a ripoff. Costner has a real director's eye for shot composition and draws beautiful work out of Robert Duvall and Annette Bening, not to mention Michael Gambon and Michael Jeter.This movie shows that ""The Postman"" was a fluke, a true vanity project. But it is also time for us to move on and let Costner make movies. Too bad that if the movie underperforms financially, it will be more difficult for him to so. He's the real deal.",Open Range

The beginning starts slow, showing what free grazing was like, but once the conflicts begin, the movie picks up to its actioned packed ending, and turns out to be a pretty good western. I have never been a fan of Costner too much, but he puts in a solid performance, as does Duvall. The way the gun battle at the end was done was terrific, surprised me very much. It had been a long time since I saw a western movie that had a gun battle that had surprised me with every shot and kill. And I have never seen the main killer bad guy be shot dead as the first guy to go down in a gun battle, but it worked very well here. I could of swore Duvall was going to die the whole movie, surprised me that both of them lived with only 2 wounds. Would of been nice to see a younger main female actress in the movie though, Bening was really it, but that just doesn't really matter once the movie picks up. I gave it a 9/10 solely cuz the beginning is slow. I feel this is definately a good western to watch.",Open Range

He is someone who has made some remarkable movies and then all of a sudden vanishes altogether. Open Range is one such movie that has been made with a fine eye for detail and the camera work in this movie is pretty nice. The performances by Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner are also pretty good and a bit understated. The good thing about this movie is that it is a proper Western that captures the beauty of the countryside in an impressive manner. The performance of most of the characters in this movie is good and it reminded me a bit about Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. I really liked the movie and can easily recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a nice Western that will stay in one's mind for a long time...,Open Range
196,The_Eighth_Passenger,"Excellent, if not a little heavy handed",7,8 May 2013,"Kevin Costner directs and co-stars with Robert Duvall (inexplicably billed first) and Annette Benning in this story of cattlemen being forced to take a stand against a big time rancher who wants them off 'his' land.Costner directs with a sure and steady hand, letting the story unfold at an almost glacial pace while at the same time giving a great performance as a man at war with himself, struggling to forgive himself for the sins he has committed in the past. Duvall is the moral backbone of the story and to Costner, guiding him through his personal turmoil. Benning's role is a little underdeveloped and the cursory love sub plot seems forcefully placed into the story as a means to provide Costner with a chance for redemption.There are echoes of Eastwood's Unforgiven; the change from the 'old' West to the 'new'; the old gunslinger who has tried to move on but cannot forget the past, yet Open Range opts for a more positive outlook by its' conclusion than Unforgiven's sombre climax.The film builds to a showdown that we are more than ready for and the action and gun play is exciting and feels authentic. The epilogue, however, is a problem. It takes 3 or 4 scenes to do what 1 would have managed fine and puts too much focus back onto the already not too convincing romance. With the last instalment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy also in theatres, 2003 must have been the year of the self indulgent ending. I also had a problem with a few moments of slow motion and the overuse of fades and dissolves, which gave the otherwise epic scope of the picture a sudden made for TV feel. The font used on those opening credits didn't do much for either. How often do you pay attention to the font in the credits? That just shows how bad it is.Overall though, Open Range is a fantastic modern Western and I highly recommend it.",Open Range

What I got instead was a Costner doing his standard bit of speaking in one or two sentences at a time.  And, when he did speak, the combo of dialogue and delivery resulted in chuckles from across the theatre.   Unfortunately, these moments were not supposed to be funny.  Even worse, some of Costner's mojo rubbed of on the always great Robert Duvall and even his dialogue got a few chuckles in scenes where none were expected.On the bright side, the vista shots of 1880's America were cool (even if they were filmed in Canada) and the supporting cast helped the movie.

198,Tokugawa,Just a DAMN GOOD Old Fashioned Western. Recommended!,10,23 August 2003,"I'm back from seeing ""Open Range"", the first good Kevin Costner movie in years.He was good; Annette Bening better; and Robert Duvall the best. Duvall sort of rehashes his ""Lonesome Dove"" routine, but gives it a softer edge but filled with crusty gravitas and grit. Just a great actor. Costner directed it very well.Not quite as good as ""Unforgiven"", and certainly not as dark, but still maybe the best movie this Summer. Authentic-looking, with fine character development, all the gunplay is saved for the climax as the plot builds to it nicely, and that shootout is messy and chaotic - the way it should be and the way they were, unlike Eastwood Westerns where every bullet fired immediately kills a rival, all fired in a few seconds.Often beautiful cinematography, and fine realistic performances right through the cast including the hateful bad guys.The one surprising thing about it is that the film played out in a manner that would have been almost predictable - for most Westerns from a few generations ago, it being straightforward, and good triumphing over evil, with only a few touches of ambiguity. As such, and in ""look"", it reminded me of George Stevens' classic ""Shane"", with Alan Ladd, but even that classic had a slightly dark ending.Anyway, lovely film. In the theater I was in it got applause at the end.BTW, for those into Westerns I highly recommended ""The Big Country"" from the 1950's, but always thought John Wayne's ""Red River"" slightly overrated, though still good.",Open Range

Kevin Costner also returns to form like his days on Dances With Wolves. The film is shot against breathtaking on location backdrops which add a richness to the film. You feel like you are on the range with the cowboys. Robert Duvall turns in an Oscar worthy performance as Costner's partner. To come into this movie expecting gunfights and saloon highjinks is completely absurd. The movie is about freedom and what it costs to get it and in the end, is the price you have to pay worth it? I must comment on the current user review that says the end gunfight saves the movie: Sure it is an action packed scene, but it is not meant as a glorious sequence. It shows a town torn apart because two men felt they had to kill the people responsible for killing their friends. How many people had to suffer at their hands? Costner shows this brilliantly in a slow-mo shot with only music playing. This film shows the lawlessness that plagued the West in the late 1800s.

203,kaibab1,Deja vu all over again,5,2 September 2003,"With this malformed cross between Unforgiven and High Noon, Kevin Costner delivers further evidence of his penchant for using reels and reels of otherwise good film to register much ado about nothing.  Unimaginative (most scenes are shot at sunrise or sunset) and stretched to implausibility (in the romance -catch those plastic flowers through which Kevin Costner approaches Annette Bening at the end- and gun battle scenes), with DUH dialogue and predictable situations broadly hinted at by the by-the-numbers sound track, this is one Western that should be left out to pasture on the plains already well visited by one Mr. Eastwood in the aforementioned Unforgiven.",Open Range

It just makes a change to see something unlike the other westerns where there were sharpshooters galore, and punch-ups go on for ever.Kudos to the writer, director and actors for this gripping story, with particular merit to Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall who play the grizzled 'free grazers'.

205,DrLovelick,FINALLY A WESTERN THAT ISN'T DRY!,10,29 July 2003,"Being a coordinator at one of the most popular San Francisco theatres around, the Embarcadero Center Cinema, I had the liberty of staying for a screening of Kevin Costner's latest directorial effort, `Open Range.'  In addition, I hanged out afterwards to be at this Q&A session with Kevin Costner himself, being conducted by Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle.BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW, PLEASE BE AWARE THERE ARE SPOILERS!OPEN RANGE (dir: Kevin Costner):  ****So many westerns made these days are married with style and little substance.  To me, it almost feels as if you're making a period piece where actors are not really trying to embody the characters they play but rather trying to make an impression.  Same goes with costumes and makeup.  They make the characters so shiny and elegant looking, that everything feels artificial.  In the case of Westerns, being that they take place years back into the 19th century, you often wonder...  Is this the way everyone behaved and everything looked back in those times?The Western genre has been deemed to be old and tiresome, as if it's grown duller as the years have passed.  People say the Western genre is dying. Is it really dying or are people not bothering to actually write decent stories?  Nothing's really dead unless it's been made the exact same way over and over again.It is to the great credit of Kevin Costner that he does not make this mistake in directing ""Open Range.""  Unlike many Westerns which present themselves in the obvious, classy good ol' times feel to them, this one keeps its eye on the story the whole time.  In fact, this movie gets so caught up in telling the story, it's as if we're not reminded that we're watching a Western.There is something very inspired in the way Costner sets this film up versus most pictures which are made these days, Western or not.  Unlike most filmmakers who start their movies off with a great attention grabber, don't follow up that moment with more interesting images and depth, and leave the ending unsatisfying, Costner builds and builds on the narrative of `Open Range' as the movie progresses.  At first one might not feel that compelled at the beginning.  The movie starts off with credits rolling in front of a vast landscape but nothing instant to grab people.  If this is a turnoff for people, then perhaps they need to be more patient.  If one were to actually allow `Open Range' to progress, then they'd be very interested as minutes pass.And what to come in the narrative are images and moments which you never would expect in an average Western picture.1) Lack of subplot- In a lesser film such as `Texas Cowboys' or `American Outlaws,' you'd have the narrative quickly move from one scene to another without much time to really get to know the characters.  In `Open Range,' plot isn't the main concern here.  Costner is more interested in focusing on the story as a character study.  No MTV-style cutting nor overly-stylistic, camera moving panoramic shots (a la Michael Bay's films) to be found here.2) No larger-than-life heroes.  Here we have Costner and Robert Duvall playing characters (Charley Waite and `Boss' respectively) who while are the lead characters and virtually in every scene (either together or separate), the texture of the two does not overwhelm any other character.  While `Open Range' is far from having the style of filmmaking that Italian Neorealism uses, it still takes consideration in showing mainly how characters fit in society, instead of having them trying to show off cool tricks solely for entertainment purposes.  Charley and Boss are basically two guys who have lots of morals and if they screw up, they know that they should try to improve on their mistakes.  In fact, both Charley and Boss much different characters that you would expect.Charley has a good heart but in reality, his violent actions have made his decisions irrational.  When Charley tries to kill one of Baxter's (Michael Gambon) goons after he's wounded in cold blood, Boss tells him that if he does, his actions won't be any different than Baxter and his men's. Kevin Costner, in one of his better performances, shows how Charley is often an insecure man who is trying his best to be a good.  In a way, Charley's violent nature is comparable to the Henry Oak character Ray Liotta plays in `Narc,' except in a more subtle way.Boss (played by Robert Duvall in a performance that should win him a Best Actor nomination) may be smarter than Charley but he's really not acting as if he's a show off.  He's really trying to be there to keep Charley in check.  Boss is probably the most moralistic out of any character in `Open Range' because he's the one who believes in common sense, while being considerate towards others.  Take for instance when bringing Button (Diego Luna) in to get cared for, he asks Sue (Annette Bening) how much her services will cost.  Sue doesn't feel she should charge him but Boss insists on paying her.  In a way, Boss believes people should work hard and always deserve a reward for their labor.3)  Charley and Sue's relationship in this film does not involve sex and does not cut to the kissing too quickly.  Rarely are relationships in film ever about the slow progress of real relationships.  There's this scene where Charley sees Sue start to clean the dishes, prompting him to volunteer to take over cleaning the dishes in the sink and insisting that Sue take a breather.  At this moment, you would expect `Open Range' to rush to the kissing, leaving Charley and Sue's conversation forced.  Not so.  Charley is clearly attracted to Sue but instead of saying she's a pretty girl or hitting on her, he talks about other things such as what may happen to Button (Diego Luna) and what Boss is dealing with.  The result of this scene is something very real and completely the opposite of the relationship Costner and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had in `Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.'  Here we have not a sexual or lust moment but rather a moment when Charley simply wants to be a good man and ease Sue's pain.  Then at the end of `Open Range,' Charley and Sue finally kissing each other (for the first time!).  However, no overly sentimental soap opera is to be found here. Instead, we see Charley and Sue as real, imperfect people, not as lovers with speaking typical, soppy, `I love you this' `I love you that' dialog.4) Remember Diego Luna from `Y Tu Mama Tambien?'  In case you never knew, Luna played Tenoch, the brown haired best friend of Julio.  Well in here, instead of Luna creating a character who is always trying to remind us he's Spanish, he develops his character of Button as if he was another person living his life.  In fact, no person in `Open Range' ever has a sensitivity issue towards Button being Spanish nor does he get glorified into a stereotypical Spanish individual.  The only time where you think anything is being discussed about Button's Spanish background is when Charley mentions to Sue that he found Button homeless in Texas (which of course is right next to part of Mexico).  However, that implies, more than it explains.5) There is hardly any makeup.  Here Kevin Costner's intention supposedly is to make `Open Range' authentic enough that to not include makeup would mean to see the flawed skin and emotions of characters a lot easier than if they had pounds of powder touched densely all over their faces.6) There's a scene when Charley is to save a terrier dog from being swept away in a flood in town.  Instead of the sequence being a long, triumphant scene of excitement, it becomes more reality-based.  Here Charley tries to and successfully grab the dog from being drowned in water and everything is quiet.  No music present.7) In the end shootout scene, you'd expect the villagers to crowd around left and right in town, leaving the road as the center point of the shootout.  Instead of that happening, many villagers actually leave town! Realistically, potential violence doesn't necessarily provoke people to want to see it.I could go on and on about the many clichés `Open Range' has avoided but that's enough for you to get the idea.  Essentially if you are expecting an action type of Western, you're in for the wrong film.  There is really only one big action sequence but it doesn't occur until near the end.  By this time, we'd have gotten to know Charley, Boss, Sue, and Button so well, that when this action sequence happens, you really care for their well-being. It's as if Kevin Costner holds off on really doing much action of any sort until the end, simply because to have action occur without any character development prior would leave the viewer empty.In this action sequence, which doesn't involve as much dialog as others scenes do, we are treated in one of the most visually stunning and exciting shootout sequences since the big battle scene in `The Wild Bunch.' Costner cuts back and forth and back and forth as a way of showing tension between Charley & Boss's side, Baxter and his men, the villagers, Sue, and Button. How this sequence starts and ends, I will not tell.  All I can say is that the payoff is striking and the timing of this sequence is amazing.  And how the `Open Range' cuts from one shot to another showing gunshots going off. If anyone ever complained about such shots in Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life being unexciting, you will be relieved when you see this sequence in `Open Range.'  It's a masterful sequence of quick editing and timing that should earn the film another Academy Award Nomination at least for Best Film Editing.As much as I want to emphasize `Open Range' is heading the Western genre in exactly the right direction as it should be going, I found there to be one fault in it: the villains.  Whereas all of the good people in this movie are richly detailed, the bad guys (including Baxter) just seem too evil.  I remember Ain't It Cool News' Harry Knowles saying he got sick and tired of the villains whom act and think in the sense of, `ewww, I'm so evil!' and have the traditional sinister grins on their faces.  However, considering `Open Range' is a fiction film and is really trying to give us a statement on moral values, being so focused on developing three-dimensional villains isn't as important.  It helps but it could be a lot worse.  `Open Range' could have been very mediocre as whole.By the way, it would be harsh not to mention the late Michael Jeter.  As many people have raved about him ever since he died, Jeter gives one of his greatest, if not the best, performances as Percy, the man whom Charley and Boss have the best relationship in town.  Every moment Jeter has on screen is memorable and timeless.  His acting shows Percy as a humane and very considerate man, one that anyone would want to have as a friend.  And the moments in which Jeter appears on screen with Costner and Duvall in the shootout scene just makes you want to love Jeter even more.  May he rest in peace.Anyway, onto the Q&A session.  Now I was told that Kevin Costner was going to answer questions after `Open Range' ended.  What I wasn't prepared was how honest Costner was in responding to whatever people in the audience had to ask him.  I don't remember what the exact questions were but I'll summarize a few things Costner said throughout the session.1) Costner made a statement saying something along the lines of, `a film's value is worth more than its box office gross, no matter if you show it to someone 5 years or 20 years from now.'2) Costner went about how he feels Westerns made these days are dull and have more style than substance, that they have little recognition for history.3) He also was modest enough to actually admit he made mistakes in his career.  What was nice was that Costner went into detail about how certain films he's starred in have had great stories but that in the post-production stage, they got butchered up to the lowest common denominator.4) Costner also mentioned Michael Jeter was a great actor whom he misses. He said he showed Jeter `Open Range' about two weeks (maybe even more) before he died.So that's about all I have to say.  Now my last words.  If you are a great fan of the Western genre and have wanted to see a worthy Western for so long, please do not avoid seeing `Open Range.'  I can guarantee you it is NOT crap, forgettable entertainment as plenty of movies these days tend to be.  Also, `Open Range' is the film that has redeemed Costner for sure from `The Postman.'",Open Range

208,pughimag,About time Costner - you did good!,10,15 August 2003,"I think I've seen one movie where Kevin Costner did a half decent job. Most of the time in other (really bad) movies I've seen him in he was Kevin Costner in character as well as Kevin Costner as supposed actor e.g., Robin Hood and the Cuban crisis flick.This time I have to take my hat off to him - this movie was entertaining and wholly satisfying. I loved every minute of it - even the smooshy parts which were kept reasonably short thank goodness. Of course Robert Duvall is the antithesis of Kevin Costner - there isn't a movie that I've seen him in that I haven't liked and his presence basically drew me to the theater despite Costner's name. He is his usual outstanding self in this movie too - utterly convincing!There's humor, gunslinging, cows, mud, saloon, a girl, gunfights, scenery, horses, stable, horse troughs with bullet holes, tough guys, bad guys, twisted Sheriff, good guys, bullets, rifles (no hangin's and no Indians though) - almost everything you want to see in a good ol' western where the few take on the many in a town that's lost its courage (same old plot).I particularly like the way Robert Duvall's character talks to his victims - you'll see what I mean!This movie was one of the highlights of my summer as was sea biscuit - nice job guys! I was complete!",Open Range
209,Johnny-125,New Appreciation for a Slow Pace,7,4 June 2013,"Last night as I started to watch this I almost stopped during the opening scenes. The pace is slow, real slow. I tend not to tolerate slow moving stories very well. Yet as soon as I met Boss Spearman and Charley Waite I was hooked. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner did a fantastic job of convincing me they were driving those cows through the open range. In fact by the time the two hours and nineteen minutes rolled by, I didn't feel it. I'm not saying that slower paced westerns are all I will watch now, but this one was worthy the viewing. May even find itself reviewed a few years down the road.Great entertainment, and a movie to help one appreciate the slower pace.",Open Range

People need to relax!Deep down I think most men want a cause and a woman worth fighting for and most women want to be considered beautiful and worth fighting for.  This movie did a great job incorporating such classic themes, was pretty to look at (great dog's-eye views), historically authentic-looking, had fun good guys and really wicked bad guys.I thought a little of the script was so hokey, that maybe it was intended to be so as a joke (e.g., let's rustle up some grub, etc.)  Still, this was very good movie.

212,robsha,Lonesome Range or was that Open Dove,9,2 September 2003,"I love a good western and this was a good western because it gives you everything a good western should. We have a strong silent cowboy with a secret past, we have a noble cause, and we have the grit to make a stand.Kevin Costner does a good job with his role. Robert Duval plays Gus from Lonesome Dove and the interaction between the two very Gus and Call. Annette Benning plays the role of Lorena Wood from Lonesome Dove who falls in love with the dark brooding cowboy. I thought this movie took ideas not only from Lonesome Dove with the epic feel and the camaraderie of the two main characters. But also borrowed the antihero of Unforgiven and the men making the stand for the small town from the likes of Tombstone or Young Guns. If your going to use ideas than I guess those are some pretty good westerns to pattern yourself after.
I enjoyed the gun fights almost as much as I enjoyed the sweeping panorama shoots of the British Columbian mountain ranges. The bad guys were bad and we all wanted them to lose, even the town hated them. In the end we get what we want and that's the little guy standing up to the big guy.
The Western is a wholly and unique American way of thinking. I think that may be why Westerns in general don't sell overseas. It shows our swagger and our doggedness that made this country a great place to live. I digress.Western lovers will love it and all those other city varmints won't. It's big and it's fun and makes you want to buy some spurs.",Open Range
213,Calstanhope,Don't miss this one,7,8 March 2004,"Kevin Costner shows us again that he has the feel to direct and act in a great Western. Add this one to the list of ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Silverado"" and ""Wyatt Earp."" Robert Duvall also adds to his considerable repertoire as an actor in Westerns. He plays himself, really, as he does in so many parts these days, but luckily he has the range and ability to give a lot of feeling to this role. I won't go into the movie with spoilers, but let me offer this observation: Westerns aren't as common as they used to be, but they make up for quantity with much better quality; this movie is a good example of a latter-day Hollywood Western. Don't be put off if the first part of the movie seems slow in the action department. This is a film that builds to a tremendous climax and the viewer will be rewarded if he lets it proceed at its own pace.",Open Range
214,montecristo42,Open Range--Wow (SPOILERS),9,19 August 2003,"A lot of people have already covered this, but what a fantastic movie. I've been reading the message boards and couldn't agree more with the positive comments on this film. Even though most of you have said this, I just wanted to put my two cents in, b/c I loved this movie so much.MINOR SPOILERS The pacing is DELIBERATELY ""slow"" for a reason--we get to see the characters develop in a way that isn't forced or contrived.  I put slow in quotes, b/c though I thought the movie was slow, I was never bored.  Costner allows these characters to come to life naturally, and all aspiring writers/directors should take note of this; only occasionally does he offer glimpses into their histories (i.e. Charlie talking about his role in the Civil War; Boss talking about how he was married before).  Charlie and Boss are real people, who set out to make justice and put things right in the end.  Charlie is flawed, but sympathetic.  His wrongs were all done in the past AND we can tell by his actions that he is fighting to come to terms with them and be a good man again.  Let all aspiring writers/directors take note of this too--we can have flawed heroes, but they must be sympathetic!Also, the ""slow"" pacing sets up the ending well and makes it all the more dramatic.  Did anyone else find themselves getting more and more tense as the movie progressed?  During the second night of heavy rain (while they were in the town), I kept waiting for someone to come out of the woodwork and start shooting at them, but it didn't happen.  And the longer we went without the shootout, the more dramatic it became.Costner and Duvall are perfect together in this movie.  They have a wonderful dynamic.  Annette Bening is gorgeous, but they did not pretty her up for this movie.  Instead, they kept her looking more classically pretty. I liked how they didn't need some nineteen year old actress to play the love interest.  She is great in this movie, too, although some of her dialogue is a little heavy-handed.  Some of Costner's dialogue with her is smarmy too. But the dialogue between them has only minor flaws.  In fact, that is the only imperfection I found in the movie.This movie paid homage to many of the great Westerns as well, while being completely fresh.  Everyone's talked about this, so I won't bother.MAJOR SPOILER!!! The gunfight is probably the best Western shootout I've ever seen.  First of all, no standoff.  I don't mean to bash standoffs or anything, but it wouldn't have worked in this movie b/c Costner did not develop the other gunfighter's character at all (we don't meet him till five minutes b/f the fight) and Charlie and Boss were taking on a bunch of guys.  It would have been so contrived to put a standoff in there somewhere (I guess they would have done it at the end).  Besides, the standoff didn't fit with Charlie's character.  He wasn't out to give the other men any respect b/c they hadn't shown him or his friends any.  But the lack of a standoff is better b/c of how it starts, which was awesome--I was completely shocked when Charlie walks up to the other gunfighter, asks ""Are you the one that shot our friend?"", waits for an answer, and plugs him in the head. I mean, here we are, we've been waiting the entire movie for this fight basically.  We know how Charlie and Boss plan to pull it off.  We know who the best gunfighter on the other side is.  So what does Costner do?  Walks up and shoots him in the head.  I can't believe how much of a loop I was thrown.I found myself tense throughout the entire gunfight, grabbing the armrests on my seat.  It was great b/c the whole movie followed the dramatic curve well. The tension mounted, just continually building and building.  We cared about Charlie and Boss so much, we didn't want to see them die.  We knew they were in over their heads b/f they got into it, but they went anyway, b/c they had to do the right thing.  I almost couldn't watch when Boss charged the office at the end to kill Baxter.I just can't say enough good things about this movie, and most of you have already beaten me to the punch anyways.  Couldn't help myself, though, b/c this movie was the best one I've seen all year.  And I am not a die hard Costner fan, either.  I think he's made great movies (Field of Dreams, Untouchables, Dances) and some bad movies (3000 Miles to Nowhere).  But all in all, I think he's a great actor and we should give him respect for always assuming full responsibility for the successes and failures of his projects.

215,stevegc,A story about Redemption,10,24 August 2003,"Open Range is the story of two cow pokes that are running a herd of cattle through a territory that doesn't allow for free ranging of cattle. There is an evil Irish cattle baron that is seeking to scatter their cattle and kill them in the process. Robert Duval gives an Oscar award winning performance as the old cattle hand that knows it all because he's done it all and Costner plays the brooding second in command cattle hand with a sorted history. They also throw a bit of romance in the movie between Costner and Annette Bening. It has the best climatic shoot out I have seen since Unforgiven.Kevin Costner's character, Charley, is a man who doesn't believe in second chances. His reluctance to forgive his co-worker for cheating at cards shows us that he is not willing to forgive himself for the things he has done in his past. Charley has changed his ways and he doesn't even know it.The person he was in his past has driven him to become the best person possible; a person of integrity, loyalty and respect. In that regard, I would say that this is a movie about second chances. I would further say that this is a movie about redemption. In a very subtle manor, Charley effects redemption for himself, his co-workers, his boss, his future wife and an entire town. I would even go so far as to say that all of the bad things that happened to Charley in his past served the purpose of this redemption. For it is the catalyst that brings this entire story together. I walked away from this movie uplifted and restored with hope. Hope that my sorted past will lead me to be a better person; a person of integrity, loyalty and respect.http://scottishtexan.blogspot.com",Open Range
216,Polanski_Fan,Solid Genre Picture,8,28 June 2004,"This movie could have been ruined in a number of ways, namely Kevin Costner's terrible acting, or the lame love plot, or political correctness, or whatever has happened to movies since ""Unforgiven"" came out.  But, no, this movie is actually really good. What interested me is that the bad guy in this movie is the land-owner, whereas in the classic film ""Shane,"" it is the freegrazers who are the evil ones, running roughshod over the homesteaders' lands. I like how either side can be drawn on for protagonists and stereotypes by Hollywood. Anyways, there is a superb gun battle, convincing rising action, and some great acting by Robert Duvall.

Costner's acting and directing is wooden, Bening might as well be serving wine in a Manhattan high-rise, the plot is actionless until an hour passes, the story is predictable, cliché-ridden, unbelievable, overlong, copies from 100 better westerns, shows no character development, is prudish, two-dimensional, populated by stereotypes, and derives its only action and interest from a long-prepared, bloody, painless endless vengeful, hypocritical gunfight, kind of 2-against-100, that turns out exactly as you expect and want it to.

218,FMK,There Must Be Some Mistake,4,1 December 2004,"Now based on factual information, experience and calculation the odds, I have to go by the assumption that everyone who raved about this movie in the media, to me personally, as well as on this site, saw the same movie I just did. I'll just have to shelve my confusion and give you my minority report.This movie sucks.First of all, I haven't heard a single bit of dialogue I believed. Duvall - in the second-to-best role of the film (see my PS) - has the horrible task of delivering disjointed sound bites of open range wisdom. Costner, as wooden as ever, drawls out his own, usually unconnected, one-liners. Every supposedly meaningful dialogue seems designed to shout out the painfully obvious points of the movie, which were already old and tired after the first decennium of westerns. I can only conclude that the script is terrible.Added to the bad dialogue is the uncertain camera standpoints and moves and the rickety editing, giving me the impression that Costner was in permanent disagreement with cinematographer James Muro while shooting the film. Pointless cuts of bits of sky, weird low camera work, sudden clumsy moves... it all adds up to a tiring and amateuristic watch.So technique-wise, this movie hasn't much to recommend it. Perhaps the story makes it worthwhile? But no. A chewed-out theme of revenge of the underdog, a love subplot that adds a useless extra 15 minutes onto the end of the film, some incomprehensible bits and scenes that just don't make sense. What do you mean, they walk in and out of town as they please while all the bad guys are gunning for them? And what's with the house frame almost getting destroyed before Charley rescues the town dog? Speaking of which, how deeply lame is it that the rescue of the town mutt is the sole factor endearing Duvall and Costner to the townspeople?Zooming in on a set of china at the end of the film, by comparison, is almost acceptable. Bad Kevin! Bad, naughty Kevin!But then again, everyone else seems to love the film, so I'll just shut up now and have myself a back-to-back viewing of Once Upon a Time in the West and Unforgiven.

(I'd easily rate Postman one of the worst movies ever). Costner redeems himself somewhat. He still has a tendency to stretch scenes out a bit. And, on many ocassions kept wondering why his shots remained so static. During key interchanges, he'd remain in a medium shot, when I close-up was called for, to build intimacy. (I don't think I've ever noticed that before in a movie...I wanted more close-ups). Duval stole the movie playing essentially the same ""Lonesome Dove"" character. Gotta love him. It's a solid piece of entertainment. And Annette Bening does wear make-up, it's just subtle. (I tire of publications stating she isn't wearing any make-up.)

220,alana-dill,"A classic, but not an instant one",10,28 July 2003,"more the stir-over-a-slow-flame kind. Saw it at a sneak preview in San Francisco last Thursday night. It is a cinematic equivalent of Slow Food: authentic, satisfying, and leaving you with a bigger picture of the world.Many of my favorite films have a strong ""sense of place"" (apparently from comments at the preview I'm not alone). Open Range is ostensibly about a range war in the 1880's; our protagonists are ""free-rangers"" (G-d, I hope I remember that phrase right, otherwise I've made this film out to be about chickens!), nomadic cowboys who graze their herd and move along before wearing out the range.  Kevin Costner gave post-screening interview; he stated that the best films are really about the relationships between men and women; and I think that people will watch Open Range more than once, to savor the development of those relationships.Having come off of seeing Charley's Angels (my bad) and 28 Days Later (worth seeing), in the first 20 minutes of Open Range I found myself feeling restless, like, ""um, when does the movie start?""  But the beauty of Open Range drew me in, and it's still with me. The light changes over the mountains and grassy hills; wildflowers nod, water flows, cows do their bovine thing, mud has a life of its own; the cowboys speak tersely and communicate obliquely (but the dialog is a joy when it comes), with long intervals of action between talking. These men clearly go for months without seeing a town; they're dependent on each other, wary of the outside world, a little stir-crazy despite the wide open spaces because they can't afford to be away from each other too long. The plot grows more complex and slowly builds to a showdown between avaricious local landowners and the free-rangers.There's a flawless sense of chemistry and developing relationship between the primary cast and supporting players. There's also enough danger and action to keep adrenaline junkies humming along happily. I'm not crazy about gunfights but the film's climax is chilling. Although there were some shots of the townsfolk scrambling for safety, the gunfight doesn't occur in a vacuum and isn't cartoonish. Of course there's the obligatory child-in-danger moment, but I especially liked the showdown's denouement, because the townspeople react with realistic shock and rage at their peaceful town's desecration. How would you comfort your 4-y/o daughter after a gunfighter bleeds to death on your front porch?  So many movies put such an emphasis on violence, yet no one gets really HURT. In this movie, the violence hurts, and that feels right.During the post-screening interview with Costner, he mentioned that (this is not an exact quote, just the gist) a Western is a formula and there are time-honored elements to that formula: the challenge is to honor the formula but not fall into cliché.  I have an I obscure and useless talent: picking up on cues that inform later plot twists. Normally when I see a movie, I find myself nudging my husband (and sometimes whispering VERY QUIETLY): (don't worry, no spoilers here) i.e., ""she dropped her earring...  The kitten is toast...  That nail gun has a future..."" Well, the film did indeed provide cues, but the payoffs were fresh and interesting. I'll spare you further detail. During the interview, Costner did explicitly state that he HATES it when audiences talk during movies. I sort of hate it when OTHER people are talking but...If it's me talking, please remind me to shut up, I deserve it. Now for my pet peeve: don't bring your kids to R-rated movies. Really. Everyone benefits from your getting a sitter, ok?As for the performances, Robert Duvall is dead-on. His character, Boss, is the spiritual twin of my father-in-law who was raised in Eastern Washington farm country.  Costner is well-cast as a man who finds a dilemma that keeps growing more horns. His forte is solid, action-oriented yet thoughtful American men, and he's really at his best in this role. Annette Bening is amazing: a mature, gorgeous, adult, complex, intelligent *woman*. Comparing Bening's performance to her repellant characters in Bugsy and the Grifters, and the high- maintenance b!+(h in American Beauty, she reveals extraordinary talent, depth, and versatility. Costner mentioned that she was courageous enough not to wear makeup for the role, and indeed she looks radiant and lovely but REAL. She makes Goldie Hawn look like a 2-bit tart. (No offense, Goldie, but now that you're gonna be a grandma, it's ok if you back off on the Botox. Kissing those little fingers and toes will be so much easier if you can feel your lips.)I'm rooting for Bening to get at least a Best Supporting Actress nomination.

Credit due to Kostner for sticking to his principles and directing an old fashioned film that is about story and character and builds slowly to a powerful climax rather than feeling the need to insert an action sequence every 15 minutes.This is also proof that, in the right hands, a film can be both slow moving and totally absorbing.Great casting. Kostner unselfishly gives the limelight to Robert Duvall. Annette Benning shines in her role as the town doctors sister.It is in the smaller moments that this film really excels, such as in a scene between the 3 leads where Kostner learns for the first time, having known Duvall's character for 10 years, that his friend had been married. It provides a great insight into how men communicate with each other and only a skilled and sensitive director like Kostner could have pulled this off.Stunning cinematography. My only criticism is that I felt this film would have been enhanced even further by a more expansive and emotional musical score.A small gripe for an otherwise very satisfying movie going experience.",Open Range
222,axnjxn1701,Open Range - An Open Country Classic!,10,1 January 2018,"It's extremely hard to identify with text that doesn't add something new to the incredible reviews already composed; but I'd say I think I found my favorite Western movie on Jan1st, 2018! While my father always watched Westerns with the ever fascinating John Wayne, you ponder what else could a classic be about? Clint Eastwood made a fine film, and not like this is new territory, about good guys trying to correct some bad guys doing bad things on the old frontier... What is new, (being that it is actually made in 2003) is that Costner's rendition charms in literally EVERY single way of storytelling. Seriously... I absolutely love watching Robert Duvall in a western and here, he's nothing short of realistic, amazing and the perfect partner to accompany Costner in this journey both in text and on screen. I'll save the plot for 50 others that have capitulated it so darn well, but for me, I simply can't pick out a particular part that either wasn't needed, or, was either under-done or overdone..? The scenery is a dream, the story; punctual and hearty - and the story.... the story is simply spellbinding in a way where it offers a few turns to keep the next chapter fresh. Annette Benning was simply charming and eloquent. Can't say anything bad here. But for Costner, he doesn't play the absolutely 'roughest-gunner' out there, but he inserts just at correct moments, humanity and yet, he's got a past he slowly reveals. This film is stunning from all angles, ideals, cinematography and editing. A simple yet charismatic film with incredibly well developed and devout characters. Loved it.",Open Range
223,fresh-4,"superb. bravo, costner!",10,20 August 2003,"if there were any justice, this would be the sleeper hit of the summer season. whether or not it finds its audience, kevin costner should feel very proud. this is a rich, moving, funny, utterly gripping and honest film experience. beautifully acted, written, directed and shot. i'm not usually a fan of westerns, but this one held me from start to finish. it's genuinely character based, you care about the people, and every beat of the film feels full of life and true. costner deserves enormous credit for bringing such a vibrant and compelling work to life. most impressively, he doesn't 'hog' the picture. he gives it over generously to robert duvall, who is superb. it's a wonderful film, full of carefully observed details, and heartbreaking moments.  and it was a pleasure to witness a summer movie audience engage so deeply with such a thoughtful and intelligent epic.  great work, kevin!!",Open Range
224,poliglot,One of the Best of the Best Westerns of all Times!,10,21 August 2003,"Open Range is quite simply one of the best Westerns of all time.  I would not hesitate to add this film to the list of  greats such as Lonesome Dove, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Shootist, Quigley Down Under, The Fastest Gun Alive, Outlaw Jose Wales, and other Superb Western films. Certainly one of Costner's best films it had everything,  It was funny, Romantic in the truest sense of the word, Violent, and poignant.  And what is more, Thanks to all the cast Superbly Acted having of course probably the finest actor alive in Robert Duval, one of the Finest Character actors, the late Michael Jeter, and Superbly Directed and Acted by Kevin Costner himself.  The Best Review by far here on IMDb and the one that expresses my own views perfectly of this film was submitted by DBP who said:""Open Range is, without doubt, one of the finest films of any genre to come along in years. A deeply felt, funny, violent, gorgeous movie. It's that rare commodity, a completely satisfying experience. Yet the audience of twenty-somethings I had the misfortune of sharing the theater at the Arclight with couldn't suppress their idiotic snickering throughout. Can these really be my peers? The film has so much to recommend it; I guarantee you won't see a better ensemble cast this year. But perhaps young audiences are not able to process sincerity anymore. Open Range is full of humor, but it does mean everything it says. It has no irony. Maybe that's the trouble.Afterward I heard several baboons who'd been in the audience gibbering about their own future film careers, and how much hope they had in themselves after watching Open Range. God help us.""
Thank you DBP of Los Angeles..In summing up my Review.I also heard of three young (under 30) Movie Reviewers saying of this film ""You've seen one Cowboy Movie You've seen them all.  To which I ad another hearty God Help Us!I have two minor picky-ooonie observations.  First of all as a 65 year old man I can tell you that in the world of men it is divided basically into two categories.  ""Spitters""  and ""Non Spitters""  It is my belief that Kevin Kostner, like my self is a NON spitter and like most of us non spitters usually spits on his shirt.  He should have left those scenes out or given them to a seasoned spitter.   Secondly, according to most fire arms authorities and Gun Fighter Folk- Loreists the ""Fanning"" of the gun (that is the rapid fire with the palm of the left hand) was almost never used successfully by any self respecting cowboy or gunfighter.  This technique almost always just wasted Amo, and made the pistol inaccurate...this view is even stated in Wyatt Earps memoirs.  However, with a wry smile on my face over these two very minor flaws I can tell you please go to see this wonderful OUTSTANDING  film.I can also tell you that this movie will be totally overlooked by the Academy.  It is politically incorrect, And the ""New"" Hollywood is just not in place for it.  Folks like Michael Moore and the other imbecils  will be all over it I am sure, blubbering about inspiring violence and gun control and all the rest of that variety of silliness",Open Range

226,QuintHooper,thirst quenching,7,12 September 2003,"Open Range quenches our thirst after a long famine without any good westerns.  Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall star in this enjoyable western about two `free-range' cowboys who butt heads with your proverbial `bad guy who owns the whole town.'  This film isn't a Clint Eastwood and it's not a Sam Peckinpah (not that those are bad).  Instead, it's a fresh peek into two very likable characters as they stand up for what is right.  If you don't like Costner, put that aside for this film because he actually pulls off the best I've seen him since Silverado. (Ironically, another great western where he plays a completely different character)  This movie has the perfect balance of testosterone, romance, humor and heart.  You won't be disappointed.  7 out of 10",Open Range
227,J_Cheever_Loophole,Terrific Western,10,14 February 2007,"There simply are not enough Westerns made these days so it's a lovely surprise when a really good one comes along. Open Range is tough and gritty and has a old fashioned Western feel about it but served up with modern production values.It's also a welcome return to top form by Kevin Costner who directs and stars. Needless to say Robert Duvall is excellent and together with Annette Benning and Michael Gambon makes up a top quality cast.Like most Westerns you don't need to be Einstein to follow the plot. Costner, an ex gunman, and Duvall, his boss, are moving a herd when they come across a town led and controlled by the corrupt and sadistic Gambon. Events, pride and the need for justice, force the two to take a stand against the Gambon, his Sheriff and their hired guns. A very violent confrontation ensues.The (Canadian) scenery is beautiful, the film is nicely paced and suitable time is devoted to ensure that the characters have depth. This character development is important, not just to the motivations that make them do what they do, but because you then care about their fate. The dialogue is definitely a case of less is more, which is just how Westerns should be.It all adds up to a very enjoyable film which everyone should enjoy but which lovers of Westerns will errr... love.",Open Range
228,Philippe-B,"A simple western at first look, complex on a second",10,17 September 2003,"Kevin Costner should stick to baseball and westerns. He shines in both. The last time I saw a western I REALLY enjoyed was Silverado in 1985 (sorry Clint) which coincidentally also starred a young Costner along with a string of unknowns like Kevin Kline,Danny Glover, Scott Glenn and the well-known,superb Brian Dennehy.Open Range is a simple story discussing a basic tenet of American society: freedom to do what you please as long as it does not injure or harm your neighbour. Duvall is great, Annette Bening is also (and gorgeous!). The acting is understated and real. The townsfolk act like you or I would, especially when seeing heavily armed men walking into a tavern/kitchen - nervously.The Old West seen in countless movies is mostly myth: the majority of settlers were veterans of the civil war of 1861-65 and were quite capable of handling would-be thieves/tyrants. Handguns were NO match for a good Winchester in the hands of a former soldier...This movies reminds us of one of the few times when violence could and did occur: over access, property rights and freedom.To be free requires vigilance AND the will do fight for it. Or as my father always said. ""NEVER start a fight but if you're in one, finish it!""",Open Range
229,Gatecrasherfilms,Very Worthy Western,9,4 July 2006,"By far one of Kevin Costner's finest pieces, right behind Dances with Wolves. Costner's hard work (as actor, director and producer) has paid off handsomely in this finely crafted film. The story's structure is simple but the difference comes with the heart that Costner, Duvall and Benning instills in their characters. I've seen my share of westerns - good, bad and sucky - and it seems that the genre has fallen out of favor with today's movie-going audience. But this film proves (along with Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven) that if you put a little intelligence into the writing, add top-notch actors (can Duvall do no wrong?) and direct it in a way that blends the story, characters and (beautiful) scenery seamlessly then the audience will find your film.",Open Range
230,garypage,It goes on and on and on like an open range...,4,24 March 2004,"The scenery and photography were at times breathtaking in this film.  Too bad there's wasn't a film attached to it that was also breathtaking.I found myself laughing too many times at the many ridiculous turns of events in this bloated Western.Such as...(SPOILERS AHEAD!)A forty-something year-old nurse (Annette Bening) who is perhaps the prettiest woman in a town filled with men, and yet she's not married, engaged, or even dating anyone.  In fact, the men in the town are so lacking in testosterone that they don't even try to chat her up.  Maybe the town is a homosexual haven in the West?  Perhaps, she herself is lesbian?  Nah, can't be because when a cowboy with very little charisma (Kevin Costner)shows up she suddenly discovers she has a libido and falls in love with him.Gunfights in which guns always have a never-ending supply of bullets and hit with pinpoint accuracy.  (Back in those days most guns were highly inaccurate and unreliable.  The same can be said for the men shooting the guns, but you wouldn't know it from this film.  You might think that Costner was a sharpshooter who had some kind of S.W.A.T. training.) Of course, when it comes to shooting the main villain (Michael Gambon), no-one can shoot straight.  At one point almost the entire town is shooting at him while he's holed up in a little room and yet miraculously he isn't killed.  (Perhaps, I was watching a Westernized version of Pulp Fiction where an act of Divine Intervention had taken place!)A near-dead character named Button (who hours before was in a coma with little chance of ever recovering) somehow gets the strength, determination, and ability to take part in the final shoot-out.The old coot (Duvall) who turns into Superman.  He even gets the upper hand on and successfully beats up a group of young men more than half his age. And when he gets shot in the stomach in the final gunfight, somehow he's able to stop himself from bleeding to death and continue on making speeches and shooting at the bad guys.I could go on and on (like this film does), but I think I'll take this time and rewatch a true Western directed by John Ford.",Open Range
231,The_Master_Critic,This movie is far better than it has any right to be.,7,6 November 2004,"While watching this movie, I finally pegged what it is that I don't like about Kevin Costner. It's his delivery of lines. He's really pretty good at expressing emotion with his face and body language, and he has a pretty good look. It's just that every line he delivers - be it in Bull Durham, Robin Hood, or Open Range, is delivered the same. The lack of inflection and emotion in the delivery of his dialog is just plain annoying, and it's this way in every movie he's ever been in. That being said, he still makes a pretty friggin' cool Cowboy. He looks as natural on a horse as he would in an acting class. He just looks like he belongs there.If we could limit Costner to only ""acting"" in Baseball movies and Westerns, I'd probably be a bigger fan. Going in to this movie, even with Costner's success in Westerns, I was still pretty positive that I would find it a complete waste of time. I'm happy to report that, despite Kev's ""acting"", I really enjoyed Open Range.There really isn't anything new to Open Range. It's got a nice story, beautiful scenery, and mostly solid acting ( you can guess why I say mostly ). The story is as old as Westerns themselves, but I'm not going to say much about it; I feel that one of the reasons I enjoyed this movie as much as I did is due to the fact that I knew very little about it upon viewing. It's quite long, but I didn't find that a problem as I enjoyed the entire movie. Another positive is that the movie is very well directed. No matter how much I trash Costner's acting (it really is that bad), he is a very talented director. The biggest complaint I have about his producing and directing is that he needs to make better casting choices for the lead roles. This movie really flows nicely and fits together well. It's a bit slow in places, but I was never bored. There are a few silly lines that seem out of place, but nothing that really detracts from the movie.Overall, the performances were quite good. I always enjoy the work of Robert Duvall, but I've never been of fan of Annette Benning. Maybe it's her whiney voice or her tendency to overact, but she's never been on my list of favorites. Even so, she fit well in this picture. The biggest and most pleasant surprise in Open Range was the appearance of actor Michael Jeter. He was terrific and, as always, stole every scene he was in. He passed away this past March, and he will definitely be missed in Hollywood. I didn't realize he had any unreleased movies, and I was very happy to see him here.",Open Range

It is paced superbly moving from relevant dialogue/set up, to tension building, to one of the best release points on film - an epic and elaborate shoot out as good as any. As typical to most Hollywood movies there is a love story; however, unlike the typical Hollywood love story embedded in an action film as a ploy to bulk up the female portion of the audience, this is a unique tale that is not bogged down with sentimentality but steeped in realism. The whole execution of the plot is well done with nothing superfluous in the tale, and unlike the typical western, the protagonists are not pushed around for 75% of the movie until the proverbial camel's back is broken and they are forced to take action. Instead, Waite and Spearman are men of action who don't wait to be wronged a second time. They suffer an injustice and avenge it without compunction.I have recently been rediscovering Costner's pre-""Waterworld"" output. It's perplexing to see someone put out so many quality films in the 80s and 90s only to release such crap over the last 10 years. ""Open Range"" is the only post-""Waterworld"" Costner movie that I can sit through, and to take that further it is the best film he's ever made. The only way I can stress this enough is to list the excellent movies he put out in the first half of his career: The Untouchables; Dances With Wolves; Robin Hood; No Way Out; Bull Durham; Revenge; Field of Dreams; JFK; A Perfect World; Wyatt Earp; Fandango - Open Range is better than all of these.",Open Range
236,bigwollie123,a simple storyline made extraordinary by the director and actor,10,25 March 2007,"I have to say that I was hesitant before seeing this movie, most westerns now days aren't nearly as enjoyable or well made as ones were 30, 40, 50 years ago. I waited to see this movie on DVD and I'm still regretting it. This movie has a very simple story-line but Costner with his stupendous acting and directing skills turned this into a future classic. The movie has some familiar faces like Robert Duvall, Annette Bening, and the late Michael Jeter. Although this movie had the average storyline of most okay westerns, the director and, most of all the actors turned this movie into one of the most exciting, wonderfully entertaining westerns in the past decade. This movie has action, suspense, and a little touch of drama and mystery that I think was added nicely to Costner's character. All the actors didn't fail their part at all and hopefully will continue to make movies on this level of greatness. I recommend this movie for people who just need to see some of the old school western with some of the new school effects.",Open Range
237,nelson_lee43,Good smouldering and atmospheric western,8,21 March 2004,"Never been a great fan of Kevin Costner and lets face it he has made a couple of very average movies of late.However, I really enjoyed this one which seemed to pay homage in some respects to the old western of the 1950's but maybe told it more like it was in reality. The gun fight at the end is as good as the hype and while it seems to take a while to get there with little seeming to happen the film never flags and interest is always maintained. Most of this is due in no small part to the relationship between Boss and Charley, which I thought was superb. Simple men with simple values, men who told a simple story without complication.The scenery and camera work were wonderful and it was only during the credits that I realised it was shot in the Canadian Plains and not in the States.Despite all of my enthusiasm for the film Costner does seem a bit wooden from time to time, much of which could be attributed to his applied style of speech. Duval is simply brilliant.""Spoiler alert""I was a bit disappointed at the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' scene at the beginning of the climatic gun fight.

For me it created a problem in the love story. It doesn't make much sense that two people can fall in love, not having seen each other that much, and talked even less, in the span of a couple of days.

Kevin Costner has his moments, but in some of the scenes with Anette Bening it just gets embarrassing. But anyway the character Kevin plays unquestionably the coolest I`ve seen him in(a quiet cold as ice killer). The two ""boys"" Mose and Button does a adequate job. But I`m not gonna talk about Anette Bening I`ts not worth mentioning.. The role of the bad guy is fairly simple just a lot of grinning and yelling it does not deserve a second thought.The locations are beautiful, definently some of the finest I`ve seen in this genre.And beware. If your walking in to the movies expecting a western/action movie your gonna be dissapointed like myself.But in the end the standoff was beautiful I`ve never had such a good feeling when I see a bad guy getting blown 3-4 meters off his back by a dobbel barreled shotgun :DThe movie starts out kinda slow and continues kinda slow, all the way until the end. And there is alot of running back and forth between the saloon and the doc`s house. The character developement is very good. you get to know some of Kevins dark past and Roberts tragic reason that drove him to become free-ranger.All in all it`s a good movie in it`s own way.

242,CPAScott,The second best modern western,8,28 August 2003,"Although my preference remains with Unforgiven (how can you dispute a film that won Best Picture?), Open Range is a well-done and masterful western.  I was a little skeptical given Kevin Costner's involvement as its so rare for Costner to produce anything worthwhile lately.But I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  In many ways, it was Robert Duvall that assisted greatly in my enjoyment.I thought the film tried to hard to make the ranch boss the bad guy and thus the film clearly had the ""white hats"" and the ""black hats"" (a missing feature in Unforgiven that makes it simply the best of the western genre), but overlooking that, the film was true to the manner of gunfights (no street showdowns).  I was particularly impressed with the filmmakers decision to portray how loud pistols really were.I gave Unforgiven a 10 out of 10, and would have given Open Range a 9 out of 10 if it weren't for the contrived and underdeveloped bad guys.  Thus, an 8 out of 10, still a good score!",Open Range
243,nfxstudios,Costner better behind the lense,8,6 September 2004,"I've never been a fan of Costner's ability as an actor. Something in his voice grates on me and seems to scream ""I'm acting!""However, there have been several movies to date with Costner in the lead that I count among my favorites, such as Bull Durham, Robin Hood (despite his lousy non-accent), Field of Dreams, and even For Love of the Game and Perfect World.So while Costner the actor does, typically, come across more as Costner playing Charlie than he does embodying the role, the photography and storytelling of Open Range are very well grounded, honest, and often beautiful.Development of characters isn't created by holding up cue cards with a detailed, written biography. It's revealed in subtle moments of dialog and action. We know that Costner has been a killer and a soldier and regrets both and wishes to be neither. We know that despite his sordid past he's generally honest, from his reaction to cheating at cards.We know Boss is living out a lonely, sad existence following the death of his wife and child, whom he never had the time to tell how he really felt towards them. We know that Boss is an honorable and peaceful man with a strong believe in justice and is slow to violence and slower yet to killing.Through Duvall's performance we see the difficulty of his decisions in letting men live until he's given no choice other than to kill them. We also that when it comes right down to it, he has the experience of age and a long hard life to know what needs to be done and how, and the ways in which Charlie and his younger companions are as sons to him.All that and more is character development for those who care to listen to dialog rather than numerous successive explosions and senseless shootouts.Photography-wise the film provides stunning vistas of the open prairie, and closer shots reflecting on the beauty of nature, such as a low shot across a clear shallow river. The photography of the climactic shootout uses several inventive and effective camera angles to provide us with information the characters don't have. And while a vast majority of films tend to have one recurring theme to the photography and setting, Open Range ranges from sun-drenched plains under a cloudless blue sky, to smoky saloons, to raging thunderstorms. Not many films work with such a pallet of lighting and setting, preferring to theme themselves as dark or light but rarely both.The story itself is perhaps clichéd, perhaps formulaic. It's been said that every story has already been told at least once; the merit is in the freshness of the re-telling. For me, the photography and the character development really made the movie. There was terrific chemistry between Duvall and Costner in particular, and while the romance angle was perhaps underplayed or underwritten, subtle chemistry does exist between Costner and Bening.Finally, in one of his last film roles, the late Michael Jeter provides a terrific offbeat performance as the livery owner who risks his life to help the good guys against the most powerful man in town.Some of the fades between scenes seemed to happen a bit too abruptly, but I'm uncertain whether to fault Costner as the director, or the editing of Michael Duthie and Miklos Wright. In the end I'm convinced that from an artistic standpoint, Costner's strength lies primarily behind the camera rather than in front of it.Open Range is essentially a two-character drama set in a beautifully photographed setting, and I believe it succeeds very well on those two levels.8/10",Open Range
244,as_williams,"Costner does what he knows, and that's a Western.",9,24 August 2003,"I was put off one night from seeing this film on the advice of a trusted movie buff friend, but I went and saw it this afternoon and I was very pleasantly surprised. Not being a huge fan of Dances With Wolves I had in mind a lot of boring shots of cattle herding and very short snippets of dialogue. Much to the contrary, Open Range moves along at a not too hurried and not too slow pace, much the way a cowboy moseys up and down the street. Duvall turns in a fantastic performance as Boss Spearman, a tough old free ranger that has a sense of right and wrong that compels him to risk death just to make sure a score is settled. Costner has in the past been in desperate need of an editor when he directs but this time I couldn't find an instance of something that he should have cut, with the sole exception of the sort of double ending. He gets the characters from A to B to C of the story without messing around unnecessarily. The cinematography is on par with The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers, and evokes life in 1882 western America quite unlike anything I have ever seen before. Many people will reference the gunfight near the end of the film as the only shining point but while it is expertly staged and has a fantastic pay off, I feel the film as a whole the movie is merely improved from really good to great. Costner doesn't do anything spectacular or break new ground as an actor but he does what he needs to do and he doesn't take over the film or steal from Duvall who most likely will get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination. While the film is long, it didn't feel like it to me, I really enjoyed the back and forth between Boss and Charley. The love story between Benning and Costner is done just right and I am of the opinion that it isn't as rushed and unnecessary as some other people might feel. It doesn't take away from the story but it serves as an example of how Costner's Charley is growing as a person. Michael Gambon turns in a serviceable villain though he is no Gene Hackman (Unforgiven, The Quick And The Dead). Annette Bening doesn't have a whole lot to do with her role but does very well with what little she has. It must be said that after a summer of long winded, artificial movies, it is a fantastic change of pace to have a movie about when things were simpler. 4/5 stars",Open Range
245,Robert R Jackson,Smart script.,8,28 January 2004,"I haven't read the novel that Open Range is based on, but right off the bat a few things strike me about this script. The local cattleman in Open Range speaks passionately about why he hates the type of ""free grazing"" cattlemen played by Duvall and Costner. This character is very reminiscent of Ryker from the 1953 George Stevens classic, ""Shane."" That's a good character to lift, if you're going to Frankenstein a script together because he's one of the most interesting bad guys in the history of westerns. Also, the fate that befalls the herd and hand left out on the range while the main characters go into town really reminds me of the setup in the 1946 John Ford film, ""My Darling Clementine."" Again, a pretty sweet bit of business to grab if you're going to assemble a western from great bits out of the history of westerns. Who knows, those two earlier films may owe a debt to the original novel that Open Range is based on. What's important is that it works great here. Sure, ""Open Range"" is a little too talky and it should probably end about ten minutes before it actually ends and the love interest seems a little over-worked, but despite any of that this comes off as one of the better westerns of the last 20 years. Without going too far overboard, Costner really seems to be one of the few men with a real respect for the western as an American form and he just keeps making valuable contributions to keeping it alive and vital. He really deserves a little more respect than he seems to get.",Open Range
246,Kratos666,Glimpse of hope for the western genre,8,2 January 2012,"""Well, if I'm gonna get killed, I got a hankerin' to soothe my sweet tooth."" The western genre isn't doing that well anymore. After Kevin Costner's 'Dances With the Wolves' and Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven', it's been kinda slow for the cowboys. It took over a decade before a considerable western was made. It wasn't' a big surprise that Costner did it. He really seems to have the ability to capture the magic of the era.'Open Range' tells the story of two free-range cattlemen, who get in to trouble with a local land baron. He hates the way of these free-rangers who ""steal and destroy"" his lands (these kinda conflicts weren't that unusual in the late 19th century and several westerns were made in the golden era of westerns in the 40's and 50's). Things result in terrible ways, which leads to Boss Spearman (Duvall) and Charley Waite (Costner) prepare to defend themselves and to get some justice.'Open Range' is a typical western, from the storyline point of view. Costner has yet managed to increase the suspense towards the end finale and capture the ""old spirit"" of westerns. The story develops in a calm way but doesn't fail to be draging or boring. Costner has given plenty of time for character development, revealing glimpses of the two main characters past.There are a few complaints regarding the movie. 'Open Range' could've been edited some minutes shorter by not adding a useless sub plot regarding Costner's and Annette Bening's characters relationship. There are some scenes, not gonna mention when and where for spoilers, that have some very queasy and implausible dialogue. It just didn't work that well.The cinematography of 'Open Range' is beautiful with longlasting shots of the beautiful landscape. Jim Muro has also managed to capture the tension of the shootout. The shootout is by the way one of the best I've seen. I've mentioned lately in my reviews the word realistic. This does look realistic and Muro has had some terrific eye for capturing it all on the big screen. Nicely choreographed by the way.'Open Range' is one of the better westerns I've seen, even though it doesn't deliver anything new to the genre. Nice chemistry between the two main characters, good dialogue between them and all together good acting by the actors. Considerable westerns haven't been made that many lately (3:10 to Yuma), so 'Open Range' is a welcomed addition to a genre that needs some glimpse of hope.",Open Range
247,abacus24,A near perfect classic western,9,19 January 2007,"I must have been in a cave when this movie came out. Actually, I was; Kuwait City, Kuwait, right after the second Iraq War. The movie had great actors (Duvall, Kostner, Bening and more), a tight plot, outstanding photography and superb story line. Westerns have gone out of favor recently. Mostly doomed to be specials on TV. Too bad. Ten years ago, this might have been the a very highly touted movie. There were areas in the movie that kind of dragged (when are they going to kick some ass, anyway) but that being said, it was a great movie. I haven't seen too many movies that caught my attention as well as this. When I saw this on AMC, I was ready to go outside to my patio and smoke my pipe and drink my scotch, but from the beginning of the movie to the end, I couldn't leave! Believe me; my pipe and scotch are part of my daily routine, but it played second fiddle (I recall the sheriff in this flick was playing his fiddle just before he was put into his on jail cell). Well done!",Open Range
248,Tomici,A great example what is western supposed to be,10,11 February 2009,"In my life, I watched many westerns, especially the old ones from 60's and 70's. Those westerns were (and always will be) way better than the most of the modern ones. Westerns made in the last, let's say 20 years, very often give big advantage to the style over substance. And unfortunately, there isn't too many of them made these days because everybody are looking for some big budget action spectacles. And if there still weren't movies like Open Range, Jack Bull, 3:10 to Yuma, or that great show Deadwood, I guess we could really say that western is dead.After mediocre Postman, in this movie Costner showed us that he can still direct and act in a movie as good as his previous Dance with the Wolves. This western has everything needful to make an Oscar worth film. Everything is great, especially the last gunfight. I can tell that this is, without a doubt, one of the best shootouts I've seen in my whole life. It looks really realistic and without exaggerations that are synonym for todays movies. I couldn't find any objection to the movie and I really doubt I ever will (more or less because I watched this movie 2 or 3 times already :). It's a beautiful dedication to the old westerns and all I can say is : Thank you for that, K. Costner.",Open Range
249,videooutakes,A Return of the Classic Western,8,20 August 2003,"I recently went to see Costner's new western pic Open Range and came away from the film thinking they finally made a good western. The film opens slow but slowly builds up the pace to the final climax of the ""Good Guys"" vs. the ""Bad Guys"".  As I watched the film I had to give the writer credit for watching the Old Time westerns that starred the likes of Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea and of course the Duke, John Wayne.  If you have ever watched any of these actors westerns then you know what I'm talking about.  If you haven't then, well, you missed some good old fashion westerns as well as the point of this film. My hats off to Costner for not doing the typical ADD (Attention Deficiet Disorder) way of filmmaking by having action sequences every five minutes. The story took it's time in telling, not only with the pacing but with the characters as well. So, if you want to see a good ""Old Fashioned"" western then I recommend this film.",Open Range

Whilst Robert Duval steals every scene, Kevin Costner has come back home to what he does best - damn good westerns. Short on action in the early stages, this does not lessen the films entertainment worth, as the tension builds towards the final show down ...and when it comes, bam! I just wouldn't want to be the man that shot Costner's friend.This is a thoughtful story of friendship, courage and doing what a man's gotta do.

251,drwnutt,Gets the characters right,10,11 June 2008,"The plot of this movie is not original, but the execution of the characters is so clear and convincing that it transcends the story. Annette Benning is so appealing in her role as spinster sister with standards a little too high for the locals. Surprisingly, the two characters I found only good were Robert Duvall, who reprised his cowboy role from ""Lonesome Dove"", and Michael Gambon, who played a stereotypical town bad guy. The character who really stood out was Kevin Costner. He captured the dual nature of the western gunslinger hero as well or better than Clint Eastwood did in ""The Unforgiven"". In each case, we get to see the efficient, ruthless killer that resides in the same body as the really nice guy you meet early on. They were always good at killing. Zane Grey wrote about this in his classic westerns and very few westerns have captured this. Even movies like ""Shane"" and ""High Noon"" left us with a nice guy for a hero.Kevin Costner gets the gets the main characters right and makes this a really wonderful western that I enjoy watching again and again. It has what it takes to be one of the great westerns.",Open Range

The acting is impossible to comment on because there is NO discernible acting going on throughout this magnificent film. Each and every character fits in place like a finely crafted quilt, bringing his or her contribution with no varying levels of ability. We are drawn into the story and the setting without choice and we are close enough to the gun battles to be wounded. The realism is stark and seems absolutely typical of the era. Hard times, hard decisions and hard people. We experience the harshness of the climate. We share the anguish of loss. We delve into the old west....and we love it.I would love to see a sequel picking up exactly where this film leaves us.",Open Range

Logical, exciting-and of course violent. The bit where Kev fires 16 shots from a 6 shooter without reloading?

It's not Unforgiven, by any means, which I thought was a truly great Western.  This has more the ""fairy tale"" Western quality and a happy and satisfying (if not highly plausible) ending.  The directing and acting are excellent, but the writing suffers throughout, I think, both in some of the dialogue and the unfolding of the storyline.  Very black and white characters and predicatable plot; but hey - like I said that's what we expect from Western's, and I was entertained.",Open Range
256,jim_4520,Costner has returned,10,17 August 2003,"I went to this film with fairly high hopes.  In the late 80's and early 90's, Kevin Costner was one of my favorite actors.  I consider DANCE WITH WOLVES his masterpiece, and it was without a doubt a very fitting tribute to the American Indian.  I even took a road trip in 1992 to the Black Hills of South Dakota, just to see the area and the film sites.Unfortunately, during the mid to late 90's, Kevin's career went south. The only film during this time that I found remotely entertaining was WYATT EARP.  While this film was entirely too long and too detailed, it was worth watching once or twice.While I had read mixed reviews, I was not discouraged from seeing OPEN RANGE.  I was pleasantly surprised that Costner gave more screen time to Duvall than he did himself.  Costner seemed more comfortable in the role of a supporting actor rather than the leading actor.  Furthermore, this film seemed a unique combination of ideas from previous Westerns, right down to the gunfights.I have heard some ""complaints"" that the film has too much talk.  While I agree that there is plenty of dialogue, it's good dialogue.  It's witty and thoughtful and can keep the viewer's attention rather than put them to sleep (a wonderful asset for any ""talkative"" film).I plan to see this film again and will definitely buy it when it comes out on video.  I certainly hope Costner will take his next few films in better stride this time than he did ten years ago.  However, for the moment, Kevin should enjoy the good reviews that he will undoubtedly receive for this film.  For the moment, Costner has returned.",Open Range
257,nigel_hawkes,Too long and derivative,7,31 December 2020,"At this stage of the Western (2003) anything produced will inevitably draw comparisons with that vast W. legacy that many of us have lived through.In no particular order I'm reminded of ""Shane"", ""Lonesome Dove"" (Duvall much reprises his Gus character, particularly with one scene), Eastwood's revenge Ws, ""Heaven's Gate""...Nothing that Costner or the estimable Duvall appear in will be terrible; and the supporting cast are all OK in the style of the later ""mud 'n' rags"" fashion that is certainly authentic, but tends to alienate lovers of the older, simpler W. Michael Gambon is, I feel, miscast almost to an embarrassing degree.This film is also ""authentic"" in having dark cinematography; again alienating to lovers of the old bright Technicolor tradition.Costner certainly likes a long, drawn-out W. but this is too long (unlike ""Dances with Wolves"") and the long, long ""OK Corral"" gunfight finale is not convincing, although well-done, aping Eastwood. As for the ending...was it ever going to end!Half an hour should have been shorn from this.Give me a 70 minute Audie Murphy any day.",Open Range

I saw it and thought it just as good as the buzz had said. There were flaws, but what movie doesn't have any. Great performances all around, best shoot out ever. The film was very realistic, simple, and involving. I loved the 1st half of the film, where it was mainly Duvall and Costner cow-poking, and realizing that the only way to solve their problems was thru violence, which they had tried to avoid. Costner directs very methodically and never moves through anything quickly, which may seem as a drag, but actually works very well. I highly recommend this to anyone intelligent enough to appreciate the characters, their dilemma, and their lives as it is shown on screen. Good job, Mr. Costner. You've got my trust back.",Open Range

Not that I have first hand experience with judging gunfights. But you get the feeling watching it that - Yep, that's how it would probably go in real life.And so it goes throughout the whole story. There's a simplicity to life in westerns, and in this one. Things are simple enough that you understand what people are thinking without them explaining every damn thing. And the few words they do squeeze out of their lungs are weighted with a lot of unspoken thoughts.There are a lot of bad people in this movie. And there are barely more good ones. And there are a lot of things unsaid, but there are a lot of ways to communicate hate, and fear, gratitude, satisfaction, and love.",Open Range
260,Frankbill,Vain self-indulgence by Costner,4,8 March 2004,"The Good: Robert Duvall, a fine measured performance as the tough old cattleman. Duvall acts IN the film WITH his fellow cast and in context.Scenery: beautiful landscapes to gorge your eyes on.The Bad: Costner: he refused to acknowledge the presence of his fellow cast many times by acting somewhere else. He was constantly squinting his eyes and looking off camera somewhere trying to look tough and weather-beaten and going on about his bad past and what a good feller his was now. Boring and vain, and a waste of money and others' talent. He was utterly unconvincing in his role and clearly directed and edited the film to promote himself.
Editing: we got shot around in the early part of the film and left to guess how on earth we had got from scene to scene. However at the end of the film we got endless shots of Costner going on and on and on after he decides his future. Clichés: Just about all over the place, in the end a source of humour as we went from improbable in the shoot out, to impossible and then hilariously ludicrous. If French and Saunders want to do one of their movie spoofs on the shoot out, all they need to do is read the original script. Its all there, how can Costner shoot four men before they can draw and then miss Michael Gambon from ten yards with two pistols firing continuously. (What was the massive talent of Gambon doing in this?) Screenplay: who wrote this daft nonsense? Millions and millions of dollars to make this film and they can't even get even a halfway decent screenplay and script. What a waste. What Hollywood executive authorised this one, someone had their eye way off the ball. Characters: Where were they? The filmed lacked real characters, we saw far too much of Costner and precious little of anyone else except Duvall. All far two one-dimensional even for the genre. Plot: So Duvall's character announces to his enemies where they can find his injured and helpless friend? (Why?) And erm, the bad guys don't actually go and get him? I don't think so. The Heroine rushing in between the bullets for no apparent reason so the plot can have her held hostage by a bad guy? Just betrays lack of thought on making the plot realistic and interesting. Of course we had the now obligatory gunshot graze on the leg to the good guy so he can hobble a bit and hide. Oh dear. So it goes on.The Ugly: I wanted to see a good old-fashioned western done with modern filming. We got all the bad bits of old westerns, tacky scripts and impossible situations and none of the old charm and adventure. This is a much underdone and potentially popular genre and they really missed an opportunity here. Don't let male directors cast themselves in heroic leads, only the Horse Whisperer was worse in this respect, at least Costner didn't keep flashing cheesy grins at the camera in soft focus.",Open Range
261,gadflyzzz,clichéd yet effective,5,2 February 2005,"Better than average western, steadily-paced, subtly directed, acted with precision by a bunch of seasoned pros. Costner directs himself in the film's most pretentious performance, while all around him the supporting cast steal his limelight. Duvall and Gambon are exemplary as opposing, aging poles on the film's moral compass. OPEN RANGE is like Costner's Bush-era post-script to DANCES WITH WOLVES - no trace of political correctness is to be found, and while the film doffs its cap to ""reality"" - eg. the widespread use of immigrant accents and sets that look like they were built yesterday from fresh cut timber, because back then they literally were - ultimately this is just another excuse for fancy shootin', gratuitous gunplay in the name of replaying for the umpteenth time just how the west was won. Still, there are some powerful moments, and the movie remains engaging throughout. Costner says he elided all trace of Native Americans in the film because the frontier culture he was depicting had no place for them and could not countenance them. Fair enough, but in this film it is Costner's choice, and no else's, to erase the original custodians from their landscape. Out of sight out of mind. Worth renting, but this ain't no JOHNNY GUITAR.",Open Range

This film has excellent dialogue and pacing. I would say that the acting is not perfect, it can be rough around the edges.

Beats me! Dialogues are corny at best, everything in the little town is top- cliché, the romantic subplot and the whole action is unbelievably predictable, and Costner plays the role he plays the *best*: himself (yet again). Plot? Yeah, there's a subtle (oh, the irony!) plot to it: the good guys beat the crap out of the bad guys because..., because they practiced a lot more drawing their guns and shooting faster than the bad ones (I just hope that this last comment won't spoil anything about this movie, but the sad thing is that it could be giving too much away, so I will check the Spoiler-Box, just in case). But, hey, if you really love mindless westerns on DVD (it's no worth paying 10 dollars at the cinema) and if you don't want your neurons to consume too much energy, this may be the ideal movie for you.

I don't always see Kevin Costner in the right roles (e.g., Robin Hood), but here he's perfect in the low-key role and so is Duvall as his boss (and some of Duvall's humor). My favorite westerns up until now are movies like Shane, Jesse James, Big Jake, Destry Rides Again, Magnificent Seven -1960... just to give you a feel for my taste. There's something about the guns, the way they shoot, the muddy streets, etc. that make this look like the most realistic looking western. About the only negative was I didn't always like Anette Bening's acting; in 1 scene she sounded like a school girl where her voice seemed to change to a higher pitch when she learns Costner had previously thought she was married. I guess at this moment, I've seen this movie 5-7 times and never get bored. Perhaps the script isn't totally original, but I find it still ranks up there. I also like how they didn't rush the shooting scenes at the end and it was quite lengthy and enjoyable, including the chocolates, the cigars, the help Percy (Michael Jeter) gave them, and learning their real names.",Open Range
274,lightdee,Costner whiffs it again,5,21 September 2012,"This movie had real potential - lots of star power, great production values, good supporting cast, but Costner blew it again.First, the good: Duvall is great as usual. He really has the cowboy persona down to a science. Gambon is also very believable as the ""Irish"" bad guy. The setting and the old western town look great. I also like the long run time. I can't think of any other films that take time to show the aftermath of a big gunfight - cleaning up the bodies, burying the dead, bringing the wounded to the doctor. I liked the realism of that part of the movie. I thought Costner played the shy, unassuming, socially inept cowhand pretty well. The shootout was exceptional and lengthy - some of the stunts were great, and the sound effects were also great.The bad: I like long run times because it can give a western a slow burn. However, this movie wasted lots of time on boring dialog and characters sitting around talking about nothing in particular. There were many boring sections of the movie. Also, the script made it obvious that our heroes were making it up as they went along - they were irresolute and inconsistent. I guess I was hoping for a little bit darker characterization of Costner's character - he kept talking about all the bad things he had done, but he's just kind of a goofy, shy character except during the shootout. And Bening - where do I start? She looked good, but didn't even try for a western accent. Every time she opened her mouth, it blew my suspension of disbelief - terrible. Also, the script had a lot of goofy lines. It was like Duvall was ad-libbing, because he was one of the few characters who really sounded like a old-west cowboy.Overall, worth a watch but definitely not a classic.",Open Range

The film has so much to recommend it; I guarantee you won't see a better ensemble cast this year.  But perhaps young audiences are not able to process sincerity anymore.  Open Range is full of humor, but it does mean everything it says.  It has no irony.

279,Magila_guerrilla,Excellent slow burn film,10,15 October 2003,"I don't have any long winded commentary for this film, suffice to say that it was fantastic.  If you are a western fan, 10 out of 10, if not then 8 out of 10 at least.  Not a fast paced action movie, but very believable and engrossing in it's story, however when the inevitable violence does take place, it is intense and gritty and better than any action flick. (And I'm no snooty art film guy, I like action flicks!)",Open Range
280,standstraight80,A classic!,9,28 May 2008,"I've seen many of Kevin Costner's movies (both acting and directing), and even more westerns, and I'd have to say that this movie is the best in either category. I've always thought Costner a sub-par actor, but I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the role of Charlie. He had it down.The rest of the cast was superb as well. Luna (Button) and Benrubi (Mose) are both destined for greatness. Gambon (Baxter) and Duval (Boss) have been around long enough to do things right. Bening (Sue) is a better (and better-looking) actress than ever before. The supporting cast, and the characters they create, all flowed together so strongly and believably that I would've watched a movie about a week in the life of the town before Mose showed up that fateful day. The shopkeeper and Percy (Jeter) particularly shined, but every single citizen of that town gave the impression they had a story to tell. But I digress, because cast and characters alone do not a movie make.The dialog in many movies today is too geared to what the audience needs to hear. Rather than a fly-on-the-wall point of view on a realistic event, we normally get verbose exposition and other generally out-of-character dialog, so that the less intuitive viewer doesn't get left behind. In ""Open Range"", we're given a story. Four men and the task they must accomplish, with only the words any four men in a similar situation would say to each other. There wasn't anything directed to our tutelage alone, simply a bare-bones character drama. It felt real, like I could have been right there in the midst of things. That is the way movies SHOULD be. I applaud the creative minds behind this, and Costner, the ringmaster, above all others.I have not seen another film that captured the beauty of the title character (the open range, nyuk nyuk) in such a light. While I'm sure that at least some of the footage was shot in a studio, and picturesque backdrops appeared to be inserted in the terrain at some points, the believability that this was 1880's ""Old West"" was always there. From the wide open skies and rolling hills to the pebbled creeks and fresh-built townscapes, I was thoroughly impressed.The set/art direction weren't the only elements that capitalized on this beauty. Often, the camera operator (and undoubtedly Costner himself) had found amazing camera angles/motion to accentuate the finer elements of the sets. One such picturesque moment came in the form of an establishing shot of the cool, clear pebbled creek, shot from just inches above the surface, as the horses drank the purity of nature itself. Another shot shows the hills/mountains with lightning crashing around them as a storm billows its way to town. Was this an effects shot or not? I don't rightly know, and I was too impressed to care. The movie is beautiful.There is also a beautifully mastered scene in which Charlie awakes from an unsettling dream and at first doesn't know the dream from reality. The use of camera motion and picture superimposition here isn't so over-the-top that it feels out of place in the rest of the ""artistic"" film. It's hard for someone to accomplish that.All technical terms aside, this film was born from talent. The writers, actors, and most importantly the director knew how to make a film enjoyable. When a movie just plain works, it's because the producers have assembled a group of personalities that work well together. This movie obviously had that. I'm very much looking forward to whatever it is that Costner decides to bring us next. I have been shown the light.9 out of 10, ""classic""",Open Range

285,rockhound622004,Unbelievable,2,8 April 2005,"Right off the top I expected a good story, having been pleased with Duvall's performance which I feel pretty much carried ""Lonesome Dove"", half expecting something of a continuation of that story. But I was terribly disappointed by the entire plot, which I consider to be completely flawed right from the get-go. First and foremost, the very concept of ""free-grazers"" roaming around in mountainous yet apparently settled countryside is beyond reality. Where, historically, could this story have ever happened? By the time any place had become occupied and towns such as in this movie have been established, every single acre that was worth anything had been spoken for, title deed secured, and above all, fenced in with barbed wire. Any ""open range"" country would not have had any towns around for at least 100 miles in any direction. Likewise, where any towns were so well established, there would be no ""open range"" for at least 100 miles in any direction. And with all those mountains around, ANY grazing land would be marginal at best. The story was obviously written by someone with NO knowledge whatsoever about turn-of-the-century livestock management. It's just too ridiculous to contemplate. One more little thing: for that wagon to be so stuck, no human could have maneuvered alongside of it and not become mired. It was so obviously ""previously buried"" that I had to laugh right out loud. How lame can a scenario get? My recommendation is to forget this piece of crap and re-watch ""Shane"", which I could do 100 times before I'll ever re-view ""Open Range"", although the photography was OK, so I give it a ""2"".",Open Range

In general, ""Open Range"" moves along at a slower than average Western Movie tempo, but the final showdown at the end of the movie makes the wait, well worth it. Newer and younger viewers to Westerns might think there is too much dialog, but give this movie a little breathing room, settle into its pace and you can't help but stay glued to the screen. Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall are superb in this film.They definitely have an on screen rapport.The scenery shots and camera angles used by Kevin Costner are magnificent. A sequel to Open Range would have fans anxious for its release.This movie has a straightforward plot, and its message of old time justice will satisfy any Western Movie fan, whether new or veteran.",Open Range
287,ChigurandSpice,"A Strong, Deeply Felt Classic.",8,8 December 2005,"Open Range was a very pleasant surprise to me. I had't heard much about it when it came out; but am extremely glad that I bought it.Western is a very special genre; it has that something, that je ne sais quois that we go to movies to get. It reminds us what film is for in the first place. I am all for edgy movies (Requiem for a Dream, etc.) but there is a special place in my mind for a film like ""Open Range"" This project, headed by the lately ill-fated Kevin Costner, goes right from the first scene to the last. It opens quietly, and beautifully, introducing us to four free-rangers who remind us that there are still movies about decent people worth caring about. They are Boss (Robert Duvall) Charlie (Kostner) Mose, and Button, a sixteen-year-old Mexican played by Diego Luna (The Terminal, Y Tu Mama Tambien) These open-rangers spend their days living simple lives until they are interrupted by run ins with a vicious rancher in town named Baxter. HE is played sneeringly well by the always convincing Michael Gambon (Layer Cake, Wives and Daughters) and soon, Boss and Charlie are breaking Mose out of jail.Baxter has the town in the palm of his hand, including the weak, cowardly sheriff; and Boss and Charlie plan on never returning; except for the fact that Charlie can't help but notice the doctor's beautiful sister, Sue (Anette Benning).Circumstances build up to a final confrontation where Boss and Charlie will have to face the corrupt, vicious Baxter and his men.The movie lifts itsself out of mediocrity and transcends its genre by being convincing, never flashy; well written and stopping us in our tracks with the immediacy of its violence.The gunfights are not graphic, but they hit hard and we realize that these are real flesh-and-blood men and not superheros.The story contains plenty to involve us deeply with the characters and make us care about them; especially Boss's tough love treatment of Mose and Button. Also, Charlie's character is developed as we learn about his past, giving his actions all the more weight.Romance is handled tactfully and sweetly, even though it gets a little much screen time; and the cinematography (filmed in Canada) is of course, calmly breathtaking.The movie has an aura that lacks pretension, simply setting forth to tell a good story about a time in history when values were fought for and men and women were really just as human and deeply alive as us, even though hardly as advanced or cynical.It is a pleasure to watch actors like Duval play roles like this and Diego Luna is always wonderfully young and vibrant. I liked the fact that Mose was goodhearted and not obnoxious; and also the nice friendship he shares with Button; mirrored by Boss and Charlie's comraderie.The film builds slowly and inevitably to the final conflict, which is intense, given time to have impact; and best of all, done with complex but simply stated shots, and not a single quick-cut flashy sequence like so many action movies indulge in these days.Very few films are for everyone, but I think that if given the chance, Open Range can remind any moviegoer, as it did me, how a good story, solid acting, and meaningful action can still make a wonderful, old-fashioned film.",Open Range
288,Dave-in-Hayward,Story telling at it's best,9,20 August 2003,"Kevin Cosner might be to story telling via celluloid as Garrison Keillor is to story telling via the spoken word.  I can't say I've particularly liked, or even have seen ALL of his films, but this current offering is in the spirit of a couple of his very successful previous efforts, Dances with Wolves and Field of Dreams.Like the later titles, Open Range is 90% an emotionally compelling story that develops at a deliberate pace, yet it delivers all the action modern audiences need to stay interested in a story.The fight scenes are filmed in the stop action, gritty method as used in Saving Private Ryan which lends to the feeling of chaos as described by Cosner's character (Charley Waite) in the movie as he warns Duvall's character (Boss Spearman) that the moment of violence will be swift and furious.This film is not for the faint of heart when it comes to character and plot development.  In other words, if you need non-stop action and violence, then this movie isn't for you.  But if you care to invest 138 minutes in getting to know and care for compelling characters, laced with a touch of humor and the requisite conflict, you'll be pleasantly entertained by this fine offering from Kevin Cosner.",Open Range

I can't remember ever thinking that!The best movie that I have seen in years!The scenery for this show is awesome.  If you were a cowboy, you could sit on your horse and just stare at the range and feed your soul.  While Alberta provides a realistic setting to film cattle grazing, I was slightly irritated that I could not see the more realistic Wyoming and Montana mountains.  It's a shame this couldn't have been morphed into the picture instead of Canadian mountains.The length and the speed of the movie was decent.  I thought that finally someone can take the time to tell a story and not rush me as if I were cattle.  To enjoy a meal, like the French do, we should not be rushed and feel compelled to cram food in our faces.  We should take our time and savor our meal!  Likewise on viewing a film.The detail in the movie is delightful.  The shooting is crystal clear and it's cheerfully tearsome to see the detail in the bar, the candy store, the town dirt street, and the jail.  Nothing you ever would have seen years ago. This gives a person what they expect when they see a film --time travel and excruciating attention to detail so we feel as if we have gone back in time. Don't we want to be educated and reminded about how the West looked back then?  Or, maybe not.  Maybe it was just so old and rotten, we'd rather see a blur for our sanity and immediately gun the car to Times Square.Some of the dialogue is very rich, if you could imagine how people might have spoken during the 1880s. Duvall dishes out some deadly humorous remarks that certainly entertain, but I doubt whether this would've  been so entertaining in the old West.  And if you think about it, Kevin Costner makes a realistic cowboy in terms of his dialogue.  I don't think a lot of cowboys were deeply intellectual, but were pretty simple and had rough jobs to do.Of course, the gunfighting is violent and there's plenty of it; hence the ""R"" rating, but this was a big part of the Western story.
I disagree with others who have said that the love story was a drawback to the show.

The story reminded me a little of Unforgiven, High Noon, and toss in some Gunsmoke episodes.  In other words, I liked it a lot.  It's the best movie I've seen so far this year. 8/10By the way, Costner's line about killing some men today sounded a little corny in the preview, but I thought it worked well in the context of the actual movie.  It was not a super macho line, but an apology for the kind of man he used to be, and has to be again on this day.I plan to see it again, and to buy the DVD when it comes out.",Open Range

Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall have, together, created a western not soon to be forgotten.

The acting and the plot (?) just added up to a big, fat zero. I went on the basis of reviews, so I surely didn't expect something this awful.Note to Kevin Costner: just because you put it on film doesn't make it interesting!",Open Range
319,Vinne,This is a pretty good movie and definitely not too slow.,9,30 January 2004,"I liked this movie.  The actors are great, even if Kevin doesn't seem as dangerous as he says he is, but then again: he has be living peacefully in the last ten years.  There's a lot of fine humor in the dialogue and I like the way it sounds.There's nothing wrong with the pacing of this film, I wouldn't even call it slow.  If you consider ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" a slow movie, this one is pretty fast in comparison.  The film and its story have their own rhythm and the editing does a very good job trying to go along with that.  There are a little too many dissolves in the first 30 minutes of the film, trying to actually speed up the narration but after that the film finds just its perfect pace.  The shoot-out is especially well edited with great sound effects. I guess most of the CGI work was done with the sky, painting heavy dark clouds everywhere that look a little suspicious and some shots of the white dog in the beginning look a little bit too much like calendar photos that certain people would have hanging in their kitchen.  Apart from that, the film looks great, not cliché and Kevin Costner even makes an effort not to look too well-groomed all the time.  His hair for example is messed up in many of the scenes, something that would never have happened in DANCES WITH WOLVES (where he always looked like he just stepped out of a shampoo commercial).The ending is a little weak and you can tell that the film doesn't really know where it wants to go, so Kevin made it go where he thought most people would have wanted to see it go.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that the ending spoils the entire movie but it could have been different, no doubt.As far as the directing is concerned, I think this film is actually more grown-up as DANCES WITH WOLVES (even if it's not the better film).  There were a lot of goofy, silly scenes in that picture (the army general or whatever, peeing in his pants, the farting farmer etc) that clashed with the serious tone of the movie.  There are no real jokes in OPEN RANGE, no one-liners that have the entire audience burst into laughter but instead there's fine humor spread out in many of the serious, sometimes even sinister conversations.  (These conversations are beautifully written in my opinion, including the one in which the Duvall-character calls god a certain kind of son - I just can't understand why another imdb-user was so outraged about this in an earlier critique.)And finally to those who think Costner shouldn't have played the lead role in this film because he can't act: the lead is Robert Duvall and the character he portrays is of course far more complicated as the one Kevin chose to play.  That Charlie-character is just right for Kevin's abilities, just like the Terminator is just right for Schwarzenegger.  And it's great to cast someone as the female love interest who's over 40, not even the great Eastwood dared to do that in Unforgiven.  So please, no complaining about the casting.  And also no complaining about the speed of the film, this film would have been ridiculous if it had been edited in a KILL BILL-kind of way.  There's the right pace for every film and the art is to find that pace.  There are many examples for films that didn't get the pace right, this one did.",Open Range
320,marks-bradshaw,Return of the traditional western,10,14 November 2004,"Having watched Open Range for the second time,I can say it is a welcome return to the old fashioned western of ""a man's gotta do,what a man's gotta do"". Don't get me wrong,I liked Costner's revisionist western Dances with Wolves (still my favourite movie score) and still rate it as one of my all time favourite films. However,as Dances with Wolves was epic,Open Range was personal and whilst our Kev was at the helm,he let Robert Duvall take top billing. Yet,what a double act - funny,touching,needing each other - not a father/son relationship,but a younger and older brother alliance. They took a stance against Baxter's men and brought deliverance to a town under occupation of gangsters. However,here was not a town too lily liveried to cower behind the clichés of similar films of the past,one senses a resistance movement gathering,but not in subterfuge. It was the townsfolk knowing they had their saviors and was quite prepared to back them. The blossoming romance between our Kev and Annette Bening was believable and the final gunfight was brutal and realistic;taking prisoners was no option.The last scene,of Duvall and Costner,riding together in freeze frame,was not dissimilar to the latter westerns of John Wayne. It was once said,that the day Clint Eastwood dies - long away may that me - the western will end. I am sure,under the stewardship of Kevin Costner and a careful choosing of films,the western may live a little longer.",Open Range

They give the movie an intensity and depth no other would have.The two cattledrivers desire for peace really shine through when they are provoked by the ranch owner. They back down a number of times, and are not the classic dark avengers right away.They warn & club down the rancher's men a couple of times, until one of their men is killed and another seriously injured.

Open Range obviously isn't a Dances With Wolves, but it sits on its on as a great piece of film making. The acting is exceptional. Costner, Duvall and Bening all deliver superb performances. As does the supporting cast. Kim Coates who plays Tig on the Sons of Anarchy is great as one of the hired killers, Michael Gambon (who played the later Dumbledore) is outstanding as the arrogant landowner, and James Russo as the corrupt sheriff delivers a convincing performance as well. Michael Jeter, who sadly passed away 2 months after completing this film, is wonderful as always and Diego Luna as one of Costner's crew also delivers a terrific performance. The story is your basic cattlemen vs. a corrupt land owner with his hired sheriff and gunslingers. But it's the chemistry of the actors along with the gorgeous cinematography, beautiful music by Michael Kamen and the excellent dialog that make this one of my favorite movies.",Open Range

I think it is the best movie Kevin Costner has ever made. I would not call myself a big Kevin Costner fan. I think he too often over reaches. This movie however he nailed. Duval is positively superb. I do not recall Duval ever bad, well except maybe his brief turn in To Kill a Mockingbird. I am not enough of a movie buff to be able attribute his performance in this film to Costner's direction or Duval's feel for the character. I cannot recall Costner ever playing a role as subtlety as he does in this. I think he understood this character and was willing to share the screen with his costars. I give MS Benning huge props for playing this film without apparent makeup. All credit to Costner for the mood of this movie never wavering. The cinematography was excellent.",Open Range

The style is now so much worn out, every plot element seems to have been used thousand times and only way to make a new western seems to be a parody or a post-modern treatment. But this movie is no parody, no post-modern, also not spoiled by spaghetti-style, but a real classical western. It has all the elements of a classical westerns, all the typical components, and one indeed, is remained constantly on other classical westerns, but the components here are mixed in a very original and genuine way and appear fresh. Besides, this is just a nice touching story about interesting characters. Though it has a very nice slow tempo, would the movie be just a bit shorter, it would be 10 out of 10.",Open Range
325,ceyanna,Are you kidding? This was not a great movie!,3,24 September 2005,"Aside from the gunfight scene, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Bening could have played those roles in their sleep. The dialog was marginally tolerable (and there was plenty of it--no one sat together quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story, there was no subtlety at all--foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story (I think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really needed tightening up (each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality--again, too much dialog).The entire story took place over the course of a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions, much like how day-to-day happenings seemed HUGE to you in high school, but in the grand scheme really weren't THAT important. Yes, the bad guys beat up and killed Mose, they beat up Button, they killed the dog--all things which would get Boss and Charley's blood up. But the importance was diluted by all of the ""deep, meaningful"" conversations which dominated most of the movie. These guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff? The only time there wasn't much dialog was in the gunfight scene--which is probably why I liked it.Finally, someone give Annette Bening a hairbrush! The wispy strands of hair around her face that were (I suppose) to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged. If she worked outside the home, it would have made more sense. Plus, why WASN'T she married already? There seemed to be several ""kind and gentle"" (her words) single men in town aside from the marshal and his cronies. In fact, none of the bad guys seemed to want her either (a usual plot device in other movies). She stayed cooped up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town. Makes you wonder......In all, the movie was entirely too long, too chatty, and too contrived for me. It felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars, but not enough character depth to interest me, despite all of the dialog.",Open Range

327,FDR-4,Yet another great Kevin Costner movie,10,24 August 2003,"I expected to see a film that would be a treat for the spirit as well as the visual and auditory senses.  I was not disappointed.The sign of a truly great film is one that makes you feel you are on a living set watching some small portion of a life struggle unfold.  You are the ""fly on the wall"" watching cowboys of old coping with the many details of their chosen livelihood--cattle driving.  Your ears capture small snippets of the stories they tell each other as they cope with their isolation on the range.You witness firsthand the beauty that is the open range of a time that has passed but not from memory nor imagination.  You absorb the beauty of the horses enjoying their romps over grassland that you can almost smell. You can easily imagine yourself sitting on the turf soaking in the glorious sun alongside the horses that keep you company.You enjoy a passing thunderstorm and feel its awesome power and the refreshing scent of the rain pelting all that lies beneath the passing clouds.And instinctively you know that such great moments cannot last.It would be difficult to imagine any actor other than Robert Duvall playing the role of the boss of the cattle drive.  His acting was so superb that I found myself frequently uttering the words ""what a great actor Duvall is"" to my wife.  Of course in no way do I diminish the outstanding acting of Kevin Costner--what a powerhouse. Kevin and Robert are like two peas in a pod; their acting talents compliment each other to such a degree that I could not imagine this movie made without them as leads.This movie cannot be distilled to just another ""good triumphs over evil"" film; we've seen that template before and we'll see it countless times before we draw our last breath in this life.  If you just think in those terms you're missing the real intention of what a really good movie should be doing to the cinema fan--altering the mindset for a small while such that you, the fan, can live some other moment in time.What captivates my moviegoing interest is how the skills of directing and editing this film successfully converts the usual voyeur into a participant in the story that is laid out on the big screen.The gunfight was as real as anybody could imagine it to be.  Costner fulfilled and exceeded his original intention of making the most realistic gun battle ever filmed.

Everything else was pretty much what I expected (or less, in the case of the Matrix Reloaded).Open Range starts off somewhat slow, in that it is a brief expose of the characters. In the end, really, Open Range is a character movie, and not so much plot-driven as other movies. That being said, it's one of the most incredible character Westerns ever made. I laughed - many times. I quietly giggled with glee at Costner and Duvall's most hardcore moments. I was surprised as well at some things. When it was over, the theater clapped. I found myself surprised that the movie was as good as it was.Rest assured I'll be back to see it again. For fans of westerns - and anybody who's been disappointed with this summer - go see it.

330,midsmack,the eye and patience of a talented artist,9,31 August 2003,"Open Range seemed immediately to be a movie that did not rush itself into a standard plotline, nor did it have standard characters.  Instead it gave the audience a feeling of contentment and assuredness in the opening sequences, trusting itself to keep those watching interested without feeding them too much at once.  The dialogue was quite believable and the situations in which the characters interacted were unusual both in the nature of the situations themselves and the way the characters responded to them.  A good combination of humor and subtlety gave the audience the credit it deserved and allowed for better laughs and longer thoughts of deeper meaning.
I was very impressed by the camera's ability to capture the openness of the range and the west - and it gives the movie an aura of appreciation for natural beauty.  If just to see the landscape, this movie is worth viewing.The battle scenes are also very original in their realism - most westerns seem to be very cliche.  I was on the tip of my seat however, throughout the gunfights of Open Range, because I felt like I was watching something that could have very well taken place.This movie impressed me, and I think it will impress you too.

334,Hubertus Huehne,simply the same bore over and over again,4,23 November 2007,"The start: nice landscapes. Wish we had wide open land like that in Germany. I love it. Then this terrible music. It destroys everything. Every second big American movie does have this theatrical, pathetic, pseudo-classical score which in my opinion destroys more than enhances mood. I don't want to insult anybody and the composer is surely a great artist and does what he's paid for, but I think it's mostly useless kitsch - and I should know what Kitsch is because I'm German and this is a German word. Makes me laugh sometimes. The next thing which makes me angry about the film is the illogical behavior of the characters. OK, they're supposed to be simple men, but they behave like people completely unsuited for life. Don't let me explain in detail. I have no time for this. Everybody who's seen the film knows what I'm talking about. If you have and didn't see this you should watch it again and again. Come on - there are plot holes deeper than the Grand Canyon in this movie, and one should invent the word ""characterhole"" for it. What really takes me off is that the film definitely has some qualities. The characterization I like, the camera, the action (Well, I can oversee Costners ""magic-gun"", shooting more than a dozen times with a six-gun without reloading. I just say to myself it's not important for the story to show the guys reload.). Oh, there is another point: the story. Where have I seen it again? There's some ""High Noon"" and some John Ford's and more than a little John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart. The motivation of the characters is fighting for freedom? Damn. I could get political now. Yes, freedom, like George Bush's kind of ""freedom-fighting"". Hope they are starting to become aware now. But Hollywood is always showing this ""fight for freedom"", like if they are paid to show the public the same lie over and over again so they'll mistake it for reality and be quiet. Aswers why Americans always have to have a happy end. I don't spoil anything for anybody here when I say it has one. It's always the same. Seen it all. Boring.

Do yourself a favor and watch Lonesome Dove and this movie back to back, and come to your own conclusion(s). Robert Duvall was splendid in Lonesome Dove. If he intimates this movie is even close to the caliber of Lonesome Dove... he needs to re-evaluate his acting career.

Mr. Costner must have taken lessons or watched David Lean's movies as I find many similarities in said cinematography, especially ""Lawrence of Arabia"". The sound track is also superb, again reminiscent of ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

One or two scenes like this would have been sufficient, but the extremely simple storyline breaks under the all this dross we're forced to endure to get to the climax.

I found it painful and embarrassing that I shared myliving room with Costner and Duvall.  For the first hour, you will simply watch two actors rehearsing their lines on location.(Luckily, the location is breath-taking southern Alberta, and cinematographer James Muro deserves credit for lingering over my province's open skies androlling contours with painterly dedication.)The last half of the movie offers a mildly exciting gunfight, but then spirals into a cardboard romance that makes Anakin & Padme look like Bogie & Bacall.Craig Storper's screenplay lacks the character and detail that could haveelevated Open Range above the archetype.  You will scratch your head overspecifics like the Great Dog Rescue, Annette Bening's disappearing accent, and the cookie-cutter romantic subplot.  You will wince at the majority of thedialogue.  You will then plummet into madness as Costner slowwwwwly focuseshis lens on details insignificant to the story.  While a tale of this nature could be wrapped up in `High Noon""'s 84 minutes, Costner allows himself a soul- destroying 140 MINUTES.  Gentle video renter, try to remember Waterworld andThe Postman.  How many times will you allow Costner to insult you?Mustachio-Twirling Corrupt Lawmen?  Check.  Big Solemn Pronouncements?Check.  Cornball.  Cliched.  By-the-numbers.  So then why did Open Rangegross $58 million in its 16-week run?My theory is that critics and the public saw the film as a potential revival of a genre which had lain mostly dormant during the past dozen years.  Finally,Hollywood was opening up the Old West once more as prime movie territory.People forget, however, what WAS released all those dozen years ago.Unforgiven is the definitive, quintessential, prototypical, archetypical, last, best western.  There is a REASON why Hollywood has released no westerns of notesince 1992.  There is simply no need.  Nothing more can be done with the genre since Clint, Hackman, Freeman & Harris lit it up in that year's Oscar winner for Best Picture.  There are not enough superlatives for Unforgiven; just let it be said that Eastwood's epic is the bookend for the genre.Open Range just can't compete.  Not only is it a bad movie, but following - and sharing the shelf with - a work like Unforgiven, it's inherently flawed for even being CONCEIVED.  Open Range is a parody, by a pretender who wants tocash in on the work of the masters.",Open Range

I suppose I was hoping this would be another similar morality tale by Costner, in a similar vein to Dances With Wolves. Instead this film struck me as a typical 50's style glorification of property rights and violence. Duvall's character speaks a line similar to; 'A man's got a right to defend his property.' and another character says; 'They hate free grazers worse than they used to hate the Indians.' The story is a rather blatant advocation of the American dream. A single small businessman is beset by larger interests and overcomes them valiantly with the townsfolk rising up to help him. The heroes' injuries are mere scratches whilst everyone else's requires medical attention.yawn. The dialogue is the worst kind of western trash, of the 'aw shucks' and 'he sures knows how to cowboy' variety. Uninspired and dull. If you want to watch a film that perpetuates the myth of the American west that I thought had been thoroughly debunked, then you should go and see this, and take in Gone With The Wind as well to double up on your dose of historical fantasy. There is hardly any mention of Native Americans, Reconstruction, the post-slavery country.Very poor film. 2/10.",Open Range
349,frohnauer,Top Western,10,29 March 2006,"This is definitely a very inspiring and mature film. It's about real people in a historical surrounding. Brilliantly written, acted, directed and photographed. Costner has regained his real virtues after rather weak films like Postman or 1000miles to Graceland. The develops its strenght and excitement out of the characters'desires and objectives. It doesn't indulge in pure violence and a stupefying love story. The characters feel honest. The film has a very daring structure, because for over two thirds of it there is not a single shot. But when the first gun shot rings out (Costner: ""You're the one that killed our friend?"" ...) it's a real blast. Then you can witness probably the best Western shoot out ever put on film. Because it just feels absolutely real and believable. Open Range deserves to become a classic because it adds a never before seen ""romantic realism"" to the genre. And it is a rare occasion nowadays that you see a movie and have the feeling its makers really wanted to tell a story. Congratulations to this masterpiece.",Open Range

It is gentle and powerful, with superb cast, cinematography and music score. It is a compelling tale about disadvantaged men and their struggles to survive in a cold and hostile world. True to his style, Kevin Costner perfectly blends extreme violence, tender love and great friendship. The action-packed scenes of brutal killings aren't irritating, they portray harsh reality but there is life going on and there is humanity too. The end of the movie is a triumph of love and celebration of life. The second disc contains historical facts and moments of the making of the movie.

Costner has a great feel for creating and choreographing complex action scenes. There is one wide shot in particular that contains many actors involved in a number of separate interactions carried out in a masterfully-planned sequence. It is worth watching several times and paying close attention to each individual shootout going on within the larger scene. Costner has mastered the art of filling the screen with complex action.The cast is outstanding and the love story is compelling and not typical Hollywood. As a real Western fan, I enjoyed this one enough to watch it several times. I think the plot offers something for everyone and I think it is one of those rare films that appeals to both men and women. It is certainly worth checking out.",Open Range

I am still waiting for the plot to develop.I just hope I can sell it on and it will no longer take up space on my video shelf. If you like waiting from some thing to happen, and don't mind the predictable western plot of long cowboys coming to save the day from greedy corrupt robber barons.

What I get is a history lesson from movies. This movie is all about ""Free Grazing""and if you put this movie together with other movies about cattle ranching in the late 1800's of which there are numerous titles you'll see this movie fits a lot of truth about cattle trespassing on other landowners water holes,streams,wild grasses when there was not a law yet for protecting landowners from cattle drives passing through their land. This movie is about the cattle wars,a small part of the truth. This is why I like Cosner. He can make magic and tell a little part of history in his movies. I made sure I bought this DVD and wish I could have waited for the Blu-Ray version. I love the sounds of battles while watching it. I love the sounds of gun fire going behind you,around you and zing past your ears. Beautiful landscape & sound effects and great acting.

Costner and Duvall have tremendous chemistry and there is a real bond between them that is believable. Superb performances all round. Usually the love interest in Westerns detracts from the film but the mature attraction of two lonely people and growing affection between Charley Waite(Costner)and Sue(Annette Bening)is totally credible and enhances the movie. The cinematography is beautiful,the scenery is green and quite lush - this is not arid country. Also the script is first class in particular the interpolation of the ordinary 'chocolates and cigars and fancy crockery' with the imminent possibility of sudden and violent death in the main street. The suspense and tension builds to a memorable shoot-out and quite simply it's a better film than Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"".",Open Range

The acting is first class and those who have critical of Costner since Dancing with Wolves need to take a look at this film. Robert Duvall plays it perfectly and although you can see elements of Gus McCrae in Lonesome Dove it doesn't matter it's just great seeing him build the character that may seem similar but by the end of the film is very different.",Open Range
357,sweet.smartie,Easily ...,1,12 January 2004,"... the most awful film I'm going to see in 2004, and the year is barely two weeks old.The story is so lame, it wouldn't even do for a Marlboro commercial. Which it looked like, most of the time (rugged men in profile, against the open country, with a cigarette in their mouths). Here it goes:
A couple of simple, yet honest men who were just minding their own business and not doing anything wrong get in trouble with the local big guy who controls the small town and even the Sheriff, and in the end they shoot all the bad guys. And, wouldn't you know it, the hero falls in love with a pretty (?) lady but they can't get together because of his troubled past, that is, not until the end of the movie. Gag. Honestly, when Annette Bening handed Kevin Costner her necklace ""for good luck"", I almost threw up.What really bothered me was the bottom line: you're not a real man unless you shoot someone. I think Kevin Costner needs to get into his time machine and speed back to the 21 century.Tragically, the only good part was the shooting, though. Those guns made some realistic sounds, a lot of bullets missed and even if they hit, the guys didn't drop dead instantly. A very convincing scene (the only one).My advice? Don't watch it. Unless you're the guy who actually liked ""The Bridges of Madison County"".",Open Range

The acting is terrible (Costner is at his all-time worst), the dialog is boring, the plot, if you can say there is one, is completely uninteresting and the movie is entirely too long. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. The fight scenes are sloppy and unimaginable. Even the editing is awful. It looks like a made-for-TV movie that used to have lots of places for commercials which were subsequently removed.  The character development never happens. The townspeople are lame and idiotic. The sets are cheesy and phony.  Things happen and you wonder why someone thought to even add that? There is absolutely no point to this movie at all.The only good thing I can say is the wildflowers on the mountain-sides are quaint. Don't waste your money. The critics have totally lost their minds.

It's realism reminds me of the equally wonderful Lonesome Dove series, and the greatest war series ever - Band of Brothers. This film builds slowly and takes you over in so many ways. The realism was frightening in a good way and keeps you involved from start to finish. Fistfull of Dollars had always been my No 1 western until I saw this great film. If I had to find any fault it would be a minor one with the miscasting of michael gambon - in my opinion. The bad guys were a 'lovely' collection of strange looking cold hearted individuals, that makes you yearn for their predicted demise, and they certainly check out in a great variety of ways. The final shootout is the best ever gunfight I've ever seen in a western, so costner deserves a lot of credit for this. Cant wait to see it again!",Open Range
361,gunaseelapandian,Cheap remake of Unforgiven,2,21 June 2006,The storyline seems to be a parallel to Unforgiven with a similar theme of avenging the murder of a friend. Also a similarity in theme is that free grazing is frowned in the town whereas in Unforgiven it was the guns.The movie ends with a gunfight that is mediocre in terms of action and technicality. Direction is lack and can't compare to Unforgiven. The subtle love affair lacks emotion and strength and there is a lot of repetition when Kevin tries to convince his lover that he is not the suitable person for her while she tries to convince him that he is an honest person and she loves him anyway.,Open Range

364,stevehcrum,"""A tall in the saddle classic western""",10,12 August 2003,"Kevin Costner said it on Larry King recently: ""I want to make movies that will live forever."" His ""Dances With Wolves"" qualifies. So does ""Open Range,"" a terrific western directed by and starring Costner. Just when the Hollywood western genre seemed long ago ridden off into the sunset, here thunders back ""Open Range"" with double barrels ablaze. And we're mighty pleased with the re-acquaintance, pardner.Costner must be pleased too, because ""Open Range"" succeeds in blending both traditional and revisionist western themes. Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" exemplifies a revisionist western, featuring very a vengeful anti-hero. ""Open Range"" is more the good cowboy-bad cowboy scenario wherein the easy going heroes (Costner and Robert Duvall) are forced to retaliate after repeated assaults upon them. Good and evil are clearly defined. They eventually become what western heroes in hundreds of oaters became, knights on horseback.Craig Storper's screenplay, adapted from Lauran Paine's novel ""The Open Range Men,"" seems simple and familiar at first with its basis on one of the handful of western story themes, the fight for land. Four cowpokes drive a small herd of cattle across the prairie. (We are not what state they are in, but it looks like Wyoming, even though it was actually filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.) Outside of Harmonville, they meet big trouble. The town's boss, Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) claims the property surrounding the town as well, and despises ""freegrazers""--cowboys roaming the countryside and letting their cattle live off the land.After one of his men, a gentle Hoss Cartwright-type called Mose (Abraham Benrubi) is brutally killed and the teenaged Button (Diego Luna) is left for dead, Boss Spearman (Duvall) and top hand Charley Waite (Costner) are forced into double-handedly tackling Baxter's gun slinging army in town.At this descriptive point, you western purists have to  be frothing at the horse's bit in anticipation. You won't be disappointed. For the rest, including the vast number of ticket buying teenagers, why won't the heroics of ""Open Range"" thrill just as much? They will. Of course, drawing your decisive age group to a cowboy movie starring seasoned actors is the rub. Even though the dialogue and acting, particularly by Duvall and Costner, is exemplary. Even though James Muro's cinematography is awesome.Maybe teen and older anything-but-a-western-movie ticket buyers would  be drawn to Annette Bening's understated performance as the town doctor's spinster sister, Sue Barlow, who falls in love with Charley. Or the late Michael Jeter (""Evening Shade"" TV series) in a memorable role as Percy, the stable owner who befriends Boss and Charley. Whatever the attraction, let's hope box office receipts are as positive as another excellent non-traditional summer release, ""Seabiscuit.""""Open Range"" has its share of clichés, including the climactic ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" reminiscent shoot-out. There are hints of ""Shane"" with Costner's Charley and his hidden identity as a former gunman. ""High Noon"" and ""Rio Bravo"" come to mind as bystanding townspeople react and interact.But ""Open Range"" has its own edge and identity. There is a ""Lonesome Dove"" quality to the entire production, and that is a compliment. Much of the film's greatness lies in the small talk between the characters, whether it is about their love of the land or their dreams of growing old peacefully. ""There are things that gnaw at a man worse than dyin',"" Charley says to Boss just before the showdown. These are two weather-beaten cowboys desperate to survive, and we care about them.",Open Range

However, to be brief, after watching 'Open Range' I could only but sit back and say to myself 'Wow'! If you enjoyed Costner's 'Dances With Wolves' (An utterly deniable 'Renaissance' form of directing and acting) you are going to, without any doubt, be completely compelled by this work, in which Duvall should have been recognized with a merit in his outstanding performance.

367,Keith_beard66,A tight and rewarding modern Western,7,25 October 2015,"It is sometimes easy to forget that Kevin Costner once had a reputation as an understated and smart Hollywood leading man, due to overbearing epics such as Waterworld and Robin Hood: Prince of Theieves. This tight, and character driven Western is a return to form, and once again shows his keen eye as a director, and his engagement with fellow actors.I was impressed with the chemistry between Costner as Charley Waite along side Robert Duvall's seasoned 'Boss'. There was some fun knock about humour and sparks between the two, but also a gentle intimacy, and Costner deserves credit for his understated turn in allowing Duvall space to dominate the screen. Duvall has an air of subtle menace and charm as always, its a carefully built and commanding turn. It was also interesting how Boss become the more likable character of the two, having started out as a bit of a grumpy bore. There is a nice earthy look to the visuals, and the pacing is cool and breezy, with a care to detail, but not overalLy fussy. It is also a rare aspect of the Western that there is only one major action sequence and as a result it feels like a more dramatic and crucial scene. Another surprising thing is that the romance between Annette Bening's Sue and Charley is not rushed or underwritten as it maybe in other films of this genre. It is a credible part of the narrative which is given time to build, and another plus is that Sue is invested with much greater agency than is the norm for female characters of the genre.Its not all plain sailing, some of the dialogue felt jarring, Diego Luna's supporting character was a tad underwriter and felt like a plot device, and Michael Gambon's Irish accent was cartoonish.However, for the most part, this was an enjoyable mix comedy, drama, and romance, neatly shot, and grounded.",Open Range

From the very beginning I thought Costner's character was gonna be much more like the hard-boiled persona of a gunman nourished for so many years by Clint Eastwood. While in some regards he delivered, still the movie ends up with way too much touchy-feely gibberish, with the last 15 minutes being, at least for me, unbearable.

The characters speak as though you would expect in an older time and without the pretension of layed-on accents from some old Zane Grey or Max Brand book that actors sometimes get carried away with.  This is another one of classic Robert Duvall performances.  The role is very similar to Gus in 'Lonesome Dove, but is that bad?  Well, not for me.  Kevin Costner acting is understated and he lets Duvall lead the way.  Michael Jeter is nothing short of brilliant in the role of the livery stable owner.  All of the acting is solid and unassuming. Kevin Costner's direction is superb.  The camera shots, the pacing, the actors' performances all flow with the story effortlessly.  I remember the old quote, ""the sign of good direction is that you don't notice it."" That is definitely the case here. The action is well done and thankfully without the buckets of blood that are so overdone in some action movies...

I found this movie to be absolutely painful though.  Everything up to the gunfight is flat-out boring.  I've read that the slow-pace was for character development, but I found nothing compelling about any of the characters.  I did not feel the caring and sympathy for Button that the directors tried so hard to elicit. The depth they tried to give the Costner character was so trite and cliched. A guy whose ""done bad things"" but then set himself right but has to make one last stand before settling down.  Hanks' character in Road to Perdition was what the character ""could have been"".  The writing was horrendous. The dialogue was campy.  And what did we care whether those guys could graze their cows there or not?  At times I was sympathetic toward the land owner... it's his land, what right do our protagonists have to just bring their cows in there anyway?  Is this handled any better in the book?  I've never walked out of a movie but came close until I saw the gunfight was imminent.And let me say, the gunfight almost, ALMOST, saved this movie for me. Best gunfight I've seen in a Western and one of the best I've seen in any movie. The cinematography was excellent too.  Beautiful shots of the landscape and the rain.  The acting was even pretty good.  Costner seems to overplay all his parts now but Duvall was excellent as always and, though I'm not a big Bening fan, she played her part really well.

He does not disappoint with 'Open Range'. His sweeping landscapes and exposure of the elements put the audience in the middle of the wind swept fields and soaking rains.As an actor, Costner comfortably stays out of the camera's way when Duvall is in the scene.  It's good to know that directorial common sense kicks in to preserve the authenticity of the film.  Other notable performances come from Annette Benning (Costner's love interest) and Michael Jeter (the livery stable man with the sweet side).

The thing that warranted my giving the film a 3 out of 10 (as opposed to a 1, which I briefly considered) was the incredible performance of Robert Duvall and the admirable one of Annette Bening. Duvall was the only thing that kept me in the theater to the end, with his sometimes comical, sometimes touching, always believable delivery saving the character of Boss from the path of ridiculousness most other actors would have led him down given the UNBELIEVABLY weak script. This movie sealed the deal for me: in spite of the good movies he's been a part of, and the rather enjoyable performances he's put forth in the past, Kevin Costner simply is not a talented actor. I did not believe a single word out of his mouth in this film, and was actually laughing out loud during the ""dramatic"" (-ally absurd) final gunslingin' showdown scene. All in all a terrible disappointment, much closer to ""The Postman"" than to ""Dances with Wolves.""",Open Range

The beginning was abrupt, and several times I thought to myself, ""What's going on?"" but it quickly improves. The same goes for the dialogue, in the beginning it is choppy, random, and sometimes unintelligible (to me, anyhow). It too rights itself not too long in. My only other qualm was that the ending dragged on a bit, they could have chopped some from that end.There was quite a bit of action, very suspenseful at times too, perfectly at that ""violent enough for him, not too gory for her"" mark.The acting was very good. Robert Duvall was the best I think, Kevin Costner was also good. Unfortunately whenever I saw Annette Bening all I could think of was her character from ""American Beauty,"" but her acting was decent.In Conclusion, go out and see it if you feel like a good, enjoyable movie.

The only thing missing is the tall pasty undertaker (the one always wearing a stovepipe hat).  The great thing that Costner and company do with these characters is that they breathe life into them.They make them real people whom you actually care about.

Thankfully this movie isn't an exception to this un-written rule.Sadly, I think if you're a western buff the movie is a C-, and if you're not a western buff I wouldn't even bother going.I thought that the movie was slow, and was wasted on none moments. The characters where defined poorly. The movie could have been a lot better.

Kaven Costner has done an excelent job at producing this great film. He was also a great performer in this movie, His cast was excelent Robert Duvall was an excelent Boss Man,  with such a great protrayel of how the west was, Keven made a statement in the movie "" They broke the mole after him"" was i feel a real comment towards Robert Duvall as a person and not just as an actor ! Annete Banning was superb in her performance,  The other cast did such a good job at being western i felt like it was a real documentry made in the western days, The only thing i didnt like is the scene where the Big Guy dies, he was such a good side kick, i missed him through the rest of the movie :-( the little side kick did a great job of being YOUNG and full of P--- & Vinegar for this movie and my hats off to them all. I seen the movie twice the first day. and would consider buying this movie for future viewing. If Kaven doesnt recieve something for This Masterpeace i will be SHOCKED ! There isnt any other film made today as good as this one ! Im just an old Roughneck, who doesnt like to spend money on movies, but I will see this one again and again, Like Pretty Woman, Like Titanic, the great movies of my time. In closing i would like to state the fact, I DONT LIKE WESTERNS. BECAUSE NO ONE CAN MAKE THEM REAL ENOUGH TO LOOK GOOD, ANYONE CAN RIDE A HORSE, but this is a GREAT MOVIE.

As nowadays  the western genre appears out of vogue, it was of great delight to see what I considered a ""traditional"" cowboy film which harked back to the eras when the Western was popular.Not only a western, but a very good one. Superb acting by the major principals, particularly Robert Duvall. The screenplay is intelligent and the director although not using a fast pace captures the problems encountered during this historical period and the individuals characters to enable  a contemporary audience understand what motivated these people. The violence, particularly late in the film is shown as something that had to be done, and killing is a last resort.

397,Harveyt101,Kept my interest from start to finish.,8,25 January 2004,"I consider myself extremely critical of westerns and I liked this one a bunch.  When I watch a western I look for realism. Movies like Unforgiven and High Plains Drifter come to mind. Cowboys lucky to have a bath once a month, bad teeth and tough skin was the life of the cowboy. Open Range appears to take place outside the Southwest as evidenced from the green grass prairies that their cattle grazed on. Open Range is a good movie that delivers as well as the old Clint Eastwood westerns.**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****There were two areas in the movie where I thought it fell short. First, the water running through the center of town clearly posed no serious threat. Yet, they try hard to make it appear to be a life threatening deep current that runs the risk of sweeping Charlie away. The other area is the reaction to the gunfire. Anyone that has ever shot a shotgun knows that it isn't going to go through a 1x12 and still hit a man with enough force to knock him off his feet and through the air for 10 or more feet. I saw similar reactions to some of the pistol fire as well. What did I like about the movie? I thought the scene in the general store with Robert Duvall and the shop owner was special. I also thought the scene where the livery owner reads Charlie's note was special. After the movie ends, I find myself thinking that Charlie has a serious psychological problem that needs mending.",Open Range

The actors are great at their designated roles and the sceneries are good but the action of the movie is nothing new. I guess being a western you can't ask for more, but on the other hand the gunfight scenes are worth looking at. There some glitches with the camera sometimes, I mean it doesn't get the best angle on things and there also is an annoying sound in the scene where Charley and Sue talk alone in the saloon, which I can only guess it came from the camera. Also another thing which I expected more from was the love story between Charley (Kevin Costner) and Sue (Annette Bening), I mean there had to be more intimacy for it to be a major attraction of the movie. Kevin Costner did not make such great job at directing this movie as he did with Dances With Wolves or Waterworld an also the script I think isn't as good as in the previously mentioned movies. I liked the fact that the actors did a good job and made the story believable, they gave it feeling and I felt like I was a part of the crowd standing up for what's right in that small town. All and all a pretty good movie, not at all dull but also far from perfect. I gave it **** out of 5.",Open Range

If she didn't get through it, I'd understand.  The dialogue was some of the cheesiest and most contrived I can think of.Obviously, no historian had anything to do with the making of this movie. Costner has a line in which he quotes the adage, ""A picture is worth a thousand words.""  Um, hello?  The saying didn't exist at the time this film supposedly took place.  There were many such lapses in Open Range.  Was the entire crew so daft that none of them noticed any of this?  And where did they find the gem of a writer who penned the screenplay for this disaster? Among a group of third-graders playing Cowboys and Indians?  No, wait. That can't be.  A third-grader could have written a much better script.Moviegoers, beware.  I only rented this masterpiece for $3, and I feel ripped off.  I'd like not just my money back, but also the long, tedious two and a half agonizing hours this movie stole from my life.Bottom line: don't rent it.

I liked the human side to the characters, even the evil sheriff knew he was evil, but he accepted it. This proved that a movie could be made without sex and constant profanity and could still provide quality entertainment. Kevin Costner's character was really wonderful as he was able to capture the tough no nonsense killer when it was necessary and the soft and tender caring man as well, definitely a dicotimy. Duvall is superb as well as Annette Benning, Hard to believe that a woman can be that beautiful even when she is not made up and just playing a plain jane type role.

Ever since his portrayal of ""Boo Radley"" in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" I have been a fan. This movie is an absolute delight and the very best of western cinema.

Although not quite as good as ""Dances With Wolves"" Open Range, funnily enough, not only stars Kevin Costner but is along the same theme in as much as it tells a story about the early American way of life. This time about the ""Free Range"" cattlemen and the different hardships they had to cope with. And for once my family could sit down and watch a movie without all the smut, swearing and extreme violence that unfortunately, all movie makers of late, seem to think is necessary to sell them. The storyline was simple and easy to follow at the same time as it retold a fine piece of early American history. Although the actors had a simple storyline to work with, I felt their performances made the movie all the more realistic. Kevin Costner in my opinion is a fine actor, but put him in with an under-rated master such as Robert Duvall, and you can't go wrong. Their easy going,straight from the hip portrayal of the main characters was one of the reasons that as soon as I had finished watching the video I rewound it and the whole family watched it again.",Open Range

Charlie's comment to boss as they shake hands before the gunfight, ""just in case..."", is understated but yet understood; between men who live by that subtle, invaluable creed.

The brilliant Robert Duval is the drover and leader of a small crew who take advantage of grazing his herd freely on the open range, a policy the nasty land baron doesn't hanker to. Michael Jeter does a fine job as a helpful townsman and Kim Coates is a very convincing villain. Annette Bening, though, steals the film with her tender portrayal of the doctor's sister and love interest to Costner's character. Ms. Bening's pure beauty is never more apparent than in this movie where she uses no makeup. Her wholesome purity matches well against the violent demons that haunt the mind of the heroic gunman.

They kill 8 or 9 people and save the town from the horrendous rancher.,1,7 April 2005,"First off I would like to say that the script is unbelievably bad and the acting matches it's caliber. This movie is so bad, that it makes ""Waterworld"" look like an Oscar worthy movie. The fact that the names of the characters are, Bluebonnet, Mose, Button, and Charlie Postelwaite is a sure-sign indicator that this movie is AWFUL. With such lines as ""We better rustle up some grub"" the script takes a turn for the worst. Basically Boss and Charley are cowboys or ""Freegrazers."" They move threw a town by the name of fort Harmon. The people don't like ""freegrazers"" in the town for no apparent reason and get in to a fight with the charming cowpoke Mose. They find Mose in a jail cell and decide to take revenge on ""them who done this."" They decide to go find the people who committed the crime and leave their battered companion Mose and their 16 year old Button to fend for themselves in the ""Open Range."" When they come back, the bad guys have killed Mose and injured Button. However with all of the drama present, Bluebonnet and Charley remain calm. They take Button to the doctor and it turns out that after being shot point blank in the head, he has only suffered a concussion. The most ridiculous scene in the entire movie is when Bluebonnet explains to Sue Barlow what happened. He barely even mentions his two comrades being killed in a very gruesome way, but he gets very choked up when he mentions the dog that they killed. Well Charley and Bluebonnet make friends with a guy who loses his puppy and a man named ""Ralph"" who owns a candy store. But let us not forget the two's good friend Percy, whom cries after reading the last will of Charley. Bluebonnet and Charley get in a fight with Baxter the rancher and his ""lawman,"" Marshal Poole. The gunfight is very stupid and you can see that the bullets aren't timed what-so-ever. In example, Charley shoots his rifle and the bullet hits about 3 seconds later. You can tell that this is a very sad attempt at a Western movie. I almost feel sorry for Duvall for making a movie thinking that it was going to be another ""Lonesome Dove."" It's very obvious that Mr.Duvall has given up on the film when he delivers the line, ""I'm coming for you, you son of a bitch"" with no enthusiasm at all. The movie ends with Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall utter the line ""Let's go get our cows."" This is one of the VERY worst movies I have ever seen.

(I recommend The Upside of Anger for another fine performance. Forget -- please, forget -- Dragonfly.) Robert Duval, once again, delivers a finely tuned performance. The interchange between the two actors is very good and crackles with both feeling and humor. Annette Benning is also fine. Some have criticized the movie's romance. But, to speak quite frankly, the emotional sweep at the film's conclusion pulled me along in spite of a lack of build-up to the moment. Costner's attention to detail is admirable. It was only after pondering the violent scenes that I thought, 'Yes, in the old West, that's probably how a shoot-out would take place.' So, my wife and I enjoyed it. Was it John Ford?

While I respect their opinion, and they have the right to feel that way, I believe they don't understand the Western genre. The Western is not dead, and as it has been noted before, it is truly an American art form. It is not all myths (although many Western movies are not historically accurate). Open Range, I believe, should be recognized for it's great acting (Robert Duvall is always good) and it's great script. The scenery is awesome, and the tension of the film builds until the last (and only) gunfight. If you like Westerns, you'll enjoy this one. With all due respect for the other person who reviewed this should probably stick to a genre they understand. Them reviewing a Western would be like me reviewing a musical.

Tough and a man of few words makes a person listen when he has something to say and in this movie will give young men someone to look up to. This movie offers something every time you watch it, I often start dreaming of life back in the day of cattle drives and western expansion; I even by happenstance noticed at least one historical error which was the first town scene when men were carrying a circle saw blade which had the holes for inserted teeth, older blades wouldn't have had that. I have one and wish they could've called, I would've loaned it to them. Kevin Costners character is a wonderfully tough, take no crap, get things done type of guy but also respectful, and more aware of consequences down the road for actions taken in the present. He is a sort of project which I think women would appreciate a kind heart with a tough exterior. This movie has a great feel to it and I appreciate the transitions from different scenes. I think that seeing a movie that uses things that I have at my house keeps my interest and anyone who enjoys history and seeing it come alive will appreciate it. It has a little language but no sex, which makes it better than anything you'll see on TV.

The same things happen when they hit town, as well. I'm not going to go into the plot because you woudn't have much need to see the movie. If you like most of Kevin Costner's movies, you should like this one. The pace is brisker but you still get that great feeling that you want from a quality movie. If you want a real gem of a movie, please look into this movie. It's the only western you really need to see",Open Range

421,llbilyeu,A Wonderful Western after the Realist Dramas of the Shootist and Unforgiven.,10,14 October 2012,"I was VERY impressed by this film. Kevin has, once again, ignored the rules of fitting the movie to the audience and done a wonderful western that,those of us who have western experience, can value and enjoy. There is a feeling in western cultures of a day to day slugging it out to get the Job done. I was afraid that many in our rush rush hurry hurry get it done and entertain me modern culture would have problems with this western. But, again, like ""Dances with wolves"", he is letting us live the western from droning day to day to terror filled fight for your life and make them pay drama. I believe Kevin is reaching out to the average person and letting them FEEL the life that is so fascinating to so many of us. I am in hopes that most will be able to feel the touch of the life of the real cowboy and...enjoy the ride...without the need to dissect it.",Open Range
422,slats1,Open Range,9,9 January 2006,"If you like Westerns and great photography you'll definitely enjoy this movie. The Open Range photography was outstanding. The story line was a classic good against bad.Robert Duval was great. I think one of his better acting roles. I liked him with John Wayne in ""True Grit"" too. ""I call that bold talk for a one eyed fat man"" Duvall shouts across the field before they charge each other on horseback firing away !! Duval has been around the block a few times and his acting skills were never better in ""Open Range"".Costner with his casual ways and laid back manner was also great. It's as if he's trying to teach us all something in his films when he takes his time to deliver his lines. I think he's pretty good.Overall, great movie. Right up there with ""Tombstone"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""City Slickers""(only kidding) Billy Who ?? Jack Palace should have had a spot role in ""Open Range"" naw,,,Rent ""Open Range"" and watch a great movie with character.",Open Range
