0,MartinHafer,"It played better back in 1984, but it's still a good film.",7,5 August 2013,"Back when ""Beverly Hills Cop"" came out in 1984, it was a HUGE sensation--HUGE. Although the film cost about $14,000,000 to make, it earned back almost $250,000,000...in the US alone! And, the soundtrack from the film was almost as big--with many of the songs getting enormous airtime. In fact, the soundtrack was a HUGE hit as well. And, not surprisingly, Eddie Murphy soon decided to call it quits on ""Saturday Night Live"". On top of that, everyone seemed to be talking about the film...I can clearly remember that. Oddly, however, I didn't get around to seeing the film until now! And, now that I've seen it, I enjoyed it but also feel that the film sure would have played better back in the day than it does today.In this dramatic-comedy, Murphy plays Axel Foley--a freewheeling cop who seems to be the only one in the film who has a brain. He's smart and capable--and naturally the Detroit Police don't understand or appreciate him. One night, an old friend of Foley's shows up and after an evening partying, some assassins are waiting for them--killing the friend and sparing Foley. Clearly, Foley was not their target. Now, with the BAREST OF EVIDENCE, Foley is going on vacation to Beverly Hills to finish the investigation unofficially. However, once there, he finds the Beverly Hills Cops equally unappreciative of his talents and hassle him throughout most of the film. When the trail leads to a scum-bag named Maitland, the cops must decide whether to keep hassling Foley or jump into the fray with this out of control cop.The plot itself wasn't all that interesting to me and seemed a bit more like a plot from a TV cop show. However, this is not why folks liked the film. What folks liked, and I appreciated, was Murphy's humor--which was very much appreciated in order to liven up the mediocre plot. Is all this nonsense great? Nah...but it is quite good and Murphy's charisma was a MAJOR plus. Too bad this incredibly talented guy who made this and ""Dreamgirls"" (for which he received an Oscar nomination) also ended up making ""Norbit"" and ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"". Worth seeing, though you should be aware of the very crude language, violence and brief nudity.By the way, and it's not a complaint, but HOW DID AXEL GET THAT GUN IN THE BACK OF HIS PANTS AT THE END OF THE FILM?! He was shot in his right shoulder (his shooting arm) and yet the gun is stuffed in the back of his pants---in a way that could only happen if he did it with his damaged arm. And, who sticks their gun back there anyway? They'll end up blowing their butt off!!",Beverly Hills Cop
1,TheLittleSongbird,Hugely enjoyable and features Eddie Murphy in his best role,10,25 September 2010,"Wow, I was surprised at how brilliant this film was. It was funny and thrilling and had Eddie Murphy in his best role. It looks great, with the cinematography, scenery and editing all stylish, and the soundtrack is note-perfect, while the script is fresh, believable and funny with plenty of wit, and the story is thrilling and fast paced. The direction is assured, and the acting is great. Eddie Murphy is brilliant playing his most likable character to date, and shares a believable chemistry with Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Lisa Eilbacher and Steven Berkoff who all match him without fault. In conclusion, greatly enjoyable, and much better than its sequel. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Beverly Hills Cop
2,Leofwine_draca,"Not great, but still...",6,11 February 2012,"BEVERLY HILLS COP is one of the films that kick-started the action-comedy movie that ruled the 1980s. Films like LETHAL WEAPON and their ilk wouldn't have existed if Eddie Murphy hadn't come along to begin with and show them how it's done.I'll admit, right away, that I'm no Murphy fan. I've seen him in a couple of okayish movies (THE GOLDEN CHILD, METRO) but most of his filmography I wouldn't go near. BEVERLY HILLS COP presents him at his most successful and most commercial, full of wisecracks and edgy humour. Watching him go up against the staid, by-the-book-cops is a lot of fun.The film has dated quite a lot. The story feels a little bland and not much happens. Some of it's repetitive, and other scenes feel extraneous. There are a bunch of familiar faces (Ronny Cox, Steven Berkoff, Paul Reiser) but the really interesting roles go to Judge Reinhold and John Ashton. Watching the effect Murphy's character has on them is a lot of fun.That's good, because the action is fairly routine and there are no twists that you won't work out well in advance. In fact, I think this would be a pretty pedestrian film were it not for Murphy's larger-than-life turn. He brings the vital life and energy that helped turn this into a classic.",Beverly Hills Cop
3,SnoopyStyle,Great star vehicle for Eddie Murphy,8,4 January 2014,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a brash young Detroit cop. His childhood friend Mikey returns from LA having crossed the wrong people. Mikey is executed while out with Axel. Axel doesn't get the murder case. So instead he takes his vacation time in Beverly Hills to investigate. There he runs into cops who do things a little differently.It's a simple formula of action and Eddie Murphy hijinx. Eddie Murphy makes jokes, do the action thing, and create havoc. Young Judge Reinhold, grisly John Ashton, and by-the-books Ronny Cox play the Beverly Hills cops. There is the clash of culture, and Murphy's hilarious laugh. This is a star vehicle for Eddie Murphy, and he drives it with style.",Beverly Hills Cop
4,Horst_In_Translation,Young talent on the rise,6,10 December 2014,"It is already the 30th anniversary for the early Eddie Murphy movie ""Beverly Hills Cop"". Director Martin Brest has a pretty unique body of work afterward. He scored 2 Oscar nominations for ""Scent of a Woman"" (the film that won Pacino finally his Oscar), but seemingly killed his career in 2003 with ""Gigli"" and has not directed a movie ever since. ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was the highest grossing film from 1984, ahead of classics like ""Indiana Jones"", ""Gremlins"", ""Karate Kid"" and ""Ghostbusters"". Quite a good year for cinema with a winner that you would not necessarily expect. Probably thanks to the commercial success, the script received an Academy Award nomination, and Harold Faltermeyer's excellent soundtrack scored some recognition at award shows as well. He had to wait for the sequel to get his Oscar nomination though. Fittingly for its audience numbers, the film also won People's Choice Award for Best Movie of the Year.Eddie Murphy was a rising star back then. He got a Golden Globe nomination, his second already after ""Trading Places"" and an earlier ""Best Newcomer"" nod for ""48 Hours"" and all this in his early 20s. There have been two sequels already for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" in the 10 years after the original, but judging from what the critics say, the quality got steadily worse. Maybe a possible 4th film, which could come out in 2016, will be received better again.I personally found this film work much better as a crime thriller than as a comedy. Murphy's usual stick has never been really my cup of tea, but it's not so bad that it destroys the whole movie. His character is as loud, obnoxious and smart as you know it from Murphy's other works. The film has all the ingredients: one rich evil antagonist, violent scary henchmen and a good-looking female, who has even less to do than the average Bond girl. It is all a bit predictable, but I liked the ending with the reference back to the made-up story Murphy told earlier in the film. That connection was nicely written. You could summarize this film as a story about a cop who goes from New York to Beverly Hills to solve the murder of his friend (oh back in the days when males could still tell males ""I love you"" without the audience smelling any homoerotic tendencies). Decide for yourself if you want to give it a go. If you do and if you have seen ""Breaking Bad"", you will find the young Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmanntraut) in the cast as well playing one of the bigger characters and he even has a shootout scene with Murphy.",Beverly Hills Cop
5,Prismark10,Beverly Hills Tops,10,31 July 2013,"This was one of the biggest comedies of all time. Before this film, there were black comedians in movies that never reached their promise.Eddie Murphy coming off 48 Hours and Trading Places hit the ball out of the park. He set the template for every black comedy actor to follow which is a bit of a curse in itself.This is essentially a fish out of water film, with a pure 80s soundtrack, violence, action and a bundle of laughs. The bad guys are vicious and menacing, there is very little charm in Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks.It is the Beverly Hills setting that gives Murphy's character full reign to contrast the police procedures in his native Detroit to that of the more sedate Los Angeles enclave of the rich and famous.Great support from John Ashton, Judge Reinhold and Ronny Cox.",Beverly Hills Cop
6,classicsoncall,"""One drink's not gonna kill us.""",8,22 May 2021,"This was a lot of fun back in the day and holds up pretty well even now, as I watched it once again the other evening. For me it was one of those movies that remain memorable because of Eddie Murphy's nervous energy and brilliant wisecracks owing to some edgy script writing. My favorite scenes were the banana in the tailpipe, the strip joint take down of the two hoods, and while watching this time around, I happened to be eating a roast beef sandwich while being reminded by Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) that by the time one hits fifty, you have about five pounds of undigested red meat in your colon. I'm a couple decades beyond that, so I probably have to compensate for another couple pounds or so. The film is punctuated by a hip and energetic soundtrack, with a great opener that sets the pace of the story with Glenn Frey's 'The Heat is On'. One minor point caught my attention when I heard it stated a night at the Beverly Hills Hotel went for two hundred thirty five dollars; that didn't sound like a whole lot to me, even for 1984, but it still probably caused the police department some irritation, seeing how it wound up on their tab. For me, this was one of Murphy's best flicks, suggesting one take a look at the couple of sequels that followed.",Beverly Hills Cop
7,gavin6942,Greatest Action Comedy Ever?,7,31 December 2012,"A freewheeling Detroit cop (Eddie Murphy) pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills.I love that they took a Sylvester Stallone action film, made some modifications, and then turned it into an Eddie Murphy comedy. I think without a doubt this was a wise move -- how many Stallone films have been forgotten, whereas this one was one of the top-grossing films of all time and sparked two sequels (thus far).Heck, I am generally speaking not even a Murphy fan... but he is just so great here, and really in his element. Eddie Murphy is Axel Foley more than he is any other character he has played (though I suppose the kids today know him best as Donkey). And the banana in the tailpipe! I can see that joke a million times!",Beverly Hills Cop
8,lee_eisenberg,"A total '80s movie. And how did Martin Brest degenerate into ""Gigli""?",5,8 March 2006,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is the sort of movie that I would usually give 10/10, but there unfortunately is a major problem with it. The movie presents no challenge to the status quo, portraying the police as the good guys.But other than that, the movie is pretty funny. With Eddie Murphy in as Axel Foley, one gets the feeling that they must have had fun making it. Which of course brings up a few questions: How did director Martin Brest go from this to a piece of dreckola like ""Gigli""? Why is Eddie Murphy currently doing movies like ""Daddy Day Care""? What ever became of Judge Reinhold? Oh well. The point is that you're sure to enjoy this movie, even if it is a total '80s movie. Neat.",Beverly Hills Cop
9,jboothmillard,Beverly Hills Cop,8,6 July 2010,"Eddie Murphy had great success in Saturday Night Live, and a good debut debut into film with 48 Hours, but this was the blockbuster that propelled him into stardom, from director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Meet Joe Black). Basically Det. Axel Foley (Golden Globe nominated Murphy) is the young, talkative and wise-cracking Detroit cop, who while reckless in his crime solving has become talented since reforming from his hoodlum days. He delighted to see his childhood friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo), saying he is working in Beverly Hills as a security guard with Axel's mutual friend Jeannette 'Jenny' Summers (Lisa Eilbacher). Then Mikey is murdered right in front of Axel by a man named Zack (Jonathan Banks), and he is compelled to investigate the murder. Axel pretends to go on vacation in Beverly Hills to his boss Inspector Douglas Todd (Gil Hill), but there Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Total Recall's Ronny Cox) assigns Det. William 'Billy' Rosewood (Ruthless People's Judge Reinhold) and Det. Sgt. John Taggart (John Ashton) to keep an eye on him. With the help of Jenny, Axel meets her boss, and Mikey's one-time boss also, art gallery owner Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff), who doubles as a drug kingpin, using the gallery as a cover-up. After confirming all the suspicions, Axel, with the co-operation of Bogomil, and the help of Rosewood and Taggart, they all go to bring Maitland to justice. Also starring Stephen Elliott as Police Chief Hubbard, Gilbert R. Hill as Insp. Douglas Todd, Art Kimbro as Det. Foster, Joel Bailey as Det. McCabe and Bronson Pinchot as Serge. You have to remind yourself sometimes that Murphy was a huge star famed for his foul mouth before going into the family films genre, but that is one of the big hooks, my favourite lines are his ""Get the f*** out of here!"" to the foreign and camp art guy. Anyway, Murphy really throws himself into this fun role that could have gone to Sylvester Stallone, he has a great swagger attitude to the character, and the supporting cast add to the fun as well. I have to admit also that the ""Axel F"" theme tune by Harold Faltermeyer is great, but sometimes I can't help but think of the Crazy Frog (which I do like). I was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Score for Harold Faltermeyer, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Eddie Murphy was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, ""Axel F"" was number 28 on 50 Greatest One Hit Wonders, and the film was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 44 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Beverly Hills Cop
10,ccthemovieman-1,Now-Tired Themes Make It A Lot Less Fun That It Used To Be,5,21 February 2007,"This was a very entertaining movie when I first saw it at the theater in the mid '80s. Later, I enjoyed it on VHS. The film featured good music, good action and good humor.After a hiatus of 5-10 years, I viewed it again in the late '90s and got more annoyed than anything else. By then, I had seen thousands of movies and was starting tired of the ""new stereotypes"" I was beginning to see with regularity; reverse racism in which the black guy is always smarter than the white guy, for example. In here, it's Murphy smarter than all the white cops, most of whom are pictured as outright stupid. (If the reverse was shown, there would be an uproar.)It's also one more example - among hundreds in films since the late '60s - in which the renegade (regardless of color) is the only one who can solve cases. The regular law enforcement, from local cops to FBI to CIA, are always featured as bumbling idiots with stupid superiors. It's all getting tiresome. Murphy had a great run in the '80s, but his act has worn thin and I hadn't heard much from him in years until this year for his supporting role in ""Dreamgirls.""",Beverly Hills Cop
11,rmax304823,Being Poor Makes You Tough.,5,6 November 2010,"I never know quite what to make out of this movie. Yes, the Beverly Hills police get skewered -- along with Beverly Hills culture in general -- and if Beverly Hills represents the realization of the American dream it certainly deserves skewering. The materialism blossoms like a fungus in a vast spiritual void. You ought to see Rodeo Drive. One millionaire's shop after another and a constant parade of customers groomed and dressed identically in thousand-dollar jeans. It's like a Theme Park. I wouldn't want my kid to grow up there.But to ridicule the locus while exalting the obnoxious figure doing the ridiculing raises entirely different questions of taste.Eddie Murphy is Detective Axel Foley from Detroit, at the time the murder capitol of the nation. He's poor. He's savvy. He's black. He's everything they're not. Murphy giggles as he drives his beat-up clunker through the city (if it's a city) and eyes the ritzy hotels and jewelry stores. He's on a quest for the murderers of his good friend back in Detroit and has reason to believe the trail starts in Beverly Hills. It does, and it ends there too.Meanwhile Murphy teaches the uptight local cops how the cow ate the cabbage. The local cops are stupid beyond belief. They follow the rules. They call people ""sir"" and they say ""please"" when they tell a suspect to do something. The Beverly Hills cops act like Boy Scouts, squealing on each other and on themselves. They're clean. They're well spoken. They're white. His opposite number is Judge Reinhold, than whom no one can possibly look and sound wimpier.Well, that's just about the whole story. Murphy acquires a white girl friend without quite acquiring a white girl friend (this movie will be shown in Jackson, Mississippi), he brazens his way out of complicated situations and exploits his environment. He insults people of his own color for not behaving as if they were black enough for him. He violates the law at every turn. When he walks in public he looks back over his shoulder and chuckles at the two gay guys who just passed him, although they've done nothing comic.The musical score, though, is full of an appropriate zest. Reinhold acts as if his IQ were about as high as his body is in inches. Eddie Murphy often uses his big grin, wide mouthed persona, familiar from television, and sometimes it works for him, but when he tries to sound sincere, he does his best but there isn't a moment when he doesn't sound like Eddie Murphy trying to act. He was more effective when he was more subtle, doing the same number on the excessively rich in ""Trading Places."" It's mildly amusing but I couldn't really get with it because I don't find insults in themselves funny. You want to see a very good movie involving the police of Beverly Hills? See ""Straight Time,"" if you can find it.",Beverly Hills Cop
12,Tweekums,A classic '80s action comedy,8,18 August 2016,"Protagonist Axel Foley is a Detroit cop who is happy break the rules; something that annoys his boss. Early on his old friend Mikey pays him a visit; Mikey is in trouble with some very bad people in Beverly Hills and soon after arriving in Detroit he is killed. Axel is told to stay well clear of the case so decides to take a much needed vacation in Beverly Hills. Here he visits his old friend Jenny Summers and starts investigating Victor Maitland, Mikey's former employee which gets him arrested. Once again Axel is warned off the case but he still keeps digging while local cops Sgt Taggart and Det. Rosewood try to keep an eye on him and stop him getting into any more trouble. Axel's investigation leads him to believe Maitland is smuggling cocaine and he is soon in real danger.This film is a great mix of comedy and action. It gets off to a fine start which involves a truck being chased through the streets of Detroit causing mayhem as is goes; this isn't related to the main story but serves to introduce Foley. The central story is interesting even there is no real doubt who is behind the death of Axel's friend it is just a question of how he will prove Maitland did it. Eddie Murphy has made some turkeys over the years but here he is on top form as the wise-cracking Axel Foley. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton provide good support as Rosewood and Taggart; playing things straighter but still pretty funny at time. Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks are suitably unpleasant as Maitland and his henchman; thankfully leaving the jokes for the good guys. There are also some decent minor characters; most notably Bronson Pinchot who is hilarious as Serge, the camp gallery assistant. There are plenty of really funny moments during the film such as when Axel bluffs his way into an exclusive club by pretending to be Maitland's lover with an embarrassing medical condition that he thinks Maitland should know about. There is a fair amount of strong language but if that doesn't offend you and you want a good laugh then I certainly recommend this '80s classic the soundtrack is great too!",Beverly Hills Cop

14,BA_Harrison,Axel Effing Good.,9,14 September 2016,"Originally a vehicle for Sylvester Stallone, Beverly Hills Cop underwent a significant overhaul after Eddie Murphy was cast in the lead only weeks before filming was due to start; consequently, what would most likely have been a standard '80s action flick was turned into a much more humorous affair, Murphy's sassy, smart-talking persona bringing a levity and charm that would have been sorely lacking if Sly had been the star.Fresh from the success of Trading Places, Murphy gives a confident turn as Axel Foley, a Detroit cop who goes to Los Angeles to try and find those responsible for the murder of his best friend. Landing himself in trouble with the Beverly Hills police force, Foley enlists the help of two police detectives, Rosewood and Taggart (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton), and uncovers a drug smuggling operation run by art dealer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff), the man who ordered the hit on Foley's pal.With Murphy at the top of his game (improvising much of his hilarious dialogue), a terrific supporting cast, lots of quotable dialogue, and great action sequences, all accompanied by Harold Faltermeyer's unmistakable synth soundtrack and some classic pop/rock tunes that are impossible not to bop along to, Beverly Hills Cop is easily one of the most consistently fun films to come out of the '80s.9 out of 10, although Bronson Pinchot's scene-stealing turn as gallery employee Serge almost earned it top marks (""I make it back there myself with a little lemon twist, it's good—you should try it"").",Beverly Hills Cop

It's a delightful what-they-didn't-know-was with all its formulas cleverly reworked for maximum dramatic impact, plus well-timed and neatly-paced humor. Mr. Murphy is astonishingly able in the main role. The script allows him several impersonations which he walks off with most amusingly. Judge Reinhold heads a great support cast. Director Martin Brest makes use of both his players and his locations for maximum effect. This movie is totally gripping from the first all-action sequence to the last. In short, Mr. Murphy and his writers have created some believable characters and made good use of them in an involving plot which the producer and his technicians serve up in involving style on an A-1 budget.

Undaunted, Foley, aided by old friend Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) and two intrigued local detectives, starts to unravel the mystery.Hey Axel you got a cigarette?There was a time when Eddie Murphy ruled the world. After Trading Places had introduced us to his sharp comedic tongue, and 48 Hours had shown him to be a more than capable action character actor, Beverly Hills Cop fused the two together and propelled Murphy to super stardom. Directed by Martin Brest and produced by Messers Simpson & Bruckheimer, it's really no surprise that ""Hills Cop"" is shallow, simple (a fish out of water comedy standard) and utterly commercial. Yet with its gusto, humorous script (Daniel Petrie Jr) and neat plotting, it becomes a hugely entertaining film - led superbly by Murphy due to infectious comedy energy and superb knack for timing.You're not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe routine!It's hard to believe that the likes of Sly Stallone and Al Pacino were first mooted for the role, so not as a comedy one imagines, but as it being a standard police action movie, but enter Murphy and it ended up as a fine blend of action and comedy. There's little digs at Beverly Hills and its smugness, a way of life that Foley, with his down on the streets toughness, can't comprehend, while opposing police methods also get a wry once over - wonderfully threaded in the relationship between Foley, Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold).Small gripes reside, such as Steven Berkoff's by the numbers villain being something of a let down and Ronny Cox is sadly playing filler time with an underwritten character. But this is about Murphy, the fabulous stunt work and the successful union of action and comedy.

20,zardoz-13,An Exciting Action 'Fish-Out of Water' Comedy,9,23 December 2014,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is one of Eddie Murphy's few genuinely good movies. Murphy is cast as Axel Foley, a Detriot policeman with authority issues who travels to Beverly Hills to learn what happened to one of his close friends. He discovers the ultimate adversary in villainous Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff of ""Octopussy""), while he cannot get his head around how the Beverly Hills Police Department operates. Eventually, he makes friends with two blue-collar cops, callow Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") and Rosewood's gruff, no-nonsense partner Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton of ""Midnight Run"") who have been dispatched to conduct surveillance on him by their immediate superior, Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox of ""Deliverance"") who wants Axel out of town. Axel isn't the kind of guy who gives up easily as everybody comes to realize with dire chagrin, especially Maitland. Axel's Detroit Police Department Captain, Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill) is the only person that Axel seems to respect. Anyway, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is fast-paced fun with all the dull spots edited out for maximum velocity from the early scenes in the Motor City when he busts cigarette smugglers to his repeated clashes with Maitland and his minions, most memorably Zack (Jonathan Banks), the evil villain who killed Axel's friend and loves to brag about the feat. Martin Brest made his reputation with this top-flight action thriller. Before ""Beverly Hills Cop"" he made an amusing oldsters actioneer with George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg entitled ""Going in Style."" He went on to helm the top-notch Robert De Niro bounty hunter thriller ""Midnight Run."" The bouncy orchestral theme by Harold Faltermeyer became a popular hit.

A lot of this will probably seem routine to modern audiences, but at the time this film established the action-comedy as one of the biggest genres of the decade.

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a charming action film which was heavy on humor but light on realism. Be that as it may, I thought that Eddie Murphy was absolutely sensational and that this was probably his best movie of all. Granted, this movie is definitely dated and clearly reflected the 1980s. Likewise, he was quite vulgar in several scenes as well but he managed to use that to his advantage to keep the humor moving along. In any case, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Beverly Hills Cop
24,HotToastyRag,Classically 1984,8,23 September 2021,"Set to the great soundtrack that has now become a classic, Beverly Hills Cop is a laugh a minute. It's no wonder they kept making sequels! It's a tad violent, though not by today's standards, and more than a little suspenseful. Definitely different than your usual ""cop comedy"", this movie is intense and manages to make you fear for everyone's safety.I wasn't around to watch it during its release, but watching it now gives an extra special treat: retro appreciation. The cars are hilariously boxy. The music makes you want to slide into some tight jeans and cut the sleeves off your t-shirt. And I fell in love with Lisa Eilbacher, from her perm to her '80s smoky eyeshadow to the shoulderpads in her costumes to her ""I work out with Jane Fonda"" slim figure. Everything about her was so classically 1984!Even though this movie is supposed to be a laugh-out-loud comedy (and it is), I couldn't help but admire the intelligence of Eddie Murphy's character. He was constantly thinking on his feet, coming up with complex lies at the drop of a hat, and adopted different identities to get his way in different situations. It was brilliant! And yes, a lot of fun.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During the opening car chase, the camera swerves and turns, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Beverly Hills Cop

Judge Reinhold & John Ashton play local policeman who never encountered anyone like Axel before...Smash hit in 1984, though I really have no idea why. Good music score, but plot is strictly routine, no better than a TV series plot.(Nothing wrong with that, but still!) Film coasts along on the persona of Eddie Murphy, who plays Axel as a wise-cracking buffoon on the one hand, but a dedicated and brilliant detective on the other(Sounds like Columbo!) Trouble is, I found his act tiresome; he succeeds in his investigation because the script says he does, since I didn't buy how he bluffs his way through tough situations because the people are so gullible.And the ""banana in the tailpipe"" joke really makes Foley look like a jerk!",Beverly Hills Cop

He teams up with two reluctant detectives from the Beverly Hills police force who were supposed to keep a watch on him. But after seeing Foley's different approach to tackling criminals and other illegitimate businesses, they have no other choice but to help him....Here's another movie that gives strong evidence as to 1984 being the best year for movies ever, Beverly Hills Cop isn't just a great action comedy, it's one of the greatest comedies ever made and personifies the eighties as a really great time to be growing up.Murphy easily peaked his career making this, and when watching this, you know that he knows he is making something special, something huge, and on such a straightforward concept.What makes it so iconic though is that you can tell that everyone is enjoying themselves making this, and how at ease everyone is with each other, almost making you feel that you are part of Foley's world, because he is such a likable, and relatable character.Murphy steals almost every scene that he's in, and each little situation almost feels like a comedy sketch, but the writes and narrative seamlessly add the sketch into the plot.The rest of the cast know that this is Murphy's vehicle and just let him go for it. The only Pearson in the film that usurps Murphy is one Bronson Pinchot, and that's only because his part is very short, but memorable for all the right reasons.It's a wonderful, bright, sunny movie that epitomises the eighties, and even the synth soundtrack and hilarious outfits, can't age this movie.Because laughter is timeless......",Beverly Hills Cop
27,Wuchakk,Eddie Murphy at his peak in a great cop thriller/comedy,9,20 May 2015,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" (1984) stars Eddie Murphy as, Axel Foley, a fast-talking, streetwise Detroit cop who goes to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of a close friend. He meets up with a fetching high school friend (Lisa Eilbacher) and encounters a handful of Beverly Hills police (Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Ronny Cox ) while zeroing in on the wicked culprit (Steven Berkoff).Murphy's role was originally intended for Sylvester Stallone, who dropped out two weeks before filming was to commence because the producers insisted that Stallone's ideas were over-budget. A couple days later Eddie signed on resulting in massive rewrites to include his witty comedic flair. Despite these last-minute changes everything clicks for a great mid-80s cop thriller/comedy. The movie went on to become the #1 film in the USA in 1984 and #2 worldwide.Seeing it 31 years later (as of this writing) it's clearly a product of its time—e.g. the music and styles—but its greatness still shines. What's so great about this film? Of course there's Eddie's comic genius, but there's so much more: The great ""Axel F"" instrumental by Harold Faltermeyer; the way the movie expertly meshes serious drama/action with excellent comedic elements; Mikey's surprising and potent expression of love for his friend; Axel's loyalty at all costs spirit; the theme of being different in a world that demands conformity; trying to understand how your colleagues think or work in order to solve a case; the great camaraderie that develops amongst the protagonists; Axel's acceptance once he proves he's the real deal; looking beyond outer gruffness to see inner greatness; Lisa's perky cuteness; the warmth the viewer feels for the protagonists as the story progresses; and more.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in Detroit and Dearborn, Michigan; and Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Los Angeles, California.GRADE: A",Beverly Hills Cop
28,SimonJack,Early Eddie Murphy comedy crime flick still holds some humor,7,16 February 2021,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" was a smash hit comedy, crime and action thriller in 1984. Watching it again after these many years, I found it still amusing. Yet, as a couple other reviewers have noted, it's not as funny as it was back then. One other thing stood out again after these many years. This film was made at a time of the mid-late 20th century when the art form of film was celebrating its penchant for profanity. From about the mid-1970s into the early 90s, it seems so many films - of all genres, had scripts filled with crass, crude or vulgar language. Well, apparently Hollywood got it out of its system to the extent that foul language isn't even the main vocabulary of foul characters in most films well into the 21st century.The success of this film would lead to two sequels. While there's some originality here, the writers have woven little subtilties into the film. They appear to have borrowed some ideas from the James Bond series, and put much more action into the type of comedy mysteries that had various successful series in the 1930s into the 1950s (""The Thin Man,"" ""Philo Vance,"" ""Boston Blackie"" and others.) Most of the main characters would appear in all three films, and all give good performances. Eddie Murphy is a natural for detective Axel foley. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Ronny Cox are all good in their roles.After watching it again these many years later, I was intrigued by the actor who played Axel Foley's boss in Detroit, Inspector Todd. Before the Internet there wasn't a handy IMDb to check on movies. But now I was able to look up Gilbert R. Hill. What a surprise to learn that this was his first movie and that he would make only three in his life - all of them in this series. Hill wasn't a professional actor but he knew the part well because he was a professional in law enforcement. When this movie was made, Hill was the inspector in charge of the homicide division in the Detroit Police Department. He retired from law enforcement in 1989 as a commander in the Detroit Police force. In commenting on his role in this film, Hill supposedly said that the only difference between his character in these films and his real life was that he didn't use nearly as much profanity in real life.The funniest scene to me was when Sgt. Taggart and Detective Billy Rosewood (Ashton and Reinhold) show up in their precinct office after having been put out of commission when Axel stuffed bananas in their car's tailpipe. Another detective comes up to them and says, ""We've got something for you, Billy - an anti-banana disguise,"" and he puts on a pair of clown glasses with a banana nose.Some adult audiences should still enjoy the humor in this film today, if not turned off by the profanity. And, of course the language, a scene in a strip bar and violence are reasons it's rated R and not for kids. Here are some other favorite lines from this film.Axel Foley, ""You know, this is the cleanest and nicest police car I've ever been in in my life. This thing's nicer than my apartment.""Axel Foley, ""I've never been in a cell that had a phone in it. Can I stay for a while 'cause I ordered some pizza?""Det. Billy Rosewood is reading a magazine as he and Sgt. Taggart are sitting in their car on a stakeout. He says, ""Wow! You know, it says here that by the time the average American is 50, he's got five pounds of undigested red meat in his bowels."" Sgt. Taggart, ""Why are you telling me this? What makes you think I have any interest in that at all?"" Det. Rosewood, ""Well, you eat a lot of red meat.""",Beverly Hills Cop
29,Mr-Fusion,A career-defining role,8,27 August 2012,"Looking back on it now, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" feels like a packaged deal; take a name producer, MTV-friendly pop soundtrack, and an up-and-coming star and it just looks like a formula for printing money. And I guess it'd be pretty easy to write it off as just that, but there's a lot more going on here.Eddie Murphy proves the ideal choice for the smartass who ends up schooling the rule-adherent West Coast police department. Most of the enjoyment you'll get out of this derives from his sense of humor (not to mention that laugh). It's pitch-perfect casting, and that trivia about Stallone originally being considered . . . man, that would've been a completely different movie.But there's a real camaraderie that forms between Murphy, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold once they're all working together, and it's thanks in no small part to the actors' chemistry. What could be a stale narrative deepens when the unconventional cop actually finds kindred spirits in his coastal counterparts. When all is said and done, the laughs are there, but so is the solid cop story.It's an action comedy, with the usual car chases and shootouts, but it still stands up extremely well. This is a gem. And that score is infectious! 8/10",Beverly Hills Cop
30,StevePulaski,Breakneck pacing and addicting music combined with a storyline that sadly got familiar,8,23 February 2014,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a reckless, wise-cracking Detroit cop, whose young, streetwise-mentality comes in handy in a force of aging white guys. After his childhood friend is murdered, Axel assigns himself to investigate the murder, despite harsh opposition from others on the force. He travels to Beverly Hills to work for the Beverly Hills Police Department and turns the force upside down with his aforementioned character traits. Murphy is ideal for the role of Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop. Murphy's mile-a-minute conversational humor and rapid-fire wit keeps things moving at a breakneck pace, and the man has enough charisma to keep a story like this moving. Furthermore, writer Daniel Petrie, Jr. makes sure to give Murphy an ample amount of screen time so his Axel Foley character rise is given moments to be fiercely likable and someone we grow to like.And even after giving us an energetic central character, Petrie, Jr. is sure to give us terrific action sequences. For example, the film opens with a fantastic chase scene between numerous police cruisers and a large, eighteen-wheeler carrying dozens of cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes with Axel being thrown every which way in the back of the truck. The scene goes on for about three minutes and possesses the same kind of excitement and practicalness of The Blues Brothers's famous action scenes in the regard that digital effects don't seem to be interfering with the film every chance they get.Instead, the chase scene feels much more natural and real because of the fact that it's as if we're watching a real-life car chase on TV. Another scene similar to this one is the shootout scene between Axel and two other detectives and several other goons using high-powered machine guns. The scene operates like a realistic shootout and is simply a lot of fun to sit back and watch.Another thing levying the entire film is the soundtrack, which blends the likes of electric pop and techno music that allows for an exciting mix of things. For 1984, this was an uncommon thing, and the film's frequent use of one specific techno song allow for a nice consistency and an inane catchiness to the film all around.The Beverly Hills Cop franchise is an interesting footnote in film mainly because all three films are directed by three different directors, who've had strong and prolific experience in the action genre. The first sequel was directed by Top Gun director Tony Scott, while the second sequel by John Landis, who directed The Blues Brothers. As for this film, Martin Brest mans this ship, a man whose entire career has pretty much been devoted to action comedies that pack a wallop. His camera-work and filmmaking techniques are continuously impressive, and with the help of Daniel Petrie, Jr., the story at hand never becomes shackled by the confines of dreary storytelling or even a romance. In a world where it seems buddy cop films can barely establish actor/ character-chemistry and a credible plot, it's almost shocking to see what Beverly Hills Cop does and does so well.Starring: Eddie Murphy. Directed by: Martin Brest.",Beverly Hills Cop
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Classic Eddie, timeless!",10,11 October 2006,"I recently bought the best of Saturday Night Live: Eddie Murphy, and I just about died laughing. Unfortunately, before that I only saw like three of the episodes of SNL with Eddie on tape, Eddie was kind of before my time, but when I got to see the best, I was really excited and my mom asked me if I ever saw Beverly Hills Cop, but I didn't. She went out to buy it and I just watched it, I nearly died laughing.Eddie plays Axel, a tough street smart cop from Detroit. His convict friend comes to visit him with some phony bonds, but ends up getting murdered. Axel decides to take things into his own hands and goes to Beverly Hills to find his friend's killer. He ends up getting followed by the Beverly Hills cops while he's on the case of Victor Maitland, the number one suspect for his friend's murder.Eddie has some amazing scenes in this movie, my favorite is where he has to get into the restaurant to see Victor again and he acts gay and says he has a disease that he has to tell Vic about to the host. This is a terrific movie and really shows the many talents of Eddie Murphy, the guy is just great. What a laugh! 10/10",Beverly Hills Cop
32,MovieAddict2016,Murphy's best role - a unique fish-out-of-water comedy!,10,12 November 2004,"Detroit cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is in Beverly Hills for a few days to investigate the murder of an old acquaintance. Axel assumes the suspect is a local tycoon, but no one seems to believe him  including the police force, being semi-run by Ronny Cox (in one of his rare good-guy roles).Axel comes into trouble with the law his first day on the job after getting thrown through a glass window by some thugs. He is arrested, and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them (in one of cinema's most delightful moments  ever) Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues  which, of course, he finds very easily.Before this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood: ""48 HRS."" But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much, much better film, and it's also much, much funnier, too. What's most refreshing is that it doesn't fall back upon the stereotypes of African-Americans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures  the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone (who was actually attached to star early on in pre-production before dropping out of the project) and it's quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting, script flaws can still be spotted  the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman, for example, and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story, but Murphy works against the flow, awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.These sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film  ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it's not typical in any sense. Sure, it has the routine shoot-outs but there is no romance subplot, no pointless racial comparisons (more of which would be seen in the two sequels), etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh, and far more believable  after all, rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail, and finally getting a long-awaited kiss from the leading lady. ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" to its credit, manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film, even if most of its sequences are far from being 100% realistic.The film's director, Martin Brest, has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro / Charles Grodin road-buddies-comedy ""Midnight Run,"" one of the most popular (and best) of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well  it's funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it wants to be, and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.Murphy is the driving force behind the film, presenting us with a truly likable character  the most likable character he's ever played, as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy  Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in ""48 HRS."" (being the loud, obnoxious racist who's got it all together), but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior  but he takes all the blame, and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job, despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club. Axel is tough, cool, quick-witted, nice, sarcastic, and likable  one of cinema's most enduring characters, and proof that African-American cinema heroes don't always have to be loudmouths in order to succeed as characters (pay attention, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker).The now-famous soundtrack (including 'Axel F' by Harold Faltermeyer) is a great blend of techno-pop and electronic rock  the movie's theme is bouncy, rambunctious and fun: a good parallel to Axel himself.Overall ""Beverly Hills Cop"" exceeds exceptionally well, even if a great deal of the film's success itself derives from pure accident and chance. I don't think anyone can say that those involved in the production knew exactly what they were doing at the time (DVD supplements include anecdotes about hectic filming and the project almost falling through at one point) -- but as luck would have it everything turned out fine. ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is an immensely enjoyable film, and one of the best examples of the cop-comedy genre executed properly.",Beverly Hills Cop
33,OllieSuave-007,One of the best Action Comedies!,10,3 October 2013,"This is one of the best action comedies from Hollywood.

35,ElMaruecan82,Eddie Murphy at the top of his form... for a formulaic cop movie...,8,22 December 2017,"""Beverly Hill's Cop"" has all the makings of a classic 80's movie, the charismatic persona of Eddie Murphy, an upbeat and catchy synthesizer's beat and a likability factor that tie up all these elements together, so its iconic status can't be denied regardless of whether you've actually enjoyed it or not. But that doesn't make it immune to fair criticism, is the film a classic? Yes. Is it funny? Now , that's tricky.We're in 2017, and Martin Brest's film still holds up very well and is considered as one of the most defining comedies of the 80's. I wouldn't say it's one of the funniest and I always felt an affront to comedies that ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Beverly Hill Cops"" are listed in AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies while the laugh-riot of the year ""Top Secret!"" has been overlooked. No offense to these two classics, but by Bill Murray's own admittance, Ramis' classic leaned toward Sci-fi and special effects at the expenses of comedy during the whole third act, and ""Beverly Hills Cops"" features a cold-blooded murder at point blank on the head, for Pete's sake. For a comedy, it's quite a heavy movie but there are reasons why ""Beverly Hills Cops"" is a classic.The film features Eddie Murphy at the top of his game as a street-smart loudmouthed, foulmouthed Detroit cop, Axel Folley, who investigates (officiously, he's supposed to be in vacation) the murder of his friend, an ex-convict killed by his boss' right-hand man, played by a sinister Jonathan Banks, the bigger bad guy is an art deal but drug smuggler operating in Beverly Hills and played with the faux suaveness of a Bond bad- guy by Steven Berkoff. The comedic moments generally emerge comes from the situations when Folley, discovers the manners of Beverly Hills and the procedural of the Police Deparment. His constant arguments with Taggart (John Ashton) and Bogomil (Ronny Cox) are always entertaining, so is the way Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is always the only one to empathize with Folley, or find his jokes funny.But to be honest, the film doesn't hold up to its reputation for one simple reason, it always gets to the obvious. The plot is rather formulaic and consists on a really mean bad guy, not even likable on a vile level, who's confronted by Folley at various circumstances and who could have been easily gotten away if he didn't decide to kidnap his friend at the end, the climax is a banal shootout and doesn't leave much to the imagination. You've got to wonder why it ended up being nominated for Best Original Screenplay, even a moment that could have been the inspiration for a hilarious monologue, when Eddie Murphy checks out at the hotel, turns into a ""that's because I'm black"" shtick. Just compare that moment to the magnificent hotel lobby room sequence in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and you'll find the line between good and lazy writing.That's how the film felt, lazy, obvious and oblivious to its obviousness. I enjoyed it as far I enjoyed Eddie Murphy but if he can make a movie good, he can't carry a plot alone, this is why ""Trading Places"" and ""Coming to America"" were better, they had Dan Aykroyd, Don Ameche, Ralph Bellamy, Arsenio Hall, John Amos and James Earl Jones... ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is the Eddie Murphy show combined with a banal cop flick, it gets slightly better when it evolves toward a triangular buddy movie, so much better that you can even feel some vibes of ""Lethal Weapon"", a film that doesn't have the pretension to be a comedy, but was as enjoyable and even lighthearted as ""Beverly Hill Cop"".But after ""Lethal Weapon"" and the great chemistry between Gibson and Glover, the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" sequels sucked by comparison.Maybe the theme of the film contributed to its popularity, now that should have been nominated for an Oscar; not the screenplay. Again, Eddie Murphy is such a great presence I forgive everything but wish there was more part showcasing the differences between the Detroit and the Beverly Hills lifestyle, and more inspired bits than impersonating a homosexual or complaining of black, that felt like old stuff even by 80's standards. The film becomes better once you expect a cop movie, maybe that's how they should have label it.

It just flies by, entertaining you pretty much every step of the way.

40,CuriosityKilledShawn,A timeless classic,8,6 August 2000,"""That the film turned out to be coherent is a miracle. That it is successful proves there is a God."" -Martin Brest on his own movie.It's easy to understand his feelings when you consider the endless changes made to Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr's script. They got an Academy Award nomination, but the final product is a million miles away from what they originally conceived.Axel Foley was originally written for Mickey Rourke, then it was geared around Sylvester Stallone, who significantly rewrote the script further before abandoning the project a couple of weeks before shooting was scheduled to begin. Eddie Murphy was brought on board at the last minute, and the script was re-written yet again to form the movie we know today. Bizarrely, all of the work Stallone did on the script was recycled into his reprehensible 1986 action movie Cobra, which, on top of being nothing at all like Beverly Hills Cop, called itself an adaptation of a novel called Fair Game by Paula Gosling (which it also bore little-to-no resemblance to). Nine years later, that novel was once again made into a movie of the same name starring William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, which bore no resemblance to Cobra. When I say that Beverly Hills Cop had the biggest hodgepodge of a shooting script ever, you better believe it.The story could not get any simpler. Young renegade Detroit cop Axel Foley, forever tormenting his no-nonsense boss with his reckless antics, meets up with a childhood pal only for him to be murdered that very night. Axel follows the trail and travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy, banged-up sky-blue Chevy Nova. It's a world away from the streets of Detroit. Even the patrol cops look like soap opera actors. Axel's fast and loose work ethic, barely on the good side of the law, doesn't sit well with the Beverly Hills police department. Detectives Taggart and Rosewood (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold doing a Laurel and Hardy routine) are assigned to keep an eye on Axel as he very quickly discovers the bad guy.No twists, no surprises, and barely a couple layers deep, it's amazing that a story so superficial is able get 105 minutes of mileage. The film works thanks to Murphy's cheerful, upbeat performance and Martin Brest's ability to keep it light. Beverly Hills Cop would not have worked as a dark thriller. Harold Faltermeyer's iconic score and world-famous Axel F theme tune certainly help the happy-go-lucky nature.There are certainly shortcomings. Steven Berkoff, as Victor Maitland, is completely unconvincing as the villain. In fact, with the exception of Bennett from Commando, he's probably the least threatening/most campiest villain I've ever seen in a movie. And, as I have mentioned, the story is very straightforward. Taggart and Rosewood do virtually no police work and are just bystanders watching and reacting to Axel's hustles. Apart from one cruise along Rodeo Drive, we never really see or feel the glamor of Beverly Hills to juxtapose it next to the grime of Detroit. There are just too many interior scenes.But it never fails to entertain and is truly the highlight of Murphy's career.

41,inkblot11,"Very fun, very funny; Murphy shines brightly!",9,18 November 2018,"In Detroit, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a detective who sometimes does things his own way. This upsets his superiors quite a bit. When a supposed apprehension of a drug heist turns into a hair-raising adventure, Axel is reprimanded sharply. Shortly after, Axel is surprised to see a long-ago friend turn up at his apartment. This buddy has been living in California and tells Axel about a mutual friend who has a high class job at a Beverly Hills art gallery. But, he doesn't tell Axel he has stolen funds from the same seller until the guys come for him. The friend is killed and Axel barely survives. Unhappy with the way the investigation of Mikey's murder in Detroit is going, he asks for a vacation. He gets it. However, he is warned NOT to conduct his own detective work in Beverly Hills. Not listening, Axel goes out to CA in his somewhat junk car and gets a room at a posh hotel. Meeting up with the mutual friend, Jenny (Lisa Eilbacher), Axel learns some information about her boss that doesn't please him. He also incurs the wrath of the Beverly Hills police for ""bothering"" the art seller. This includes sergeant Taggert (John Ashton) and goofy partner, Billy (Judge Reinhold) who take to trailing Axel. At every turn, he outsmarts them, including putting a banana in their tailpipe to stop their police car. Soon, Axel really is on to something sinister about art seller Maitland (Steven Berkoff) and his gang. But, since the art man is a rich and highly respected member of the community, will anyone listen? This very fun, very funny film was one Murphy's first big movies and also one of his best. His laidback but ultrasmart turn as a Detroit cop making mincemeat of Beverly Hills finest men in blue is just priceless. Reinhold, too, is very funny and got oodles of future parts from his portrayal of dimwit but erstwhile Billy. Ashton, Ronny Cox, Berkoff and all the rest give rousing support. Naturally, the scenes from one of the country's richest communities are very fine while the script and zesty direction keeps all viewers in stitches. Yes, there's a bit of bad language and violence but mostly, there's great amusement. Therefore, keep a copy handy to keep your spirits upbeat.",Beverly Hills Cop
42,atlasmb,"Reasons Why ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Is Great Entertainment",10,12 May 2017,"""Beverly Hills Cop"", besides being a solid drama, is one of the best comedies of its time. Here are some of the reasons:1. This fish out of water story take Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) from Detroit to Beverly Hills--a significant juxtaposition that really provides opportunities for plenty of cultural incongruities that Murphy can mine. (One of the best examples is Axel's reaction to seeing two guys dressed in Michael Jackson-like attire.)2. Eddie Murphy is at his peak. He plays a fast talking, street savvy, hip and funny breaker of rules like no one else can.3. Murphy and the other actors were encouraged to improvise, and they made the dialogue much funnier. This is an essential part of the film's transformation from its original concept which was to star Sylvester Stallone.4. Axel's theme (""Axel F""), by Harold Faltermeyer, is a catchy theme that suits the main character.5. The soundtrack includes some of the most infectious melodies of the eighties, including Glenn Frey singing ""The Heat is On"", the energetic ""Neutron Dance"" by The Pointer Sisters, Patti LaBelle singing ""Stir It Up"" and ""New Attitude"", and ""Nasty Girl"" by Vanity.6. A chase that's like a demolition derby, crushing plenty of vehicles without hurting a soul.7. Two memorable villains portrayed by Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks.8. The Buddy Cop film that is within the film, featuring John Ashton (Sgt. Taggart) and Judge Reinhold (Det. Billy Rosewood) whose relationship manages to convey undertones of Laurel and Hardy. Reinhold's character is central to the film's commentary on morality vs. duty in much the same way that Murphy's character (Axel) lives by a personal code that supersedes all others.9. Bronson Pinchot's creation of the hilarious character Serge.",Beverly Hills Cop

This formulaic fish-out-of-water movie became a surprising hit, leading to multiple sequels. Although he doesn't really have any funny lines, Murphy is loud and foul-mouthed, which apparently many find hilarious. There are only a couple of scenes that are mildly amusing, courtesy of Reinhold and Ashton as straight-laced Beverly Hills cops. Cox is fine as a lieutenant, Berkoff makes a good villain, and Pinchot is funny in a brief role. Most of the situations are idiotic and the final shootout is quite ineptly staged, with bad guys wielding machine guns unable to hit open targets.",Beverly Hills Cop
44,The-Sarkologist,The movie that made Eddie Murphy a star,8,10 December 2011,"This is one of those films that I consider a classic film from my childhood. It is about a Detroit cop who goes on 'vacation' to Beverley Hills to attempt to investigate the murder of a childhood friend, despite the fact that he is not allowed to. Beside watching it again because I had not seen it in a long time, I also noted that I have reviewed the third movie, but not the first and thus decided to rectify the situation. The one thing I do like about movies is that to rewatch them does not take anywhere near as much time as it does to re-read a book.This film is hardly original: the cop that acts on instinct and is pretty much a loose cannon that gets results, and the setting of a cop going outside of his jurisdiction, and against orders, to investigate something that is personal to him. What makes this movie great is Eddie Murphy and the role he plays as a fast talking cop that is able to get what he needs simply through verbosity.One thing that stands out is how that contrast Beverley Hills with Detroit. Detroit is a dirty city with run down buildings and a busy and dilapidated police station. Beverley Hills is completely the opposite. While in Detroit you are after real criminals, the most that a Beverley Hills Cop does is to keep the peace. I note that on a number of occasions the cops are quick to arrest Foley (Eddie Murphy) and it is clear that he does not fit into this world. It is also interesting that because of the wealth and the reputation of Beverley Hills, it is almost inconceivable that its residents are criminals, at least to the police force. However, where there is money there is also corruption.The one thing that makes me raise my eyes is how Foley was intending on paying for his room at the hotel. It is clear through the movie that he cannot afford the $300US a night that they charge, and that is on top of all the added extras (such as sending food out to the cops who are watching Foley), though at the end the Beverley Hills Police end up picking up the tab (mighty generous of them, though I suspect that a lot of questions will be asked nonetheless).This is a heaps cool movie, and for those who have not seen it I would recommend watching it at least once. To me, Eddie Murphy created the fast-talking, quick witted, smiling cop (though he doesn't always play cops), and this movie is one of my favourites.",Beverly Hills Cop
45,paulclaassen,Far better than expected!,7,23 July 2021,"I must be honest, I was never interested in watching 'Beverly Hills Cop', as I was under the impression it was a slapstick comedy. Whatever made me decide to watch this, I don't know, but on the spur of the moment I opted for this movie, and I'm glad I did.I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was it actually funny (and not slapstick), it was an entertaining action movie with great stunts, good action sequences - especially the opening scene! - and darn good acting from Eddie Murphy. He was just hilarious. I loved the characters and the somewhat unusual circumstances they often found themselves in. Not only was Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, funny, but his practical jokes on colleagues were also funny.To add to this, it was a really good story. I found it interesting and fun to watch all the way. I also loved the soundtrack. You gotta love those 80s action movies! 'Beverly Hills Cop' was indeed a nice surprise.",Beverly Hills Cop
46,johnnyboyz,"Largely unexceptional farce, made watchable for the odd moment that is far removed from its meagre plot and derivative nature.",5,31 August 2013,"It is a relief that Eddie Murphy is as good as he is in Beverly Hills Cop, otherwise the film wouldn't be as tolerable as it is. Away from the jokes; the wisecracks and the sheer arrogance of the man, we sense his Axel Foley is someone tough enough to dish out a beating but equally hard enough to take one. The film isn't particularly good on its own, but had it been so unbelievable that Foley was in it for the gags before having to go through a fight because the screenplay demanded it, it would have fallen at the first hurdle. As for the rest of it, there isn't necessarily anything interesting here; it cracks along, tries too hard to impress with its second unit material and maintains an uneasy line between comedy and black drama. There can be little doubt that the film is made up of bits from others you've already seen: the revenge story that sees a tough individual traverse a distance to investigate; the eventual plot that has much to do with narcotics and the uneasy combination of black and white, of carefree and regimented in the central character pairing. The trouble is, each of these things were better when you first saw them.At the core of the picture is how a ragtag, unorthodox cop from somewhere as rough and ready as Detroit can bring a little carefree energy to the stiff procedure driven folks in Beverley Hills. A point is made early on as to how the Californian police officers cannot break their stiff routine when the chance of getting themselves out of trouble is offered for sake of a lie to a superior officer. They pass it up, preferring to take the heat for their actions if it means remaining truthful – when the time comes to establish what everybody's learnt from the exercise that is Beverley Hills Cop, it is to tell us that the stiff cops have come to embrace bluffing to the suits in charge if it means cracking the case and getting away with avoiding ramifications. How Martin Brest tells this tale is essentially in the mould of what you might get if you merged ""Get Carter"" with ""The Cannonball Run"", a revenge story about a man far from home told under a colourful umbrella of different parties out for a similar thing – each getting in each other's way and tripping over one another in the process.Beginning in Detroit, the aforementioned Foley has shown the brash initiative we will later learn is synonymous with his character in that he's decided to infiltrate a smuggling ring without authorisation. When things go wrong, he bears the brunt of his police chief but we sense Foley is suffocated by narrow-mindedness out of the fact the chief cannot see all the good work Foley was responsible for. Plus it was ultimately the untimely appearance of a squad car which blew the operation. From here, we get a brief taste of what life in Detroit is like for those occupying it; the film in no hurry and refusing to play its hand. People live rough, they swear; they occupy sleazy pool halls and make stupid bets on one's ability to pull off trick shots – one person is even gunned down in cold blood. In spite of this, Brest doesn't want to gross the audience out too much; there remains, throughout, a distinctly fruity atmosphere of fun and frolics. This is not a film directed particularly well, but often its dialogue and willingness to crack on with things it knows are not particularly smart in that B-movie way.About that instance of someone being gunned down in cold blood: it ends up being the film's catalyst out of the fact it was a friend of Foley's who had come over from Beverley Hills to visit him. Unfortunately, he had brought too much of something else with him and incurred the wrath of a hit-man. Distraught, Foley takes time off work but is warned by his chief of treading too close to his usual ways of playing the lone-wolf and hunting for the perpetrators of the killing. Thus, the titular Beverley Hills Cop is born when he heads over there in his raggedy car to investigate a name his former friend mentioned. What unfolds is not so much a detective story per se, but a series of scenes based upon the fact Foley already knows who's guilty – he just needs to work backwards from the right answer and land something on the antagonist guilty of some seriously amoral stuff in a world where affluence can buy you into rarefied circles free of accusation. Steven Berkoff fills this void and does so with a slimy relish, amply supported by a doughy eyed second-in-command thug assassin.Away from the case, the film must flesh itself out with a series of scenes depicting the police force of the area questioning Foley, while the scenes that play out wherein Foley just doesn't seem to belong in Beverly Hills are done so with a sort of confident relish that just feels heavy. The fact of the matter is, Foley is not a fish out of water beyond the racial and class distinctions; he is a police officer mixing with other police officers striking us as someone following up on leads the locals cannot bring themselves to fathom for the fact the suspect is who it is. The stubbornness of the locals in this regard is so hard to break down, that the film must resort to the villain engaging in a straight-up case of kidnapping so as to prolong a police presence for the final shootout. Where by no means a disaster, the film didn't do an awful lot for me beyond individual bits and pieces that were often as good as they were out of Murphy's delivery. In the long run, this is fairly poor: a middling-to-bad effort.",Beverly Hills Cop

It's sort of its own classic genre and it's epitomized by ""Beverly Hills Cop."" The movie is nothing near sensational, especially considering how the genre has transformed simply by virtue of technology, but it has a niche near and dear to the hearts of many.Eddie Murphy stars as Axel Foley, a detective for the Detroit PD with a knack for doing things the theatrical and brash way. After getting an earful from his boss, a friend is killed and Foley decides to investigate his friends' case (despite warnings from his boss), which will take him to Beverly Hills where he gets caught up in some drug pushing. He also has a couple of LAPD guys on his tail making sure he stays out of trouble, which of course he doesn't. In fact, he ropes the two of them into it.Murphy is far and away the best part the movie. His lines are well written as he plays this foul-mouthed troublemaker that always keeps the moment awkward with a tone of voice and jokes that completely don't fit the situation. The rest of the cast is pretty much garbage. A few good roles here and there, but the acting is mostly forgettable.The story isn't too important. It just sets up situations for Foley to be the rule-breaking, crazy cop who never learns but always comes out on top. It also sets up some neat chase/action sequences, which consists of the film crew driving trucks like wrecking balls down a street full of cars and bashing everything in sight.The film also makes itself a very clear tribute to the grooves of the 80s, many times when those songs are completely out of place. The film's iconic synthesized theme works, but the rest of the song choices add too much of a playful, not-serious tone for a film that does try to be a crime drama in ways.""Beverly Hills Cop"" is certainly the antidote for a case of ""haven't seen enough 80s action movies lately,"" but other than that it's just a plain cop drama with an interesting main character.",Beverly Hills Cop
50,Anonymous_Maxine,Funniest combination of bananas and tail pipes in cinematic history...!,9,11 November 2004,"Beverly Hills Cop is by far Eddie Murphy's most popular role, and the movie that officially launched his career as a genuine movie star. It was one of those movies that my dad would let my brother and I watch on weekends, after my mom made him promise not to show us any rated R movies, and over the years it's easy to forget the level of violence and profanity in it that earned it that forbidding rating. Of course, as a kid I was just excited that I was getting to see something that I shouldn't, but in retrospect I tend to think that it was this combination of clever comedy and the ingredients from harder action thrillers that ensured Beverly Hills Cop's status as a cop comedy classic. You see, Foley has a bit of a criminal past of his own, but he is clearly much more at home on the right side of the law, and he uses his experiences in crime to his advantage in working his way into the criminal underworld, where he routinely attempts to bring down major crime ring kingpins. One day an old friend comes to visit him after having been released from prison and spending some time relaxing in the California sun. The two have a great time at the bar recounting their old criminal days together, until we learn that this guy, who once took the fall for one of Axel's crimes and served prison time for him without ever mentioning his name, now has stolen bearer bonds with him worth millions. Before long the owner of the bonds shows up and is not in a reminiscent mood. Axel is knocked out as they're staggering back to his apartment for the night, and he wakes up to find his friend murdered.The movie follows one of the biggest 1980s action movie clichés to the letter. Every single line is here, 'take some time off,' 'stay away from this case,' 'if you go after this guy don't bother calling in on Monday,' etc. My eyes tend to glaze over whenever I hear this situation in a movie, probably because I work so much and in such situations can only think of how great it would be if my bosses told me to take some time off, go on vacation, don't let them catch me working or they'll fire me. But Foley's trip to Beverly Hills to perform his own investigation yields results so promising that it keeps the movie moving along at a pretty fast pace. Of course we realize the real life odds of a police officer traveling to the other side of the country and immediately stumbling across the major crime organization that he's looking for, but Murphy's quick-talking wit and street-wise charm makes it pretty easy to root for him. The movie has the perfect premise to combine with Murphy's personality – he's an urban cop from Detroit named Axel Foley who is always driving his boss insane because he doesn't wait for piddly things like authorization when he wants to do major undercover work. The movie opens with one of these undercover and under the radar missions, which culminates in the police being called and then a major car chase through city and residential streets that must have caused millions of dollars in damage. Of course, when the cops have Axel at gunpoint, he gives them a grin and they shake their heads and lower their guns. Aw shucks, it's that crazy Foley again!Judge Reinhold and John Ashton play Detectives Rosewood and Taggart, two of Beverly Hillss finest who are assigned to keep an eye on Foley and make sure he doesn't start doing police work while a dozen states or so outside his jurisdiction, from which he's suspended anyway. So Foley moves around among the Ferraris and BMWs and Mercedeses of Beverly Hills in his ancient, beat up Chevy Nova, cheerfully laughing at Taggart's and Rosewood's bumbling efforts to tail him and doing his investigation right under their noses. In the standard buddy cop movie sitcom, you have two wildly different people thrown together in a police partnership situation and forced to work together. This was a staple of the 1980s and has remained popular to this day, with classic movies like Lethal Weapon, Tango & Cash, 48 hours (one of Murphy's own earlier comedies), Red Heat, Rush Hour (could two cops ever be more different than Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan?), and possibly my favorite, Hot Fuzz. And of course I shouldn't forget Bad Boys, which may very well have so much in common with Beverly Hills Cop as to warrant suspicion of plagiarism. I'll let it go though. I'm sure Eddie Murphy doesn't mind. Anyway, Beverly Hills Cop does follow all of the basic rules of your standard buddy cop movie, but somehow manages to avoid feeling like a formula film. The combination of Axel's determination to avenge his friend's murder is juxtaposed with hilarious situations involving Taggart and Rosewood trying in vain to keep an eye on him, as well as various police organizations tearing their hair out trying to keep him under control. Picture the police chief in Last Action Hero, a bad movie for which I maintain a certain affection, and make him intelligible and add a lot of profanity and you'll get some idea of what's going on here. I don't know that Beverly Hills Cop can quite be called a comedy classic, but it is definitely an action comedy classic.Also keep your eye out for the hilarious cameo from Bronson Pinchot, who you may remember as Balki from Perfect Strangers! Eleventh best TV show ever!",Beverly Hills Cop

53,jzappa,"""Is this the gentleman who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?""",10,25 May 2010,"Beverly Hills Cop is among the top of my ""populist"" list of favorites, meaning movies made to please Friday night moviegoers and renters more than the refined tastes of critics. A big part of why I love this movie is because I grew up on it. I loved Eddie Murphy as a kid. Whether he's a brilliant actor or not, or whether or not the majority of his movies are very good, he has an energy completely apart from a movie itself. He's simply Eddie, in the face of whatever his ""characters""' adversities are. But this isn't the reason I still love this movie as an adult. Watching now, I'm seeing a sharply written fish-out-of-water story---a clever insight into how a character behaves out of his element---masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster star vehicle.It opens with a way-over-the-top chase between a huge semi-truck and various Keystone-like squadcars, which would be exciting if it didn't function primarily as a Pointer Sisters music video. Neutron Dance is the foreground of this set-piece, not the imagery it's scoring. We're dancing in our seats instead of gripping them. Still, the film's beginning is also drenching us in the utter grittiness of urban Detroit. While also essentially a music video for The Heat is On, the opening credits sequence is comprised of naturalistic, documentary street scenes of real people, housing developments, smokestacks, etc. At the same time the film-making is glitzy and commercial with its soundtrack and obligatory set-pieces, it's truly impressive how it absorbs us in one environment and then, by the end, has completely entrenched us in another one worlds apart.We meet Axel in action, in character undercover, wearing a smart-ass shell when he shows his face at the station after such a disaster, following in the tradition of reckless cops winning scorn from their superiors, in this case a scene-stealing performance by Gil Hill as his no-nonsense boss Inspector Todd. We then see Axel take in a surprise visit from his childhood friend Mikey, who's broken into his apartment, raided his fridge, proceeding to show him some suspicious bearer bonds. Axel doesn't care, doesn't want to know, just happy to see his old pal. We learn that Axel wasn't always into serving and protecting, and although Mikey now has a job as a security guard out in Beverly Hills, Mikey still isn't. This is the reason the night doesn't end so well for Mikey, as well as why Axel finds himself conning his way through Beverly Hills, ostensibly on vacation but really working as an effective cop with the instincts of a street-smart criminal.This is very funny, because essentially the movie's premise is composed of a foul-mouthed inner-city cop showing clean-cut, by-the-book veterans how to catch a killer. We know who had Mikey snuffed as soon as we're introduced to him, which is correct, because what the movie's all about is how the strict bureaucracy and elite judicial system protect the biggest criminals. The culprit here is Victor Maitland, a sophisticated millionaire, one of the most respected art dealers in the country. He's also involved in a complex smuggling operation and ordering hits on little people who take more than they earn just as he does, like Mikey, and gets away with it because Beverly Hills' finest, the customs house, his manufacturers, all do just what they're told, nothing more. The more time we spend with Axel in Beverly Hills, the more we realize the cultural inducements that allow Maitland the luxury of being above even ballpark suspicion. Whenever/however Axel follows his detective instincts to Maitland, he's breaking rules, charged with felonies, in positions where he must fool everybody, until finally the Beverly Hills police are so jarred from their robotic procedure, and of course inclined to think like detectives, that reason takes over: Why would this exotic cop, this ""foul-mouthed jerk from outta town"" be so persistent at all this if he didn't have reason to believe something's really up?Indeed, the movie doesn't paint Axel's unlikely cohorts as mean, ignorant, snobbish. We love these guys. In their own contrasting way, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as Taggart and Rosewood are equally funny, perhaps even more so in some scenes, as Murphy is as Foley. And they're better than he is at adopting the gravity of less comical scenes, which makes their Laurel and Hardy relationship more complex and inspired. At any rate, these three are responsible for improvising much of their dialogue, even creating whole scenes, like the ""supercop"" bit, the red-meat-in-the-bowels, bringing an inimitable chemistry to their trio. While Ronny Cox is awesome in sinister roles like in RoboCop, he plays Lieutenant Bogomil not as an uptight jerk of a superior, just firm about enforcing regulations; he's got a boss too, and hangs his head and sucks up in his presence like Taggart and Rosewood do in his.And as I said, it's great on a pure entertainment level. There are actually lots of great bit performances. There's Bronson Pinchot's memorable Serge, an effeminate European art salesman, basically the first person Axel meets in Beverly Hills. Murphy's subdued reaction to Pinchot is correct. A Martin Lawrence or Chris Tucker would've probably submerged the scene in some bombastic repulsion, but Murphy's persona in its heyday was much more graceful and well-timed than that. There's also the great veteran character actor Jonathan Banks as Maitland's thug, so matter-of-fact and stone-cold, especially when he pulls the trigger on Mikey. Oh, and Paul Reiser as the fly buzzing around Axel early on at the Detroit precinct. And the soundtrack, including obviously the immortal Faltermeyer synth melody, does give the movie an upbeat energy, though I do have my complaints. It's a real movie about the underdog in the rich man's world, and a ceaselessly entertaining one.",Beverly Hills Cop

When he was done in that chase involving a semi, his friend Mickey(James Russo) drops by, and they have a good time. Then after the fun they have, Axel gets jumped, and Mickey gets capped. Beverly Hills is a culture shock for Foley, since he lives the simple life, the high life is not a challenge to Foley. When he meets two BH detectives(Judge Reinhold, John Ashton), Foley is the ultimate charmer. In Beverly Hills, he did have an old friend of Mickey's, Jenny Summers(Lisa Eilbacher), they have relived some of the good times, when Foley's in town. Even though Foley's antics have annoyed the police department, his skills are never denied by anyone he meets. The funny scenes are when he choked the car with bananas, and he fends off the would-be robbers at a strip-club. Rosewood and Taggert quickly bonded with Foley, even he helps save Jenny from her boss, Maitland(Stephen Berkoff). No fights crime better than Axel Foley, and no place has more class than Beverly Hills. The music soundtrack, the action, and the plots were all there, and it's never a dull moment.

58,bsmith5552,Motor Mouth at the Top of His Game!,8,4 April 2019,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is one of star Eddie Murphy's best films made when he was at the top of his game in the eighties. It's about a Detroit cop who goes to Beverly Hill s to solve the murder of his best friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo).The film opens in Detroit with Detective Axel Foley (Murphy) working under cover in a cigarette smuggling operation. He is caught up in a spectacular chase sequence involving a large semi careening through the streets smashing parked cars along the way. Back at the station house, Foley's boss Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill - a real cop) chews him out. When Foley returns home he is greeted by best friend Mikey Tandino who has been working in Beverly Hills.Mikey has with him some German bearer bonds which he took from his boss Victor Maitland (Steven Berko) Maitland sends Zack (Jonathon Banks to Detroit to retrieve the bonds and deal with Mikey. Zack and cronies murder Mikey and leave Axel unconscious on his doorstep. When
Foley recovers he vows to track down Mikey's killer. Insp. Todd takes him off the case and warns him not to interfere..Foley takes vacation time and goes to Beverly hills in his beat up Chevy Nova.
There, he meets Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) an old friend and learns that Mikey had been working for Victor Maitland. He goes to see Maitland but is tossed through a front door window for his trouble. The Beverly Hills police arrest him and charge him with public mischief and carrying a concealed weapon. Jenny bails him out but Lt. Bogomil (Ronny Cox) assigns two of his detectives Taggart (John Ashton) and the young Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold to watch Foley. Then the fun starts.Foley with the help of Jenny gains access to Maitland's warehouse and discovers that he is running drugs. Unable to convince Lt. Bogomil that Maitland is a drug smuggler, Foley enlists the reluctant help of Taggart and Rosewood in bringing down the drug lord. They break into Maitland's home and.........................................................................................Much of the humor in the movie stems from Murphy's frequent ad libs which continually broke up the cast and crew. There was great chemistry between the star and supporting cast. There was also great chemistry between John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as well as Ronny Cox as the cops. Watch for a delightful cameo by Bronson Pinchot as Serge a worker at Eilbacker's art gallery.Hard to imagine Sylvester Stallone who was originally cast as the lead in this scenario.

I mean, it would have been Cobra bad.Instead, they got Eddie Murphy to do it and.... I don't know, it's worth it for the ""Super Cop"" speech alone. I mean, you can clearly see the people around him trying their absolute best not to laugh. At least you notice it when you've watched it enough where you're not busy laughing.And... yet... it's really still an 80s cop action movie... but a funny 80s cop action movie.With anyone else, it WOULD have been a throw away 80s action flick, one that was maybe OK, but not Lethal Weapon good. But, they cast Murphy in the role, and that casting choice made it a classic, it made it a pleasure to watch, it made it ore than the movie could have been.It's one of those movies that you never pass up when it's on, Oh? Beverly Hills Cop is on? Suddenly you have nothing that is so important that you can't stop and watch it.",Beverly Hills Cop
60,dee.reid,Classic Eddie Murphy,10,19 October 2001,"In 1984, Eddie Murphy took on probably the best role of his career.  His name was Axel Foley.  Axel Foley is a Detroit police officer who goes to Beverly Hills, California to find the men who killed his best friend.  When he gets to Beverly Hills, he finds that the law there is a lot stricter than it is Detroit.  As Lieutenant Bogomil(Ronny Cox) says,""Here in Beverly Hills, we do everything by the book.""  So Axel goes about finding the crooks his own way.  His investigation leads him to Victor Maitland(Steven Berkoff), a shady art dealer with possible drug connections.  So to help out Axel with his investigation, two detectives are assigned to watch him in case he gets into trouble.  They are Sergeant Taggart(John Ashton) and Detective Rosewood(Judge Reinhold), probably one of the best comic duos in comedy history.  Beverly Hills Cop is probably Eddie Murphy's best film role to date.  I'm surprised he did not win his Golden Globe nomination for his performance.  I mean Beverly Hills Cop is filled with some of the funniest and most profanity-laden dialogue in film history.  There are so many classic action scenes and jokes as well, such as the cop-truck chase in the beginning and the banana-in-the-tailpipe gag.  My personal favorite scene is the locker room scene where Axel's boss (Gilbert R. Hill) walks in begins his barrage of f-words.  Special praise should go to director Martin Brest for keeping the action tight and jokes funny.  Brest directed another action-comedy flick during the 80's, with Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in Midnight Run in 1988.Beverly Hills Cop gets a 10/10",Beverly Hills Cop

62,jimbo-53-186511,The heat is (mostly) on,7,26 February 2020,"Detroit cop Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) receives a visit from his friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo) who tells him that he has been working in Beverly Hills with another old friend of Axel's Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher). A short while later Tandino is killed by a couple of heavies. After his friend's death, Axel's boss suggests that he takes a vacation, but Axel sees this as a working holiday and heads to Beverly Hills to track down Victor Maitland (the boss of both Jenny and Mikey) who he believes may be responsible for organising Mikey's murder...With the opening credits proudly displaying the words 'Eddie Murphy Productions' then I'm sure some cynics may dismiss this as a vanity project and little more than an excuse for Murphy to show-off. Whilst it's possibly a little guilty on both fronts, Beverly Hills Cop still remains a fairly enjoyable film...Naturally, a lot of the film's success is down to Murphy who delivers a lot of his dialogue in what would become his trademark wisecracking, rapid fire manner. Once again it is actually Murphy's energy that is the main selling point in this film - like many of his film (particularly in the 80's) he's so flamboyant that it's nigh on impossible to ignore him.In some ways, it's fortunate that Murphy is as good as he is here, because the story is only so-so and once again Beverly Hills Cop is an example of a film where the story almost takes a backseat to everything else around it. In fact, it is actually when the film becomes more serious and focusses on the main plot where the film suffers slightly (not because it is bad, but it's just a little generic to really hold any kind of vested interest in).Aside from Murphy, the cast are still mostly good; Reinhold and Ashton as the reluctant foils for Murphy are an excellent double act, but I think particular praise should go to Reinhold whose wide-eyed naïve performance was believable and entertaining to watch which to me was a case of near perfect casting. Ronny Cox is solid and Berkoff actually made for a semi-decent villain (he isn't hammy like he has been in other films) and puts in a nice understated performance here. The only weak link lay with Eilbacher who I felt was a bit wooden and didn't seem to quite gel with the film like everything one else did.Despite not providing a great story, Beverley Hills Cop is energetic, amusing and competently directed (Brest deserves credit because despite working from a generic script he does ensure that there are no dull spots). It also goes to prove that Murphy could sell anything when he was at the top of his game and Beverly Hills Cop is very much a case in point.",Beverly Hills Cop

I grew up watching his films on video & he always made me laugh so much, i used to watch the Beverly Hills Cop Trilogy, Trading Places, Coming to America, The Golden Child, Metro, both 48 hrs films, The Nutty Professor & Doctor Doolittle over & over again. Eddie Murphy had a huge impact on me growing up, i loved his sick & witty humour & his energy & his big smile, Eddie Murphy made me feel like you could have so much fun in life, even at the darkest of times!!!
I wanted to be like Him but of course real life is tough & its often hard to smile when life is dark but hey that's why movies are great, because they help you escape into their fantasy worlds & escapism i loved.
I get very Nostalgic when i think about Eddie Murphy & especially thinking about his Beverley Hills Cop Trilogy, i can still picture them singularly on video with that Awesome artwork. Good memories.Anyway yes Eddie Murphy in movies means alot to me, alot like how also Will Smith, Dan Aykroyd & Schwarzenegger do too, when you grew up watching certain Actors all the time on video, you feel kind of a connection to them.The first instance Classic, ""Beverley Hills Cop"" is one of Eddie Murphy's best & most beloved movies of all time!!!
Here we get Murphy on fire, here he's smart mouthed & witty as hell as he plays his most iconic role as Detective Axel Foley from Detroit, who goes to cause havoc in sunny Beverley Hills to track down his friends killer. This movie is a blast of hilarious situations & brutal violent action scenes with a class cast with Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood & John Ashton as Sgt. Taggart, both legends in this film & make up the funny trio of cops on the killer's case.
There's lovely scenery & nice cinematography as this was a big production but still has it's tough & gritty moments too.
Also the great Ronny Cox is funny as Lt. Bogomil & there's Jonathan Banks as evil Zack & Steven Berkoff as main villain, Victor Maitland so it's a great cast. The theme music is legendary now as we know & gets me so Nostalgic whenever i hear it.Beverley Hills Cop & it's sequels are Classic films that mean alot to people who grew up watching them & Eddie Murphy was a hero to us too!!!

66,slokes,Eddie Vidi Vici,9,28 September 2005,"Eddie Murphy gave the 1980s its first fresh film star in this clever action-comedy, a fun-filled time capsule for all that was best about the decade of narrow ties and big hair. ""Beverly Hills Cop"" remains Murphy's sturdiest, funniest vehicle, a rare classic of its genre that even two weak-minded sequels can't cloud over.In Detroit, police detective Axel Foley (Murphy) loses a friend to a hit he believes had something to do with business the friend had in Beverly Hills. Apparently too poor for airfare, Foley drives to California in his beat-up Chevy Nova and pokes around, earning the ire of a sinister art dealer as well as the Beverly Hills police. Shrugging off assorted butt-kickings and improvising like a madman, Foley begins learning art isn't the only thing Victor Maitland is dealing, while winning over two Beverly Hills officers who learn to trust Foley's instincts, and maybe in the process, their own.The film wasn't written initially with Murphy in mind, and there's some awkwardness with that. For example, it's clear from the DVD extras if not the film itself that the lead female character, Maitland's employee and Foley's friend Jenny (beautiful Lisa Eilbacher) was intended to play Foley's love interest when Foley was to be played by Sly Stallone. When Foley turned into a black guy, white Jenny became just a friend.Though it's hard not to think the producers got cold feet because of the interracial love angle, it's easy to forgive because the film is better off without the obligatory romance. Instead, the movie fleshes out the more interesting relationship between Foley and the two Beverly Hills cops, Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Murphy shines throughout the film, but he's a supernova in the presence of Taggart and Rosewood, both great foils in different, complementary ways. Hardcase Taggart glowers, while the kind and naive Rosewood is won over by Foley's amiable gamesmanship. Even after Foley sticks bananas in his car's tailpipe, a move that costs the two cops a day's pay, Rosewood offers heartfelt thanks for the sandwich Foley sent him as a distraction ploy.Another film would have played Rosewood and Taggart as the uptight white guys trying and failing to crush Foley's groove, but ""Beverly Hills Cop"" brings them in and gives you another reason to like Foley beyond his Bugs Bunny antics. We warm to Taggart, for example, even before he warms to Foley because of his stubborn, eyes-open loyalty to his goofy partner Rosewood.So the script has depth, but a shiny surface, too, augmented by many quotable wisecracks, at least in adult company. Most are Foley's lines (""Can you put this in a good spot? 'Cause all of this *stuff* happened the last time I parked here."" ""I might as well just call it 'Michael Jackson Can Sit On Top of the World Just As Long As He Doesn't Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel 'Cause There's No *African Americans* Allowed in There!'"") but even Maitland gets off a good one in his creepy English voice: ""Careful, old boy, you might hit me.""What else is there? Everything! Start with that terrific score, the '80s equivalent of ""Saturday Night Fever"" in its front-to-back pop quality. There's standout performances everywhere, by people like Stephen Elliot and Jonathan Banks (a heavy here, though he plays a heroic cop in Murphy's previous action comedy, ""48 Hours."") Bronson Pinchot's affectedly exotic art gallery employee makes an indelible impression in just two scenes, critiquing a fellow employee's unbuttoned shirt with the line: ""Vot ees deat? Deat ees not sexy."" I even love the sunny sheen of this film, which came to represent everything California was supposed to be when I first saw it back in the day. The Armani suits and coiffed blond hair carry a sense of style every bit as integral to ""Beverly Hills Cop"" as dusters and spurs are to Sergio Leone westerns.No, the mystery isn't much of a mystery, and there are flaws. Maitland's guards obviously took their marksman lessons from Darth Vader's stormtroopers, and everything seems to happen too easily for Foley. But all this is easy to ignore, whether you are watching this for the first or fourteenth time, because Murphy has you rooting for him all the way through. Even if he never did a film this good again, and he's been in some decent ones, Murphy created a centerpiece moment in his career that still shines on.",Beverly Hills Cop

68,aidanratesmovies,Classic Fun,10,12 June 2021,"At times it may take style over substance, but despite its more artificial moments, Beverly Hills Cop is a fun and timeless action comedy that proves to be entertaining every step of the way. I've loved this film for quite some time, and although it's not my favorite Eddie Murphy movie, it most certainly is one of my favorite roles for him- if not my most favorite. Axel Foley is just the perfect role for Eddie Murphy, cause you can both care and laugh with his ambitious recklessness along the way, and simply without Murphy's charisma the film would not work. The cinematography is bright and fun, a very signature 80's point of view, but it keeps the audience engaged throughout despite its more filler like shots. The villain can be a bit generic, but it's fun to see Murphy's interactions with him and his gang, and exciting to see the final few scenes play out. In the end, Beverly Hills Cop may not be perfect, but it is an essential and incredibly fun little 80's action comedy that will always live rent free in my mind no matter what I do.My Rating: 9.5/10.",Beverly Hills Cop

One is the rawness of Eddie Murphy . He was young , up and coming and fresh and he was funny , unlike in later years.
Secondly it's the iconic Harold Faltermeyer score . The music IS the film and quite frankly wouldn't be the same without it .
There are also some brilliant 80's songs from Glenn Frey , The Pointer Sisters , Patti LaBelle and Junior that remind me of my teenage years.The story is nothing special. It doesn't have to be , because this is all about Axel Foley and his relationship with the Beverly Hills cops .
It's good to to see a young Jonathan Banks . I didn't recognise him at first because he looks so different from the Breaking Bad Banks.
Steven Berkoff is a brilliant bad guy as well , but is out staged by other members of the cast in this .I'm interested to see if the sequel stands up as well to this .",Beverly Hills Cop

71,PredragReviews,The Heat Is On!,9,13 June 2016,"Definitely of its time, Beverly Hills Cop is full of wisecracks and 80's/90's pop tunes mixed rather high. In terms of comedy or seriousness, it's neither fish nor fowl. One minute Axel Foley is having his hotel deliver a late lunch to cops that tried to covertly follow him and are staking out the hotel, whereas some time beforehand, and some time later, people are being filled with holes. It's definitely a popcorn cop movie overall, but with serious moments.Eddie Murphy makes a thoroughly likable lead, and his disrespect for procedure contrasts nicely with the buttoned-up procedural processes of the local police department, and I think the film also makes a nice contrast between the opening in Detroit that makes the city look distinctly 3rd world, and the plastic peachiness of California, where even the crooks have mansions (sorry, I meant ""as usual""). Although Murphy takes an obvious lead (I can't imagine how the originally-cast Sylvester Stallone would have handled it), the film is carried by the ensemble cast without whom this would have gone nowhere. The script changes made between the Stallone original and the Murphy final have incongruities in how a mean streets Detroit cop has the connections he has (and the name he has, and the brother he no longer has (see the extras for an explanation of that!)) but the whole thing was pretty likable, so this can be overlooked.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Beverly Hills Cop
72,eric262003,The Heat Is On!,8,2 September 2013,"I first saw ""Beverly Hills Cop"" when i was an adolescent and that was a very long time time ago. I haven't seen it in decades until now. I can't believe how actors change their form of comedy over the years. And Eddie Murphy truly defines that. He used to be bold, raunchy and didn't give a crap about being image conscious like our society has become. Here in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" he just dominated his way through bar-none. From the opening scene where goes undercover selling cigarettes to some rather shady dudes to the engaging finale, Murphy sells his character without any real effort. Even though he's very funny, there are moments where falters on being way too serious. Yes every time I see this movie it brings a tear to my eyes. And the reason for that is I know Murphy can still provide solid comedy but all he does know is little kiddie film like ""Daddy Day Care"", ""Pluto Nash"", and ""Norbit"".Axel Foley (Murphy) is a cop from Detroit who is a man of great potential, but his weakness is that he is very aggressive. He has all the right tools to be a cop, He is smart, dedicated to his job, but he is also very headstrong. Behind his superior's back he arranges undercover busts,which makes him not a model employee. One day a chum from his past pays him a visit. When they arrive at Foley's apartment, two thugs attacked him knocking Foley out and killing his best friend. The two thugs are professional hit men. Foley was demanded by his boss to stay away from the case and ventures off to Beverly Hills where he takes some time off from police duty. His friend last took a job in Beverly Hills and this is where Foley has an epiphany that his friend's boss may have been a conspirator behind his murder. Foley encounters some cops from Beverly Hills and the action and comedy gets underway.Overall, this movie is nothing more than just kicking back and enjoying the memorable ride. The slapstick factor is proved quite effective and the action is quite effective. But the highlight of the night is when Axel talks trash and boy does he ever throughout the 1 hour and forty-five minute duration. The dialogue is easily funny, but also at the same time it is sharp and the dialogue is quite intelligent. The music is quite fitting for the time period even though it is dated by today's standards. Director Martin Brest's formula was proved successful.For a 105 minute film, this movie flows at pace faster than a blink of an eye. It's just an above average action comedy cop movie.People who have followed Eddie Murphy since the early 1980's are familiar with the type of comedy that Murphy was at the time famous for. To the people who only remember Eddie Murphy for kid-friendly fluff like ""Haunted Mansion,"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"" will be shocked that the Eddie Murphy they know now used to make more edgier films and never cared about being image conscious. I have always had respect for Eddie Murphy, but I liked him better when he starred in movies like ""Beverly Hills Cop"".",Beverly Hills Cop

The opening road train chase and the string of stunts that open the film attest to that.As trite as it might seem putting a brash young black guy in among a bunch of stiff shirt by-the-book cops works, especially when the black guy is Eddie Murphy at the height of his comedic powers and the stiff white guys always remember to look suitably shocked and appalled (something they just forgot to do with BHC3, where's the fun in being mildly obnoxious if no-one is there to be offended?).The original Beverly Hills Cop boasts a soundtrack that can lay claim to being one of the strongest in living memory – with a few songs that still hold up almost 3 decades later – and an immediately catchy and timeless theme song entitled Axel F.Even the cops are perfect for the film, Rosewood is the keen young pup who admires Axel even though he knows he could never be him, Taggert is the wizened vet who thinks he's seen it all and can't wait for Foley to trip and fall on his face, and Bogomil is the department head who just doesn't want it to happen on his watch.Unlike the earlier Murphy vehicle Trading Places (so-so) Beverly Hills Cop remains rooted in reality as Axel and the initially reluctant Beverly Hills Police officers ordered to accompany him on his many jaunts, Taggert and Rosewood, swear, shoot and bull their way across the city in search of Axel's buddies' killer(s).Beverly Hills Cop is a perfect blend of action, comedy and story that sadly seems so hard to replicate today. They could try to remake this a hundred times and not make anything near as good.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. This isn't one of the best films of all time, but it is an extremely well made and efficient action comedy, and in Axel Foley it does manage to create one of the best characters of all time.",Beverly Hills Cop
80,Sirus_the_Virus,Sylvester Stallone couldn't have done this.,10,26 October 2009,"Apparently, Sylvester Stallone was supposed to play Axel Foley in the great movie Beverly hills cop. Luckily, he didn't. Luckily, we didn't. Instead we got who used to be a comedic genius, not as much anymore but I believe he is somewhere, Eddie Murphey. Giving the best performance of his career. Eddie Murphey is a great actor. He is great even doing the voice of somebody(hence...Shrek). Beverly hills cop is probably his best comedy he has done. Forget The Nutty professor and Bowfinger, this is his best. This is a very short review for a very good film. It is kind of like with Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler. Nicolas Cage was supposed to play his part. Thank God he didn't. I like Nicolas Cage, but he couldn't have done as well as Mickey Rourke. Same thing with Sylvester Stallone. He couldn't have done better than Eddie Murphey. At a time, nobody could.",Beverly Hills Cop

82,brchthethird,Eddie Murphy's defining career moment,8,14 November 2014,"Yet another early comedic hit from Eddie Murphy. The movie is more subtly funny than his other movies I've seen (like TRADING PLACES), but the humor is just as good. The only bit that felt out of place/awkward was a cameo by Damon Wayans playing a stereotypically gay man. The plot is mostly straightforward: Eddie Murphy's best friend gets shot and he goes to Beverly Hills to investigate, but what makes this movie great is the interactions between Eddie Murphy and all of the people he meets, which serve as straight men/comic foils to his laid-back, joking persona. If I had one major quibble with the movie though, it's the lack of a charismatic villain, but the banter between the main characters easily overcomes it. There's even some spectacular action scenes. Two that stood out to me was the opening chase scene and the final shootout, which were intense and excellently shot. Anyway, I'm enjoying playing catchup on 80's action/comedies, and this is yet another excellent addition to my ""watched"" list.",Beverly Hills Cop
83,thekarmicnomad,Revisit in 2020 after 20+ years.,8,19 June 2020,"I have reached that age where I have become too grumpy to truly enjoy new movies.
So I am spiraling down through my (mostly unopened) blu ray library.After about 25 years since I last saw this I was wondering how it had aged.Surprisingly well!It is still funny and there is still enough action - I had actually forgot how good car chases can be without a CGI crutch.
Sure lots of the things that were new in this movie are now total cliché but it still felt fresh enough to me.The story is really simple and when you break it down not a great deal happens but the glare coming off Eddie Murphy's personality easily distracts from this.My view is completely colored by nostalgia so you probably shouldn't trust this review if you are new to this.
But if you are wondering if you should dust off your BluRay/DVD/VHS edition then I would say yes!I guarantee you will find yourself returning to the same questions you had 20 years ago like:
Did people in LA really wear red leather jumpsuits?
Why did the bad guys stop just to unload that box?
Can you really disable a car with a banana-in-the-tail-pipe?",Beverly Hills Cop
84,Stampsfightclub,engaging crime comedy worth watching,9,18 January 2007,"Eddie Murphy (Lethal Weapon) stars as slick cop Axel Foley who is out for revenge after the death of an old friend. He travels to the luxury area of Beverly Hills to find his friend's murderers and through the slick acting; the funny tale and fast energetic plot older audiences can appreciate a unique cop comedy. It's a great story about one cop and his pride to do the right thing for himself and his late friend. Murphy is sensational as the elegant energetic cop, not listening to anyone and preferring to do things the hard way by himself, his character is great and a real joy to watch.The story is fast flowing right from the van chase at the beginning to another chase towards the end. It conforms beautifully to the crime genre to focus upon the cop's life and his fellow companions in Detroit and Beverly Hills. The juxtaposition of Judge Reinhold and John Ashton was great, an enjoyable cop pairing which worked wonders with Murphy making the occasional mockery of the pair of them in the background.There are many twists in the plot and caged mystery which keeps audiences glued to the screen.It was interesting watching the different methods of crime and cop life in the different states. The rough brutal portrayed life in Detroit to a more sophisticated professional crime life in Beverly Hills. The change was enjoyable to watch as Foley didn't adjust to the changes but lived as he normally did, which conformed to the comedy genre as he acted in a way he shouldn't in a different community.The jokes are funny throughout with Murphy the obvious comedian, making audiences laugh with cocky jokes as well as his facial expressions and other means of physical humour. Steven Berkoff makes a great villain in this story. His tone of voice and facial expressions are worth notice as he portrays such a cleverly disguised vindictive character to make the plot intense but also elegant and sophisticated. worth watching just for Murphy's brilliance but the energetic engaging plot make it a sensation cop comedy",Beverly Hills Cop
85,ivo-cobra8,Beverly Hills Cop is the best classic Action comedy film from the 80's,10,16 October 2015,"Beverly Hills Cop (1984) is my favorite childhood movie. It is one of the best Action Films in the 80's I have seen. I don't care if it is written comedy in the genre. It is humor in this film but I am considering as a classic Action Film. It is definitely Eddie Murphy's best film. Film about Beverly Hills Cop and Cobra will not be today Action films like are this. I am really disappointed with how action films are turning today. Beverly hills Cop is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish and I will never get tired of it. I love this movie to death. Great job reviewing one of the best classic action films ever.This is my favorite film and one of the best classic action films from the 80's of all time. Yes I grew up with this film, that always fascinated me how this film is fascinated, awesome, brilliant and very funny. Eddie Murphy kick's ass!!! A freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills Cop is a movie made successful entirely on the performance of its star. The film is fairly shallow when it comes right down to it -- really, it's a whole lot of talk, a fair bit of comedy, and only a little bit of action -- but Star Eddie Murphy's (48 Hrs.) charisma and complete mastery of his character is what makes Director Martin Brest's (Midnight Run) movie a fan-favorite success. Outside of Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop is as routine as routine gets; a standard cops-and-robbers plot, no mystery, and point-and-shoot and in-the-raw direction make for an otherwise dull picture, but Murphy saves the film from its own shortcomings with so much flair and genuine excitement that this might be the all-time best of any of the ""actor-singlehandedly-makes-the-movie"" movies. Beverly Hills Cop is the very definition of a ""star vehicle,"" a movie that's nothing without its lead -- this specific lead at that -- but with him? It's a movie that's always masking its mistakes behind Murphy's big smile and quick-to-the-punch comic style and timing that he's got going on no matter the time, place, or circumstances in the story, selling the character and his actions with a startling effortlessness that transforms him into Axel Foley in every scene. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a slick, smooth-talking Detroit detective who's disobedience and disregard for procedure has once again landed him in hot water with his Chief, and a promising career is on the brink of disintegration. Axel Foley is Eddie Murphy's best role that made him in to a star today. Beverly Hills Cop is a 1984 American action comedy film directed by Martin Brest and starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart Detroit cop who heads to Beverly Hills, California to solve the murder of his best friend. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks appear in supporting roles.This first film in the Beverly Hills Cop series shot Murphy to international stardom, won the People's Choice Award for ""Favorite Motion Picture"", was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) in 1985. It earned $234 million at the North American domestic box office, making it the highest-grossing 1984 film in the U.S.Beverly Hills Cop is always on the precipice of disaster, the picture teetering on the edge but always pulled back from the brink by Murphy's contagious enthusiasm and pure comic timing. About half the film, it seems, is constructed almost exclusively of scenes featuring Murphy's character being chewed out for his actions that take place in the other half of the film. Whether he's defending himself in front of his superiors or defending his life on the streets of Detroit and Beverly Hills, Murphy consistently and perfectly juggles the film's requirements for action (as sparse as the action may be) with what is almost always subtle but extraordinarily effective humor that always flows from the story and feels genuinely off-the-cuff, rather than force-fed into the plot just to try and squeeze out a laugh from its audience. It's the film's sense of real, genuine storytelling, then, that outside of Murphy, is its greatest asset. The film is awfully standard, yes, but it's never mechanical, instead playing as completely organic. The interplay between characters seems perfectly natural, as does the humor, and it's all thanks to Murphy's uncanny ability to carry the movie with so much natural swagger and charm that Beverly Hills Cop is so much fun in spite of what would otherwise be a forgettable loser of a movie. The heat is on in this fast paced action-comedy starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street smart Detroit cop tracking down his best friend's killer in Beverly Hills. Axel quickly learns that his wild style doesn't fit in with the Beverly Hills Police Department, which assigns two officers (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) to make sure things don't get out of hand. Dragging the stuffy detectives along for the ride, Axel smashes through a huge culture clash in his hilarious, high-speed pursuit of justice. Featuring cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans, Beverly Hills Cop is an exhilarating sidesplitting adventure!I love this film, it is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Eddie Murphy rocks the house.",Beverly Hills Cop
86,krorie,Eddie Murphy's Masterpiece,10,27 May 2006,"Eddie Murphy's best comedy work was on Saturday Night Live with such classic sketches as ""Mr. Robinson's Hood."" On the big screen, much of Eddie Murphy's work is stretched to the breaking point, with funny bits here and there. Not so for ""Beverly Hills Cop."" Murphy is able to sustain his gift for levity from beginning to end. This is a must-see for his many fans, if there are any of the younger generation that have not already seen it. But it is also for any lover of exceptional action flicks with humorous dialog and situations. The writers pass the fun around. Fact is Murphy doesn't have the funniest line in the show. That honor goes to John Ashton as Det. Sgt. John Taggart. Detective Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) stands up like a wooden Indian and yells at the thugs shooting at him, ""Police! You're all under arrest!"" The thugs answer with a volley of machine gun fire. Taggart looks at Rosewood and tells him deadpan, ""You do that again, I'll shoot you myself!"" Also nearly upstaging the brilliant Murphy is Bronson Pinchot as Serge who has to be heard to be believed. His verbal exchange with Murphy at the art gallery is one of the high points of the movie.The writers and director deliver the goods for the multi-talented Murphy by giving him a good story filled with wit and daring and making the film action-packed with nary a dull minute. Det. Axel Foley (Murphy) is one of Detroit's finest but he is at times a loose cannon. He attempts to make an unauthorized drug bust only to haggle with the dealers over money. Not realizing Foley is undercover, uniformed police check out the situation leading to one of the most destructive chases on celluloid. After being chewed out by Insp. Douglas Todd (Gilbert R. Hill), Foley meets up with an old buddy, Mikey Tandino (James Russo), from California. Tandino turns out to be a target for the drug kingpin, Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff). Following Tandino's murder, Foley leaves for L.A. on vacation to find his pal's killer. The Beverly Hills Police Department unwittingly become involved to assist Foley in his quest. The laughs come fast and furious with most of the lines ad-libbed.All aspects of ""Beverly Hills Cops"" work including the soundtrack. My son was a teen learning the keyboard when this film was first released. The first song he learned to play was Harold Faltermeyer's Beverly Hills Cop theme.It is difficult to understand why ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was panned by many critics when first shown in 1984. I was hesitant to see it as a result of reading so many negative reviews. I learned quickly that film goers should judge for themselves.",Beverly Hills Cop
87,gab-14712,Eddie Murphy Rocks This Movie!,9,16 May 2020,"Just like 48 Hrs and Lethal Weapon to name a few, Beverly Hills Cop is one of those movies that revolutionized the buddy cop genre in the 1980's. Even to this day, this film remains incredibly popular thanks to Eddie Murphy's fast-paced, magnificent performance. Also, what stands out here is the soundtrack. Hate talk 80's music all you want, but there is no beating this soundtrack. In addition to the famous ""Axel F' theme song, there are songs from Patti LaBelle and the Pointer Sisters that you couldn't imagine anywhere else. Watching Murphy drive down Beverly Hills while LaBelle is rocking out ""Stir It Up"" allows you to embrace the film.The megastar producing duo of Jerry Bruckheimer/Don Simpson came up with the film's idea in the late 1970's, but Paramount decided not to move forward with the film until the early 80's. It is hard to believe after watching the film, but the original screenplay was a more serious drama that had Sylvester Stallone attached to it. Stallone ultimately left the project when he was told his version was too expensive for the studio. Daniel Petrie Jr. was hired to recreate the script into the version we all know and love. The movie is your trademark Bruckheimer film; loud, intense action sequences, funny one-liners and garbs, and a paper-thin plot that you do not care about because you love it anyway.This movie, directed by Martin Brest, is about a Detroit cop named Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy). Axel is a fast-talking cop where trouble always seem to find him. One night, he receives a visit from one of his good friends Mikey Tandino (James Russo), but he was killed right in front of Axel by a goon named Zach (Jonathan Banks). Axel goes to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder. Lt. Bogomil (Ronny Cox) assigns Detective Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Sgt. Taggart (John Ashton) to make sure he stays away from the case. They barely succeed if you can call it that. Axel meets up with his friend, Jenny (Lisa Eilbacher) who works at an art gallery. The art gallery happened to be owned by Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff), one of Beverly Hill's mobsters. Maitland also may be behind the death of Axel's friend, which may result in some craziness!Eddie Murphy did a very good job carrying the film, which gave the comedian superstardom. That is wild considering Murphy was not hired until two weeks until shooting was to begin. I loved his wit and how he used comedy to blend with the action. If you can suspend disbelief, my favorite scene is when he introduced himself at one of the hotels of Beverly Hills. Yeah, he brought out the race card, but I was laughing nonstop here. I also love his hijinks with Rosewood and Taggart, which is where the buddy comedy comes in. The three gets on each other's nerves to no end and its funny when Murphy pranks these cops as he grows deeper and deeper into the case. All three actors have awesome chemistry. This is another one of those films that uses Judge Reinhold at his best. Steven Berkoff, as Victor Maitland, does a good job. His villain may be typical of the 80's/90's, but he is undeniably evil and a force to be reckoned with.Martin Brest did a good job directing the action. The film starts with a crazy action scene that introduced us to Axel Foley. The ending sequence is reminiscent of Scarface's ending with hundreds and hundreds of bullets whizzing around, but this time with the three cops. The setup and the actual sequence is very good and it might be my favorite action sequence of any 80's film.Beverly Hills Cop is a classic film that is meant to entertain. Yeah, the story/villain can be cheesy, but honestly that is the point of these films. This movie, thanks to Eddie Murphy, just happens to do it the best. The movie spawned two sequels, but nothing can compare to the original. The film does not take itself too seriously because it has a great sense of humor. Outdated special effects may be around, but enjoy the action and comedy because it is a good time watching to happen. At least you will hum ""Axel F"" the next week.My Grade: A-",Beverly Hills Cop
88,SmileysWorld,Murphy in his prime and at his best.,8,1 August 2013,"When it comes to his career in films,beyond the 1980's,there's little for Eddie Murphy to brag about short of his Oscar nominated turn in Dreamgirls.It was nice coming back and seeing the man in his prime and at his best after so many years of mostly hit and miss.It's basically your typical fish out of water story.A hot shot Detroit cop goes to Beverly Hills to seek answers in the death of a good friend.You have a good mixture here of Murphy's great comedic talent mixed with explosive action sequences and a synthesizer heavy music soundtrack that was typical of that decade.For my money,it's Eddie's best work on the big screen.",Beverly Hills Cop
89,rzajac,Dated,7,25 November 2018,"It was interesting to watch this as a sort of period piece.I have super happy memories of Murphy on SNL. He's a truly gifted guy.I guess I can see that a flick like this can be entertaining to watch at home. But I really do expect better. I guess it works better for me if a cops-robbers flick is an honest drama infused with comedy, and this appears to be a comedy draped over a ""hard-stories-in-the-big-city"" dramatic framework. That don't hunt. I suspect they thought the exercise would be redeemed because of (minor spoiler) the sundry inversions: Inversions of (economic) class, flyover vs. coastal, and race are thrown in for good measure. You can feel the storytellers are trying too hard to earn those heartstring tugs.This dog *could've* hunted--if it'd been better written. But this one wasn't, so it don't.I accord it a few stars because of the effort. But it was a bit of an effort to watch, so....Anyway: Can't recommend it, if you like an honest story.",Beverly Hills Cop
90,Angry_Arguer,Murphy Carries a Movie,8,21 July 2003,"Rather than having an incompetent Nick Nolte for a partner as in 48 Hours, Eddie Murphy shows he can take control of a movie all by himself.  This was in the days when Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were getting started in their modern appeal to the dollar.  It also proves to be the best.  Audio is skimped on, as it always is in their movies, but the highlight is the fact that Martin Brest--previously fired off of WarGames--doesn't let Bruckheimer get in the way of the story.Had a less competent director, say Tony Scott or Michael Bay, been put in charge, the movie would have fallen apart like BHC II did.  Fortunately, Brest knows how far to push things and when to back off.  He is helped by Arthur Coburn and Billy Weber, two of the best editors short of Michael Kahn.  It's too bad that Arthur lost precedence in Hollywood and Billy wound up a slave to Bruckheimer.The charge in this movie is still strong after nearly 20 years, but there are obvious signs of aging.  Thankfully, the dialogue is not Bruckheimer's typical macho-BS, but rather natural and fluid.  Eddie delivers again and again.  The remainder of the cast, obscure as they are fair, but it is John Ashton who has the least trouble with his lines.The only major fault I find with BHC is not in the film itself, but rather in how many times the formula has been duplicated, mimicked, plagarized, and copied.  Each time less inventive or original than the rest.Overall, funny and somewhat vulgar (this is not for fans of Dr. Doolittle or The Nutty Professor), but it shows when Eddie was at his pinnacle of ability...before the inferior screenwriters took over.  A gem of the 80s. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",Beverly Hills Cop
91,russem31,A classic 80s film,8,3 December 2005,"Beverly Hills Cop is one of the best 1980s films. It also helped propel the career of Eddie Murphy. As Detroit cop Axel Foley, he is on a murder trail that leads him to the quaint city of Beverly Hills. This is a film that pokes fun at cultural differences between two very different types of environments - Detroit and Beverly Hills. The great thing about this film is how the 3 main actors, Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, and John Ashton, are properly cast in their roles, they definitely work well together. Also, the score to this film is both inventive, new, and classic 1980s style (kudos to the composer and songwriters). This is a must see film for all ages - 8 out of 10!",Beverly Hills Cop
92,Maziun,The best action comedy of all time - Murphy's best movie,8,24 June 2018,"This classic 80's movie could easily have turned out to be a complete mess. The first draft of the movie was finished in 1977. The shooting script was literally pasted together from the half dozen or so scripts written for this project over the years. At one point Axel Foley was going to be played by Sylvester Stallone. It was supposed to be a much darker revenge movie . Two weeks before filming was to start Stallone left the project and used some of his script ideas to make ""Cobra"" ( a masterpiece of cheesy B-class action cinema). Then miracle happened in the form of Eddie Murphy.When Eddie Murphy was hired he started making massive rewrites to the script. It's also interesting that Murphy as well as John Ashton and Judge Reinhold improvised their lines of dialogue and even some scenes. The filming was hectic and even the moviemakers didn't had any clue what will be the end result. Thankfully a combination of accident , luck and genuine filmmaking enthusiasm gave a birth to a great movie.""Beverly Hills cop"" is the very definition of a ""star vehicle,"" a movie that's nothing without its main star. Eddie Murphy is pure gold as Axel Foley - one of the most likeable characters in cinema. He is cool , quick-witted , sarcastic , street smart. He usually uses his brain and smooth talking to get out of trouble . He's not your typical tough guy and that what makes him interesting. You could compare him to Bugs Bunny (which is not a bad thing).Murphy is the driving force behind the film, no doubt about it. However , he does have a good support here. John Ashton (""Midnight run"") and Judge Reinhold (""Fast times at Ridgemont High"") as the grumpy Taggart and naïve Rosewood have great chemistry together and pretty much deserve their own movie. Bronson Pinchot as the art curator has small but very memorable part. Ronny Cox (""Robocop"") plays a rare for him role of good guy . Lisa Eilbacher is good eye candy. Jonathan Banks (""48 hours"") is quite chilling as the bad guy. The only downside is the boring main villain played by Steven Berkoff (""Octopussy"").The plot is pretty much your standard buddy cop movie. It is however also a fish out of water story with some social commentary. The contrast between the different methods of crime and cop life in Detroit and LA works very well. The movie also doesn't have any romance or racial comparisons which gives it a fresh feel. The dialogues and one liners are sharply written and funny. There isn't really much of mystery here and some moments are obviously unrealistic, but it's very easy to ignore.""BHC"" has a pretty strong soundtrack . ""Axel F"" by Harold Faltermeyer is a true classic. It's cool , bouncy and infectious - just like the main character. I don't think there's a person on Earth that doesn't recognize it. Don't forget about other great songs : Glenn Frey ""The Heat is on"" , Patti LaBelle ""Stir it up"" and Pointer Sisters ""Neutron dance"". Overall , the soundtrack is a great blend of pop-rock from the 80's.It's surprising that Martin Scorsese was offered the chance to direct , but turned it down. The director Martin Brest was hired and it was a wise decision. Brest turned out to be a expert when it comes to action-comedies with ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and later with De Niro/Grodin movie ""Midnight run"". He skillfully blends action with comedy and creates a sense of lightherted adventure.I give it 8/10. An immensely enjoyable film. It captures everything that was the best about the 80's. It might be a standard movie , but one that doesn't feel mechanical and simply works. There's a real camaraderie between Murphy , Ashton and Reinhold here. The chemistry feels real , the humor works , the action is good. In the long line of action comedies/buddy cop movies (that started in 1982 with ""48 hours"" also with Murphy) this is the best one.",Beverly Hills Cop
93,EijnarAmadeus,He's Mr. California,7,29 May 2011,"BEVERLY HILL COP is quite a funny and enjoyable 80s flick that got Eddie Murphy seated in super-stardom, and quite deservedly so. His performance is simple, yet all so much better for it, he more or less plays himself and has this laughing, pleased and joyous character to work with, which suits him fine. The film isn't especially original or groundbreaking, it's first and firmly a well made action/comedy that pops up with a likable protagonist that investigates bad guys in Beverly Hills while he's surrounded by swell locations and accompanied by some fantastic music by Patti LaBelle, Pointer Sisters, Danny Elfman and off course the memorable theme track.

With a script originally intended for Sylvester Stallone, Murphy commands the screen in one of the greatest, single comic performances ever captured on screen, splashed against the backdrop of an action movie that is still riveting from start to finish. Murphy plays Axel Foley, a Detroit police officer who travels to Beverly Hills after a childhood buddy (James Russo) is murdered in his hallway, shortly after arriving in Detroit from Beverly Hills. Murphy gives a thousand mega-watt performance here, blowing everyone off the screen with the exception of Judge Reinhold as Beverly Hills cop Billy Rosewood and the then unknown Bronson Pinchot as Serge, a gay receptionist in an art gallery. Twenty two years later, this is still Murphy's best performance and best movie and I don't think he will ever match it and shouldn't even try. An instant classic.",Beverly Hills Cop
95,Min111,Axel Foley in action,7,12 August 2020,"You get to see Axel Foley in action in this movie. The character was played by Eddie Murphy. I can't believe how young he looks. He looks like a guy that's starting out his career. A man in his twenties. He looks cool as a cop. He's meant for the job. Beverly Hills Cop is one of the best action/comedy movies of the eighties. You can tell it's an eighties movie. A great movie to have come out from that time. The other movie that can compare to Beverly Hills Cop is Rush Hour, but that movie involves two cops. In Beverly Hills Cop, Axel Foley is alone. He has a team of cops to help when he needs them. One of them goes by the name Billy Rosewood who is a detective. He's a likeable character. Another cop is John Taggart. I like how they all fight the bad guys. It makes for epic viewing. There was so much action to be found in the movie. Axel Foley is funny, and that's not surprising. Eddie Murphy is known to be a funny actor. Axel Foley can fight. I like his fighting skills. He knows what he's doing. He's one of the best cops I ever seen. I like his name too. His boss hates him. He threatens to fire Axel unless his ""behaviour"" improves. His boss is someone you don't like. Axel is actually a cop from Detroit that visits Beverly Hills in California. There's debate whether it's the best movie in the series, but I think they were all equally good. I gave a rating of seven stars for Beverly Hills Cop, Beverly Hills Cop II and Beverly Hills Cop III. That's a good rating. Be sure to check both the sequels out.",Beverly Hills Cop

This film is possibly one of the best action-comedy films out there.  The action is done extremely well, the comedy is right on, the characters are likable, the acting is fantastic, and the story is great.Eddie Murphy really shines in this role as Axel Foley, a very likable Detroit Cop, and does a fantastic job of laying out the groundwork for a great franchise, as does director Martin Brest.  Judge Reinhold and John Ashton play Axel's Beverly Hills counterparts.  Both pulling off fantastic performances and playing very enjoyable characters.  Ronny Cox also does a fine job with his role in the film.  Bronson Pinchot and Paul Reiser also deserve some notice as well, despite having very little screen time, they both make the best of it.  I'd also like to point a little known actor named Damon Wayans in the film, playing an extremely small part, but nonetheless a good one (he's the man that gives Axel the bananas).As I mentioned before the action and the comedy are right on and the scenes flows very nicely together, you never once get bored throughout the film.

97,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: hasn't aged, still worthwhile",7,16 April 2002,"I'm probably wrong, but ""Beverly Hills Cop"" seemed to redefine the police action / comedy. I believe that ratings should be based on recent viewings (not our nostalgia), but I caught it on TV recently and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is still holding up!Eddy Murphy was at the start of his career in 1984, but does a great job of being smug but not unlikeably smug, skilled but not unreasonably silly-super-skilled, and there is a sort-of plot. For an action film guy like me there is plenty of action, but the film is a safe comedy to drag your SO along.If you're curious about the early Eddy Murphy, check this out. It's certainly better than the recent ""Showtime"". And the soundtrack can't be beat. I'm forced to admit, however, that those not wanting to experience some nostalgia can find just as good cop flicks from the 90s and today.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs on a rainy day, or if you lived throughthe 80s and somehow missed it. And skip ""48 Hrs.""-- Comedy buffs, see ""Trading Places"" instead if you'dlike to see some early Eddy Murphy.I'll give ""Beverly Hills Cop"" a resilient 7 out of 10.",Beverly Hills Cop
98,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,15 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...Back in 1984, I was a teenager just finding his love for music. The soundtrack to this movie was brimming with great songs, and it was because of ""Axel F"" by Harold Faltermeyer, that it became the first ever album (on cassette tape) that I bought. And Eddie Murphy? I'd heard of him and knew who he was ... but it was this movie that really put him on the Hollywood map.Axel Foley (Murphy) is a Detroit detective who has a penchant for trouble and is constantly on his captain's bad side. When an old acquaintance of his comes visiting, two hitmen follow him into town and rub him out. The clues lead to Beverly Hills, so Axel takes his vacation time, packs his bags, and heads to California in his beat up, blue Chevy Nova. Axel is soon hot on the trail of a crooked local art dealer, and with the help of two Beverly Hills police officers, he systematically breaks him down.This action comedy is a classic to say the least. It was Eddie Murphy's breakthrough role and it spawned 2 sequels (with perhaps even more on the horizon). It has stood the test of time and is still just as viable and enjoyable today as it was back in 1984 - after 35+ years, that's saying something. This was the perfect role for Eddie Murphy. Everything works here, even his signature 80's laugh.I highly recommend this film. Every once in a while a movie will come along that is perfect - one for the ages. This is one of those films. It helped to influence other movies in the genre over the years and became a blueprint for action comedies. I love ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and give it a perfect 10 stars out of 10. This is ""must see"" material, and every movie collection should have this one included.",Beverly Hills Cop
99,policy134,One of the only times Murphy's talents has not been misused.,7,8 August 2005,"The first time I saw this back in the 80's I thought that it was hilarious. Since then the passage of time has dimmed the luster a little but I still think that this is one of the best Murphy vehicles ever. His wisecracks was totally uninhibited and it shows.Since then there has been some good and very bad Murphy movies but when this first came out, his humour was enormously fresh. His sheep-like laugh was the clincher and has since been imitated, but never duplicated.The plot is not much to speak off and you could only wonder what a disaster it could have been if Sylvester Stallone had been cast, as was originally intended. The idea of a black man rubbing the very white people in Beverly Hills the wrong way is of course brilliantly thought out and I can't think of other actors who could portray the white cops better than the people chosen here.The one thing I will always remember about this was of course the theme song by Harold Faltermayer. It had some kind of inexplicably hold on you that you nearly whistled the tune out loud every time you heard it. While not in the league of Martin Brests next film, ""Midnight Run"" it will always be a fond memory of the time Murphy could do no wrong until ""Best Defense"" was released.",Beverly Hills Cop
100,Horror-yo,"80's action-comedy, Eddie Murphy: top fun",8,19 May 2016,"This review could almost just suffice itself to that title up there. It's EXACTLY what you think. It's the 80's, with the awful dress code, the cool smooth black guy protagonist, and Eddie Murphy particularly who's just immediate added value with just his lines' delivery and the tiny little things I'm almost certain he adds himself to the script as it goes (or 5min before the shoot). The crappy 80's music and that iconic synth lead. Overall it's got that feeling of tremendous freedom following Murphy as the main character, the anti-hero hero with his lightness and ability to get seemingly anything done whether through streetwise ruse or on-the-spot humor, that guy who's completely fearless and isn't always totally legal with everything he does but at the end of the day definitely plays for the 'right team'. There's a big bad villain, there's a chick, there are friends (along the way), and there's a bunch of action. It's heaps of fun. Don't miss out.",Beverly Hills Cop
101,saadanathan,Beverly Hills Cop brings the heat on 7\10,7,3 April 2021,"Eddie Murphy's big hit ""Beverly Hills Cop"" is a funny and light film, brings a lot to the table: humor, action and a lot of differences between how Detroit works and how Beverly Hills works. Eddie Murphy was one of the big stars of the 80's and his career evolved with every movie and performance of his. This is probably one of his more notable movies. The film overall has much to offer, including those differences between Axel Foley and the other cops. The music is a little painful and overused but it does add the vibe of the 80's.",Beverly Hills Cop
102,TheMan3051,Eddie Murphy's BEST!,9,10 January 2003,"Released in 1984 this hilarious and action-packed film directed by Martin Brest, stars Eddie Murphy in his best movie role to date! The concept is simple. Eddie Murphy plays a ""do it his own way"" cop who travels to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of a friend. Along the way he teams up with two other cops. And the adventure begins which is full with a lot of great gags and action sequences.4(****)out of 4(****)stars",Beverly Hills Cop
103,harryplinkett14,Oh joy,10,13 January 2014,"Looking at the script alone it's easy to conclude that this film could easily have turned out to be a complete mess.Bit it didn't. Why? I am still not sure. Although great casting played a major role. All the roles were perfectly cast, and Murphy (unlike in some of the films he made later in his career) was really into it this time around. These actors were all into it, and clearly having lots of fun.But is that all? No. There is the awesome musical score as well.What else? Solid direction? Nice locations? Yeah.What else? I guess it's one of those few projects where all the stars in the sky aligned properly so as to give it that x-factor that renders a film awesome. And that's what this film is: awesome. Beverly Hills Cop is pure enjoyment from beginning to end, from the first scene to the last. Finally, there was an honesty and genuine filmmaking enthusiasm that characterized films in the 80s. Now it's all routine, cynicism, and calculation. As long as the film makes money, nothing else matters. That's not an attitude that can sustain the film industry in the long run. You can condition your audience to put up with rubbish for a while, but sooner or later people will become starved and desperate for genuine movie magic. In the meantime, I am sticking to 80s classics like The Beverly Hills Cop.An easy 10/10.",Beverly Hills Cop
104,jhaggardjr,Eddie Murphy's best film,10,24 February 2001,"""Beverly Hills Cop"" is still in my opinion Eddie Murphy's best movie. Released back in December 1984, this movie propelled Murphy into super movie stardom as it went on to become one of the highest grossing movies of all-time and it still is Murphy's biggest hit. It spawned two sequels, but this is easily the best in the series. In ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Murphy plays Axel Foley, a fast-talking Detroit cop who gets a visit from his troublemaking best friend early on. When his friend is murdered, Foley tries to take on the case against the wishes of his boss. The friend had told Foley that he had been working in a warehouse out in Beverly Hills, California. Foley then asks his boss for a vacation. The boss agrees, and Foley is off to Beverly Hills and tries to investigate on why his friend was killed. Beverly Hills will never be the same again! ""Beverly Hills Cop"" has great comedy, great action, and a great soundtrack featuring the hit songs ""The Heat Is On"", ""Stir It Up"", ""New Attitude"", and ""Neutron Dance"". Murphy is perfect in his portrayl of Axel Foley, and gets great support from Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff, and Paul Reiser. This is one very entertaining motion picture. It's very funny and very exciting. **** (out of four)",Beverly Hills Cop
105,Offworld_Colony,"I miss the days when coppers were flawed and well rounded, colourful characters...",8,7 February 2020,"...instead of divided.
Beverly Hiils Cop is a bygone action dramatic comedy where the drama is strong and the comedy is character/actor personality driven, like Lethal Weapon. And like that franchise, by the time the third one rolls around it has devolved in to farce.
This entry, directed by Martin Brest, feels quite non traditional even though it's full of early cop film cliches. It's got some fantastic dialogue and acting and a really crisp and non cheesy style despite its loveable soundtrack and score.
Eddie Murphy is hilarious, sweet, funny but not annoying and natural. The action is so-so and the film has its share of dud moments but overall Brest's eye for character and the 18 rating keeps the film feeling fresh over the years.",Beverly Hills Cop
106,Cinemaniac1984,Still a fantastic comedy and a delight to watch. Definitely Eddie Murphy's best movie.,9,10 October 2021,"Following the success of 48 Hours (1982) and Trading Places (1983), Eddie Murphy struck box office gold once again with the action comedy Beverly Hills Cop. Released in 1984, the movie is still a delight to watch and it is still hilarious years later.Eddie Murphy has never been better in his trademark role as wisecracking Detroit Police Detective Axel Foley who constantly finds himself in trouble especially after an unauthorised undercover sting operation involving a truck full of cigarettes goes awry. In the aftermath, Foley is severely reprimanded by his bad tempered boss Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill) and threatens to fire him if he continues his reckless behaviour.Foley's childhood friend Mikey (James Russo) pays him a surprise visit but later both are ambushed by a pair of thugs and Mikey is murdered in cold blood. Foley decides to take vacation time and travels from Detroit to Beverly Hills to find the killers responsible for Mikey's murder. The trail leads to shady art dealer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) who is also operating a drug smuggling ring and fellow henchman Zach (Jonathan Banks) is behind Mikey's murder. Beverly Hills Police Detectives Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggert (John Ashton) are assigned to keep a watch on Axel but later find themselves reluctantly dragged into assisting Foley in bringing down Victor Maitland. Their boss Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox) is not too pleased with Foley's presence and thus wants him out of the city. With the help of Foley's childhood friend Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) who is also working in Beverly Hills, Foley continues to outwit everyone as he is determined to expose Victor Maitland and to avenge Mikey's death.I loved Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop. Every scene he is in is like a shining light with every wisecrack and one liners and the humour never stops from start to finish. Personally, his role as Axel Foley is one of my favourites.Also featured in the cast includes Bronson Pinochet as a camp gallery worker, Paul Reiser as Jeffrey who is a fellow Detroit police detective, and Damon Wayans in an early role as a hotel employee who gives Foley some bananas.Director Martin Brest has done a fantastic job with Beverly Hills Cop. Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up in what was an early box office hit early in their careers.I loved the soundtrack. Harold Faltermeyer's score is fantastic and the songs throughout the movie was memorable. Every time I hear The Heat Is On by Glenn Frey, I immediately think of the opening credits. Other songs including the Axel F theme, Neutron Dance by The Pointer Sisters, and Stir It Up by Patty LaBelle are also great additions to the movie's soundtrack.Beverly Hills Cop is still a classic comedy and this is one of Eddie Murphy's most memorable movies. The movie has aged very well and still remains as one of my favourite comedies of all time.9/10.",Beverly Hills Cop

109,LegendaryFang56,Great movie.,8,6 July 2021,"It took a little while to get immersed in the movie. I started getting immersed once Beverly Hills was the setting, and my immersion only grew from there. At the same time, I believe there was another factor as to why that was the case, that factor being: I watched up to that point once before. As to why I stopped, and when that was, I have no idea.Putting the past aside, I enjoyed this movie very much. I imagine that it is regarded as a classic as far as movies are concerned. The only disappointment is that I'm uncertain whether that will be the case to me. The main reason being that I just watched it, and not back when it was released. I'm also uncertain how coming to consider something as a classic is determined. Taking that particular uncertainty into consideration, I may not have considered this movie a classic right now had I watched it back then.Regardless, I am appreciative that I was able to watch it now, even though it would've been cool and interesting to have watched it back then. I mean, I don't think it was stellar or anything like that, but I was greatly entertained. If anything, it was certainly a gem of a movie. I'd most definitely watch it again.",Beverly Hills Cop
110,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Hilarious Action-Comedy Classic. Eddie Murphy At His Best.",10,29 December 2013,"Beverly Hills Cop is an excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy Classic that combines wonderful direction,a brilliant and funny performance from Eddie Murphy and a great cast,terrific Action,Amazing laughs,a fantastic score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Beverly Hills Cop a timeless classic and Eddie Murphy at his best.Set in Beverly Hills,California and Detroit,Michigan,Beverly Hills Cop tells the story of Detective Axel Foley(Eddie Murphy),a clever,smart and wisecracking Detroit cop who while at home gets a visit from his friend Michael Tandino(James Russo). After hanging out together,Axel and Michael are ambushed and Michael is murdered. After the murder,Axel takes a vacation and heads to Beverly Hills where Michael used to work and investigate the reasons for Michael's death which lead to hilarious results.Released in 1984,Beverly Hills Cop is an amazing,hilarious and unforgettable classic that became a critical and Box Office success for Eddie Murphy. Prior to Beverly Hills Cop Eddie Murphy was already a star thanks thanks to his funny and memorable supporting work in terrific films such as 48 Hrs and Trading Places,his wonderful four year stint on Saturday Night Live and his stand up television special Delirious but it was Beverly Hills Cop that was Eddie Murphy's first leading role as an actor and was the film that made Murphy not only a mega star but also a movie icon. Right from the first time you watch the film Beverly Hills Cop is an instant classic that will make you laugh out loud and will have tears running down your face. The film is basically a fish out of water tale but is one of the smartest and funniest Comedies of all time that has many scenes and lines that have become apart of pop culture and is one of those films that whenever you see BHC on television or on Home Video you never turn it off. BHC is one of the few films that perfectly mixes Comedy and Action. The laughs and Humor in BHC are hilarious and truly masterful with most of the funny scenes involving the antics of Axel Foley and with moments and dialog that come at a rapid pace that gives BHC a great energy that never slows down until the very end. When you look the Comedic scenes in BHC some of them feel improvised and jokes don't feel forced or fake but flawless. The Action scenes in BHC are simple but thrilling and effective and are done in the style of Action movies that were popular at the time and give the movie a wonderful balance to the Comedy and laughs that happen throughout BHC. Beverly Hills Cop is one of the films that would set the standard for Action-Comedies that would follow years after it's release. The film's main character Axel Foley is one of funniest and most iconic characters in movie history and is a character you will love as soon as appears on the screen. Unlike most cops on the movie and Television screen who use their guns and fists,Axel uses his Humor,wits and smarts to get out of situations that can be dangerous and other times simple. Axel can also use his smarts and Humor and pretend to be something he's not and fool some of the people he talks to and he can do it on the spot. You will laugh your head off at the things that Axel does. Also,you would think that with Axel being a fish out of water and being from the mean streets of Detroit that he wouldn't understand or fit in with the rich and high glamor of Beverly Hills,but Axel gets used to Beverly Hills and gets a kick out of it laughing at the nature of the city and it's style. For Axel Beverly Hills is a playground and Axel is having a fun time. Axel Foley is a classic character that you will never forget and will live on forever. The ending of the film is great and funny mixing wonderful laughs and explosive Action. It's fantastic conclusion to Beverly Hills Cop that will make you laugh and smile.The whole cast is great. Eddie Murphy is excellent,hilarious and at his very best as Axel Foley,with Murphy bringing wonderful laughs and one-liners to the film. An amazing performance by Murphy. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are brilliant and funny as Beverly Hills police officers and partners Sgt.John Taggart and Detective Billy Rosewood,with Reinhold and Ashton having funny scenes with Murphy and each other. Lisa Eilbacher is wonderful and sexy as Jenny Summers,an old friend of Axel's. James Russo is outstanding as Mikey Tandino,Axel's best friend. Steven Berkoff is terrific as Victor Maitland,the villain of the film. Jonathan Banks is fantastic as Zack,Victor's hit-man and right hand man. Ronny Cox is amazing as Lt.Bogomil,Rosewood and Taggart's Commanding Officer. Gibert R.Hill is sensational and funny as Inspector Todd,Axel's boss. Bronson Pinchot gives a fun and memorable performance as Serge,an art dealer. Paul Reiser is hilarious in his small role as Jeffrey,a Detroit cop. Stephen Elliot(Chief Hubbard),Art Kimbro(Detective Foster)and Joel Bailey(Detective McCabe)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a early role and cameo appearance by Damon Wayans as The Banana Man.The direction by Martin Brest is great,with Brest always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace. Fine direction,Brest.The score and Axel F. theme by Harold Faltermeyer is amazing,memorable and one of the most iconic scores and themes of the 1980s and of all time and matches the film perfectly. Terrific score,Faltermeyer. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Glenn Frey(The Heat Is On),The Pointer Sisters(Neutron Dance),Patti LaBelle(Stir It Up,New Attitude),Vanity 6(Nasty Girl),Harold Faltermeyer(Axel F.)and more. A terrific and memorable soundtrack. In final word,if you love Eddie Murphy or Action-Comedies,I highly suggest you see Beverly Hills Cop,an excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy classic that you can watch again and again and is Eddie Murphy at his best. Highly Recommended 10/10.",Beverly Hills Cop

A blend of violent action picture and sharp comedy, the film has an excellent director, Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman), who finds some original perspectives on stock scenes (highway chases, police rousts) and hits a gleeful note with Murphy while skewering L.A. culture. Good support from Judge Reinhold and John Ashton as local cops not used to doing things the Detroit way (Murphy's character hails from the Motor City).

I love, love , love this film to death. The gun battle on mansion's grounds is one of the reasons to watch this movie. It is Commando and Rambo: First Blood part II two action films in one. Axel (Eddie Murphy), Billy (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (John Ashton) firing with handguns on Uzi-wielding henchman is the most entertainment trough in tier film. The final showdown between Axel and Zack (Jonathan Banks) is memorable gun shootout my favorite bad-ass scene trough whole film.I love the rescue operation so it remains an action classic in the gunplay's fanatic dream with substance action and comedy. I love the filming location of Maitland's residence.Beverly Hills Cop (1984) remains Eddie Murphy's best film and people's favorite film in the series. It is my number 1 favorite Eddie Murphy film and of course remains my number 1 favorite in Beverly Hills Cop trilogy. I enjoy this movie it is my personal favorite action film from Eddie Murphy. This is people's favorite film in the trilogy and Eddie Murphy's best film and I Understand why. This is another childhood classic of mine I grew up watching it, it was the first and only movie I saw as a kid. I didn't know they were three movies at the time , I only thought this is a stand up alone movie I never saw sequels before. This movie has mixed elements with comedy and the same time entertaining action, it has a lot of humor to laugh about. This is one of the decent's 80's action films they don't do movies like this anymore.Beverly Hills Cop Staring: Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Lisa Eilbacher, Ronny Cox, Steven Berkoff, James Russo, Bronson Pinchot, Paul Reiser, Jonathan Banks and Stephen Elliott and they all do fine job.Steven Berkoff is the main villain he was also in James Bond 007 - Octopussy and Rambo: First Blood Part II. They guy was born to play bad guys and I enjoy his performance in all three movies. Jonathan Banks was also in Eddie Murphy's first movie 48 Hrs. no Eddie and Jonathan they did not had any screen time in that movie together but 2 years later they reunited and they had screen time in this movie. Lisa Eilbacher as Jenny Summers close childhood friend of Axel was excellent one of her best performance ever she was also in Leviathan (1989) with Peter Weller. I love these trio working together Ronny Cox from RoboCop and Total Recall was excellent I miss the actor so much he was great. John Ashton was excellent and Judge Reinhold was great and decent as Det. Billy Billy Rosewood, he was the only one of the three actors that appear in all three Beverly Hills Cop movies.Great direction from Martin Brest his best direction debut ever. Great music score from Harold Faltermeyer for Axel F theme. I love the soundtrack: Stir It Up by Patti LaBelle my favorite song of the film. Great opening sequence showing Detroit was excellent great action flick from Paramount.The first movie of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" Trilogy remains the best one in the series my personal favorite action film.",Beverly Hills Cop
113,monkeysgalore,Beverly Hills Cop is Still a Timeless Classic,10,29 October 2018,"While some may not see what the big deal is with this movie, I have to say, I absolutely love it. Just everything about it is fun, charming, and fresh. Eddie Murphy was still enjoying his newfound success after ""48 HRS"". This is back when the motormouthed, quick-witted lead was relatively new, and this is what spawned imitators, and it still holds up today. Some people say it's dated, which is fair, as many of the outfits and sets do feel very 80s, but that doesn't take away from the greatness of the film, at least not for me, and the story is still engaging. It's important to enjoy the movie not just as an action film, but within the context of its time. In that period, it was a pretty unique film and premise.There are also those people who scream that this isn't a buddy cop film, and while that may be true to a point, I still feel that Taggart and Rosewood still play a large-enough part where it can be considered as a buddy cop film. Axel Foley is definitely the main character, but there is a camaraderie and friendship that develops, and the three face down the bad guys at the climax together. Say what you will, but I am one of the people who count this as a buddy cop movie.Enough people have gone into the plot, so I don't feel the need to, but the film is well-paced, and it still manages to move along at reasonable pace, while still giving time to develop characters, such as Mikey, Jenny, and Taggart and Rosewood. While there isn't a ton of action, a surprising little amount for an 80s vehicle actually, what's there is good, and I actually kind of like it that way, as it feels more like an investigation and procedural, which is the intent. Axel is in Beverly Hills to solve a crime, not kill everyone.The script is very well-written, so hats off to Daniel Petrie. The only other movies written by him that I've seen are ""Cop II and III"", and ""Shoot to Kill"", and I loved them, except for ""Cop III"". All in all, excellent writing worthy of your time. His dialogue is excellent and it crackles on screen. He really lets Eddie Murphy do his thing, and doesn't smother him in action sequences.The film benefits greatly from Martin Brest's direction, and though he hasn't done much else, he is still obviously a talented director, and this is obviously is highest directing achievement, with the possible exception of ""Midnight Run"". He handles the comedy scenarios well, letting Murphy do his thing and not trying to quickly move the script along and stifle the actors' talents, as John Landis did with ""Cop III"". Instead, he lets the story move at its own pace, which is part of the charm, setting it more apart from other 80s action vehicles. He also handles the action sequences quite well, particularly the opening car chase and very memorable final shootout. There's a particular instance during the shootout in which Axel actually reloads his gun, at least once, which was especially nice to see, and it definitely added another shade of realism to the film, which already had less than over-the-top action to begin with. So hats off to Brest.Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer are producing here, the two being known for producing great, high-octane action movies. They're hand in the film's production is obvious, though this is definitely a more toned-down effort compared to some of their later films such as ""Crimson Tide"", ""The Rock"", or ""Bad Boys"".Some may not find it very funny, but I personally thought it was hilarious, and Eddie's constant banter and witty remarks never fail to amaze. I laughed out loud several times, especially the scenes at the art gallery with Serge, and the scene outside the mansion with the two other cops.While there is little in the way of action, the action sequences are still pretty good, with a great opening truck chase, two small fight scenes, and one large-scale, explosive shootout at the end where everyone is trading bullets, and many bad guys die. Don't expect action on the scale of ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" and you'll probably enjoy it more, for what it is. The final shootout in particular was very well-handled, I thought, and it's probably one of my favorite shootouts in film.I also want to mention the soundtrack, which I really enjoyed. It was because of this film that I discovered ""Stir It Up"" by Patti LaBelle, and ""Neutron Dance"" by the Pointer Sisters, both very catchy and fun songs. The soundtrack also gave us one of the most memorable, and arguably the best theme song from a movie, Harold Faltermeyer's ""Axel F"".Everyone's performances were great, but Eddie Murphy really carried this film, even though he has great chemistry with Taggart and Rosewood, who do an excellent job of playing straight to Axel's antics. Eddie's banter feels so natural, and he is still believable as a cop who wants justice for his best friend. Overall, excellent film, 10/10.",Beverly Hills Cop
114,pinkliz41,1 of the best films of the 80's and certainly the greatest Murphy flick to date.,8,30 June 2007,"THRILLER!!!!!! i don't think so.......... Action Comedy are my words. At the beginning of 85' a film came out, a very slick cool film, that was Beverly Hills Cop. Comedy at its pinnacal peak of laughs and thrills, joy and excitement. Murphy made action comedy's live again, this was the start of a new, more comedic and actiony look at films. action. Adventure. Comedy. Murphy gives a bloody damn good comedy performance making him one of the top and most respected comedy actors to date. Axel Foley (Murphy) is a Detriot police officer, who wants to find the man for the murder of his friend Mikey Tandino. And decided by saying to his boss he wont go but does go to Beverly Hills, where he gets thrown through a window, goes to a strip club and puts a banana in the tail pipe of two cops, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Sgt John Taggart (John Ashton) who are trailing Axel and experience hilarious results.Murphy, Reinhold and Ashton make Beverly Hills a long and well worthy experience of cops and comedy, action and adventure and a killer soundtrack.",Beverly Hills Cop
115,kingofdanerds,Just insert that theme,9,14 January 2021,"Eddie Murphy is a man that literally everyone knows about. He started out on SNL in 1980 and was on the show for a few years. He even was a musician (which is quite odd the more I think about it). He started acting in movies in 1982 in the film 48 Hrs. In 1984, he starred in Beverly Hills Cop which is considered by some to be his best film. The film was originally going to have Sylvester Stallone star in this film but they ended up having Eddie Murphy instead. The film also stars Judge Reinhold (The Santa Clause movies and the other Beverly Hills Cop films), John Ashton (The Tommyknockers and a crappy film known as Escape from Alaska), and Ronny Cox (Robocop). The film was a critical success and also a commercial success as well. So much so that it ended up being the highest grossing film of 1984. This film was so popular that it got two sequels which never performed as well critically or financial as the first film.Axel Foley is a cool and hip police detective. He does things his own way even if it does not quite sit well with his higher ranking officers. A friend of his from Beverly Hills comes to Detroit and is killed and Axel Foley wants to find out who killed him. But, the police chief won't allow it so, Axel goes on a ""vacation"" to Beverly Hills where he sees if he can get any answers. Along the way he meets some Beverly Hills cops who do things way differently than what Axel is used to. Will Axel be able to figure out who killed his friend?I remember the very first time that I watched this film way back in elementary school and I loved it. Watching it many years later and it still holds up for the most part. The one thing I have to keep in mind is that this is an action comedy film and a pre Die Hard or even pre Rambo II. Typically when I watch action films, I want something big. In this film I do not get that but I won't take points off for that because as a pre Die Hard or pre Rambo II film, it holds it's own. There are some well directed action scenes. Most notably being in the beginning and end. As a comedy, this film works extremely well. The comedy still holds up and is due in large part to Eddie Murphy who is a funny guy. What is rather interesting is that most of this film's scenes were improvised and it is all pure genius. Sure, when I see Eddie Murphy in any film, this is the type of performance I typically expect and I usually get. The characters are really likeable and enjoyable to watch. Again, Eddie Murphy does amazing in this film and does a great job when he is trying to be funny and oddly enough, does a great job when he is being serious. It is rather different but it is done fairly well. The other actors do a phenomenal job and the characters they portray are amazing. I like the whole setup with Axel being this hip cop detective and meeting these by-the-book Beverly Hills cops. The villain is nothing too special here and to me is just your typical villain (and had they did something rather unique with the villain, perhaps I would have given this film the ten star rating it should get). The soundtrack is phenomenal. Harold Faltermeyer did the famous Axel F theme which the more I think of it, is played way too much but it is still awesome and catchy. I would have liked to see this theme played more in the action scenes but that is only a minor nitpick.Beverly Hills Cop is a truly iconic film and for me it is a great film that just has a few nitpicks that sadly keep me from giving this a ten star rating. If you are a huge Eddie Murphy fan, this is a film that you will surely enjoy.",Beverly Hills Cop
116,kyle-cruse,Fun 80s film,8,17 October 2008,"There was plenty to enjoy in ""Beverly Hills Cop."" In one of his early roles, Eddie Murphy plays Alex Foley, a cop who wants to take action on the crooks who killed his buddy and goes to Beverly Hills to track them down. What results along the way is a great number of laughs here and there. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton make hilarious co-stars, as usual. One of my favorite scenes involves Foley having room service sent to the cops watching him across the street while he shoves a banana up their tail pipe. That's just a sample of how funny this film can be. The film is similar to other great action comedies such as ""Rush Hour"" or ""Midnight Run."" ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" however, is generally considered to me more monumental than those, most likely because it was the first of its kind. That is not to say, however, that it is the best of its kind. I find the latter two films to be funnier, though I don't have a lot to complain about with this one. My only problem with this film is the substantial amount of strong language. If this bothers you as it bothers me, I suggest you find an edited-for-TV version or a special version edited for content to remove the profanity. Without that, the film will be much more enjoyable and less of a distraction. There's plenty to enjoy in this movie, but don't expect it to be the best action comedy you've ever seen.*** out of ****",Beverly Hills Cop

Not every movie he is in works, but most do - and this one definitely does.The thing about Beverly Hills Cop is that it is hard to specifically call it a drama or a comedy. And, it certainly is not a dramedy. Their are plenty of bad guys that get killed, but when it is Eddie Murphy involved, you just can't take it all that seriously. Every time you look at him, you want to smile. And, of course, the movie had lots of funny moments.The other interesting element to the movie was the fish out of water idea. A black Detroit rule-breaking cop goes to lily white Beverly Hills and intermingles with by-the-book detectives. It almost makes you laugh just thinking about it. It also reminds me of the TV show McCloud where you had a western policeman sent to NY to train. Culture clash movies are usually funny - especially when the fish out of water does a better job than the land people.

122,thespeos,Unusual Cop Movie that's Fun,7,3 June 2021,"This is an unusual ""cop movie"" as it combines serious crime, comedy, and the poor inner city world of Detroit, MI (black world) in contrast to the grotesque opulence of Beverly Hills, CA (white world).STORY: The plot is simple, and there aren't any real sub-plots, but it works well. What's interesting is that these two (2) worlds are brought together unintentionally. Here we have a black Detroit cop who just mixes in with the ""rich and famous"" without care. Granted, his ""fashion"" stands out as ""inner city,"" but his easy and comfortable interactions are what set him apart. There's the normal cop stuff: guns, crime ... but it's done with lots of comedic tone - an unusual blend.ACTING: The acting was fine all around. While Murphy is very talented, the rest of the cast play substantial roles and perform equally as well. Frankly, everyone worked as team, and I got that feeling clearly.TEMPO: The beginning of the film in Detroit sets up Murphy's visit to Beverly Hills, and it's done fine (though a bit ""crazy"" with an opening car chase). Overall the pace was fine.CINEMATOGRAPHY: There weren't a lot of especially brilliant scenes here, or the sound. The film focused on characters and their interactions.DIRECTING: I thought it was well directed, nothing horrible or brilliant. This director shot ""Scent of a Woman,"" which I thought stunk, being little more than Pacino barking like a dog, and ""Meet Joe Black,"" which I didn't care for either. Not a great resume, but neither a made-for-TV hack.This was fun, different, and it showed how Murphy is both talented and able to work well at binding people together. Nice work.

124,ray-280,"Great story, great cast, great film.",10,3 June 2007,"If ever there were a film where those involved in its production should have known they were making history, this was it. You got Eddie Murphy as the fish-out-of-water Detroit cop Axel Foley, supported by veterans Ronny Cox (Andrew Bogemill) and John Ashton (Sgt. Taggart). Throw in a fresh-out-of-Ridgemont high Judge Reinhold (Lt. Rosewood), and we have an action/comedy/buddy movie for the ages.Although most of the film centers on the chemistry between Foley, Rosewood and Taggart, the true buddies of the film are Foley and Bogemill. The Beverly Hills police chief knows something is wrong in his town when Foley shows up from Detroit investigating a murder from there, and seems to immediately sense that this street-smart inner-city cop who only recently crossed over from the wrong side of the tracks wouldn't be there without a good reason. Unfortunately, Foley does not blend in Beverly Hills, and Bogemill is hobbled by Police Chief Hubbard (Stephen Ellion). Paul Reiser had yet to emerge from the background at the time of this film, playing Jeffrey ""Mario Andretti"" Friedman (as he'd be called in the sequel), while Bronson Pinochet had his coming-out party as art-gallery flameball Serge.The film's conflict centers primarily not around Foley, but Bogemill, who literally cannot rid Beverly Hills of Foley faster than his suspicions about art gallery owner Victor Maitlin grow. Foley's presence upsets Maitlin, who grows more and more brazen in his attempt to put a lid on the genie of truth that wants to escape.The action moves excellently, and very comedically along the way, leading to a climax which unites Bogemill and Foley against a common enemy, to further underscore how similar the two are in their life's missions, despite the disparity in their approaches. Foley and Bogemill have a fundamental mutual respect for each other's methods, at times with each one wishing they could be more like the other, and knowing that both of them have their place in catching the bad guys. Bogemill is the least surprised in the department as he watches his officers repeatedly outsmarted by Foley, and the first to have faith in Foley's instincts when it becomes clear that Maitlin is not all that he seems.Ronny Cox is not the type of actor who stands out much, except perhaps with his over-the-top performance as Dick Jones in Robocop, but in this film he complements Eddie Murphy perfectly, helping to ensure that his film debut was a spectacular one. Without Murphy, the film wouldn't have been as funny (Stallone was originally set to play the lead), and without any of the other leads, it might have suffered a bit, but without Cox, it might not have worked at all. Every minute he was on screen was crucial to the plot, and any mistakes in his performance would have brought the entire film down. He delivered better here than at any other time in his career before or after.You aren't part of pop culture if you don't see this film at least once, and preferably three or four times. It's always on cable, so it's not difficult to find.",Beverly Hills Cop

One day his best friend Mikey Tandino visited him and got shot dead at his apartment. Therefore Axel went to Beverly Hills to investigate Mikey's murder, where Mikey used to work for a famous art dealer Victor Maitland.This was a typical guy movie in which Lisa Eilbacher's character ""Jenny Summers"" was only a small role. Axel, Jenny and Mikey grew up together in the same neighborhood and they were great friends. And now Axel came to L. A. to find the people who killed Mikey, and Jenny owned an art gallery, which belonged to Maitland.In one scene when Axel took Jenny to his hotel room, Jenny sat on the bed and asked ""How long are you gonna stay?"", with a big smile and full of anticipation. ""Til I find the man who killed Mikey"", Axel replied. Obviously this answer was a huge disappointment to Jenny, who I personally think, intended to have sex with Axel.I also think that this film portrayed gays and less ""macho"" men in a stereotypical and satirical way. Indeed, there were various scenes contained such matter that did make me feel funny and laugh, but ultimately, this is not fair to homosexuals.Nevertheless, ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was still a marvelous movie with the actors' outstanding performances which made me laugh out loud and dazzling car chasing and action.

Story was quite simple about a cop's raids in an unknown state. The film as concentrates on many little plots at the same time, it doesn't drag at all to make you groove. Technical departments ain't well noticed enough in this flick which make a bit dragging watch. The production design is not too delightful against some beautiful performances. Actors are well shaped and their dialogues are swiftly delivered yet there is no such thing which seem glossy to feel. Eddie Murphy is amazing, he nails his performance to make you clap on his work.

140,DaRick89,"Slick action and good comedy - too bad about Eddie Murphy, though",8,6 April 2006,"Out of curiosity, I decided to get Beverly Hills Cop. Let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint. It is not particularly original - I have seen this sort of cop-buddy movie done about a thousand times before, along with the 'renegade cop' thing. But Beverly Hills Cop stands out as one of the better ones of its genre. One reason for this is Eddie Murphy. Lately, his presence has been a waste of screen time - look at him in The Haunted Mansion! But here, he seems in his element - he's fresh, he's likable and he's pretty funny at times. He always seems to inject his humour at the right times, like when he rants on about Michael Jackson and defuses a potentially awkward situation. Beverly Hills Cop is a slick movie, it must be said. It may just be Beverly Hills, but there is a slickness about the movie which is noticeable. For example, the expensive hotels, the luxury cars - yes indeed, Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, is really out of his element here. A real...fish out of water. Foley, you see, is used to living in the 'ghetto' that is Detroit - crappy car, derelict buildings - no, Foley doesn't have it easy. Another thing which apparently doesn't exist in Beverly Hills is the unorthodox nature of Foley. I am just thinking about how unoriginal all of this really is - the stupid chief, the renegade cop who is always right, etc, etc. But it still works better than a movie like Die Hard 2. Mind you, Die Hard 2 is not a bad movie (see that review for more), but Beverly Hills Cop has something that Die Hard 2 doesn't...maybe some humour. Or maybe the fact that there is no strip bar scene in Die Hard 2! :) The theme music here is memorable, as well.The acting was OK I guess. The only one who really does well, like I said, is Murphy. Steven Berkoff is somewhat cold (although not really menacing) as the villain of the piece, while the rest are adequate.As well as being a good comedy, Beverly Hills Cop also delivers on action. There is a good shootout near the end of the film, at what I believe to be the same mansion which was used in Commando. The chase scene at the start is also eyecatching and I couldn't help laughing when Foley threw one of Berkoff's thugs into a buffet. And what about the banana trick? Overall, this is a good action movie which provides some good comedy as well. It does not score any points for originality, but it does deserve it's reputation as one of the better cop-buddy movies. Although I would never call Beverly Hills Cop great as such, it is still definitely worth a watch or two. I could definitely watch it again.4/5 stars",Beverly Hills Cop

146,fidelio74,Is this the best buddy cop action comedy ever made?,8,30 October 2010,"'Beverly Hills Cop' is possibly the best buddy cop action comedy ever made. There was a time when Eddie Murphy was the biggest movie star on the planet, and 'Beverly Hills Cop' shows him at the top of his powers. The balance of action and comedy is perfect, and the film opens with a spectacular car chase which really sets the tone for what is to follow. Murphy is wonderful as the wisecracking Detective Axel Foley, a Detroit police officer who goes to Beverly Hills to solve the murder of his friend, Mikey Tandino (James Russo). In Beverly Hills Foley tangles with Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff), a wealthy art dealer and the villain of the piece.Excellent support is offered by Judge Reinhold as Detective William 'Billy' Rosewood, John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart, and Ronny Cox as Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil. 'Beverly Hills Cop' was a massive blockbuster; it cost fourteen million dollars to make, and grossed nearly two hundred and thirty million.Bronson Pinchot really steals the show as Serge, a flamboyant salesperson at the Beverly Hills Art Gallery, and look fast for Damon Wayans as a banquet waiter. Unlike a lot of people, I also like director Martin Brest's later films 'Meet Joe Black' and 'Gigli'. I think they were both unnecessarily reviled. Sure, 'Joe Black' is really long, but it is also very rewarding.'Beverly Hills Cop' is just one of those films where everything slots neatly into place. It was an early hit for the incredibly successful producer team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the soundtrack is pure platinum, featuring such artists as Glenn Frey and The Pointer Sisters. Murphy just oozes charisma from every pore, and he has some great lines to work with. A real classic.",Beverly Hills Cop
147,ShadySovereign,Axel Foley: Eddie Murphy's best role,9,5 June 2005,"Beverly Hills Cop was a big hit in the 1980's. The film was loved by many action fans, as well as comedy fans and movie buffs at the time. It is still being admired by many people as one of the funniest cop movies ever made.The thing I love about this movie is that Eddie Murphy was perfectly cast as the Axel Foley character. Originally, Sylvester Stallone was considered for the role. Thank God he wasn't! Eddie Murphy was perfect for the role, because he can be a clever cop, and can at the same time be very funny! Another great thing about Beverly Hills Cop is its smashing soundtrack. There are some great hit songs from the 1980's featured in the soundtrack, as well as an excellent musical score which can be heard throughout the movie (to me, the musical score is the Beverly Hills Cop ""theme song"").Perhaps the only downside of Beverly Hills Cop is that it can be pretty slow in certain scenes. Hardcore action fans would probably be disappointed by this. But let's face it: Beverly Hills Cop is not an all-out mindless action movie. It is actually a clever comedy with elements of action present within.To conclude, Beverly Hills Cop is arguably Eddie Murphy's best film since he fits the Axel Foley character perfectly. There are many funny scenes featuring Eddie Murphy that will have people laughing (even the action scenes can be cleverly funny)! P.S: Look out for cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot, and Damon Wayans!",Beverly Hills Cop
148,ultimatenexus,A Great '80's Action Comedy,6,28 August 2014,"I hadn't seen Eddie Murphy in anything worth watching for a long time, and I kind of missed the guy from movies I watched during my childhood days, so I decided to poke around his filmography to see what I missed. That's when I found the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy.Eddie plays fast-talking Detective Axel Foley who meets up with an old buddy of his who apparently was let out of prison five months earlier. Their reunion is cut short when they're ambushed by a pair of hit men and Axel's buddy is killed as a result, luring Axel to Beverly Hills to investigate his friend's murder (against his Chief's orders, of course). I'm not going to reveal much more than that, other than the fact that he finds himself in over his head stumbling upon a drug smuggling operation.One thing I'd noticed about this movie is that it's the first one where Ronny Cox plays a character (Andrew Bogomil) I didn't want to push out a window myself (having only ever seen him in Verhoeven's Robocop and Total Recall). Also along for the ride are Judge Reinhold (Billy Rosewood) and John Ashton (John Taggert), both of whom are ACTUAL Beverly Hills cops that befriend and help Axel. Even Bogomil turns out to be one of the coolest police lieutenant in all of film. These four leads are all very likable and fun to watch.The villain, Victor Maitland, is convincingly nasty and somewhat refined at the same time. What I like about the villains of this franchise so far is that all of the villains manage to be... well... villainous without acting like total psychopathic, trigger-happy nutcases.It's a fun movie that takes a lot of the fun parts of Bad Boys and Lethal Weapon without being gratuitously violent and dark. Eddie Murphy's speedy monologues are always funny and the situations he gets himself into should have had his badge taken away from him in the first five minutes of the movie, but that's all part of the fun of following him around while he does his best to prove his case to everyone else and bring justice to his friend's killer.Just watch for a fun ride and keep on the lookout for bananas in your tailpipe.",Beverly Hills Cop
149,tupungato,More than a funny police film,9,10 December 2008,"Considering how often I laughed during this movie, whether Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) mocked members of the Beverly Hills Police Force or boyish Beverly Hills Police officer Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) frustrated his much more seasoned partner, John Taggert (John Ashton), I tend to think of this film as a comedy. Anybody planning to rent it, however, may find himself feeling a little shocked on occasion if he has expected to recline on his sofa and take in an amusing story about a cocky, streetwise cop who upstages several naive ones.Beverly Hills Cop also includes a few plainly violent scenes, each one sobering because its realism. A viewer sensitive to gunfire or fisticuffs might find these moments upsetting, notwithstanding Axel Foley's gestures or comments to make light of their intensity. For those having an easier time assimilating the violence, though, Beverly Hills Cop not only entertains, with mostly clever and some crude dialog, it also informs. Featuring a plot that involves cocaine and coffee grounds, customs and contraband, responsible and reproachful police protocol, Beverly Hills Cop gives its audience a valuable introductory course in law enforcement and criminology.Beverly Hills Cop has remained popular, I believe, because of the performances -- all of them -- from those of the thugs with the small parts to the leads. To me, two actors stand out, nevertheless: Ronnie Cox, the ethical Beverly Hills Police Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil, who handles his force with the controlled anger of a school principal, and Gilbert Hill, the Detroit Police Inspector Todd, not at all formal but equally intolerant of Axel Foley's nonconforming ways.",Beverly Hills Cop

This film is funny funny funny, not just Eddie and Judge, but Bronson Pinchot in a cameo you will never forget.

152,Baghdaddy,"Nice, Quiet Place Out of Town...Very Conservative!",10,16 January 2014,"One of the best action comedies I have ever watched!The film is about a Detroit police officer Axel Foley, whom is visited by an old friend, Mikey Tandino, from when they were juveniles. The happy reunion, however, is short lived when hit men come and whack Foley's friend, which leads to Foley going to Beverly Hills, where his friend last worked.Along the way, he reunites with Jenny Summers, a girl who used to know both Foley and Tandino, but whilst investigating gets thrown out of a window and arrested. This is where he meets Detective Rosewood, Sergeant Taggart and Lieutenant Bogomil. Following a rocky start, they begin to form a partnership that allows Foley to finally find out why Tandino was killed!The film is brilliantly filmed, with an abundance of punchlines and comedy to go with blistering action sequences. Has a very feel-good sense to it, and one of my favourite movie scenes of all time when Foley tricks Rosewood and Taggart into following him into a striptease joint by saying something along the lines of he knows a ""nice, quiet place out of town...very conservative""!Need some action?

Ever-accompanied by Harold Faltermeyer's irritatingly-catchy ""Axel F"" backing track, Foley ruffles more than a few feathers as he winds up waist-deep in a secret world of mobsters, drug-smuggling and extremely plush-looking finger buffets.Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are the local detectives who end up working alongside Foley, via a banana in the tailpipe. Steven Berkoff is the curiously-accented villain-by-numbers Victor Maitland, whilst Jonathan Banks is Maitland's token lazy-eyed henchman.Murphy keeps us reminded that he's indeed no stranger to the letter 'F', though the swearies are generally infrequent enough not to interfere with the good comedic quality of the script.And, if you're up for some unintentional humour, look out for the big-boned Daley Thompson look-a-like appearing on screen for a split-second as Murphy's double in the scene where Foley throws Maitland's henchman over a restaurant table. Had me in stitches first time I had that pointed out to me.It's got an 80s-tastic soundtrack, complete with Glenn Frey, the Pointer Sisters, Patti LaBelle and the mighty Mr Faltermeyer, what else do you need?",Beverly Hills Cop

The opening scene ""I'm a businessman, talk to me"" establishes the mood as we listen in on Eddie Murphy doing his trademank jive talk. A few minutes later, Inspector Todd breaks the all-time record for cursing in a hilarious scene with Eddie and Paul Reiser listening on. The film is well cast all the way down to the smallest roles and Eddie is in top form, but not enough credit has been given to the excellent screenplay. A lot of people forget that the script was nominated for an Oscar. They think Eddie improvised all his lines and that all they did was insert swear words. What they actually did was take a classic fish out of water premise (Eddie in Beverly Hills!) and spin a wonderful variaion on it with rich, lovable characters and creative use of language. The salty language in this movie is used in a way that stings more than actual violence does. Could Inspector Todd be any more menacing if he actually had a weapon in his hands? No. His mouth is the weapon. Every character in this movie, all the way down to the Bronson Pinchot character, has a unigue way with words. It's the screenplay, not just the energtic acting, that will alow this movie to stand the test of time.

And at the time I found myself alternately glued to my chair because of the suspense, and falling off my chair because of the outrageous humor. I was extremely well entertained.

At the time of dinosaurs (well, you understood: ""VCRs"") I had a pirated video recording, which, however, was the third part of ""The Beverly Hills Cop"" and in the appendage of the cartoons of Metro Golden Mayer. You remember such SCEN'L cassettes.""A Cop from B.H."" is from Paramount. And I will give time and a place to sources. After all, the third part, of course, the third part, but it was interesting: how it all began. Chance presented himself 20 years after seeing Trikvela.So. First of all, it was interesting to me how the characters known in the last part of the trilogy will converge in one territory. And I saw Serge and Billy Rosewood here. Serge in real life turned out to be Bronson Pinsho. And I have nowhere else except for two parts (the 3rd and 1st, in my case, respectively, in such a sequence) ""Beverly Hills Cop"" did not see. Judge Reinhold as Rosewood. Here is a boy at all. And also in the third part the name of Taggart was sounded. There, Flint replaced him. A good caste for the extreme part. But talking about the first. Taggart is played by john ashton . Soon I will switch to the flow of the film. In the meantime, finally, I'll say the Detroit police boss Douglas Todd performed by Gilbert R. Hill . The remaining roles can be considered minor.In a separate text can be identified inimitable Eddie Murphy . And here he got the role of a policeman with humor. Unusual ingenuity and charisma. Axel Fowley - his hero - on the move comes up with and composes such pearls to achieve the goal, that you give a miracle. Even curls take. And how he laughs! ..The above actors and their ""brainchild"" complement the main coloring of the picture. Everyone has their own genuine and unique character and zest.The plot can be credited to a number of easy and unconstrained. Then just send such movies. The murder of a friend, search, revenge. But not so trite. Everything is within the framework of the law according to their plot, and within the framework of a proper script with us.I noticed that in ""Beverly Hills Cop"" my handwriting was defined. Its rod. This will find its place in the next two parts of the film.Humor is also present. And this is despite the fact that the film itself looks in the same breath, there is also a ""crust"" on level ground. When the final outcome went, Billy pulled Taggart up to get over the fence. I burst out laughing. And this scene is quite long and quite funny.In general, I do not regret that I got acquainted with this film. But the third part is still better for me.

This is a flick that showcases what Eddie Murphy has always done best; Eddie Murphy can make EVERYONE laugh.Though his humor may not be G-Rated, once you are old enough to watch this, or his legendary stand-up specials, Eddie's humor is always a welcome addition to an audience of two, or less people. This movie has one thing that other films from this time do not, when showcasing the talents of a famous comedian.

It starts with Axel Foley who is played by Eddie Murphy going to Beverly Hills because his friend was murdered. While there he tries to solve what happened to his friend and learn about Beverly Hills. It may seem serious but it's very funny. Judge Reinhold plays Billy Rosewood who is the goofy serious guy who is one of the lead characters. There's also Taggard who is the serious guy who never laughs or smiles.

187,irenesurgeon,"Still a modern concept for policemen,crime investigations and other sectors",8,1 September 2007,"Although the general outline of the play is reflecting the beloved 80s, it is well -presented that when management is wrong the mission fails, so people without official permission may need to take things in their hands.. . especially in serious matters... Nowadays, in Greece, management is based on people who are chosen by the political party on Government. This has made the whole country, come to a general mess in any sector, because of bad management and because of people who do not feel what should be done in each crisis that appears. This play shows very well, that many times we have to disobey the official rules in order to do what must be done. Unfortunately, this in Greece has to be done every day. So, the wonderful protagonist, the cop of Beverly Hills is a close friend since ""lives inside us"". Very good story, wonderful music and a wonderful Eddie.",Beverly Hills Cop

Murphy is an abosolute comedic genious!!! Most of the great comedic scenes are all improvised by Murphy himself. All of the actors were great!!!!!! The DVD is cool with a couple of special features with commentery from the cast and Jerry Bruckheimer. This was a HUGE BOX OFFICE SUCCESS!!! It was second to Ghostbusters as the top grossing movies of 1984. This is followed by 2 sequel Beverly Hills Cop 2, and 3. There are rumors of Beverly Hills Cop 4. But with a more family oriented Murphy, it is very had to say if he would do another Beverly Hills Cop movie. I did hear he is interested in revising the role one more time. Bruckheimer is also interested as well. I hope it works out.........Majid",Beverly Hills Cop

197,Briangonzales-523-566242,Review for Beverly Hills Cop,9,9 November 2012,"I would really suggest the movie ""Beverly Hills Cop"" to a lot of the Eddie Murphy lovers. This movie was very spectacular in its own way. It was funny, action-packed, and spooky at the same time. Here is my view of the movie overall. This movie was very funny. I don't suggest it to young children because it might be too inappropriate for the young ones. There is a lot of cussing and there is some stripper scenes. But, the parents should always look at the rating before letting there child see it. Eddie Murphy has always been in movies with more cuss words than usual. The movie was also very action-packed. Whenever Eddie Murphy pulled out his gun, you were sure to lean forward in your seat. Although none of the revolver guns that the police carried was loaded, they still made it seem like there was. I love this movie and I believe a lot of other people will too if they see my view of it. Although this movie was only 1 hour and 45 minutes long, it still covered everything it should have covered. This movie is a true masterpiece to my family and I. It was phenomenal and an intriguing movie. There isn't many things this movie did wrong. This movie was spooky and frightening in its own way. It had some scenes where I wanted to cover my face with the blankets because the final scene between Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) and Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) was like a face-off. It was very fun to watch but frightening at the same time. The movie was based on Axel Foley's friend from California coming to visit him in Detroit. Later that day, he was killed by a man named Zach. Axel follows Zach to Beverly Hills in California. Axel was looking to find who was behind his friends death, and in a way, he wants to avenge his friends death. His police department lieutenant doesn't want him involved in this case. But, he goes anyway, Axel thinks that his friend Lisa's boss Victor was behind it. Axel begins to follow Victor and his workers around. At the same time, lieutenant Bogomil from the Beverly Hills department has assigned two cops to look after Foley to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. In a way he manipulates the two cops to help him solve his case. Foley does solve the case; although, I am not going to tell you the person who was behind it.Overall, this movie was very exciting. I really recommend it to others. It is surely a must see when your old enough, of course. I love Eddie Murphy and I am an Eddie Murphy lover.",Beverly Hills Cop
198,dgert86,This film is about a touch street wise Detroit detective named Axel Foley (Spoiler),10,4 August 2013,"This film is about a tough street wise Detroit detective named Axel Foley played by Eddie Murphy, who is out to avenge the death of his childhood friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo). Mikey had recently returned from Los Angeles and had been tracked down and killed by his former employer for theft of smuggled bonds.After the murder Axel heads to Los Angeles to seek more information about Mikey's past and who could have ordered the killing. The film's theme revolved around Axel taking whatever steps necessary to solve the crime, whether those methods were legal or illegal. He begins his search for answers by first visiting another childhood friend Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) and she informs him that her employer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) hired Mikey as a favor to her.Thus begins Axel's fact finding about what type of business man Victor really is. During his search for answers he is in constant conflict with the Beverly Hills Police Department over his choice of tactics in the search for the truth about Victor. He is constantly reprimanded by Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) and tailed by Detectives John Taggart and Billy Rosewood (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold).Once Axel uncovers the truth about Victor he convinces Detective Rosewood to take him to Victor's warehouse where he believes a drug shipment is located. He entered with his friend Jenny and while she is kidnapped, Axel with Billy's help is able to escape and team up with Taggart and Rosewood to rescue Jenny and avenge his friend's death by killing Victor Maitland.The film used different aspects to portray Axel in many different scenes. To establish Axel as a tough street wise cop from Detroit the mood was gray and a montage was used in the beginning of the film to show a depressed city and a struggling population. Once Axel arrived in Beverly Hills a sunny, bright montage was presented displaying economic well-being and an environment that Axel would have to adjust to in solving the crime.The use of close ups throughout the film were very effective in both a comedic sense and to display character emotions. They were used extensively by the filmmaker to establish points at the end of different scenes.Axel's do whatever it takes mentality was extremely effective throughout the film. The film flowed well and Axel's common sense crime solving, much like Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) was effective and kept viewers on the edge of their seat, always wondering what was next. It was refreshing to see Axel solve the crime from the comedic and common sense view rather than Dirty harry just bullying or eliminating everything he needed to in order to solve the crime.",Beverly Hills Cop
199,uberwinner611,You want a laugh?,10,25 June 2005,"As being a fan of comedy, I love laughing and having a good time with family and friends watching them. Comedy is the best movie genre because it provides so much entertainment! Beverly Hills Cop 1,2, and 3 are great examples of what comedy should be. Whacky mishaps, funny lines, a little bit of swearing, and a great plot make this movie one of the best I've ever watched. I couldn't stop laughing; that's how funny this movie is! I suggest that you don't even waste the money renting this movie because if you like comedies, more than likely you're gonna watch it again and laugh just as hard! If anyone gave this movie a 1, they don't need to even watch comedy because most likely they hate it in general.",Beverly Hills Cop
200,tylerbodhaine,Justice Served,5,4 December 2015,"Beverly Hills Cop is a film about a rebellious Detroit police officer who plays by his own rules. He is a man who believes in justice and truth, he isn't afraid to get the job done even if it means getting a little dirty along the way. Axel Foley isn't your typical play by the rules type of police officer. Axel Foley is no basic police officer. The film Beverly Hills Cop begins with Axel Foley in the back of a semi truck along with two tough gang members in Detroit, Michigan. He is negotiating on a price for the untraceable drugs which he had ""supposedly"" packed into cigarettes. They are interrupted when a police unit rushes in with there sirens blaring; the police are oblivious to Axel's undercover operation. All of a sudden shots are fired, one man falls to the ground and the other jumps into the drivers seat and takes off, with Axel still in the trucks trailer. A wild police chase erupts with collisions and explosions throughout the city of Detroit and when the truck finally runs out of steam the police realize it is Axel working on an unauthorized case. This is not Axels first time to work undercover without authorization; and as a matter of fact the city of Detroit and the police chief are not happy with Axel's stunts. The city seems as if it was steamrolled and shredded to pieces. Axel is given a final warning from his police chief and threatens to take his job away if he pulls another stunt like that. Shortly after being sent home from work due to his crazed actions Axel witnesses the death of an old friend named Mikey and is driven to crack a case across the country in Beverly Hills. Here is where the movie truly begins to take off, Axels chief told him to stay away from the case, but Axel being the rebel police officer he is knows he can not stay away from the murder case of his best friend. He decides to take a ""vacation"" to Beverly Hills where Mikey had worked for a man named Victor Maidland. After some investigation on Victor Axel is arrested and taken down town and becomes very familiar with a few of the Beverly Hills police officers. Axel is picked up from the police department by an old friend named Jenny. She works for Victor and was also a good friend of Mikey's. This works out perfectly for Axel because she is able to get him access to buildings in Victors business and give him inside intel that eventually solves the case. The remainder of the movie is all about Axel investigating Victors company searching for clues and evidence to solve the murder case of his friend. He eventually becomes close with police officers who were originally sent to follow him and get him under tight watch. These officers eventually help Axel solve the case and are with him throughout the end of the film. Throughout the film Axel does many things that shouldn't be acceptable for a police officer to do. He goes under cover when he is not authorized to do so, he carries a gun outside of his jurisdiction, he goes to strip clubs and does many other asinine things that a cop is not expected to do. He bends many of the rules and even the laws that police officers are expected to abide by. Even though Axel makes many risky decisions he solves the case and does a really good job. He takes many bad people off the street and cleans up the city of Beverly Hills. If Axel would have done anything differently in the film, the outcome would have been much different. If Axel would have played by the rules and listened to his police chief, he would never have solved the case of his good friend. If he wouldn't have taken police officers that were on duty to a strip club, he never would have gotten a lead that would lead them straight to the source of the murder. Breaking the rules in Axels case was well worth it. Although he had to face a lot of opposition from his senior officers and take a lot of heat from his colleagues. A major case was solved because he wasn't afraid to finish a job regardless of the consequences. Axels bending and breaking the rules type of behavior was a necessary procedure in order for him to be a successful police officer. In the case of Axel Foley and Beverly Hills Cop risking your job, life, and reputation are worth doing something that you believe in. Overall the movie is pretty average, this is your typical police action movie with a bit of Eddie Murphy's comedic twist. So if you have the time go ahead and check out the film ""Beverly Hills Cop""",Beverly Hills Cop
